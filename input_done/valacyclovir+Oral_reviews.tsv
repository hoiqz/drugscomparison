Cold Sore	Kjane, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	9/12/2012 8:49:34 AM	I have been getting cold sores on my top lips since I can remember.  I get them about 1-2 times a year.  The only thing that I notice when I take this medication is that the sore doesn't get as large.  I still get the blisters and redness though, and I do take it right away when my lip starts tingling, before it even looks like a cold sore is forming. 
Shingles	Bob Builder, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	8/21/2012 9:55:04 PM	Aloe vera (ensure no additives) for external use proved very helpful in conjunction with this prescription along with licorice (oral-aids antiviral).Drink plenty of water as does affect liver, etc...
Other	TMG24Fan, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	8/9/2012 12:07:17 PM	Valacyclovir HCL 1 Gram Tablet has been prescribed to me in place of Acyclovir 400 mg. Valacyclovir has had less side effects, such as dizziness, for me. Vala. has been easier to take(even though the pill is quite large)twice a day instead of five times a day with the Acyclovir.The cost of the Valacyclovir is very high,to high for the average person to afford. It has helped my eyes from getting worse,thank God I can still see. Thanks Vala. makers too! I have been through two kinds of eye antibiotics and two kinds of eye ointments(antivirals). That's not counting the trials at the beginning of my medical problem. No steroids for me again(hopefully),they made my condition worse,I thought I might loose my vision.I would love to see more research on the eye problems Valacyclovir is treating.It's been 1 year and 6 months for me and my Cornea Specialist is still &quot;baffled&quot; at what's going on with my eyes. He says it's common, but usually in one eye. I have it in both, one eye will be okay, next visit it's the other eye. I went from 20/20 vision to bifocals. I hope more can be done to help others in the future. I would recommend that people drink plenty of water as they are instructed. That's another good reason to drink water. My doctor has also said he hasn't had a case last as long as mine. I have read the exact doses of Vala. has not been researched enough to know how much really needs to be taken to get the full effect of the drug. Thanks for reading about my experience, I hope it helps. I also don't understand why my M.D. wouldn't want to help me get a Shingle vaccination approved by my insurance company when it's all kind of related and it may help me(and others) in the future. No I'm not 50 yrs. old yet, but everyone is different. And think of the money it would save in the long run, at $759.99 for thirty days. Wow! I'm glad it's the only prescription I have to buy, imagine if you had 2-3 prescriptions to buy. Thanks Webmd.
Shingles	Rosie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	7/25/2012 10:15:51 AM	This is my 4th bout of shingles, but by far the worst. This is the first time on this medication. Although I have only a small area of rash, the deep pain and burning in my upper left side, back of shoulder, chest &amp; arm, is intense. I've taken 1 GM of valacycovir for 6 days so far, 4 to go. I guess it kept the rash from getting more extensive. I've had bouts of pain in the past without rash. The pain is just beginning to decrease today, but it's still there. Unfortunately, the itching in and all around the rash in very intense and not subsiding yet. I am using a topical astringent and calamine lotion with very little relief. I had the vaccine last year but unfortunately, it didn't work to prevent shingles outbreaks for me. What a strange condition!
Recurrent Genital Herpes	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	5/15/2012 1:10:58 AM	I have found that this particular manufacturer of the generic form of Valtrex is not as effective as the name brand. I have had genital herpes for several years.  In the past I always used Valtrex daily which was very effective. I never had herpes outbreaks while taking Valtrex daily. I switched to the generic form for about 6 months and had a outbreak during that time. I have now gone back to the brand name Valtrex because it is more effective for me.
Genital Herpes	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	4/13/2012 1:02:31 PM	My initial outbreak was the most painful. Almost every symptom was going on all at once. Read the WebMD info on these symptoms of an initial outbreak. After that it began happening right after my menstrual period had ended. This was for about 3 months. My periods were irregular so this caused what I would like to call 'phantom' outbreaks. Where you had the feeling like you were going to get one but never did. Now I am on a contraceptive regulating my periods while also taking Valacyclovir both once a day. My outbreaks now are triggered by stress only. Reduce the stress in your life. You don't need it anyways infected or not. 
Cold Sore	MARIANN, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/5/2012 8:17:32 AM	I'M PRON TO GETTING COLD SORES BY A COLD OR STRESS ON EITHER MY MOUTH OR IN MY NOSE  AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME ANY MEDICATION HAS STOPPED IT IN ITS TRACK. NOW AFTER THE COLDS GONE IN 7-10 DAYS, I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE UGLY SORE FOR WEEKS. AFTER 30YRS I DON'T HAVE TO SUFFER ANY MORE AND HAVE PEOPLE LOOK AT ME STRANGELY.   THANKS  DOC
Shingles	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	65-74	2/21/2012 7:59:16 PM	I took medication for three days and nothing improved .  In fact, the itching increased along with a tremendous rash from the back of my neck to across my shoulder and down my left arm.  The doctor changed my meds to  acyclovir and within two hours itching subsided.
Cold Sore	Sandybchgrl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/20/2012 8:37:26 AM	I get cold sores very often and for awhile I just let them go away on their own but my doctor suggested I take Valacyclovir when I start feeling the tingle and it worked!! The best way for the medicine to be effective is  taking it before the cold sore gets worse but even if you have a full blown sore the medicine will heal it faster. The most side effects I have gotten are headaches and tiredness but usually goes away by drinking tons of water. 
Shingles	Anne Marie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/16/2012 1:11:35 PM	My shingles started with a headache and a zigging pain in my head, which lasted all day. I realized I must have shingles even though there was no rash.  Next day I went to the doctor.  The nurse said if I didn't have the rash, they can't diagnose shingles.  I told her I looked shingles up on WebMD and was pretty sure I was coming down with it because of the zigging headache.  Met with doctor, he checked my vital signs which appeared ok.  I asked for the anti viral drug, he said ok because the drug is a benige drug, which will not hurt me if I don't have shingles. (I should add I have been going once a year to this doctor's office for 15+ years for my annual physical and am very rarely sick.) I started Valacyclovir that afternoon.  The next morning I had the rash on my left side of my neck and worse zigging headache.  I started alternating Ibuprofen and Tylenol every 4 hours to keep the zigging to a miniumum and I took Valacyclovir every 8 hours never missing a dose and drinking lots of water. (I should add I was the one who decided on the Ibuprofen and Tylenol regimen, also I do not have liver or kidney problems.)  It is the third day since the rash and I am feeling ok but still alternating the Ibuprofen and Tylenol.  I am not sure if the pain management is working or I am getting better because the zigging is not as bad.  I still have the rash but it does not bother me because it does not rub against anything. I am drinking a lot of water because of all the pain relievers I am taking, as I do not want to cause liver or kidney damage. I will start taking less pain reliever when I am able but I will take all my Rx.  I want to make sure I get over this.

Nausea I can deal with but the dizziness is driving me crazy. Going to keep drinking water or gatorade to see if extra fluids help.

And even taking it every day doesn't stop pain or itchiness. Maybe my body is used to it, @ first it worked fine. Also, you have mood swings and you may feel dizzy or sick. Nothing better than to have this as a poster for abstinence! Even if it was from rape...

Cold Sore	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	7/13/2011 11:31:30 PM	I'm not sure how well these drugs work. I thought they were supposed to stop the virus from replicating, but it only seems to slow it down. I guess once the process has started, it will run it's course. The medicine only seems to affect the severity of the outbreak. I have cold sores regularly as of lately, and once I switched from acyclovir to valacyclovir, I seemed to get a little break before getting another sore. I am on 500mg once a day. I take 1000mg twice daily during an outbreak.
Cold Sore	nobody's fool, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	35-44	7/5/2011 4:38:15 PM	I experienced severe pain in the lower part of my jaw and chin area and the sores were only on my lower lip. I've had cold sores off and on for several years but, I've never used this drug before and it appears to be working but, it doesn't come without the painful side effects?!
Genital Herpes	AMZ78, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/28/2011 1:10:51 PM	I have been taking this drug going on two weeks after my first outbreak.Worked fine for me, breakout started disappearing after a couple of days from taking the first pill. My only downside to taking it is the size of that pill. I gag on it almost every time.
Shingles	Tip, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	5/15/2011 10:47:50 PM	I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and was taking methotrexate for over a year when I came down with shingles.Im running a 101 fever, my left eye was totally involved, my head felt like it was going to explode all I wanted to do was curl up in my bed and die. After 3 days I finally got in to see my doc who said I had a staph infection and prescribed 2 expensive antibiotics (which did nothing) and some Vicodin ES. After 9 days I got to see my eye doc who told me I had shingles and prescribed Valacyclovir along with eye drops Prednisolone Acetate. Wow! After only 2 doses of Valacyclovir I felt much better, it took a week for the eye to settle down. Currently taking 400MG of Acyclovir to keep the shingles at bay. BTW my regular doc is now my ex-doc.

Cold Sore	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/1/2011 10:38:47 PM	I took this 2 grams a day for 7 days and am now taking 500mg once a day indefinitely. I have been suffering from a herpes (HSV1) infection of the eye for the last four months. This has taken away the sores, burning and stinging. I have experienced no negative side effects. I am not excited about long term use, but I also do not want to lose my sight, which my doctor tells me could happen. I drink lots of water with it.

Shingles	tsmith, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	2/11/2011 1:41:08 PM	My shingles is a bit different than most. Mine was brough on by surgery on my back. The pain was as soon as the day after surgery. Now I had the horrible pain for 5 months before any outbreak of the rash and only 6 spots total, on my low back. The Docs didn't know I had shingles for that long. So I didn't get the benifit of taking the medication soon after the onset. Valacyclovir has helped with some of the deep muscle pain and the extreem electric pain. But when I stopped the med, because of the directions, the pain comes back. When I get back on the med the pain is lowered again. Now I am not sure how I can work staying on this medication just to keep the pain down. My spots are drying up, and some that have not broken the skin surface yet are going away too. All in all it has helped make me human again.

It makes me so dizzy I have to lay down then I have a headache and stomach pains and can't even stand thinking about food. It wouldn't be bad but I go through it every time I take my next dose (1000mg 3x daily). Hopefully it gets better, but if it reoccurs I'm asking for different drugs.

Prevent Recurrent Herpes Simplex Infection	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	5/6/2010 8:39:27 PM	I am a college student and weigh about 100 lbs. I have been on this medication for about two weeks, and it works very well with preventing outbreaks and reducing redness of the outbreak area. However, after I take the pill, I experience a great amount nausea and anxiety. Sometimes I have trouble sleeping because of it. I will continue to take the medication though because of how effective it is. If these side effects continue to affect my daily life, I will speak with my doctor. I would rather experience the side effects than have another outbreak.

Shingles	Happy Face No Rash, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	65-74	7/18/2009 10:07:01 PM	It did not help right away.  I was in a lot of pain, but as I look back this anti-virus nerve med probably was responsible for me not getting the rash, even though my pain levels were 10-6 for a good month and have tapered down to 4-6 recently.  This is due to a medication, Neurontin, given to me to help the pain, but it has to be titrated into my system very slowly.  Now I am wondering how long I will have to take this med to be finished, I HOPE AND PRAY, with the Shingles; yes, I know there is risk of it returning.  Thanks be to God for advanced medications, that were not available for the sufferers of shingles years ago.  I am 72.
