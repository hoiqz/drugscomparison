I used this drug instead of the other bone drugs because jaw necrosis was not listed as a side effect. What is going on?
Other	DonnaAZ, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	2/12/2010 8:41:51 PM	Precribed for bone loss prior to menopause. It will grow back!  After 24 months and 1200mg of calcium daily, 50% of bone loss grew back.Another generic brand, calcitonin spray; the sprayer jams after only 2 weeks of usage.

Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	65-74 Female  (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	65-74	9/14/2009 3:31:13 PM	I have taken Fortical for nearly two years.  After the lst year of treatment, I had a bone density test which showed more deterioration in spine and very minor change in other areas.  I was switched to a generic (thanks, drug insurance plan) earlier this year--Calcitonin-Salmon.  Don't know what effect this change to the generic will have.  I am not due for another bone density test until next year.  My doctor suggested Reclast, but I have read so many viewers' comments that indicate very severe reactions and pain after getting Reclast that I am reluctant to try it--also the cost is prohibitive.
Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	65-74	2/14/2009 5:46:16 PM	The combination of doing weight bearing exercises religiously 2-3 times a week, taking at least 1400 mg of calcium that my body absorbed (your body may not absorb all calcium products), and using Fortical reversed bone my loss from osteopenia to normal, as measured by bonescans.  Fortical and calcium were not enough.
