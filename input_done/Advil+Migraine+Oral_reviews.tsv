Painful Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	12/31/2010 7:18:34 PM	I swear by this. It works fantasic for cramps and never once had a side effect from it. I have taken some strong meds to help but this seems the best to work fast and get rid of those nasty cramps!

I personally love it.  I rarely get migraines but when I do, they are severe enough to give me blind spots.  Within about 20-30 minutes of taking 2 pills, the blind spots disappear and the migraine is gone.  
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	3/8/2010 9:46:04 AM	Took this as a suggestion from a family member for my migraines, the next day I had blisters and sores all over my body, most of the sores lasted for weeks after stopping the medication.  I would never take this again nor would I suggest it to anyone.
Migraine Headache	turtle, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/18/2009 7:14:58 PM	I have had migraines for over 25 yrs., so I really had my doubts about an over-the-counter medicine. I was surprised when I took 4 Advil Migraine over a 24 hr. period, and they worked! They took care of the nausea and the pain! I was looking for something that didn't cost as much as my regular migraine medicine and I found it! Thank you Advil!    
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	5/6/2009 11:45:18 AM	I am an avid user of Advil Migraine. Sometimes I use it up to 3-4 times a week, other times not at all. Everytime I get a migraine this seems to work for me. I've tried regular aspirins and they work the first couple times and then nothing. This has always worked. I take one and lay down for 30 mins or so and wake up feeling much better. I only take one too, I don't take the recommended dose and it's great!
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	5	1	Female	25-34	4/14/2009 2:40:44 AM	I took 2 of these Advil Migraine Liquids about 30 minutes ago, I nearly went to 24 hour emergency care before realising that I'm experiencing most of the SEVERE side effects, these pills are terrible, don't buy them, and throw them away if they're in you're cabinet!
Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	2	5	Female	35-44	3/17/2008 9:06:11 AM	Years of painful menstrual cramping and prescription drugs to treat and one day I accidentally pick up this form of ibuprofen (free acid form-Advil migraine).  It works unbelievably well on menstrual cramping.  Not sure why Wyeth recommends not exceeding 2 pills/day for this form.  Stomach upset is really bad, even with milk.  It is difficult to take but controls pain within 10 minutes...not kidding!  It controls severe pain so give it a try.
