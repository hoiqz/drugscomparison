Prior to taking it my only symptom was an increase in discharge. The medicine has caused iching and burning and after 5 days of taking it I'm worse then when I started. I had severe cramping (think BAD period cramps) for 2 days and was nauseated for 1. I delt with the side effects because I wanted the infection to clear up... however that did not happen!

Also important to note that I had a severe rection to alcohol use with this drug.  Do not have alcoholic drink, use mouthwash, or anything containing alcohol on skin. Swelling occured in tongue, lips, and oral glands.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	4/26/2010 10:21:50 PM	I feel better after the 5th doses and I two doses per day due to severe infection.  After the 5th dose, I feel tired but the itchy seems to be cure.  I wash myself two to three times a day to avoid too much moisture and hope that this can prevent yeast infection.  I am on my 6th dose and believe this medicine cure my infection.

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	classywoman, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	8/9/2009 2:49:25 AM	This medication is not effective. I am still experiencing abdominal pains and my vagina seems as if its dilating. I have a constant discharge and odor when moving around for long hours.  I really wish there was something else out there, because this medication is not doing it for me. ugh!

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	5/13/2009 8:27:00 AM	I noticed a big difference after one application but have used it for the full five days as prescribed.  I'm confident that this has treated the infection.

I'm still using it ,and it seems to be very effective. The only ill effective was that I drank a glass of wine and soon after I got sick. I did not know  til I read it here that you can't drink.

It was prescribed for 5 days but I kept using it for 4 more days. It seemed to work. But after just 3 days of non-use, the infection seemed to be back. I used it again for a couple of days. But infection was still there. Irritation in the pubic area and discharge. I would not recommend this drug for a vaginal infection.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Irritated, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	11/26/2008 11:48:48 AM	I have been on and off this medication for almost a year.  The infection does clear up but it comes back again and again. This is very irritating.  It is only effective for a couple of weeks (if that) then the infection is back again. I am tired of the watery discharge and the odor.  There has to be something out there that is effective in clearing this infection up for good.

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	5/5/2008 7:31:57 AM	 This stuff did not work for me at all. I used it for 5 days as the directions said... it didn't seem to do anything, then my symptoms came back very quickly. My doctor prescribed it again and after 2 days my vagina was so dry and in so much pain that I couldn't even use it any more. It hurt so badly trying to get the medicine up there that I just gave up.
