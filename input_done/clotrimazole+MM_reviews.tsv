I was on IV with a steriod medication. My doctor has never seen anything what I have. spending New Years Eve in my hospital bed watching the ball to drop in NY.

Thrush	dogman, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	4/4/2011 11:21:17 AM	this medication gives me a metallic taste,nausea,an insane craving for salt. these symptoms dont quit as i have to take 1 every 3 hours &amp; the tablet takes 4 hours to dissolve. could be the worst meds i ever took in my life. plus i still have the symptoms i started with.
Thrush	Judy T-C, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	12/29/2010 4:01:02 AM	I was prescribed this drug after receiving antibiotics after minor surgery. I found it hard to remember the tablets 5 times a day, they don't disolve well and after a 2 week use the thrush came right back. I am very unsatisfied with this product.

Much Much easier
