Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	RDash, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	7/24/2012 6:59:41 PM	I have used this gel twice. The first time it work great and like everyone else I experienced the white cottage cheese discharge, which is normal when using this product. The second time using the gel did not help at all. I experienced irritation throughout and after the treatment. I had no noticeable side effects while using this product. I am starting treatment with a different product tonight, hopefully it will work great. Some of the previous reviews discussed, how they thought they were getting or got a yeast infection while on this product. According to my gynecologist, yeast infections often develop when vaginosis caused by bacteria is present, so a prescription for a yeast infection is something you might want to discuss with your doctor as well.

On the 3rd day I noticed a heavy white cottage cheese discharge.  No itching, no burning, no smell.  No other side effects either.   But just like any other antibiotic, I think it is causing me to have a yeast infection.

But about a half hour after applying severe burning and cramping began the burning faded after about 6 hours the extreme cramping is still happening 13 hours later. The side effects are much worse than the actual infection.

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	MM6381, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	4/20/2011 11:29:45 AM	I had to take the vaginal cream because I was first prescribed the oral version of this medicine and it made me extremely sick.  Within 1/2 hour of taking it I had terrible heartburn and indigestion, which has yet to go away even after I stopped taking the oral pills.  The vaginal cream is easy to use with the inserts they provide and convenient since you're supposed to take it right before bedtime.  But I too noticed a white discharge after I started using the cream.  It seems like the cream is working but overall I haven't liked how I felt since I started taking this medicine. I continue to have heartburn/indigestion, an upset stomach and extreme tiredness.If my doctor tried to prescribe this again I would ask for another kind of medication.

By that evening I noticed the discharge was becoming more of a period and I seemed to bleed everytime I urinated. Every time I wiped there was a brownish powdery discharge. I'm a little afraid to continue my second night of treatment.

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	10/30/2010 12:09:27 AM	Last night was my first night using the jel. It made me feel alittle dizzy. Tonight I used it again and the dizzyness got worse and now I feel I'm having alittle trouble breathing and lots of cramping. I feel worse tonight compared to last night so I'm wondering if it'll be even worse tomorrow night. I'm afraid to try again because of that. Im going to call the dr in the morning to make sure I'm ok before taking another dose tomorrow. Has anyone else had these problems?

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	notmia, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	8/18/2010 2:48:17 PM	It cured aches and pains that I got with a yeast infection, but produced more yeast infection making more of the &quot;cottage chees&quot; effect.  I stopped using it to treat the yeast infection instead.  Did not finish using all the medication, because of the yeast infection coming back.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	8/16/2010 4:26:32 AM	My experience has been quite good until yesterday when the white discharge began. It didn't start until 4 or 5 days after my last dose. I got my period right in the middle of taking this and flowed heavy for 3 days then stopped suddenly. Overall I would say it's effective as long as this discharge stops soon.

It gave me massive abdominal cramping and pain, a rash, my throat started to swell so that I had to take lots of Benadryl immediately, and the metallic taste lingered in my mouth for days afterward.  
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	irishgirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	5/23/2010 7:37:07 PM	Was given this medication after a routine pap. Never had  problem like this before was very skeptical about putting a gel inside me... I stopped using after 2 nites because of lower stomach cramping and chunky white discharge.. i was very relieved to see other women described the same discharge.  I dont think i would take this again.

So I had my doctor prescribe again. So I did it for five days. done, I was cured. Then one monthe later, here I am again same thing. In my 38 a years, this is the first time I had a little trouble down there with vaginosis, so I don't think my body is just prone to it. I just don't think this is able to control it for me.

Other	Angie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	45-54	2/26/2010 5:58:29 PM	I had an abnormal pap and was given this medication to use before getting a followup pap.  It isn't fun and I was warned by the pharmacist not to drink any alcohol while using (she said you can get violently sick).  My doc didn't tell me that.  I do get a little nauseous right after I insert it.  I am wondering if that is my imagination or if anyone else has noticed that?

But my doctor insisted it is was far better than the pill version. So far I have just taken my last dose. I take 1 little tube full every night for 5 nights. On day 2 I noticed this clumpy white cottage cheese like discharge. Really worried me till I got online and did research and found on here many women have the same discharge. I guess its the medicine working. Not that I even knew I had a problem. Went in for a routine pap smear and she said my vaginal mucus was thick and that was that. So far my sysmptoms/side effects are as follow:-Clumpy white discharge-Mild stomach cramps for a couple hours after insertion.- Prolonged period.My period was due 3 days ago and I have all the classic symptoms (Ie, Tender breasts, lower back pain, hot flashes) except, no blood yet. I suppose its working. My private area has never smelled so, fresh. Im sure thats gross and weird. But true.

I called my doctor and she said to continue the treatment and not to worry. It was very concerning though...I think this should be in the list of common side effects!
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Anonymous, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	19-24	10/27/2009 4:28:10 PM	I have had to take this twice because the first round didn't fully get rid of the condition. My doctor perscribed it again and I can't say I am thrilled with it although most symptoms are now gone. Both times it has made me spot and even now I am still spotting which has me concerned. Someone else said it made them bleed too so for now (because i can't afford yet another visit and co-pay to the doc's) I guess I will wait and see. I haven't had to take a pill before for this condition but if I ever get it again I would rather just take a pill and get it over with than using this gel for 5 nights.

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	 Female  (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female		9/30/2009 3:51:33 AM	It was okay but was not a fast fix. The 5 night treatment is long. I did experience relief right after the first night but I got white clumpy discharge, like many other women on here, and it is not going away quickly. I would only take this treatment if your Dr. won't give you anything else for it.

But the huge white chunks scared me so looked up the med on a few websites, and i also i just got off the phone w/my doc..as i thought..perfectly normal. its the meds getting rid of whats up there and coming back out. i hope this helps the females that kinda freaked out about the chunks like i did.

I don't know if this is the way the medicine works to clear up the infection, or if I should discontinue use.  Of course, it is a holiday weekend, and I don't really want to call the doctor but I am getting increasingly nervous about using it....

I ended up having to go on Flagyl a week later.  I wished I would have just done that in the first place and skipped the messiness of a gel.

After 3 days I started to notice the white discharge that others have mentioned but I'm not sure if it's normal or a yeast infection b/c 6-10% of users get candidasis from this medication :/

Was told by Dr to use once a day at night but med lit says use twice a day. There is still half a tube left so not sure if I should move on to hormone pills now prescribed. Guess I will call the Dr &amp; pharmacy and see if they have add't info for me.

I followed the directions I was given on the box. Once nightly before bedtime for 5 days. I as well noticed a white discharge, which triggered me to research here. Two others had the same experience, so I guess it is normal. I did not experience any other side effects. I would much rather use this then the nasty Flagyl pills.

I noticed that it when it comes out, when I go to the bathroom, it comes out in a thick white creamy form. I didnt know if that was normal but when I called the pharmacy they couldnt answer my question. While reading another review I notcied someone said the same thing happen to them so it must be normal.

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Patient PhD, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	10/6/2007 7:03:52 PM	In general, this was an easy to use and effective treatment. Although it goes in as a clear gel, I did notice some white cream-like residue when I wiped in the mornings and throughout the day following the bedtime treatment. Surprisingly, I did not experience a lot of moisture and drainage from the gel during the day, but I did wear a mini pad for general protection during the treatment.
