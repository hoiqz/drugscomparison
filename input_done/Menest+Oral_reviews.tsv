Low Estrogen After Operation to Remove Ovaries	Happy Grandma GA, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	3/19/2012 11:13:53 PM	I've taken Cenestin for a decade &amp; my doctor has been reducing the dosage periodically to finally get to the lowest level.  But, when Cenestin was back ordered in December, my new doctor prescribed Menest without me knowing it.  I was sick for the entire 2 months while using it. I finally figured out what caused this as that was the only thing I had changed!  Menest made me extremely dizzy to the point where I never should have driven, sick to my stomach, ears ringing constantly and feeling horrible.  My life was on hold.  I switched to Enjuvia since Menest is in the same category as Premarin which also made me sick long ago. The pharmacist told me that Menest never should have been ordered as a replacement.  The dizziness is gone but the ringing in my ears is still there, driving me crazy! Does anyone know HOW to get this ringing to stop and have others experienced this problem ???  I want to stop estrogen completely. I am 60 and had surgery in 1995 so have been on it too long.  I now have 90 Menest pills that cost me $52 and I can't even use them.

Since taking menest (now in my 8th year) I have not experienced the mood swings, sweats, or crying episodes that seemed to be associated with the loss of natural hormones.

My doc put me on Menest 1.25 mg and I have been on it until June of this year. I never had problems with it. At my age now I decided to try a natural HRT.

Increase sex drive again, tenderness in breast. Has caused higher blood sugar readings, resulting in higher insulin usage. More frequent urination. But when weighing mental to physical control it is worth it.
