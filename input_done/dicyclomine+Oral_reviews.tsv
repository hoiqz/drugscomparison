I was previously diagnosed with IBS but had never had pain like this. After 4 days in the hospital, and multiple tests done, I was placed on this med. It started helping after only a few doses. I am relatively pain free if I take my 4 doses daily.
Irritable Colon	Jules, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	45-54	7/25/2012 1:04:11 PM	This drug helps with my pain and nausea.  Lost alot of weight because my stomach did not feel like having anything inside it. Now I can eat anything. It is hard to remember to take it 30 min. before meals, so as long as I take it 4 times a day it is helping.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	10/26/2011 10:49:25 PM	I've had problems since I was 19 with severe diabilating pain every couple months, I'm now 29.  So severe, I couldn't leave the house let alone stand up, or function like a normal human being.  I have not been diagnosed with any particular disease.  Was prescribed this on a as needed basis, to take 1- 20mg tab every 15 min til the pain subsided. Where the side affects are horrendous, I would not trade the pain.  Side affects being, slurred speech, not comprehending speech or conversations, and constipation that lasts for 3 days. I would take the side affects over the pain any day. This medicine has let me at least not scare my children with the pain in my guts.  Though, I would not reccomend opperating heavy machinery or driving on this medication, you can still certainly still make dinner and tuck your kids into bed without screaming in pain and being taken to the hospital.  So far this is the only medicine that has helped my cause.  Thank you!

I experienced extreme blurred vision, slurred speech, and cloudy thinking. Before I reduced my dose to 10mg, I had trouble even forming a sentence in my head!  There was no way I could take this medication during the day as I wouldn't be able to function normally to work or drive anywhere. I almost felt drunk. However, I continued to use it before dinner because it was very effective!  I discontinued the drug after switching to medications. I guess I was one of the many that experienced the rare side effects! :(

I am still having side effects even though I only take it when I absolutely have to do so. It does help my stomach but it makes me fell...drunk. I also helped my over active bladder (there were days I would need to urinate every hour!) I hate how it makes me feel but can not stand running to the bathroom at times or not being able to use the rest room for days...are there any other drugs that people have found helpful with less side effects??

I often had diarrhea within a couple of hours of eating a meal and sometimes had it 4-6 times per day. I often didnt have time to make it to the toilet! I had gurgling in my bowels while I was having a bowel movement. Furthermore, fresh vegetables passed right through me. My doctor prescribed Bentyl 3 months ago. I took this med 3 times per day when I started. This caused constipation and pain in my lower abdomen. I cut my dose to twice per day and my bowels became relatively normal, but my stool was hard. My doctor added Metamucil to my regimen to regulate my bowels and soften my stool. The fiber in Metamucil has made my stool normal and has not caused diarrhea. Im now taking one Bentyl per day and using Metamucil once per day. My IBS is under control and I have one or two normal bowel movements a day.

Irritable Colon	Me, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/20/2010 9:32:55 AM	This medication has helped a lot with my stomach pain and cramping.  I have also noticed that it has helped restore function to my bowel.  I went from being constipated and having bowel movements every 2 - 3 days to having bowel movements every day, 1 to 2 times a day.  I had increased my fiber intake to try to restore function to my bowel before, but to no avail.  I also drink more than 8 glasses of water a day, and I go to the gym 5-6 days a week.  I take the medication 3 times a day, and I have noticed that if I forget to take my doses (the stomach pain and cramping has been greatly reduced since starting this med), I become slightly constipated (only for a day, day and a half).  Overall, this med has helped me a lot.

It has helped me greatly. I use it as needed. I can even eat salads again without the pain! The only draw back is it doesn't do anything for the diarrhea that I get 2 or 3 times a week. But I am able to take it anytime I have the cramping and not worry about having people over or going out. I just take a pill and it saves me from spending the rest of my life in pain or staying home in fear that I will get sick out somewhere.

When I have a horrible, painful IBS attack (whether from gas, constipation, etc), taking this ALWAYS &quot;numbs&quot; my stomach pains.  Of course, they  need to be intestinal-related stomach pains.  There is nothing else that can help me.  It gets so bad sometimes that it feels like a knife is stabbing me in the lower left or right quadrant of my lower intestine.  Without these pills, I would have to miss work more often and would be in SEVERE pain for much, much longer.I HIGHLY recommend these! They have worked wonders for me! (by the way I use 20 mg tablets as needed..usually every single morning and most of the time in the afternoon, as well)
Other	ArkSteph, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	1/17/2010 1:46:47 PM	I have inflammatory bowel disease. Been taking this for a year now. I recently ran out and have not taken it for a few days. I'm so sick again with stomache cramps that I couldnt even go to work. I had began to think that it wasnt helping me. However being without it tells me that it was! It helps the intestinal/colon related lower abdominal cramps and diarrhea. It does have slight side effects. It makes you feel a bit tired and maybe sort of in a bit of a haze but nothing serious.  IT does NOT cause me to feel nauseated if I take it after eating.It's a vital part of my medical treatment and I wouldn't want to ever be without it again! If your having serious enough problems the minor side effects are nothing compared to the help that it gives.

I swear by it, take it all the time and it really seems to ease my stomach on the really bad days. Plus it has a mild seditive that helps with strees induced stomach problems.

This is the first drug I have tried for my stomach and it has not helped me a bit. I have side effects for about 3 hours after taking this medicine that includes disorientation, thirst, and extreme sleepiness. I have been on it for about 4 months now and only contine taking it bacause of the hope that it will eventually help. My family doctor said there was nothing more she could do and that I would have to go see a stomach specialist for further testing, which I cannot due to no insurance.

I took Hyoscyamine for 11 years with great success, and then the manufacturer discontinued this drug.  My doctor prescribed Dicyclomine in it's place and it is barely working.  I don't get the gas and cramps, but I still get the diarrea 3 or 4 times a week.  I feel dizzy, fatigued, nausea, and foggy.  It causes neuropathy on the left side.  After reading the reviews, I am glad that I am not the only one with these side effects.

At first, it reduced the severity of the camps but they did not totally go away, from time to time, the intensity would come back very strong.  By this time I had been on the medication about 7  8 days.  I went back to Dr. and he gave another medication, however the pharmacy did not have it and had to order it.  I continued to take the Dicyclomine and things got better.  The cramps are gone and I have not noticed any side effects.  I have been taking it for about four weeks now and I feel great. I take one pill three times a day with or without meals and no cramps, bubbling, or bloating issues.  I never even took the other medication.  It really hit the spot.

Lost 8 pounds in two weeks because I could not stand the smell or thoughts of food. Did not decrease the cramping one bit. Was not told not to take with nexium. Took it two days and had a mild seizure. Did not think it was related to med. Stopped it for two weeks and pain was so unbearable started it again and had a seizure. Was never told not to take it with my antacids but from reading here I see you are not supposed to.  I would never take this again if it means crying in pain all day and night. I have not had more than two hrs sleep in almost 3 weeks now and this med makes me feel very jumpy.

My doctor prescribed dicyclomine after going thru other doctors to determine why i was having so many stomach problems. This medication has kept be from running back and forth to the bathroom after i ate breakfast, lunch, dinner or simply a snack. I also have experienced dizzy, nausaea and have felt tired but that was only during the first month of treatment. Im still using this medication to treat all the ibs problems and the once a month thing which also helps ease the cramps or have no cramps at all. I would recommend anyone to had similar problems like i have to ask their doctor about this medication!

When I do have diarrhea, the need to go isn't as urgent as it was before I started taking this. I went from having 4-5 episodes of diarrhea a week to having maybe 1 a week. I still get diarrhea really bad at the start of my period, so it doesn't seem to help then.
