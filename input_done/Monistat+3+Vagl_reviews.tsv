Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Southpaw, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	10/3/2012 2:25:58 PM	I used Target's brand (same ingredients) and felt relief after 1 treatment the next morning so I will continue with the next 2 treatments.  It did burn a little, but I took ibuprofen (800 mg)to relieve the throbbing (it takes a while).  An antihistamine helped, too.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	10/3/2012 1:12:09 PM	I'm writing this review because I wanted to share a positive experience. After reading other reviews I was terrified of the possible &quot;debilitating&quot; pain that others talk about. After the first application the itchiness was very intense - much worse than originally - but that could be due to the fact that I wasn't used to the applicator and didn't do it right. There was no burning. After a while (about an hour) I slept through the night (the night before I had trouble sleeping due to the itch). I would definitely recommend this. It does tend to be a little messy but hey it's solving a medical problem.

The reason that Monostat is so painful for them is because they waited too long to realize they had a yeast infection in the first place. You should never second guess or take chances when it comes to something as important as your vagina. If you have any sort of difference in the usual smell, texture of discharge, color, or feel it is important to take notice. (not just think it will take care of itself naturally) If you catch a yeast infection in the first day or so Monostat is not painful at all to use.

The burning and itching is worse than the infection itself!!!!!!! I hope this stuff works and the old saying &quot;the burning sensation means it's working&quot; is true!!! Wowwee!!!!!!

Also it is now super tender down there more than it was before! probably going to use the 7 day treatment from now on, id rather deal with a mess than pain!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Badyeast1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	7/24/2012 1:08:47 AM	When I used the insert the first night, it leaked out and was very messy. Hard to sleep due to intense burning and itching all night. Felt terrible to wash my gebital area the next morning. Used cooling wipes and cream throughout the day. Feels better but there is a lot of soreness around my vaginal opening and it seems difficult to touch. Seems like the vaginal infection is starting to clear up, but the skin symptoms semm to be taking their time. Used monistat before with no problems. But never the 3 before. Might try 7-day next time. This is the worst yeast infection ever!

I have used Monistat in the past with no issues. This time I feel like my insides are on fire and swollen. I can't get it out or make it stop. I will not be using the other two nights worth of cream.

There is INTENSE internal burning feeling like needles jabbing the vagina, and burning and itching in the vulva from this product.  There are MANY complaints on the internet and few will post them. Who is paying you off-this is a TERRIBLE and dangerous product!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Diskg08, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	19-24	5/26/2012 10:35:30 PM	I decided to try this product because it was on sale rather than others (generic). So, i used it for the 3 days and i still had itching and all of the other yi sympyoms. That was the ovule inserts. I am now using the generic monistat 3 only this time its the cream. 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	19-24	4/22/2012 12:01:00 AM	Used for my first yeast infection even at the age of 23. Woke up in the morning one day and actually mistaked itching for dry Bess. Well I've never had this before! By the night it was driving me crazy and i noticed cottage cheese discharge. I went to get my mom who told me what it was and gave met some monistat cream. This did not work, I was complaining again within minutes. My mom went out to get me the monistat 3 kit. I started the ovule inserts that night and slept like a baby.  The itching immediately vanished for me. A Little itchy in the morning but nowhere near as bad as the night before. Used the following two nights. Worked perfectly for me. A little messy in the morning but it gave so much relief I didn't even mind the mess.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	bec88keys, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	3/21/2012 6:39:19 PM	I was experiencing terrible itching for two days when my pharmacist told me that I probably had a yeast infection, something I haven't had in over 15 years.  After applying Monistat 3 that night, the itching turned to an intense burning that literally made me cry.  The pain was overwhelming and I couldn't sleep through the night.  Day two I awoke with my vulva area completely swollen beyond recognition (frightening).  The swelling subsided throughout the day but that night I was so swollen that inserting the ovule was difficult.  Day 3 was no better.  It has now been several days since I have used Monistat 3, and while the yeast infection is gone, I have received a UTI in its place.  The lining in my urethra has been &quot;burned&quot; and dead skin is coming out while urinating.  The process is painful, and I would NOT recommend this product to ANYONE.  It was been a long week, and still not over.  Bottom line: Do not buy Monistate 3 under any circumstances.  Go see your doctor for a yeast infection and get Diflucan.  It will save you the headache of being in pain 24/7 for days on end.  If you are currently taking this product and having difficulties, douche it out with water/vinegar immediately.  It won't solve it, but it does bring about some relief.

Only a little warm feeling internally throughout the night.Third night - infection appears to be gone and am again experiencing the warmth, but it isn't unbearable.Be very careful to not get the stuff on the outside.  It cleared me up, but I will definitely steer clear of this medication in the future. I've used the other otc medicine with no trouble so I'll use it from now on.
Other	LynB, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	65-74	3/7/2012 8:33:05 AM	I have used monistat in the distant past with good effect. Had vaginal itching a week before my annual pap. Removed an estring (vaginal estrogen for vaginal atrophy symptoms) and the itch stopped. The pathologist noted critters with  morphology suggestive of candida on my pap smear. Tried one application of monistat, ended up with a mouthful of blood 24 hrs later when I brushed my teeth - discovered it is due a black box warning for interaction with warfarin (which I take)elevating the INR quite dramatically especially when menopausal vaginal atrophy is present. Too bad.

I am not allergic to anything, nor have I ever had an allergic reaction to any sort of medication, but Monistat 3 changed that. My whole body turned red and itched like CRAZY!! It felt like I was being eaten alive. I couldn't sleep the entire night and look like I just got burned all over my body. I WILL NEVER USE AGAIN!

This is day one and used the 3 day/cream...I'm happy with it so far and hope by the third day to dissapear completely (the reviews are strange but it depends on everyones body type i guess)
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Blondie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/19/2011 1:26:50 PM	I rarely have yeast infections, and used to (like many women) confuse bacterial vaginosis with yeast infections. If you have a bacterial infection, you will experience SO much pain using Monistat. I made that mistake before and will never again. This time around I bought the vagisil tester kit to determine if it was yeast or bacterial. This time it was yeast and the Monistat didn't burn at all. I suggest you take the test before you do anything. Your doctor can prescribe antibiotics over the phone for bacterial infections.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	19-24	12/3/2011 4:12:17 AM	The worst idea I have ever had was to try monistat instead of going to the doctor. Literally within seconds of using the cream I experience the most intense and painful burning sensations of my life. It felt like the medicine was tearing me apart from the inside.I also became VERY swollen and started to bleed. I am seriously considering going to the hospital so they can get this stuff out of me. Worst pain of my life. Please do not try it!

It is horrible the constant burning when the cream comes out and the intense itching is unbearable!

I had the most horrible pain and itching after using. Within minutes, I wanted to die. Almost went to the ER.  Couldn't wash it out fast enough. Endured horrible pain for hours. Was swollen for days.  STAY AWAY.

I will never use this again!  EVER!

So I decided to take monistat 3 and I was petrified to insert this stuff also cause of the stuff ppl write about it on the reviews. It's my first yeast infection and although these ovules look weird, I had no side effects at all. I did not use the it h cream thoughcause I disnt need it. Day 3 now ... Hoping the yeast goes away. Lesson learned: don't believe ppl's reviews !
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	7/3/2011 1:56:00 PM	I was afraid to use this medication because all of the bad hype on the internet. However, remember that each and every person is different. I just finished day 1 of 3 with not one of the severe reactions that other people mentioned. There was some very mild burning and abdominal cramping. But it was almost unnoticeable and I was able to sleep just fine. The product is very easy to use and is already proving to be effective. It's good to know from others that adverse side effects are possible, but it does not mean that you're going to experience them.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	unsatisfied,  Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		6/26/2011 12:57:00 AM	Horrible!! will never use this brand again.Extremely itchy and uncomfortable after use, when it used to be soothing. I've used it several times in the past when it was the egg-like insertion, but this new creme formula is painful and messy. I am hoping this won't result in an ER visit.

Never will I use this again.  I am in so much pain and still want to scratch continuously, but can't because it hurts...  Don't know if inside or outside is worse.  Had to go to the OB/GYN on an emergency basis.  Used 1 day dose.  Please be careful...

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	8/8/2010 8:27:11 PM	Within an hour of taking the first dose of Monistat 3 I was relieved of all itching and burning. This is my first yeast infection and I was very embarrassed. Thankfully my mother is a nurse and was able to help me out. This yeast infection took a lot out of me, after I took Monistat 3 I became very tired and experienced a lot of lower back pain. But, after sleeping it off I felt back to normal in the morning. But, within minutes of inserting the ovule the back pain, headache, and fatigue came back. But, over all I am very satisfied with this product and will definintely use it again.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	momlovestohunt*, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	19-24	6/7/2010 8:08:20 PM	a week ago I suspected that I have a &quot;yeast infestion&quot;. I was mortified with embarassment so I did'nt tell my husband; but we hav'nt had intercourse since. It has been 8 days since I first noticed it. Finally, yestrday, I was able to sneek a box home from the store. Anyhow, It has been VERY easy for me to use. I am using the 3-day supository monistat combo box with the itch releif cream too. The cream tingles a bit when I apply it but is nothing close to painful. I do think the tingling is because I was so raw, and my skin was so thin, it was like a wound on my inner laibia. Before I used it, I itched sooooo bad I took like 3 showers a day to avoid having to touch it (the sprayer hose helps clean out very well). It would last after taking a shower for like 4 hours but then I was right back in there like an obsessive compulsive germaphobic patient. Within 15 minutes of using the first dose and the cream, i was itch free. I had NO IDEA how bad it was until it did'nt have it anymore. I have 1 day remaining and so far, I'm virtually itch free. I could tell when it was time to use the next dose today because I could feel it again; but only a little.

I should have listened but got &quot;3&quot; instead.  I didn't suffer from any side effects like some people that are allergic to Monistat and it was very easy to use.  The only problem is that it didn't clear the infection.  I don't recommend using one or three day treatments because it turns out they are simply less effective and more likely to cause a reaction.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	ER, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	6/4/2009 9:48:23 PM	I've used Monistat 7 for years and it worked great.  When I got a yeast infection recently, after 15 years of not having one, I tried Monistat 3.  It burned terribly and didn't cure my infection.  A week later, I tried Monistat 7 and it burned so bad I was crying.  I then spent 6 frustrating months trying various cures prescribed by my doctor and from what I read on the internet.  I even tried Monistat 7 again a month ago and it still burned.  Finally, who knows why, the infection went away.  So, beware, warning, Monistat 3 may burn and may sensitize you so you can't use Monistat 7.
