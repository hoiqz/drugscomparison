Chronic Inflammatory Skin Disease Marked by Blisters	kp, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	19-24	9/16/2012 11:18:08 PM	This medication is my miracle drug, as many have probably said before me. I got my DH diagnosis about 5 years after it first appeared. I only had adverse effects in the first few weeks, which included change of sleeping patterns, loss of appetite, muscle weakness and irritability. But after the first few weeks everything was just fine, have been taking it with no problems since then. But recently my health insurance lapsed, and my Dermatologist refused to refill without doing my labs, which is understandable, but ever since I ran out of the medicine I've been having some very strange side-effects, including blood blisters in every finger and toe, all over my palms, blisters larger than grapes that just never stop burning, pins and needles in the affected areas. Constant nausea, no matter what I eat, extreme fatigue. I ended up going to the ER because it was hurting so bad that I could hardly move, they did my labs, and now I just have to wait for my meds to come in, (have to order them every time I need a refill). But my question is whether anyone else has ever had side-effects similar to mine when abruptly stopping the medication? 
Chronic Inflammatory Skin Disease Marked by Blisters	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	5/17/2012 3:40:00 AM	I was diagnosed with Wells Syndrome a few months ago and my Dermatologist put me on Dapsone.  I take 50mg/day adn after 30 days, I stopped getting lesions.  My Dr. said I could try taking 25 mg/day.... after the 4th day I got a new lesion! so I'm back to 50 mg/day.  I am a runner, and now that I've been on it for over 2 months I think it is begining to affect my lungs.  I NEVER had problems breathing when I run.  Today I thought I was going to have to call an ambulance for oxygen... no joke.  Think it's from the dapsone?

Other	G Gal, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/28/2011 12:00:50 AM	I developed panniculitis a few years ago.  It involved painful large red nodules on my legs that left bruises behind.  Each leg in its turn swelled to almost twice its normal size.  Prednizone was mostly ineffective and the side effects were awful, so Dapsone seems like a miracle.  I am almost symptom free most of the time now with no major side effects except a little anemia.  However, I seemed to have developed an anxiety problem over the last year that doesn't appear to be connected with any personal problems.  Anxiety isn't listed as a side effect in the paperwork that comes with Dapsone, although I have seen it mentioned a few places on line.  I came to this site to see if anyone else mentioned anxiety related to this medication and so far  I have not seen it mentioned.  I would not give up Dapsone even if the anxiety is related to it, as the side effects for other medications used to treat panniculitus can be far worse.  However, I may ask my doctor about cutting back.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/14/2011 11:03:30 AM	I have Granuloma and Dapsone is the only treatment for this. I've taken the pill on and off for 3 years; the Granuloma will disappear for approximately 4-6 months then return. The Dapsone does work but I usually have to take (3) 100mg pills daily for 4 months. However, I've started having problems with anemia, which is a side effect. My doctors are monitoring this but I might have to quit the drug. My dermotologist is thinking about prescribing the topical instead.
Chronic Inflammatory Skin Disease Marked by Blisters	Jones, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Male	35-44	6/6/2011 6:07:48 AM	I had chronic itching that started on the tops of my feet and moved to my knees, groin, buttocks, arm pits, lower back, chin, and back of my head. It would wake me up at 2am every night and I could not top itching. After 2 years of diagnosis a Doctor figured out I had Dermititus Herpetiformis by taking a biopsy of some of the blisters. He prescriped Dapsone. It cleared up the itching within 24 hours but made me extremely tired and light headed. I went for an upper GI to confirm if I had Celiac Disease and discovered that my oxygen levels were at 80% versus 95 to 96%. I turned blue in when getting the upper GI. The doctor said that Dapsone takes oxygen out of your blood and recommended I stop taking it. I have been on a strict Gluten free diet for two weeks (the itching has come back but is getting less severe).

For that last 3 years I've had a skin disorder no one could diagnois.On my fore arms and lower legs nodules appeared raised and then darken due to the intense itching. It's been biopsied, uvb light treated, creams and ointments galore....nothing worked.  I've been taking dapsone for 3 months.  My legs have cleared 90% and my arms 50%.  I am very happy and will contiune this med until all is clear.
Other	LYTinPerry, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	5/24/2011 8:41:09 PM	At first, I was elated about how fast Dapsone worked for my Dermatitis Herpetiformis skin rash.  I also went gluten-free.  However after just 6 weeks of use, my doctor told me to stop taking the drug because my blood test results were showing that Dapsone was having &quot;toxic effects on my body&quot;.  My red and white blood cells all dropped to very low levels causing me to become anemic and also my bone marrow is not making my blood properly anymore.  I'm scared to think about the rash returning in full force....and some of my former spots/areas on my skin are already starting to inflame and itch again.  I have my son's wedding is Sept. and I was really hoping to be healthy and rash free!

I have had NO side effects going on almost 9 years now! so if your doctor has prescribed it for you DO NOT LISTEN TO ALL THE NEGATIVE THINGS YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM AS LONG AS YOU ARE SUPPORTED BY YOUR DOCTOR WHILE TAKING IT........YOU WILL BE JUST FINE SO TAKE IT!!!!!

It is my miracle drug. I take it for d. h. Wheever a case flares up i can always count on this drug.  My mr. itchies have moved around my body in regards to where the symptoms begin to show up.  in the beginning they would always start on my butt cheeks and groin area. Then they moved to starting up on my earlobes. They have always, even today been most severe on and behind my knees and on my elbows and under forearm. Presently they tend to start on the tops of my feet.  I don't know where I would be without this drug.  Probably in a mental hospital.

I am 26 yrs old and am the only patient my doc sees with this condition. Oral steroids worked for a while then became unresponsive, so I've been on Dapsone for about 6mo now.  So far no real side effects to report ( but we did just increase the dose also, so we'll see...) but I am frustrated because I also see no real improvement in my PG.  I can report that while it is still not healing, the immense pain has been better, and I consider this a victory in itself.

Dapsone worked great, relieved itching in 24 hrs. Now take 100mg every 4 to 5 days and this avoids major flare ups though I still get itchy and uncomfortable feeling if I take any gluten foods. I try to be gluten free but that is almost impossible to achieve,Very concerned to read that Dapsone may not be available - would not know what to do if I could not get it, itching is intolerable! I often get dizzy, short of breath and feeling &quot;unwell&quot; but this is better than the itch! I also have blood tests at least annually, so far all is well.

Initial dose 200mg per day .  Very effective at clearing skin blisters but severe headaches associated with the medication.  Went on gluten free diet in about 1970.  Reduced dosage to nil over 8 years.  Now have to take Dapsone occasionally even though very strict with diet.  Presumably more sensitive to gluten than I once was and some cross contamination in some manufactured foods that should be gluten free.  Does everyone now know that everyone with dH should be gluten free even if no gut symptoms?

I started on a low (25mg) dose of Dapsone and gradually that was increased to the current 100mg/day, and I am now off of prednizone altogether. I now have a blister or two perhaps as often as 2-3 weeks apart.  While I notice no side effects of the Dapsone (and the side effects of the prednizone are going away), I have had some anemia problems associated with the Dapsone, which we are treating with vitamin B12 supplements--and watching through regular blood tests.I had also been told erroneously that Dapsone &quot;is not available&quot;--which turns out not to be true--an error for about a week in the computer system that Walgreens uses. It is available, but apparently not in loose form and only in the annoying blister packs. Re the blister packs: bend it back and forth at the segment lines a few times before separating them, and one edge will come loose, making it easier to peel back the paper to get to the pill.All in all, Dapsone has been a pretty OK drug--and not having to contend with multiple blisters here and there on my old body is great!

It's not that bad yet but would like to know what I can do to minimize it since there is no cure for Vitiligo. The reason I have to take Dapson for life is prevention, since I am totally cured of the disease.
