Enbrel had eaten the myelin from parts of my brain. I discontinued my Enbrel treatment and flew to Mayo Clinic in Rochester where it was concluded that the Enbrel had triggered an MS episode that I didn't have before starting Enbrel. Now - 3 years later- I have the attention span of a gnat, I can't remember things that should be easy to remember, I still have vertigo every single day, and the lesions are still on my brain, but they are currently inactive. The doctors at Mayo said there is a 60% chance of them becoming active again. TAKE SERIOUS PRECAUTION if you are considering this medicine. I was only 26 years old and never thought I'd be part of the statistics in tiny print at the bottom of the prescription information. Sure, it worked for Phil Mickelson in the commercial - - but it didn't work for me and I have lots of daily reminders of the damage.

Would I have developed M.S. anyway?  Maybe, maybe not.  &quot;Rare neurological problems have been reported&quot; aren't so rare when one loses capacity to drive, see color, etc.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Susan, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/30/2012 12:39:29 AM	Nothing I tried orally worked for my R.A.Every time I exerted myself in anyway, I would pay dearly for it the next day.There is not a pain medicine strong enough to even phase the excruciating pain of the flair ups. 2 years ago I got on Embrel and over night I was pain free.That was one sever chronic pain I am so thankful for not having to deal with since. If I do over exert myself I can feel the symptoms of the swelling coming on. I take 1 prednizone and it's gone in the morning.Had 30 of them last 2 years,and had to toss some of them due to age.Only side effects I have had are some weight loss,and I needed to lose 20 lbs anyway :)I know it has some really scary side effects,but until something else kills me.This has let me return to a normal active life.It does disgust me that the price of this drug is so expensive. I was disabled in a car accident, and had to get on disability.And THAT is the only reason I am able to be on this medication. Can't even imagine having to deal with that pain again.Already in chronic pain from D.D.D. in my spine.

I Developed Lung Cancer in My Left Lung in 2005, I Had Lobectomy Done On Left Lower LOBE Removed; And Aggressive  ChemoTherapy Done In 2006. Now in 2011 I Have More Tumors on My Right Lung that is Cancereous and Milignant Also. I Rather Take Something Else for My RA And Pain in My Back And Spine. Pls Beware of These Enbrel Injections. 
Plaque Psoriasis	Marine1967, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	2	Male	55-64	1/5/2012 10:15:59 PM	This drug worked great within the first three weeks of taking it.  Then, for some reason, it stopped working.  The plaque returned and i was miserable again.  Previous to this, I was on prednisone (worked great but can't take too much they say) Methyltrexate (WONDERFUL!!!) The side effects were pretty bad, nasuea / vomiting / chills, etc. but it cleared up the psoriasis wonderfully. They had to take me off it because it started damaging my liver however. Then there was Humira, another injectable that I was on for 9 months and never worked. I am hoping the Embril kicks in again.  It is easy to use, VERY expensive and I pray it works again.
Other	JZ, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	1/3/2012 9:35:23 PM	I take Enbrel for idiopathic joint inflammation which was giving me severe pain taht I took up to 8 large vicodin, steroids, prescription NSAIDS and even Zyrtec EVERY day. After taking Enbrel, I have no need for any other drug. I felt minor relief the day after my first injection. It has been about 1 month now and I am back at the gym [I did not leave my bed for almost a month prior]! In a way, Enbrel has saved my life.

It worked great for my bad knees and plaque build up but I got more head and chest colds from it and developed a terrible cough that lasted 4 days. As soon as you get a sniffle STOP taking the injections. This is the 2nd time in the 6 month period that I got this bad head &amp; chest cold. As for me it took out my immune system and now I'm in a catch 22 situation. My ribs were so sore from all the coughing and the sleepless nights were awful.

I got immediate results.  However, after about two years, I developed lung cancer.  The cancer was actually located outside the lung and never permeated the lung and had the lower lobe of my right lung removed.  I firmly believe it was the action of this drug inhibiting/supressing my immune system.  My surgeon and other doctors immediately took me off the drug.

Within two weeks Of taking injections my joint pain subsided and within three months my severe back pain( which I have lived with half my life) began to subside. Six months later and My back doesn't hurt anymore and I am feel the best I have in 19 years. Thanks to Enbrel I feel like I am finally living again.the worst side effect I have is hot flashes and an itchy leg the day of my injection which is a small price to pay to feel normal again!

You can only take so much predisone and cortisone shots before causing more damage than help say the doctors. I think the shots are nothing compared to the pain of RA, hooray for Enbrel, hope the price starts dropping. Very expensive even with health insurance.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	adchisle, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/2/2011 6:27:21 PM	I was diagnosed at 18 and am now 24.  I tried a lot of medications before Enbrel but stayed away from steriods.  Getting RA at such a young age made it hard to take medication that was effective and try to start my family.  My RA doctor, at the time, recommended I go off all RA medication while trying to get pregnant.  I did so and within 4 months I had severe bone damage to my hands.  I changed doctors, got back on methotrexate and then realized methotrexate wasn't enough.  My dr added Enbrel and it has been a miracle medication for me.  I stopped methotrexate and after 3 months tried to conceive and did so right away.  I've remained on Enbrel with caution from my RA doc and my OBGYN.  I'm now 8 months pregnant.  My first pregnancy off medication ended in miscarriage at 7 weeks.  I think it was because I was in SO much pain.  Since I've been on Enbrel I can truly enjoy life again.  It doesn't hurt to walk, go up and down stairs, I can get out of the bath tub with ease, I don't experience any morning stiffness... I really feel like a normal person again.  I make my husband give me the shots because I refuse to do them myself.  The shot hurts for about 15 seconds but it is SO worth it!  I highly recommend this medication!

I also wake up with a headache nearly every day...
Joint Inflammatory Disease in Children and Young Adults	Concerned Mom, 7-12 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	1	3	Female	7-12	9/19/2011 3:51:54 PM	Enbrel was prescribed for my 7 yr old daughter who has JRA or JIA. She was diagnosed about 6 months ago and has been on naproxen and methotrexate since diagnosis. Her inflammation counts were coming down, but not as much as the doctors wanted, so they added Enbrel twice a week. We don't know yet if the Enbrel is working or not since she never complained about the pain to begin with. We go back to the doctor in about 4 weeks, so we will know then for sure. The Enbrel is a pain to mix and administer. We have to mix it using the free-hand directions since we use each vial for 2 doses. My daughter is not happy about getting shots although she has gotten a little better about it. It still takes 2 people to give the shot to her. One person to hold her and one to administer the shot.Hoping she gets good results and can come off the meds quickly.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	35-44	5/30/2011 8:53:19 PM	I am a 44 YOF.  RA showed up when I was 17.  I have been on many meds, gold injections, methotrexate injections, ect.  Have been on Arava for last 10 years.  Added Enbrel in March.  Felt great after first injection, but then started having severe back and stomach pain.  Doc put me on Dexalant for stomach thinking it was an ulcer.  Pain kept getting worse.  Finally went to another doc. and found out I had pancreatis, stomach lining inflamation and gallbaldder inflamation.  Skipped my next Enbrel injection and everything got better with 2 days.  My blood levels are now coming back down.  Hopefully no permant damage.
Other	SuzyQ, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	5/15/2011 5:18:08 PM	I have been taking Enbrel since 2002 when finally approved by ins co for PsA. It has been a miracle drug for me. Once tried the 50mg  shot and it was horrible so went back to 25mg 2x week. There is a difference in needle and PH for the premixed 50mg that makes it painful. It seems I may have reached the point that it no longer wks for me and am considering infusions. Tried Humira but was not as good as Enbrel. Also take MTX. I get a few URIs but the benefits have always outweighed the bad.

I used to get the welts on legs from shots but also use the abdomen and don't have that problem.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	frankm1225, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	3	1	Male	55-64	4/16/2011 3:25:04 PM	My wife of 40 years began taking Enbrel about 8 years ago. It worked like a real miracle drug. But within 2 years, she developed vision problems, and a neurological condition known as demyelination of the neurons. The Neurologist told us the Enbrel was the cause. She stopped the Enbrel at that time, but some permanent brain damage was done. It stopped progressing when she stopped taking Enbrel. Last year she was diagnosed with several diffuse, Type B, large cell, non-hodgkins lymphomas, the very cancer that Enbrel warns about in the fine print. This responded well to chemotherapy (R-CHOP). However, the demeyelination suddenly accellerated during her treatment and she suffered long and died of the neurological side effect of Enbrel. Enbrel kills. Rember that and think it over before you use it. And it kills decades after it's use is begun.

I went from at stages not being able to hold a cup of coffee to now losing weight, being back at the gym being off all meds, (pain killers and anti inflams) except methotrexate and the Enbrel. I am now even jogging again, something that I only dreamt about. I hadn't done that for over 6 years. My energy levels are back again and I no longer experiencing the fatique.

THIS DRUG IS SO FANTASTIC THAT I TOLD MY DOCTOR THAT IF I HAD A CHOICE OF LIVING 10 YEARS THE WAY I FEEL NOW OR 30 YEARS FEELING LIKE I DID BEFORE I'D TAKE THE 10.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	sarat, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	45-54	3/4/2011 1:34:55 PM	so far this drug has been brilliant. i noticed a difference after the first jab. its relatively easy to use (epipen) but stings quite a bit but only for a few seconds. Im hoping it continues to work and i don't catch anything with my immune system being knocked out.  I'd rather take the risk than have the pain and terrible fatigue of RA. Hope this helps anyone in their decision whether to take Embrel or not.

As the weeks go on and it really gets into my system it can only get better.

Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	DraketheFlake, 35-44 Male  (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	35-44	11/27/2010 10:37:56 AM	Diagnosed in late '97. After about 12 years of flares and remissions, steroids, creams, shampoos, NSAIDS, non-biologic DMARDs, retinoids, diets, light therapy, and several combinations of the aforementioned, I had a flare that was so severe that nothing seemed to work and some appeared to even make it worse (steroids). I had almost 70 percent skin involvement with several types (plaques, pustular, inverse) and I could barely get out of bed due to joint pain. Several joints became permanantly deformed. After a high dose round of cyclosporine (which made me sick, but did help) I started Enbrel. Four weeks after...the pain was completely gone (OK maybe I won't run a marathon but comparatively speaking it was virtually non-existant). After about 6 months my skin was completely clear (and that's the truth). Initially I would occassionally bruise at the injection site. That is no longer a problem and aside from it sometimes stinging a little during injection, taking it is a breeze (especially with the sureclick, and considering I was a walking flake factory who could barely tie his own shoes, it was a drop in the bucket). I've been on it for 3 yrs now and once in a while I will have a small patch (which eventually goes away) but I have been pain free with no major side effects. I'm sure I sound like a commercial for Enbrel, but even though the major side effects can be devastating, the overall risk of side effects is minimal. I do worry about it but compared to where I was at 3 yrs ago, I'll suffer the worry rather than suffer the pain and discomfort I was going through then. I now have my life back.

After 20+ years of daily pain I thought it was a wonder drug, then 5 months later I developed all the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis. I discontinued the drug, had a brain scan to rule out MS, which it did rule out, and never went back to Enbrel. This drug cured my use of taking any pharmaceutical drugs. I only take Tylenol Arthritis for pain and years of physical therapy has made this disease bearable to me.

I have been on and off enbrel, but while I was on it it worked wonders. I am not taking it right now because I am worried about the effects it will have on my planned future pregnancy. I was wondering if any women have had experience with this drug during pregnancy? I am to the point now where I can barely walk...but I don't know whether I should take the risk...

Rheumatoid Arthritis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	6/14/2010 12:07:08 AM	I have RA &amp; Ankylosing Spondylitis.  I had symptons in High School, but &quot;flared&quot; while trying to have kids. In 2000 my RA journey began.  I took Kineret for a few years, then was put on Enbrel.  It varied in how well it worked. I needed &quot;support&quot; drugs. I developed nerve pain as a side effect of Enbrel. I've always been on 2 rx's for pain, plus all the IBU I can take.  I developed an inability to take TYL. It agrivatied the nerve pain.  Recently after being taken off Enbrell due to sickness, I questioned myself as to why I have less daily pain w/out Enbrel while I was sick. I figured the antibiodics or the immune system played a role.  Then, the first injection began the battle w/daily pain again.  I quit taking the drug for severl weeks.  Then I went to the Dr. to tell him how great I felt. I still had pain, but IN my joints.  I still had trouble doing some things; some days my hips wouldn't do so good while walking, some days my feet made it hard to walk, etc.  My Dr agreed.  Enbrell was attacking my body, not helping my RA.  I've been off it for monthes now.  I have really bad days when it rains or is cold.  But I have some pretty good days too.  I've been doing things I haven't felt like doing for a long time. Not being in constant daily pain is a blessing.  I just hope other drugs won't do the same thing.  Come winter, I'm gonna need some help.
Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	PacMania, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	45-54	8/20/2010 2:21:21 PM	I am 54 years old.  I have had psoriatic arthritis for 20 years.  I was on Enbrel for 6 years.  It was a fantastic drug.    While I was on Enbrel, all of my symptoms were gone.  I wasn't even stiff in the morning.  After about 5 years I became very fatigued.  My rheumatologist ignored my pleas for help.  My primary care physician found that I was also having balance problems and did a brain MRI.  I had developed Multiple Sclerosis.  I had to go off of the medication immediately.  It can't be shown for sure that the Enbrel caused the MS but it seems awfully coincidental.  No one in my family has now or ever has had MS and age 50 is old to be diagnosed.  I was told that it was possible that the MS might go away after being off of the medication.  It has been 3 years and so far that hasn't happened.  This drug is amazingly effective and I really miss it, but it also can be very dangerous.  While my side effect was rare, it can happen.  Pay close attention to your health and if your rheumatologist won't listen to you, find another doctor who will.
Plaque Psoriasis	Rick, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	4	Male	55-64	8/8/2010 12:05:40 PM	I have been on Embrel for a little less than three months. So far I am pleased with the results. Most of my bad areas have almost cleared. My scalp is about 75% better. I also use Taclonex for stubborn areas. I am still on the twice a week dosage. Should go to once a week soon. The injections are no big deal. Most times I let the shot come to room temp before injecting. Some burning but only lasts a short time. Nothing compared to Lovenox injections ! I've had psoriasis for about 15 years and resisted Embrel for a long time but the condition was getting out of control. Now I seem to be getting some relief.

Plaque Psoriasis	G.V.R., 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	5/20/2010 10:48:19 AM	My wife recently began using Enbrel for Psoriasis.  She has always been healthy until recently when she began to complain of a severe headache.  Within days she suffered a debilitating stroke and has a long recovery ahead of her.  After exhaustive testing the doctors could not find a cause for the blockage since there was no plaque anywhere within her cardiovascular system. The conclusion was that the lining of her carotid artery developed a tear which in turn formed a blot clot. According to the doctors this usually only occurs after some form of physical injury to the neck.  My wife had none.  I was surprised to learn recently that my wife associates her stroke with and believes it was caused by Enbrel since it was the only thing that had changed in her life.  I had doubts until I had a moment of free time to do some research on the internet.  Now I believe she may very well be right.  As one website described...  &quot;Adverse events have been reported during post-approval use of Enbrel&#174;. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to Enbrel&#174; exposure.&quot;Guess what was on the list along with many other disorders...     Strokes!!!   Please use caution when taking any new drugs.  Ask questions.  Report any changes in your body you notice.  Unfortunately this lesson was learned too late for us and doesn't help my wife but maybe it can help another.  One person's miracle drug may be another's poison!!!  Beware.   Be cautious.

I have decided to attempt natural healing, through an herbalist, I am afraid of it's &quot;quiet&quot; side effects --DEATH!

Began my treatment with various creams, with little results.  I was presribed Enbrel about a year ago. Saw a big difference in the plaques first 8-9 months, then it seems that the injections have lost effectiveness.  Not sure why this has happened.

I had horrible psoriasis and joint pain.  Within three weeks of starting this medication, my whole life turned around, my skin cleared up, my hair stopped falling out and I could raise my arms above my head for the first time in maybe a year.  It changed my life.  I am working full time again and don't hide away from the world because of horrible looking skin.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	45-54	4/19/2010 1:40:22 PM	Worked great for about 3 months.  I then developed sudden onset atrial fib after 3 months. I got endometrial hyperplasia after 5 months, then severe anemia. Congestive heart failure about 6 months after stopping, then Lymphoma (stage 3, so must have been there for a while) just 2 years after stopping treatment. This is a VERY dangerous drug.

Thought my life as an active adult was over.  Went from jogging, weight-lifting and playing softball to a person who could hardly walk from my car to office.  Pain and fatigue were horrible.  Started Enbrel in Aug. 2009 and felt results within 2 days; full effects in one month.  I put ice cube on site to be injected for 5 mins before shot, then 5 mins after shot.  Virtually eliminates swelling, redness, and itching.  I am now able to walk for exercise, lift wieghts, and actively coach softball.  My life is back 95%.  I still am tired sometimes but may just be that I feel so good now that I try to do too much!!!Give this drug a try; it was worth it for me.
Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	Blessed, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/14/2010 12:53:00 PM	After 20+ years.I AM FREE!I was almost 75%cleared in 2weeks.Dr.was amazed.I had to decided if benfiet outweighted risk.For me yes.I had very poor quality of life the last 10years.Spent lots of time in bed unable to walk when soles of feet would peel off or skin would scream if I moved to much.Most the time I was covered head to toe with very little clearskin.Iam final able togo out and play with my grandchildren.I was able to wear summer clothes outside.and no one gasped in horror.I wish I would have started sooner.I do have some sideffects.nause,dizziness and trouble holding a thought.But I can say it is worth it I can play catch with my grandson everytime he comes to visit.I am getting a chance to have a real life an if it is over tomorrow I can say these last months have been the best.I am praying for a cure.It is just waiting to be found.

I have been taking enbrel for 7 months now and haven't really noticed much improvement if any. I have had a lot of headaches though, almost every time I wake up, bad headaches in the back of my head and on top. also had a lot of hair falling out. I've read all reviews and haven't seen any very negative. was wondering if anyone else has noticed these. 
Plaque Psoriasis	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	3/11/2010 2:45:13 PM	I've been on Enbrel 100 mg a week for 2 years, and seem to have &quot;topped&quot; out on results.  I am 80% clear with some stubborn plaques on my lower legs.  It's great to have fingernails and toenails again, but a clear scalp and ability to wear black? PRICELESS!!  I've also found that if you warm the syringe in the bathroom while you shower, and inject while your skin is warm, the pain is no discomfort at all.  Give it a try.  God bless the researchers who gave us this medicine.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/28/2010 12:24:17 PM	Just a quick note...since using Enbrel, my symptoms are almost non-existant. I have been taking Enbrel for about six years and can't say enough great things about it!
Rheumatoid Arthritis	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	65-74	2/14/2010 4:33:35 PM	I was having severe trouble walking before Enbrel.  I am now regularly exercising and moving quite freely.  I did have injection site reaction but this has lessened over time.  I don't know what I would be doing if I was not using this medication.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Sassy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/3/2010 6:59:27 PM	I tried MTX, Remicade, etc.  Went on Arava in January 2009, lost my appetite and 40 lbs.  Arava helped some but couldn't get past the pain and stiffness.  In August, 3 years after being diagnosed with RA, trying different meds, shots in the shoulders because I could hardly move,  I got to the point where I said &quot;is this the way I have to live my life?&quot;  I started on Enbrel the end of August, and in spite of the fact I hate needles, I have my life back!  I use the Enbrel autoinjector once a week.  The drug company has been absolutely awesome in providing support and calling me as scheduled for refills.  I suffered for 3 years, could hardly open doorknobs, drive the car, or do simple everyday things.  If you need to start Enbrel and are hesitating because of the needles, trust me, it's not a big deal (it only takes 15 seconds) and if Enbrel works for you as well as it did for me, it's a small price to pay when you can get out of bed without pain(used to have to move my joints before I could sit up), would take Celebrex and wait a couple of hours before I could actually function.  Yes, there are risks that we need to be aware of and only you can make the decision.  I know I made the right one!

Rheumatoid Arthritis	dbier03, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5		45-54	1/28/2010 2:29:53 PM	Have been on Enbrel for 5 months now, it is fantastic! I was at the point of not being able to function on a daily basis. I had a hard time walking, sitting the swelling and stifness was getting unbearable. I really thought I would be lucky to not be in a wheelchair within months. 3 weeks after starting Enbrel I saw and felt major differences. I can walk ( exercise too) and I can ride a bike 8=10 miles a day! No major side effects just mild soreness when injected but I can live with that!

I used humira for about a year and it wsa terrible. After about a month on enbrel the pain was lessened and the mobility increased. I am satisfied, I just wish the price would drop.

I have had no side effects, have no new plaque. I feel as though I have reached a plateau and see no continued clearing. I am also taking Methotrexate 20 mg per week.

I can finally get out of bed in the morning! and i rarely have flare ups. it sucks having to give myself shots and i'll be honest after two and a half years it still really hurts, but the reward is so worth it

Overall, feel better than before I started taking it.  Noticeable improvement but still have continuous pain and fatigue.  Just not a bad as pre-Embrel. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	mrsglis, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/29/2009 3:57:07 PM	I am 41 and have RA for 13 years.  I have been on Enbrel for 10 years. This is truly a miracle for me.  I was unable to function 3 mos after having my daughter. Enbrel showed results with me within a couple of weeks and I have not had any deterioration progression in my hand or foot since we first discovered damage to those to areas.   I do have swelling and ulnar deviation in right hand but no pain and no joint damage. The burn is the worst part of the injection but that goes away when I remember those days where it took me 2 hours to get out of bed and had my hands locked around my steering wheel by the time I got to work.  Blessed are we that have reaped the benefits of this drug.

While it worked at keeping my arthritis at bay, it caused demylenation in my brain which caused me to go blind.  It's neurological effects are well documented, aand If I knew then what I know now, i never would have taken it.  The neurological side effects are forever and far far worse than the arthritis

It cured my hands, until my insurance company wanted me to switch to their pharmacy.  I was delayed a couple of days getting my medication.  This caused my skin to flare up again.  I hope it doesn't take long to get it under control again.  I have to avoid using hot water, don't wash hands often, where rubber gloves for any cleaning job, and use fluconicide and vectical ointments for lubrication of my hands. I really need to take enbrel every 3 days instead of twice a week to do best.

Prior to Enbrel I dreaded going to bed at night knowing that when the morning came I would be in extreme pain and stiffness. It took approximately one month for the symptoms to subside. I only hope that there are no side effects looming from this drug.It took a few injections before I became at ease in sticking myself though. It has been extremely beneficial for me.

I am turning a 2 color skin person, the sun is now my enemy. In general Enbrel has worked wonders for me, I am 98% psoriasis free.  My scalp has improved only 85%.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Happy Hands, 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5		55-64	10/31/2009 2:40:10 AM	I have RA &amp; type II diabetes and have used this med for about 4 years, going on and off for unrelated surgeries and anytime I have a skin infection.  The pain and swelling are well controlled.  I love the huge decrease in fatigue.  I suggest any diabetic just starting it carefully watch their blood sugar.  When I am on it, I have to cut my oral diabetes meds by 50-75% after the first few weeks and up it again when I am off.  I am just starting Enbrel again after a prolonged period of not taking it and am anxious to see if it happens again.  I know there was some testing with Type I diabetes, but has anyone else had this experience with Type II? For injections that hurt much less than plucking a couple eyebrow hairs, leave injection at room temp 20 minutes, look at end of needle and face the bevel side away from the skin. INJECT SLOWLY to decrease burning and bruising.  My only adverse reactions are itching welt and bruising at injection site.  (I take Plavix)

After the first injection, quite painful, I began to feel dramatic results within the next couple of day!Now I have been taking Enbrel for a year and I feel wonderful, like my old self!The only problem is the difficulty of traveling with the medication since it needs to be refrigerated which makes traveling difficult.But without Enbrel, my RA would be worsening quickly.

It has not eliminated the rest of the symptoms in fact I was recently diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome to go along with RA.  The fatigue is the hardest sympton for me however the stiffness in my hands makes typing difficult.

For years no one knew what was causing it. When I was 22, I got very sick on a trip to Belize and afterwards had a flair-up so intense I could hardly walk, so I searched for more answers. I finally found a doctor who knew what it was and she recommended Enbrel to treat the inflamation of my joints. I started Enbrel and within 2 weeks my pain improved 100%.  I went from having a handicap parking permit at college to being able to run 5 miles a day and be an active and normal 24-year-old.  This drug is amazingly effective and completely worth the injection-site reactions and complicated insurance issues.  I wish I would have found it sooner.  
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Enbrel Lover, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	9/15/2009 3:08:49 PM	I never do this but I had to inform future takers of how well Enbrel works! I was diagnosed at a young age with Rheumatoid Arthritis and was lucky to get into remission a few years later. Not so lucky that it came back a little over a year ago. It hurt everywhere from my feet to my neck. My friends called me the old man and even joked at getting me a wheel chair. I tried several different medications over the past year before my doctor and I decided to go with Enbrel. I started back in March and I have almost no symptoms! I still have a little trouble when I go to bend my knees but everything else is great! I even started running again! Do not be scared of the side effects because if you are like me or anyone else the benefits defiantly outweigh the cons! Also, if you have any questions you can call Enbrel directly and they are more than happy to answer all of your questions. When I first contacted my insurance they told me that it was not covered at all. I called their 1-888-4ENBREL phone number and provide all of my insurance information and they took care of everything. Do not be scared Enbrel is a miracle drug!

I felt better the nest day!  When treatment started I was almost too sore to walk, but now I'm about 85% better.  to me Enbrel has been a miracle.  I've been on it for about 9 years and it still is effective with none of the side effects,

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Ms. B, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	55-64	9/5/2009 1:08:19 PM	I have been on Enbrel for 2 1/2 mos.  For the past three weeks I have increased joint pain to the point of not being able to hold a coffee cup with one hand.  The joint pain is centered in the hands and feet, but also knees and elbows.  I have only had RA for six months and wonder if this is just a flair-up or something else. My Rhuematologist is monitoring me but I am very discouraged.

I went from not being able to put my shoes on and my back bone nearly frozen in place due to Anklosing Spondylitis. I can now jog 2 miles a day. And as an added benefit, this medicine has put my Crohn's Disease into remission too, and I have started reccommending it to my patients with ANY auto-immune illnesses, including the ones it is not labeled to treat. For the woman who was afraid because of all of the side affects, those effects were from your other medicines more than Enbrel. Enbrel does have side effects, and some are severe, but in 10,000 cases you will get one Lymphona, and that is usually already present within the body and the Enbrel weakens your immunes system ability to keep it at bay. Try this medicine for three months, and if it doesn't work, ask your doctor to try Humira, which does the same thing a different way, and fro reasons we cannot explain, if one doesn't work, the other usually does. Like I said, I prescribe it, but I take it too. BTW the warmer the vial, the less pain upon injecting.

People no longer look at me like a freak. My elbows and knuckles no longer unexpectly bleed in public.  I don't shed like a snake.  I don't have to wear bandages to cover myself or hear people question me, stare or think I have a deadly disease.  I look like a normal person.  Yes, I have flare ups (mainly with stress). I fear people with colds &amp; real get mad at people that take kids out with flu's which I caught that put me up for a time~due to lack of immunity. Ask for the prefill sure click(same price)so easy..don't feel it..like a pen. Make sure to inject in stomach..DON'T ARM OR LEG..HURTS TO BAD. Let set for about 10min. to warm to room temp. Talk to dermatalogist or company that makes it they do have a program to help pay the co-pay or purchase of medicine no matter if you have insurance~great help! No goverment program insurance though.  Look on website of enbrel.  I had in hair, arms, knees, feet, neck, fingers &amp; major areas of body. I also had to learn with the pain of bleeding from my skin breaking all the time and the itching.  Not no more.  You would never know.  I'm normal now~getting ready soon to go on maintence soon shots. Only thing that ever worked for me. Everything else my body seemed to adjust to. I was too scared to try because of the warnings but I'm sure glad I did...I got tired of the hiding and the cruel people.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Linda, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	45-54	8/12/2009 2:09:01 PM	Since I was Dx with RA i was on Meth, Enbrel shots, Prednisone, Orencia IV infusions. I was very sick on Meth, my RA Dr changed my meds to Enbrel and I got thrush (sp?) infection in my mouth. Than infection in my eye, nose and upper lip, it was so bad! I was switched to Orencia. I am not really happy with Orencia, first of all did not do much pain wise, but you gain a lot of weight with it.  Now my RA Dr wants me to go back to Enbrel and I am really hesitant toward this drug due to severe and even fatal side effects. I had my last IV infusion and in same room, across from me was a young man who was also getting Orencia IV. I asked him if he satisfied with it, he said that he was on Enbrel for 1 year until he got bad case of Lymphoma and needed to have chemo and radiation. Now his life is in the air and he strongly did not suggest me to take this drug... I also had TB when I was young, but my Dr took blood work before my Enbrel shots and it showed I am OK to take this drug. Still, I worry about  it... any suggestions please?

I'm taking several drugs and found that enbrel works the best for me. It cut down the morning stiffness and pain i feel. Enbrel's also very easy to use. I dont mind the injection pain because its better than aching all day from the RA.

I've been on this medications for about 3 years. I give the shot in my stomach. For the past 3 years i've developed an infection in my lower stomach. This time with the infection antabotic didn't work to get rid of it. I had surgery to remove the infection from my stomach. Yes this medication help with pain and stiffness. But the side effect or very severe. I haven't took the medications since. Now I'm in pain. I'm scared to take it.

Pain scale of 1 out of 10, down from 9 out of 10. Reduced morning stiffness, joint pain, and swelling. However, very concerned about recent research finding increased rates of lymphoma in children/teens taking TNF drugs if used over 2.5 years. Is risk worth benefits??
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Ellen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/5/2009 9:12:28 AM	I have been on Enbrel for over four years. I have not had any serious infections, though I have had a lot of sinus irritation but I already had sinus problems.  I do 25 mg twice a week and have no problem injecting, unlike people I read about who have a lot of soreness &amp; pain with injection.  (I use the multiuse vial and mix it up each time.) When I feel able, I stretch out the time between injections, if I'm doing really well.  But after being off 8 weeks for ankle surgery (doctor recommended 3 weeks before &amp; after but I didn't want to take any chances), since then I pretty much stick to every 4 days, it works for me.  If I wait longer I feel my mood slide, pain starts, etc.  (My mood seems to be my early warning system!)   My only concern right now is, the length of time I've been on, if I'm increasing my risk of MS or cancer.  My doctor, never one to encourage me to hold back meds, has suggested (startingly) to see if I can stretch out the shots now.  Not sure if I want to do that, but will get myself re-tested for TB exposure first.  I've been having a few odd sensations and digestive problems this last year that are new, not sure if it is related, because I also have some fibromyalgia which could be causing that. Enbrel does nothing for FM, and I tend to notice it more when the RA gets better (different disease pathway?)   But, since I had high liver enzymes when I started Enbrel (actually Remicade first, which i DIDN&quot;T like!), my doc skipped right over all the regular DMARDS, so I don't have much else I can take for RA. I recently had to stop Celebrex, my other med, due to stomach problems, and Celebrex is about as good as it gets with NSAIDS.  So - Enbrel is my lifesaver!

My JIA was controlled for about 4 years on just methotrexate, sulfasalazine, folic acid, plaquenil, and occasionally prednisone. Then in March of 2009, a flare up started and I just couldn't do anything I used to. I had to sit in bed for nearly an hour before I could get up with ease, and was sore until the afternoon. I couldn't play sports for more than 15 minutes at a time, and then I'd have to take a break because of sore feet. Sometimes I couldn't go to school because my joints hurt so badly. I rated my everyday pains at about a 9/10 in my feet, back, knees, hips, shoulders, neck, hands, and elbows. But then I started enbrel and in about 2 weeks time, I started feeling better again. It was easy to take with the autoclick injector, and only took about 5 minutes out of my week. So far, I only have very mild pain in my neck and hands, and rate my pain at about a 1/10. Enbrel has been a total lifesaver for me, and I recommend it totally.

Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	Ultrastar9, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	3	5	Male	35-44	6/18/2009 9:34:51 AM	I used this drug about 2 years ago and was very satisfied with the results.  It completely cleared my skin and finger nails after about a month and improved my mobility and lessened my joint pain.  After changing jobs and losing my insurance I stopped taking the drug.  My arthritic symptoms slowly began to creep back and after a year it was difficult to even get out of the car or bed.  I have recently began taking the drug again and I already notice a difference with my joints after only 2 doses.  The skin has not cleared yet, but I am expecting it will begin to heal soon as well.  My only regret is waiting this long to start taking this drug again.  The injections are a little difficuly but not bad once you get the hang of it.  I use a cold pack to slightly numb the injection area before hand and let the needle get to room temp before hand.  This almost completely reduces any injection site irritation.  I am grateful that insurance covers the bulk of this medicine since it is extremely expensive otherwise.  This drug has literally changed my life.

At the time of my first shot, I had one frozen knee, carpal tunnel in my left hand, and was literally crawling out of bed in the morning until I could find the energy to stand. My rheumatologist warned me that it may take up to 3 months for the medicine to work--if at all. The VERY NEXT day, literally 24 hours later, I woke up and unconsciously stood up out of bed, the first time doing so in 2 years. Since then, I've been able to walk everywhere in any type of shoe, jump, participate in normal activities, and even run. Most people have no idea that I have a chronic joint condition and are shocked when I tell them. I have even moved from 50 cc/week to 25 cc/week. This drug is an absolute miracle and I thank God every day that it essentially has saved me from a life full of misery.

My RA dr. prescribed diclofenic and it ate a hole in my stomach. my skin dr. gave me enbrel for my psoriasis and it hasn't helpede much with that but my vision and my pain and stiffness has been alleviated. Perhaps with time my skin will clear as well. I am worried about my immune system though and the side effects of this drug.

Overall it really was a life saver for me after all of the drugs, laser treatments etc. that I have taken.

Since then side effects and anxiety about this drug has worsened. I have severe headaches now that are starting to affect my daily doings, especially with eye pain. I also have been having really annoying and disorienting tingling serges from my head down to my fingers. And I and my boyfriend are starting to notice mood changes, muscle weakness(to the point where I cant do physical therapy) and body aches, extremely in my neck and shoulders. The only reason I am taking this is for my psoriasis (which is only mild but has been severe phycologically giving me depression since it covers my face). Its also getting harder to inject it due to hardening cartilage. Alot of times 4-5 days after my injection day I get misquito bite like itchy bump from previous injection sites from months before. Hmm ?. Whats frustrating is doctors dont really answer any of these concerns.  
Rheumatoid Arthritis	45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	3	1	Male	45-54	5/22/2009 1:49:33 AM	I know of three people who took Enbrel and developed cancer as a result of taking the drug. One person died from the cancer. My good friend said that when she first took the drug, she felt, &quot;born again&quot;, like a new person! For the first time in her many years, she had no more pain or stiffness, and she was really sick, and she concluded that this drug was a miracle....until two years later when she developed Lymphona that started in the neck. She underwent intense Chemo and radiation treatments, and so far, she is OK! Too bad that this drug has this potential side effect of cancer and &quot;death&quot;.I myself have severe Psoriatic Athritis, and the pain in my body gets so bad that I'm just ready to take the plunge with Enbrel, but one of MD's tells me &quot;not&quot; to take it, and he won't even perscribe Enbrel to any of his patients, and he's one of the best doc's in my city. He says that the research that he has studied just doesn't justify the means. Maybe in time Enbrel will become a safer drug, but for now, life will have to be painful!

It has STOPPED any progression of joint damage of and has greatly reduced my severe RA symptoms.  This is truly a miracle drug.  The shots do sting, but it's not a big deal.  I give myself the shots in my thigh (I've never been told to give them in my stomach, like another poster by any of the many RA docs I've had through my HMO).  The once a week shots are nothing to worry about and a lot easier than the twice a week mix-it-yourself shots I used to do.  Until there's a cure for RA, this is the next best thing.

I asked my RA doc and he suggested taking two shots instead of one equaling the same amount of medication.  I haven't started doing it yet, but he told me his other patients tell him that it no longer stings in smaller doses!!
Rheumatoid Arthritis	butterflyspirit, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	45-54	3/25/2009 3:39:22 PM	I began Enbrel treatments a little more than a one year ago after failing a trial of Humeria.  The Enbrel seemed to improve my symptoms such as pain and inflamation so I tolorated the sting of the weekly injections.  Lucky for me (or maybe not) my health insurance paid over a thousand dollars monthly for it. The problem arose when I was diagnosed with TB and was immediately taken off all of my RA meds except plaquenil.  I had been given a TB skin test before I started the Enbrel treatment. The Enbrel was said to have caused my body to become an &quot;immunio-suppressed host for the TB bacteria.&quot;  I was extreemly sick before I was properly diagnosed and had been treated for pneumonia instead until finally a chest xray and scan led to a referral to a pulmonologist who took sputum samples which tested positive for TB. # TB skin tests had been negative. I was placed on isolation quarentine for 2 weeks. Because of the TB treatment which is a daily regimen of several antibiotics I was not allowed to take any RA meds except the plaquanil and of course my RA symptoms increased in severity.  It has been a nightmare. I don't want to bore anyone with anymore of the details but I would advise anyone to think long and hard before taking this medicine.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	ambanks23, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	25-34	3/16/2009 8:30:42 PM	It was hard at first to get use to giving myself a shot once a week in the stomach but this drug is truly a miracle. It took a couple months for me to notice any improvements from the medication. I had to take pain killers and prednisone for the first 2 months of my treatment with Enbrel. But since I've been on Enbrel I barely have any limitations from my disease anymore. I can get out of bed in the morning with no pain and the morning stiffness has disappeared. I still have some swelling but nothing serious. I have been flare free for 6 months and am taking it with Methotrexate. I highly recommend this medication for anyone with RA.

They has worked very well for me. Since switching to the Sure-Click injection, the ease of use is much better. Although, I have had both hips and knees replaced, I am able to do more with a lot less pain.

The drug stings real bad going in. I use methotrexate along with the enbrel. I can't imagine where I'd be without this drug. I still get swelling in different places and have lost a lot of strength. Have to limit what I do physicaly but can do most all I want.

I could hardly walk, stand, sit or sleep because of the extreme pain. My only recourse was knee replacement surgery which I was VERY scared of.Doctor suggested Enbrel. I felt very good relieve from pain within a few weeks. I was at least able to sleep and sit without tears. Then doctor added Methotrexate to my regime. After a few weeks I felt much better and after 3 months or so I felt like God granted me a miracle. I am walking better than ever before. I still have flare ups now and then but 99% of the time I feel very good. I can even exercise again. The injections are relatively easy once you get used to poking yourself. Must stick the needle in at the correct angle or it will sting - but the discomfort is short and bearable considering the benefits.

I dealt with the condition for roughly 5 years as it slowly spread to new areas in my body.  My sed rate was around 60-70 something and my c-reactive proteins were roughly 13.  I was taking oxycotin just to sleep, move, etc.  The morning after I took my first dose of Enbrel I felt like a million bucks.  Granted my pain wasn't completely gone, but in comparison to what it had been, it was essentially a new lease on life.  Now the pain is almost completely gone after several months treatment.

I have a severe case, 80% of my body including the palms of my hands and soles of my feet. The injections do sting, but I use an ice pack immediately after the injection and it takes the sting out. The biggest problem I have with Enbrel is that I tend to pick up infections more easily and have a harder time shaking off illnesses. I take a medication vacation before traveling, any medical work, dental work, etc. to reduce the chance of infection. I am very grateful that my insurance covers Enbrel, as it is expensive! This is the only medication that has helped clear my psoriasis. I use Taclenex on the stubborn spots that Enbrel leaves.

After starting enbrel 4weeks I was back to as close to normal as possible.I have been injecting enbrel and taking methotrexate for 18 months with very few side effects. I have sinus headaches but not bad enough to treat ,I can feel my lungs but am an ex-smoker(10 yrs.)other than that it has been well worth the sting of the injection.

I was constantly having flair ups in my knees even though I was on NSAIDS. I still have them once in a great while/ like when the weather makes a drastic change, but nothing like before. I think it is a great med and thank my lucky stars its out there.  My father had RA and he was so dependent on steroids, it destroyed his system and made his late years not very good. I wish it had been around when he was still alive.

I am a little concerned the i seem to have developed some involentary ticking in  the musles of my eye and left arm. I have an appointment with my doctor today to see if he thinks the Embrel is causing it.

Please be very careful using this drug for yourself or your loved one.  The last week of her life we were told that &quot;if&quot; she made it, she would have to be on life long antibiotics due to these infections that just wouldn't go away.  She had great releif from her RA symptoms.  But now...I feel that there should be more research before they put a new drug on the market.

We tried diets, creams, everything. Nothing worked. He was finally was placed on Methotrexate which helped but made him very tired. He would still have scales so badly that we had to change the bed sheets daily. Skin would be so thick on the sheets it looked like fish scales. His Psoarsis spread from his legs to his hips then on elbows and head. He was miserable. Eventually, his lower body was bleeding and raw. Finally, a dermatologist tried Enbrel. It worked wonders. He has a cream in conjunction with enbrel for the stubborn areas. It is like a miracle for us. He sleeps nights now; can wear shorts; Is now happy and has Quality of life. Thank you.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Sandy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/10/2008 1:20:33 PM	The only problem I have is acquiring the medication.  I have been on Enbrel since it first became available.  Pharmacies do not keep it in stock due the small number of people in specific area that need (or can afford) the medication.  Usually I have to wait over a week for pharmacy to get medication.  Or have it mailed from insurance provider which usually takes over a week also.

I have mild to moderate psoriasis on my body and moderate to severe on my face and scalp, giving me severe acne and roseca. Enbel has helped 100% with my psoriasis, and has even helped my complexion(I still use tanning beds and sometimes prescribed ointment around my nose, and in back and in my ears.)My arthritis however, it seems that Enrel has not even touched it, and Im experimenting with different anti-inflammitories, energizing anti-depressants and still taking darvocet. The reason I put somewhat difficult under use of medication is because I am extremely uncomfortable with shots! But thats just me. The only complication I worry about is the unknown effect it has on pregnancy. I had a very healthy baby boy prior to my use of enbrel, but after about a year of using enbrel I found out I was pregnant. Thinking I was playing it safe, I stopped using Enbrel (and all other medications, being only darvocet at the time) as soon as I found out I was expecting. 5 months into the pregnancy I had a stillbirth with the cause being unknown.

Enbrel and methotrexate worked wonders, still in wheelchair but can at least smile.  Be very careful. Stop when taking antibiotics.  It does cause thrush in answer to previous letter, do not mix with sulfa drugs, check with Dr. at every open sore or cut. Been taking it since 1999. Will also cause mouth ulcers. Be aware  and be thankful that we have this.  Life was unbearable before these drugs.

I have worked my way through so many other drugs. Most worked for a while, but only made the pain and stiffness tolerable. I was having areally bad flare, and nothing seemed to be getting my symptoms under control. Once I went on Enbrel, I felt like a normal human again. Since the injections are only once a week, I feel like I hardly have to take any medicine, and I rarely have any symptoms. Enbrel has literally saved my life! And thanks to the Quick Assist program Enbrel offers, I am able to afford it.

I&quot;ve been using it for 4 months. I take enbral and 2 other medication for rheumatoid arthritis. I also have a skin disoder that brought on the RA. so when the RA flares so does my skin disorder which makes the pain unbearable sometimes. since taking the enbrel the pain in my spine has eased but my hands ache like a toothache. I would really like to change meds but I'll stick with this a little longer. I still haven't gotten use to the needle. It really burns when the medication is released.

I noticed a difference the first week with my arthritis &amp; swelling.  Going into my fifth week &amp; with each week my arthritis has felt better &amp; my psoriasis has already improved about 80%.  The thin needle goes in easily with little pain &amp; while it does sting while injecting the medicine - but the few minutes of discomfort is well worth the results!  It still takes me a couple of tries to actually &quot;stick&quot; myself - but am hoping it will get easier w/time.  Am not experiencing any side effects so far &amp; am keeping my fingers crossed this &quot;miracle drug&quot; will continue to work for me!

Now I am really concerned about the new warning about fungal infections, as I have just been treated for thrush. I showed my doctor this thrush and she did not think the enbrel would cause this.  She didn't even think it was trush. I then went to my regular general practice doctor - still no diagnosis of thrush.  My wife finally felt so strongly that it was thrush that she called the GP dr and requested a RX for thrush.  It appears the thrush is now gone,but, with the new warning I am wondering if it may be worse or may have been a different fungal infection. This is giving me anxiety attacks.  Any suggestions?  Thanks best of luck for anyone being treated with TNF Blockers

Enbrel has been wonderful.  I can't use the easy click but have no problem with giving myself the shot.  Site burns for a short time but well worth it.

Very simple to use the autoinjector- i'm just glad my insurance covers it- i was diagnosed 11 years ago and had tried everything, uv treatments, tar treatments, multiple high-level steroids, oral medications and nothing was worth staying on- it was either slow or no change and too expensive for topicals when 80% of your body is covered in spots you have to treat twice a day! This is a great option for those who need it.

He was always at the doctors because it seemed he needed something stronger. He was then introduced to Enbrel and in fact it worked for about one year. After the year, he started getting different symptoms, such as loose of balance, weakness in his muscles, mood swings and was very depress.  A couple months later he started getting psychological problems.  This medication can be great if your not that percent where it can change your life for ever.  He now has irreversable brain damage with hallucinations and needs to reside in a skilled nursing home because of his high level of care, we cannot provide for him.  For those who take this medication, please be very careful and pay attention to every symptom.

I have tried many different treatments from PUVA light to methotrexate.  The only topical that has worked is called Ultravate (there is a generic for it).  I tried enbrel about 4 years ago and had great results.  I now take the med once a week.  It has not cleared it 100%, but with the topical ointment once in a while I can keep about 98% clear now.  Giving myself the injection was defintely a challenge.  I'm one who has a hard time giving blood because of the needle.  I finally said to myself if little children can give themselves injections for diabetes than I can do this.  Once you learn how to do it, it's not a big deal.  I have not tried the new sure-click injections.I can also say that I have a very good friend who has psoriasis and arthritis together. It has been unbeleivable for him too.  He is now wearing shortsleeve shirts again.

I have taken methotrexate, plaquenil and imuran for treatment, but I still would get flares, requiring prednisone.  I started Enbrel 12 weeks ago, and I feel so much better.  I still need to take Imuran and ibuprophen 400mg twice a day, but I feel like my joints have been lubricated and the pain is 95% relieved.  I consider this a miracle drug.  My husband's insurance is covering most of the cost.  Enbrel and the insurance coveage have been real blessings to the quality of my life.

I started on the Enbrel 1 month ago and the pain in my hands, shoulders and feet is practically gone. I have a hard time getting myself to inject the meds (even with the auto-injectors). Nonethless, this drug has really proven itself in such a short amount of time. The only downfall for me is that I get a reaction site injection that is unbelievable. Even with icing my leg before and after and taking 2 Benadryls, I get a welt on my leg that is bigger than a softball. It itches and is actually painful. It grows over a 24hour time frame and then takes 48 hours to fade.Its crazy. I guess I have to take the good with the bad!.

Could be my imagination but my knees seem to fee less stiff.  I am sure injectioning myself will become easier each time.

I had sore joints in my fingers. Most of my fingernails looked like I had fungus in them. The skin on my hands was very thin. I had been trying ointments for years and they would work for a while then lose their ability to heal.  I started taking Enbrel and for the last year and a half I am down to one small scabby place on my leg, my fingers do not hurt. I have all my fingernails and they look almost normal. Enbrel is a wonder drug.

ALONE!; without having to hold my urine 10 hours at a time at work. Cut my own food, without pretending that I want my husband's dish so he could secretly cut my food at public resturant's. I am actually enjoying my life, Iam not sitting on the sidelines; now I join in! To whom ever created this.... THANKYOU!  I know this drug can't repair my damaged joint's, but I noticed a change.... less swelling, tenderness and weakness.And yes ; the treatment for me... out weigh's the risk's.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	5/1/2008 10:56:22 PM	It took a little more then 2 months for Enbrel to work. At first it wasn't great but certainly lessened the pain. Now I rarely am in great pain.However I am currently having skin eruptions. They started with what I thought was a pimple on my chin that just would go away. I then started getting these in various places all over my body. Today I have them on my face, buttocks, back, upper arm and upper legs. The worst is my face and back. Mostly the right side of my body. That may be nothing.I have also gain some weight. Not sure if this is the medication or simply I haven't been as active because of the pain.I will continue to use Enbrel because it certainly has elevated my pain. 15 months ago I couldn't drive. Most days are good ones these days and I am beginning to enjoy life again.Granted there are things I still cannot do (such as bowling, push ups, weight lifts, my wrists just cant take weight) or I must do them differently but that is the price I am willing to pay to no longer be in pain.

It was really my wonder drug, after a few weeks of the injections, I was feeling much better. And even now it continues to work. I'm very pleased.The only downside if the injection site is sore for a day, but can be helped with an ice pack every now and then.

A little paranoia. I too got very red after a painful injection. Besides keeping the med out of the fridge for abount an hour, if you prefreeze the injection site with an ice pack for a few minutes before it is actually quite painless. Hope this helps.

Let the drug warm a bit before injection and inject slowly, this will reduce the &quot;burn&quot;. I think I have tried every drug and treatment that existed for the past 23 years without much succes until Enbrel. It truly is a miracle drug for me.

After 8 months of using Enbrel, it stopped working for me.  My doctor is now going to try me on methotrexate injections and Humira.  I hope it works, because my RA is spreading to joints never before.

I have been on other treatments with little change but when my doctor started me on Enbrel my life changed. It truly is a wonder drug.

Enbrel saved my life!!!  After 3weeks I was a new woman. Been on it for two yrs. Almost no pain with RA, knees and elbows will bend again!  I can sleep at night. Shot burns and injection sight is red for a few days.  So very worth it.  Cost is out of reach for so many who could have unbelievable lives with its use. dselliott in NC

Now after 6 months, I am totally at ease.  The effect of this medication qlong with methotrexate has been amazing.  After so many years of chronic pain everywhere in my body, this medication has renewed my spirit to face each day with courage, hope, and thanksgiving.

Had to go off of Enbrel for by-pass surgery. Pain returned after 2 months off Enbrel. Start taking the medication again and was totally without pain within 2-3 weeks. Seems like a miracle drug. I take it together with methotrexate once a week. I prefer the needle injections over the sure-click. I was frightened of needles but now I'm an old pro (and without joint pain)!

For the past 15 years I've had to sleep on my side. With this I'm finally able to move around and my back has started to straighten out and I'm actually a little taller than when I started.  The freedom that this has given me has been nothing short of amazing.  I'm also rather afraid of needles to doing this myself has helped me overcome this phobia too!

It is used in conjunction with Methatraxate.  She has to also take Folic Acid supplements.  Before starting the Enbrel, we struggled to control the inflammation, pain and fevers.  She has not had a bad flare since using enbrel.  She used to be very afraid of needles so it was hard to give her the med at first, but she has outgrown the fear.

However it has not completely stopped the progession of my disease.  The autoinjector system makes giving yourself medicine as easy as possible, since this medicine does have definite burn effect going in.
