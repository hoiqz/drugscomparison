At first it wasn't horrible but felt worse as the week went on. Still waiting on intended results hoping it hasn't created another infection? Did find that citrus ( orange,lemon) removes the taste problems though!!

Multiple Sclerosis	357sig, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Male	35-44	6/29/2011 9:36:12 AM	Told Docs at hosp that if they had to give me any drug that stimulates my adrenal glands, they would need to strap me down and knock me out. One day they might listen to me. 1.5 hrs after starting IV drip, I went bezerk. Sweating,rage, headache,muscle pain, got so upset I walked out of the hosp. and put my fist in a metal stop sign which tore it off it's metal pole. like taking a shot of pure speed. Hosp security brought me the sign as a momento! When will they ever learn that we know our bodies better then they and that every person is diffirent.   
Multiple Sclerosis	kat, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	25-34	6/27/2011 10:59:19 AM	I did the first run pre-diagnosis. I was losing my vision at an alarming rate. I did my first day and then went out with my mom. I was actually scared when someone showed up in my periphial vision because it had been months. I was overjoyed with the results and I am no looking forward to my next run this week for my left side weakness and vision problems because I know it will help. Side effects are bearable. I was super hyper but, my neuro offset that with Xanax, which really helped. The only unexpected was that I had to remove the IV myself. I have a friend who is an EMT so he did it for me, but I would have freaked out if I had to do it myself!

This drug caused him to be combative, unreasonable, argumentative, someetimes staring into space and cannot hear what is being said to him. Recently, I asked the doctor to take him off prednizone which has some horrible side effects and the dr. put him on this solu medrol which is worse thn anything I have ever witnessed. I feel as if I should report the doctor due to giving my husband bad and dangerous drugs.

I have had everything from weak legs to dizziness to optic neuritis and it always clears things up withing a day or so to a week.  Warn your friends about mood swings and stay positive :)

Typical side effects.  Bad taste, increased anxiety, some insomnia.   Results - walking ability greatly improved, pain diminished.  Other MS symptoms diminished (I have a lot of the symptoms).  Overall I hate IV but I do this because the results are so substantial for me.  It has been the only real relief I get.  Prednizone (sp) also gave some relief to symptoms but quickly diminished within a day of last oral med dosage.

Chemo ceased, also ceased to control RA. Began MTX (no more TNF drugs for me!!!) and after 5 weekly shots still had no symptom control -- rheumatologist prescribed 2 days of (I believe 100 units)solu-medrol infusion and I got nasty urtecaria during infusion. Given benadryl, zyrtec and zantac and control achieved, almost normal 5 hours later. I am researching online &amp; almost all sites say anaphylaxis and urtecaria are uncommon but known reactions. Dr. does not believe solu-medrol was cause. I disagree!

It stabilized my condition enough to return to work after an eight month absence. I continue treatment by 1g IV at six week intervals. Side effects are manageable. Diagnosis was July 2008 and treatment via IVIG was without success. Solu-Medrol began September 2008 and continues.

Does leave a bad taste in your mouth and I have swollen all over and I have some stomach trouble because of the treatment, but the side effects aren't near as bad as not being able to walk or move. Would do it again when needed.

Other	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	19-24	2/4/2009 8:51:17 AM	This drug did not work for me at all. 5 minutes after I received it through IV my entire body went stiff followed by muscle spasms that lasted over 2 hours and took over an hour to correct with additional drugs! Needless to say the next day I woke up feeling like I'd run a marathon-my muscles were so sore from the contractions that the medicine caused. After all this the DR informed me that solumedrol has many side effects and I was probably allergic. Be careful!
