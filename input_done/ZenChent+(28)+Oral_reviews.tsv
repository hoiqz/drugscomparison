Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	9/25/2012 11:43:11 AM	The first month was nothing short of annoying: nausea mostly, bad acne.  The first period was fairly light; however, I did get bad cramps (sadly, this is typical for me).  Oddly enough, the second month seems much better!  Acne has incredibly subsided, and no nausea!  I switched from Loestrin 24 FE (after being on it for about 4 yrs); and my sex drive has increased... thank God!!  We have Express Scripts for our prescription drug coverage... umm, $20ish for 3 months?! HOLLA!  Way better than the $150 for 3 months I was paying for Loestrin.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	7/28/2012 2:07:16 AM	I just started this pill three months ago and already having problems! I've already missed a period (NOT PREGRANT...NOT POSSIBLE!!) plus what periods I've had have been terrible. I'm also having killer headaches that have started out of the blue. I thought about atopping pill!!
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	5/31/2012 7:32:20 PM	I thought I was crazy at first but according to these reviews, I'm not alone... vaginal irritation, weight gain, mood swings, missed periods... I have all those.  
Absence of Menstrual Periods	AM, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	5/29/2012 3:12:09 PM	I was put on Zenchent in April of 2011 because I was having a period every 2-4 months for about 2 years and was told by going on bith control that I would have a period every month. After 2 1/2 weeks of my first pack I was having severe chest pains on the right side of my body. Went to the hospital and I developed several blood clots and was in the hospital for a week because of this birth control. I am still on blood thinners until this day and stuck with a hospital bill over 10,000. This birth control almost killed me and I would NEVER suggest this for anyone.
Birth Control	Liz, 19-24 Female 	2	1	1	Female	19-24	5/2/2012 6:12:13 PM	Worst experience ever. Missing periods, others than last for more than a week and really bad side effects . Do not recommend this to anybody 
Birth Control	daisy2318, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	2/2/2012 1:50:37 PM	I have used Zenchent since having my last child 3 1/2 years ago, mostly without problems (or so I thought, before reading all these reviews!).  A few months ago I started skipping periods like crazy, which had only happened a couple of times before.  I skipped one, had a normal 4 days of bleeding, skipped 2, then had a normal 4 days of bleeding last cycle, and now this current cycle I've been bleeding heavily for 9 days, passing clots, all kinds of no fun with no sign of letting up.  I've also experienced almost-daily headaches the last few years...wondering now if its related to the medicine?  In any case, I'm on my last pack before having to refill my prescription, and I think I'm going to just go off it for a while and see what happens.  Hubby is leaving for 6 months for Army training anyway, so its a good time to try it.  
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	Steph411, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	2/1/2012 10:58:34 AM	I too, have been on this med for 2 months now, and have no other side effect than other BC pills. My Dr switched me FROM BeYaz because of the higher stroke risk warnings about it. That was working fine for me too, but my Dr didn't think it was worth the risk.First month, I was a little more emotional (but nothing severe) and a little bit the 2nd month too, but not as bad. I hope everyone realizes that you should give new BC pills 3 months to even out in your body before making a decision (unless you have a severe reaction obviously!)  I'm hoping this med ends up working for me in the long run, as I have PCOS &amp; have to be on something in order to have regular cycles. Bonus that this med is cheap too.. was a hassle at times when I was unemployed, and the BeYaz was so expensive, as it's a name brand.Anyway.. hoping this med works for me in the long run, and so far, it has with no major issues. Every woman is different, so just try them, and if they don't work for you, there are a ton more out there for you to try!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/31/2012 2:34:27 PM	I felt the need to review after reading all of the negative reviews on here.  I've been using Zenchent for many years (Ovcon 35 before that), and have had no problems.  Average period of 4-5 days, little to no cramps, and no weight gain.  I'm not sure why other people are having such issues, but it's been working great for me!
Birth Control	Girlygirl23, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	11/23/2011 1:30:05 AM	I started taking this pill in April 2011 and I had a horrible experience with it. Everything was fine for the first few months but after 8 months of continued use, my acne became increasingly worse, my mood swings were HORRIBLE, and sometimes I would get my period and other times I would not. I constantly felt stressed/depressed and frequently cried for no reason. This drug almost ruined my relationship with my longtime boufriend!! However, different pills work differently on different women so I would encourage trying the pill to see if it works for you. My experience with this pill was not pleasant though! Just be aware of yourself-- I suggest keeping a short diary about how you feel each day (start this before you start the pill). This allowed me to easily see if there was a pattern to my mood swings/breakouts and if this was really because of the pill or if it was just stress. I hope this helps!! 
Birth Control	Jade, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	11/8/2011 9:00:43 PM	I went to my doctor for birth control, no issues with having my cycle regularly.  I started Zenchent on the 1st day of my cycle and have been bleeding now for almost 2 weeks.  I've had birth control before and this one I have to say is not effective.  I have cramps, clots, mood swings and bloating.  I would not recommend this pill and will stick with the brand birth control pills in the future.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	PoloNjAGER, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	10/14/2011 11:44:54 AM	I skipped my period in June then got it on August 18th &amp; it didn't stop until October 2nd. I had to wear the biggest pad &amp; tampon I could find because it was so heavy &amp; it was full of tissue &amp; clots. I went to my OBGYN &amp; she sent me to go get blood transfusions because my hemoglobin dropped to 5.9 &amp; she put me on Provera. The Provera stopped the bleeding but it came back a few days later w/ cramping. So now she has me on Zenchent. The 1st nite I took it I started feeling real sick to my stomach. The whole next day at work I felt like I was gonna throw up. I have no apetite but I'm forcing myself to eat because my stomach hurts so bad. I'm really dizzy &amp; light headed &amp; my eyes seem to be doing this crazy jumping act which makes it hard to see. I am not enjoying being on this medication &amp; I'm still bleeding on top of that
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	8/6/2011 3:37:00 AM	My body is very sensitive to b.c. pills and this one has had the least hormone fluctuations (mood swings)...although, my periods are longer than normal and cramping intensity varies on my diet (salt intake)...I experience breast tenderness which scares me into thinking I'm pregnant since that is also a pregnant side effect but I like the fact that it enhances my size since I'm small in the chest lol...overall this one works well for me but everyone's body responds differently to different pills...what works for one, may respond adversely to someone else. Best to tell your doctor all symptoms or side effects with each pill... I also kept track of the hormones that were in the pills that did not work and keep track of the mg of that hormone...  Usually the less fluctuation in colored pills (which is change in hormone) has less hormone variations.. 
Birth Control	jourdinsmommie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	5/31/2011 9:22:39 AM	I have never in my life experience anything like this.  I have not had a cycle since the end of April.  My ankles are swollen beyond belief, migraines, which I never get headaches, nausea, and high blood pressure,hot flashes and cold sweats.  Discontinued meds and hopefully this review helps someone else, because I thought I was losing my mind.

Absence of Menstrual Periods	revebaby, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/13/2010 4:26:07 AM	I was having irregular periods as well as bad acne.  I am 23 and well past the skin problem stage.  I also had a lot of PMS symptoms the week before and the day of my period.  I have been on this BC for a little over a month now and for the first time my period came when it is supposed to. I am not having the breakthrough bleedin I was with the other BC's I tried.  My breasts have increased in size :) and my mood swings are gone.  Love it. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Michelle1966, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	7/20/2010 3:53:34 AM	I was given Zenchent 28's for a large ovarian cyst and heavy painful periods. I'm 44 and a non-smoker. The only problem I have is headaches and stomach upset at start or end of a new pack of pills and during my period which is now what I call &quot;normal&quot;. It is nothing compared to to the pain and heavy bleeding I was having before taking the pills. I am going into my 4th month of taking this drug and will have my 2nd pelvic ultrasound next month to see the progress I have of shrinking the cyst on my ovary. HOpefully it's working and I won't have to have any surgery. Before taking this pill my periods kept me at home and I was having &quot;accidents&quot; all the time due to a lot of large and painful clots. I no longer have this problem. I haven't seemed to have any of the side effects mentioned in the pamplet I received with my pack of pills other than headaches. I'm very pleased to have gotten some relief taking this drug! =)
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/1/2010 10:38:30 PM	I started getting my period for 2 weeks, every 2 weeks in october. I thought it was just stress so i just delt with it. I finally gave up in dec cause i was getting sicker and weaker and went to see the doc in feb who put me on trinessa. I bled for 3 weeks in feb. She switched me to ortha evra in march which depressed me and i bled alot too. I went to see a OBGYN in april and found out i have a fibroid tumor in my uterus that is 7cm. He put my on Zenchent to control the bleeding and try to shrink the tumor before surgery is an option. SO FAR this BC has done wonders for me. I bled for about 5 days in may which was very light and for june it was only 5-6. The only thing i dont like is the cramping and discomfort but i think that is the tumor rearing its ugly head. I finally found a BC that works for me 
Endometriosis	Pleasehelp, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	6/20/2010 4:56:26 PM	hi there, i just switch to this prescription from the Lupon Depot.. this medication helped me a lot, i didn't have my period for the whole time i was in treatment and pain free. then when i switch to ZenChet the bleeding got worse, i have been in my period for about 3 month now, a lot of blood clotts that i'm getting, spotting, it's just non stop. that is the only problem i have at the moment. well my appetite changed too i eat more now that before. i have been thinking about stopping using it, isn't the point is to keep blood flow in control? you don't need to be bleeding every day if you have endometriosis. i wonder&gt;&gt;...

Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	lisa0208, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	3/31/2010 7:57:18 AM	I personally liked this pill...made my periods predictable, lighter, and minimal cramps.  I also did not gain any weight on this pill and had no weird mood swings or depression.  I was on this pill for 5yrs..after about 2 years of being on this pill, i noticed my libido pretty much disappeared...and after about 4 yrs, my blood pressure rose to 174/110!  Gyno thinks it is due to this pill so he pulled me off until BP is under control.  Other than the high bp, and loss of libido, this pill worked well for me considering that prior i suffered with CONTINUAL irregular bleeding due to PCOS
Endometriosis	mandijo1127, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	2/27/2010 1:54:12 AM	I have been on Zenchent for about six months; my periods were out of whack for a few months but that was expected.  The only major problem I have had is that it makes my hair fall out! I just run my fingers through my hair and get quite a handful...it falls out EVERYWHERE. Does this happen to anyone else?
Endometriosis	EndoSufferer, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	1/11/2010 10:01:35 AM	I switched to this when they discontinued Necon 1/50. At first I had breakthrough bleeding, but it went away after a month.  I have more energy than when I took Ovcon-50 and I am less depressed. I am also pain-free again like I was when I was taking Necon. I feel like I am back to my old self. :)
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	12/13/2009 6:47:26 PM	I've tried 3 different birth controls including this one;  Seasonique, Yaz, and now- Zenchent (4.5 months so far). And in all honesty this has been by far the worst experience I've had. During the 3 weeks that I take the active pills, I'm bleeding non-stop, and heavily. With every symptom of PMS imaginable, including cramps that are worse than when I'm not on BC. And during the one week of the inactive pills, I have no bleeding. Not to mention my appetite is through the roof, and I can't go a day without a headache. 
Absence of Menstrual Periods	BarnMom, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	10/10/2009 11:00:56 AM	This drug was substitued by my mail order pharmacy.  I had constant headaches, weight gain, and my blood pressure (normally 90/70) went to 129/85.  Once I figured out what was happening, I consulted my Gyn who took me off this immediately.  I've used the Pill for 14 years and have never had side effects like this.

Birth Control	KristySchulz, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	9/29/2009 11:57:16 PM	This is the worst birth-control experience of my life!!!!!! About a month ago I had such a severe migraine I was vomiting and it hurt just SO bad the tears were just rolling... And I am on my third pack of this medication and I have been having severe nausea for about a week and a half now I am going back to my midwife and getting on Mirena because this pill is not worth all the side effects.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	19-24	8/16/2009 1:54:19 AM	I was prescribed Zenchent because of long periods, I also have implanon. I have had many side effects because of this medicine. Lots of Nausea, cramping, backache, breast tenderness. moodswings, hot/cold flashes. This medicine has also cause weight gain of 10lbs...retention of water. Basically causes pms symptoms worse then I normally had before. 
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/11/2009 8:53:29 PM	This birth control pill has been fabulous for me. It's easy to maintain my weight, no periods to speak of, no PMS symptoms. I took Ovcon until this generic version came on the market. I was a little skeptical that it would work as well as Ovcon, but I've been delighted with the switch. The only trouble I had was when I was taking the pill with a glass of grapefruit juice. That made my hormone levels out of whack - weight gain, retaining water, weird moods - until I discontinued the grapefruit juice. Back to normal again. Yay! 
Endometriosis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	1/12/2009 11:41:53 AM	This medication has caused acne and increased appetite. Not worth it at all.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	7/7/2008 5:12:24 AM	I started ZenChent about 2 weeks ago and I felt nauseaus every day. I also got the worst migraine of my life which was the last straw with this medicine. I've stopped taking it. It's not worth the rollercoaster it put me on.
Birth Control	19-24 Female 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	2/20/2008 10:19:46 AM	While using ZenChent I have experienced long 9-12 day peiords, vaginal irritation, frequent headaches, cramps, and weight gain.

Using ZenChent has been wonderful. My periods are predictible and very light. I have no cramps like I used to, and have not had any side effects.
