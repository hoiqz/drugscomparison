High Blood Pressure	Amanda, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/9/2012 4:19:05 PM	I was put on Tiazac for high blood pressure and a hyper left ventricle.  Tiazac has worked immensely in lowering my heart rate.  It use to be 150 beats per minute now it is 80 -100 beat per minute which is normal.  I am studying to be an LPN so I want my heart to be in good condition and last a good many years!

High Blood Pressure	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	2/12/2008 7:57:13 PM	I had slight ankle swelling but excellent results. It slowed my heart rate down too low. After about 8 yrs., I just quit taking it as it would not let my heart rate go up during exercise. Probably a stupid thing to do but my pressure has not gone up after two weeks without it. Heart rate has increased to normal levels.
