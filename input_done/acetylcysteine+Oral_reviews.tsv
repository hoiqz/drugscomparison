As always, it settled in my lungs and I coughed for weeks.  Finally, in Italy, I went into a pharmacy and described my condition to the pharmacist.  He gave me a package of something called Sobrepin (dosage unknown) which is acetylcysteine. Within three days, the cough was GONE.It's a pity one cannot buy Sobrepin in the U.S.  I have just purchased a form of acetylcysteine called NAC, over the counter, and hopefully it will work as well.

Fortunately, a good friend who is a physician gave this to me.  It works much better than Mucinex or any cough medicine w/ guiaifenesin.  I am upset because I cannot get it in the U.S.

When occasional courses of 600mg daily are taken (max 7 days) my breathing becomes much easier and mucus is coughed up more easily
