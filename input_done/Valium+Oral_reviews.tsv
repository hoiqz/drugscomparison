I find it is the ONLY way I can go out in public and function anywhere close to normal.  Just yesterday I forgot to take it before church and had to go back home and get my pill in order to be able to handle the large number of people.  I love this medication because I can do things now that I couldn't for many, many years.
Muscle Spasm	BR549, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	5/10/2012 6:13:27 AM	From 1995 to present, I have had 11 spine surgeries, 4 in the low back and 7 in the cervical and thoracic area.  While the pain meds helped, I started having the worse spasms and the muscles in my neck and upper half of the large muscles would literally lockup and cause more pain then I can express. I started out taking Flexeril, Scalaxin, Soma and many others to no avail.  Around 2005, my Doctor switched to 10 mg. Valium 3 times a day, but I usually break them in half when I start to feel the muscles starting to get tight or spasms during day time, and a whole one at bedtime. Tho the spasms are there daily, had it not been for Valium, I dont know what I would have done. It has truly been a godsend for me personally. The only downside is, if I have to drive myself somewhere, I wont take it the night before as I dont want to not be at my full facultys while driving, but its a tradeoff I accept as I have been totally disabled for about 5 years now. My spouse does 90% of the driving, with me doing about 10%. The reason for this is I know of 2 people that were arrested for driving under the influence while taking this med. I also have first hand knowledge as one of them was a friend I had been warning for years not to take it and drive. So just be very careful and use common sense while taking a 10 mg. Valium and thinking you can drive safely without having an accident that may be minor to major in nature.

I suffer from anxiety disorder and occasional panic attack (when anxiety is very high for prolonged periods of time).  Clonazepam turns me into a zombie (good for periods of insomnia though) alprazolam causes me much amnesia and just seems too strong, and lorazepam and Serax just don't last very long requiring multiple doses each day.  I occasionally have my doc switch me around but I always come back to good old Valium.  It just seems to have the best combination of therapeutic action for anxiety and, at 5mg doses, does not turn me into a non functioning zombie or make me sleepy.  Proper use of diazepam has absolutely improved my life overall.  I've been taking 5-10mg a day, a low dose, for 2 years now and would hate to have to give it up.  It is also very non-addictive, and when used appropriately does not have an significant withdrawal symptoms.  For anyone suffering from moderate to severe anxiety, or panic attacks, ask your doctor to let you try simply 5mg of Valium taken in the evening.  Greetings and cheers from a fellow worrywart lol.

I have taken Xanax and every other pill under the sun to help me with severe anxiety, social anxiety etc...After just a few weeks I was actually able to be in a crowd of people and eat at any restaurant. I also have no side effects from this pill. I'm a pretty big guy and take 2-10 mg pills before I go out. Valium is definitely the best I ever had to help me.

I guess it would depend on how many someone is on a day to judge the length of time it would take to clear the system. I found Valium to be one of the most addictive drugs I have ever taken and I would never advise anyone to take it if they have never done so. I believe exercise and proper diet can help sometimes rather than drugs. I would suggest something NOT addictive like this drug if nothing else.

It allows me to unwind and relax and stops my mind from racing and wandering.  Have taken for 2 yrs now with no side effects.  It is also easy to stop taking (no withdrawal) but it stays in your system (and is detectable in urine) for a good 3 weeks.  The only caveat is that if you abuse it (take too much) it will lead to depression, so stick to the lowest dose that works.  It is also good for occasional insomnia at higher doses (10-15mg) but stops working for that after only a couple days of use.  Summary: an effective old school 'chill pill' that is safe and easy to use.  P.s. I have used Klonipim and Xanax before and actually prefer the Valium because it lasts longer and doesn't make me tired at the usual 5mg dose.  Cheers!

However about 3 months ago, I seemed to start up an immunity to it. Which can happen with this type of drug. I talked to my Dr. she now put me on something totally different and is slowly weening me off the Valium.

At age 22, my doctor put me on Xanax 1mg TID for GAD &amp; panic. It worked, sure- but I felt like I was always having to watch the clock to make sure I took my next dose before the previous one wore off. It got to the point where I would wake up to a panic attack, as the Xanax had worn off. I'm 35 now, and about six months ago, I mentioned trying a longer acting medication Valium to my new doctor- who thought it was a good idea, particularly since I needed a good muscle relaxer as well.  I'm currently prescribed Valium 10mg TID (PRN) - and could not be happier. It's such a relief to be able to take one tablet in the morning and be &quot;cool as the flip side of the pillow&quot; for the rest of the day. :)  I've seen a few of you mention this and I have also found it to be true- when using the generic (diazepam) - well... not all generics are equal, especially with this drug.  I've tried 4-5 different brands and Watson is the best.  Mylan is probably the worst.  So, just make sure you check for the generic manufacturer when you call around to the pharmacies.  Best of luck!

At first I wasn't sure why but when my Gramother's cancer took a turn for the worse i figured it out. After she passed my sleeping habits got worse and the toll of her death really hit me hard. Everything triggered a memory and I would start crying. My Dr. prescribed this for me for both my sleeping problem and taking the edge off when I thought of her. My Dr. prescirbed 2mg 1-2 tabs 4 times a day. I take 2 at bedtime, 1 in the moring, and normally 2 throughout the day. I sleep like a baby now and I'm not crying all day either. I was kinda scared at first to take it because, as a pharmacy tech, I know the bad things that can happen if you abuse it. This is a great medicine and it can be used for so many different conditions.

This is my 6th medication and it works. It gets me to sleep but doesn't keep me asleep.  The doctor increased my dosage in hopes of keeping to sleep.  I do stay asleep 2 more hours which gives me a total of 6 hours.  That's all I need to function. It also stops my violent nightmares so I'm pretty happy.  Been taking for 1 month. I have a high tolerance for medication so the mg's that I'm on will only last for awhile before it will stop working.

I was on it for only 4 days out of those 4 days I was barely awake long enough to take the next round of pills. i even tried cutting the pills in half after the 2nd day with no change. just knocked me out. I'm also on a heavy dose of hydrocodone. I think I might have to try a larger dose of baclofen. I spent enough time in a drug induced coma last summer getting tired of it.

Muscle Spasm	robine, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/19/2011 4:36:50 PM	I have pudendal neuralgia,a rare and little known disease of nerves in my back that affect my pelvic floor and whole region in the area. I cannot sit or lay down without Severe Chronic Pain. I was FINALLY diagnosed with it this last summer after having it for 11 years. It was caused by a bladder sling put in too tight. I finally got a 2nd opinion and had a doctor try to loosen the sling but it was too late and he knew I had nerve damage just not a name for it at that time. I have to urinate or feel like it constantly and cannot sit without STRONG pain pills and special seating for a SHORT amount of time. It got so bad I could only sleep 1-2 hrs at a time at night for the last 11 years. I would get up in pain, often eat, take meds and finally get back to sleep for 1-2 hrs and then it would happen all over again. Since taking Valium before I go to bed I have slept 5-6 hours at a time, a GOD SEND for me. It relaxes my pelvic muscles enough that I can sleep. I am SO glad it works and hope it works for a long time. I finally got my strong pain meds changed after 11 years because I had built up a tolerance, took them exactly as directed but until the 2nd or 3rd of the day I could not do anything! I was on Lortab 10mg for 11 years and am now on Percocet 7.5 which now brings me the relief the Lortab did YEARS ago. And that relief never takes all the pain away-just the edge off so I can function in short periods of time. I have never felt &quot;high&quot; from my pain meds, people in Chronic pain are just trying to get to a more normal existence. I took all test for Pudendal Neuralgia including nerve injections last summer which deadened the nerve for a few hours, trigger point injections etc. So all that diagnosed me with a specialist. There are only 3 surgeons in the U.S. who do a pudendal nerve release operation-there is a 60% chance of recovery and it can take 2-2 1/2 years to see IF it works. I have not opted for that yet!

Anxious	LadyOwl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/8/2011 1:16:25 PM	Valium, aka &quot;Mommy's lil' helpers&quot; had been a godsend for me.   I'd been taking it, 10mg tabs, 3x a day, #90/month for 10 years. Now THAT is a miracle as it is. On top of opiate pain meds for chronic back pain as well! All depends on the doctor. Some won't even R/x you an aspirin. Well, anyway, since it's so broad, it helped my muscle spasms, GAD, (General Anxiety Disorder) insomnia, migriaines, tension, PTSD, etc. So, that's the good thing about it. Bad thing is that after so long, like all the benzodiazapines, you get tolerant to it, and you can take half the bottle, and it doesn't phase you. *NO, I do NOT recommend that, lol)* But doc told me after 10+ years (Never asked for an increase in dose ever), the half life is very long, about 3 days. So even though you don't feel it, it's still in your system. So if you pop a Vicodin or something, chances are you're gonna wind up on the floor. That's the downside.So, as I'm on Methadone 10mg. for chronic back pain, sciatica, Lortab 10mg. for breakthrough pain, (close your mouth, you'll catch a fly), he's decided to cut the Valium, and switch me back to Ativan 1mg. Fine by me, works great, and don't have to worry Doc about the half life. Methadone has a VERY long half life, so I was dancing with death the whole time, and didn't realize it! So, it may be great, but it's a good idea to keep check on your dosage, especially if you're taking opiate painkillers, etc...

Muscle Spasm	none, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/11/2011 11:45:37 PM	I started taking this Rx. Diazepam 10mg as needed for Muscle Spasm Pain since 2000 and it has been the only Muscle Relaxant I found to be the most effective. It does'nt knock me out, I take 10mg once in a day as needed because I also found that Valium does work best when taken as needed, it does'nt give me drug hangovers, no tolerance increases or withdrawls, and it does'nt mess with my head like what most Muscle Relaxants do. If used right on a as needed only basis you can safely use this Rx. drug for long term uses without too many issues.

Anxious	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	45-54	1/8/2010 1:58:33 PM	I've had 2 separate periods of diazepam use. The first was from 1982-99 for generalized anxiety and Meniere's Disease.  It worked very well for both.  However, I am also a recovering alcoholic who has to be careful with drugs like this and when I got sober in 1999, I quit using valium.  Then this past May (2009), I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and my anxiety (and some Meniere's symptoms like vertigo, etc.)came back roaring. I had shortness of breath and a tremendously amplified startle reflex. So, I asked my GP to put me back on low levels of valium, which he did. He also put me on Ambien. My cancer surgery in July was successful and by October, I felt ready to come off both valium and ambien. But my addictive brain (remember, I'm a recovering drunk) wasn't as ready and I was unsuccessful in my own attempt to taper off either drug.  So, I went to the p-doc at the local rehab center and she put me on Remeron and told me to try and get off the ambien first and we'd worry about the valium later.  So, now about 10 weeks later, I'm off ambien completely and am being maintained on 15mg. remeron and 3mg valium a day. This is a sub-clinical valium dose, but it still helps. We're going to stay here for the next 5 months or so and then, if the Remeron continues to work for me, taper the valium until I'm off it.  Valium has historically been the only drug that has ever given me relief from my anxiety and I've been through a bushel basket of others from Buspar to Luvox to Lexapro. But because of my addictive personality, I need to be off it eventually.And that's OK so long as the Remeron keeps working.  So, with some reservations, I'd recommend short-course valium therapy to anybody with severe situational anxiety.  It works.  Watch it though and don't stay on it too long.  It makes all the sharp corners of the world round and while that is a nice feeling, it isn't the way the world really is. Be cautious with this drug, especially if you are prone to addiction.

The times without it, I tried every alternative treatment. And many psychiatrists plus psychologists and social workers. Bottom line, my life is normal when I have it. I am a basket case without it.  I have gone as much as 2 years off it, and those 2 years were hell for me.  I was given every anti-drepressant on the market but none of them took care of my anxiety and I have never had a problem with depression. Some doctors tried them to get me off valium, but they did not work on me. If I were 25, I wouldn't start it again because I know it's addictive, I read things. But at 66, I don't want to live without it after all this time.

Panic Disorder	ace22, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/11/2009 5:10:34 PM	When I had insurance I was getting the brand name Valium. I have been taking this drug for many years for Muscle Spasm and anxiety attacks, panic disorders. I cannot take SSI uptakes, Like Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft or anything along that line of medications. I need to be calm.  Now that I do not have insurance, I am taking the generic &quot;diazapam&quot; and it seems to me it is weaker or they have left out the main ingredient, I do not like generics but they are less expensive.  I have been told by Roche they are the same. I strongly disagree. If I could afford the name brand, I sure would change back. Valium is much different than the generic, but most disagree. That is why the name brand is so expensive.  Anyone else notice this?

I tried to get off of it three times and could not do it. After three attempts totaling one year of withdrawal symptoms I lost total control. Mydoctor suggest a low dose of diazepam. This medication has given me my life back. No more panic attacks and I do not find this medication to nearly as potent and addictive as Klonopin.

Doctor said I could take this the rest of my life without fear but try after a while to not use and see if my problem comes back.

Also w/taking the edge off of the aggrivation associated w/the limitations of my illness and sometimes anxiety about my limitations.

I actually feel as if I am dreaming.  The spasms were taking over my life.  Tripping and falling is very embarrassing at 32 years old.  This is a godsend and I have no clue why my doctor didn't prescribe this before.  It took and ER doctor on Sunday to suggest it and I brought it to my PCP's attention.  Thank you Valium!

Sleep Disturbance with Extreme Anxiety	minnie2007, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/2/2008 11:28:51 PM	Three yrs ago, my Dr lost his license to practice medicine, since he could no longer treat his patients, I was pretty much &quot;cut off&quot; of Xanax after taking it for 4 yrs nightly (30mg @ bed...0 in the day). I was originally prescribed this because of several reasons; TMJ, PTSD, &amp; insomnia. The 2nd night off of the med was when the withdrawl took effect. Over the course of the next 2wks, I felt near death, it was VERY scary. My blodd pressure soared to 158/128, had blurry vision al day, could not sleep for more that 45 mins @ at a time, sick to stomach, trembles, &amp; basicall just felt like dying. While waiting to be seen for a new Dr, a family member provided me with Valium. I found it to be less &quot;harse&quot; with the same effcts,&amp; if a miss a night or two, I don't feel much different. My new Dr gives me Ambien 10mg..it works O.K. for about 2 hrs then I wake up @ least 4 other times for a minute or two, just to toss &amp; turn. To sum up my experience w/Xanax, Valium, &amp; Ambien...Xanax is great if you have it but dangerous if you do not. Ambien wks just not long enough. Valium is the best by far. Relief without anyside effects.One other ??..My husband wks Mids (has for 6 yrs.)He never sleeps over 4-5 hrs a day. I realize mids are vey difficult to the normal wk

Anxity resulting from the discovery of a serious medical condition has made this period a living Hell. One Valium 5 at bedtime has done wonders for me! Does anyone else experience extreme dry mouth from this med? 
Muscle Spasm	cm, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	6/12/2008 9:11:10 PM	it helps block some spasms and help keep the pain down some but not all the time
Panic Disorder	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	35-44	6/4/2008 9:22:12 AM	I take 30 mg of Valium each day in conjunction with Paxil CR for panic disorder.  I haven't had a panic attack for 2 years.  My only qualm is that I am physically dependent on the benzodiazepine, but I don't experience withdrawal symptoms if I miss a dose because of the long half-life.  I started out on Xanax back in the 1990s, and it had the opposite effect.  I asked my PCP if I could switch from 4 mg Xanax to 40 mg Valium each day.  He said okay.  Unfortunately, Xanax and Valium are not pharmacologic substitutes.  Forty-eight hours later, I developed seizures.  It was the scariest experience of my life.

I was on Flexeril 10mg and Xanax 0.50mg, prior to this new program.  But not sure if I should go back to tell the Doctor that I have to take at least 3 tablets of valium, at a time. Again it is only 2mg.  What should I do...????
Panic Disorder	encodetry, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	5/8/2008 4:42:26 AM	Took 30 mg a day for thirty years and helped me cope with work and raising a large family.About ten years ago I stopped taking Valium and for a while smoked Cannibas.I still use Valium for stress and find that a 5 mg tablet is sufficient to take the edge off. I also use Valium to help me detox after I have had a bout of alcohol binge.My sress and anxiety was greatly helped by self hypnosis and meditation. Self help tapes and guided visualisation did wonders for me

Anxious	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	2/27/2008 12:28:03 AM	I take 5 mg as needed for anxiety, and have found the drug very helpful for this purpose. I have found it difficult, however, to resist taking it more than recommended by my doctor because it makes me feel so much more relaxed, so if you have an addictive personality this is probably not a good choice for you.

I have a harder time remembering names, situations, etc.I've also found that I sometimes have a problem with my line of thought - I'll forget what my main point was.I take 2.5 mg per day.  It has helped me a great deal with dealing with daily stresses, especially at work.  I'm much more relaxed.

Anxious	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	11/27/2007 8:42:36 AM	Valium is a godsend!!!! I have taken it exactly 5mg for 23 years for anxiety. The only stop was 5 years in psychoanalysis when the doctor claimed &quot;the therapeutic effect&quot; would be lost if on medicines !!!! Those years were COMPLETE HELL !!!! That day I stopped the psychoanalysis because (thank god!!!)the analyst should to into retirement, that day I started Valium (diazepam) 5mg/day again and IMMEDIATELY!!!!! got back to senses. How could I be so deceived by that shrink and not listen to school-medicine doctors!! Well an analysis-shrink colleague of him also having a radio show - praising the analysis - admitted in a book after his retirement that he had taken, wait ...Valium over all the years to manage his anxiety !!!!! (strong to do that) Well we know priests preaching A but doing P !!! I'm amazed when people now can report themselves, to see how great help this medicine is and how very, very few have any problems. Of course as chronic anxiety disorder is CHRONIC ... the anxiety will reappear when you stop the medication. The blood-sugar would certainly go up if stopped insulin !!!! Talk about being dependent on INSULIN.I HOPE internet medical fora can force the psychotherapeutic maffia to where it belongs. The scrapyard!!!!Regards!!

Then I become wide awake and could stay awake all night.  My dr. prescribed one half of a 2mg. Valium for me to taker at that time.  I also take a Tynenol for my aches.  I go back to sleep and awake at a normal hour.  the next day I am able to be active after a good night's sleep.

Redheadgirl please see if your anemic, it could be whats wrong. 2. Valium helps with withdrawel from prednisone and other medications that someone may be dropping off of. Also helps when swithching from one longterm medication to another.  helps only mildly with anxiety in my case.
