As for the price, buy it in Wal-Mart. It says &quot;Cimetidine&quot; on the box, 60 tablets for $4.88 ( 07/15/2011 ) There is one thing: If you start taking it, you must continue, or your dose will not work.

With the Tagamet, I get occasional heartburn and reflux, but more often than not, my symptoms happen when I over eat. If I behave with my eating, this drug works fairly well.
