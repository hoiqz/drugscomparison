I do notice a little nausea about 30 minutes after taking it, but it passes quickly. It has, however, made my appetite completely vanish. I have to really remember to eat. I was hoping it would help me sleep, but at least it takes the pain mostly away and that's great. And I can stand up and walk again and that is amazing!

I had a similar reaction to Rybix, which is also Tramadol. I am now listing Tramadol as an allergy, as I am unable to handle this medication. I do have a sensitive stomach to medications, so please be aware!
Pain	Tryforhelp, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	45-54	9/21/2011 10:48:27 PM	Chronic back pain. Physical therapy and naproxen 4 pills a day helped, but tramadol makes you forget about it. Take 50mg at 4 pm else cant sleep without klonopin. Works much better than antidepressants like the cymbalta I took and the pristiq I'm taking on mood.  Makes me feel like a normal, non-depressed person for awhile - but fear of addiction and the fact I don't want to take a pill every day to make me feel normal makes me nervous.  But for now with job depression and panic attacks, I'll take the chance for a month or two.

I continue to take it because I dont want the real-strong pain medication. I wont change unless I am given something safer than what I am taking that gets rid of the pain.

I'm on disability for an assortment of bone and muscle problems. I was at my wit's end when doctor gave me this and I was so relieved. I notice it helps my mood, which is kind of scary since I dont want to be addicted, I only take 1-2 a day so I will be okay going off of it when I decide to do so..in the colder months I may need to take more occasionally.I'm wondering if it is the cause of the hot flashes I am having now...would like to know if anyone else found this happening.

I have been on it for 7 months but it is the only thing the drs will prescribe despite the side effects.  It takes the pain from a 10 to a 7.  Considering all the side effects I have and they are magnified when there is a break in the refils and I have none, enough to send me to the ER from blacking out in my vehicle and suffering heat exhaustion.  Thank God I was in the parking lot and not driving.

I've been taking this med as needed over the past 2 months or so.  It doesn't make my headache go away, but it does lessen the intensity.  I perfer taking it over Percocet because I can still function at work with the ultracet.  This has been a great &quot;in-between&quot; med for me.  As an added bonus, it seems to help with my Fibromyalgia pain as well.

As others have stated, you do not &quot;FEEL HIGH&quot; you just know it is working. Severe arthritus, post breast cancer. Also take vicodin and temazapam along with arimedex.  Taken for 5 years, I'll deal with the sweats as I have severe hot flashes also, my Dr. regularly checks my liver, thryroid, bones (for too high calcium if cancer has spread) so I would give this a 8 as I wasn't paying attention about the nausea, now that I think about it if I am not having breakfast or a smoothie you do tend to have an upset stomach.  I am hoping after I am off arimedex in the fall, then maybe I can switch to just one pain killer instead of having a freaking PILL BOX LOL LOL Have been on the drug for a little over 5 years and until they do come up with something else, I would also rather suffer the side effects than be in constant chronic pain.

If you are taking this drug and find yourself taking more and more pills, PLEASE SWITCH TO THE VERSION WITH NO ACETAMINOPHEN (TRAMADOL) as you are destroying your liver with the acetaminophen! You *can* get off this drug -- do it by slowly tapering on a schedule. The last bit is the hardest, but you can do it! It'll be 3-4 nights of extreme discomfort at the end but then it will be over. You *can* get off this stuff; I did!The reason it is so addictive has nothing to do with its opioid effects -- it's the serotonergic/adrenergic effects that make the withdrawal such hell. I have developed a short-term regimen for people quitting this drug that uses 5HTP, dl-phenylalanine, clonazepam, and hydrocodone and have gotten 4 people completely off this drug. It can be done.

I have been on them 4 days and knee feels great.

I have been helped overall but it has not helped deep muscle pain or the pain right after my surgery.  I fractured a rib several months ago and Ultracet didn't help at all.  I took Tylenol #3 for that with great results. My shoulder surgery was over a year ago and if I overdo with my shoulder, I get pain. Ultracet does help as long as I take it in combination with Ibuprofen. Works pretty well. I also have Fibromyalgia and I am in the middle of a painful episode and had to take the Tylenol #3 for two days in a row. Today, I took the Ultracet with the ibuprofen and it has relieved the burning and aching in my right leg.  Pain is not gone but it is acceptable.Tylenol #3 does not make me drowsy and I get sure relief from it but I don't want to increase my tolerance to it or rely on it too much, so I don't take it unless nothing else works. I have had one doctor tell me that Ultracet has a bad &quot;rebound&quot; effect, as in pain being worse after taking it and then the med not relieving it. I haven't had this happen. Just in the past year or so have I become aware of how much physical pain I was dealing with on a daily basis and didn't realize it. So, if you are hurting, get some answers and don't stop til you find relief. Bother them, leave messages with their nurses, go see them and tell them what is happening. Maybe you need a specialist. Don't stop til you find help!

Anyway, I take it for three things: osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia and to keep chiari malformation headaches away.I do have to take it with food; if I take it too late at night, it sometimes keeps me awake.  I take it at least twice a day, sometimes three if the pain is more than normal.

I would go to my Drs. office barely able to move or function in my daily life. I had to keep working. He would prescribe pain med such as Vicodin, Percocet, etc. All they did was make me want to sleep. Finally I went to a rheumatologist that prescribed Ultracet. It changed my life. I am down to usually only 2 pills a day, unless I overdo and have a bad flareup. I can work, drive, and take care of my family. I did have some stomach upset in the beginning. My only complaint is that I think it is causing sweating and more severe &quot;hot flashes&quot;. If you suffer from fibro or other chronic pain this is a great drug. I don't knowthat it would be so effective on acute pain, such as surgical.

It helped the pain tremendously. I took it for about 3 years and started to have stomach pains from not always eating while taking it. Make sure that you eat. It has acetaminophen. I then asked my Dr. for just the Ultram (tramadol) and I don't have to eat with that. I don't think that it is additive, Like it has been posted. It HELPS with the pain. Why do people say thing are additive, would you rather have the pain?

As I was worried about addiction with the percocets, I agreed.  Have had low back pain for about the last 20 years.  I am 34.  Percocet was the only med that has helped my pain.  I would discontinue use when I felt like is was being taken more for the need than the pain.  This pill has changed my day to day operations.  I take one just about everyday (unless I know that I will be drinking alcohol that night). I usually take it after I get home from work, about 5ish..It not only eases the dull low back pain but it puts me in a great mood, I can deal with the 3 screaming kids, make dinner, and get the kids to bed.  I am nervous that I am addicted to this but I feel great!!!!!

I have been on Ultracet for 5 years now.  I take 4 - 6 pills per day.  Without it, I could not work, take care of my kids or anything.  Like all pain meds, however, it covers up symptoms and doesn't treat the cause.  Not the drugs fault.  I do want to find some doctor and insurance company that will take the time and patience to fix my underlying problem so I can get off this drug.  Meanwhile, I am thankful to have this drug available to allow me to live as best some life.  No problems with side effects.

They removed a significant portion of the disk material and the pain was still chronic. I am worried if there are any long-term effects and I get very anxious if I ever go more than 12 hours or so without a dose. I usually take 1 37/325mg 3x a day. I can't take it after 7pm because I have trouble sleeping when I take it. 
Pain	Faith, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	7/7/2009 8:06:49 PM	I have osteoarthritis and fibromalgia also flare ups with sciatica..I took nasaids  with little relief. I had a tia and sometimes that is related to the nasaids so I went off all pain meds. My Dr. Put me on ultracet smallest dose 2 every 6 hours or as needed, meaning I can take less not more. I have never had to take more than 4 a day, For the first time in many years I am not suffering with constant pain.I can function normally. What a gift. If I have any side effects I am not aware of it. So they must be minimal.I think this med. is safe . Just be careful to take as your Dr. Perscribed.I am careful to eat a little something before taking like a half slice bread or crackers.Anyway I am grateful to my Dr. for finding the answer to my constant pain.I have cried many times because of it ..Constant pain itself is dangerous.Depressing and dibilating.I am hoping they do not take this medicine off the market because of the few who do not do things appropriately.and get into trouble .. I do not think its the medicine ..I think its the inability to stay in touch with your Dr. and to not follow instructions.Thanks for letting me express this and I hope it helps people.
Pain	The Captain, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	7/6/2009 6:39:11 PM	I requested a switch from Vicodin for pain due to several herniated discs due to fire truck accident.  Vicodin made me feel like there was a balloon on my shoulders and I was not &quot;functional&quot; in the real world.  I take an extremely low dose am and pm of everyday and have successfully managed most of the acute pain associated with the disc problem.  Recently I have been concerned about having taken it for more than a year and I have slowly weened myself off, perferring to use it for &quot;flair-ups&quot;.  Much like Naproxin (sp?)it seems to be more effective at a lower dose when taken routinely.  Not recommended by manufacturer but very effective none the less...I recommend you try it if you are having trouble with other pain meds, especially Vicodin.  In talking to others, it seems it is one or the other in satisfaction.

My neurologist now prescribes it for me, to keep headaches caused by chiari malformation and arthritis in my neck; it helps my arthritis pain in the rest of my joints also.  It doesn't completely make the pain go away in my joints, just buffers it to be able to function everyday.  I cannot take any of the anti-inflammatories because of the terrible side effects.I would love to be able to just take Tylenol Arthritis Strength, which is great, but it doesn't keep the type of headaches that I have from coming.

Chronic pain persisted but this med releaves 75% of it. No ill aftereffects. After taking for 3 years dr. wanted me to taper off my dosage (2pills every 6 hr.) I cut this in half and experienced return of pain as well as moderate withdrawl symptoms such as anxiety and moodiness. I bumped the dose to 1 pill every 4 hrs. and the withdrawl lessened. I will gradually continue to taper off but would not hesitate to take this again at full dosage if pain dictates. Nothing else short of strong narcotics has been as effective. Side benefit is that it also releaves pain from torn ACL in right knee from injury long ago.

About a year or two ago I finally decided to go to the MD and they prescribed me meds such as vicodin and something similar, which made me just feel drugged.  A friend of mine had ultracet and made me try it and to my surprise it took my headache away within 20 minutes.  I now have had a prescription of my own and love it. I don't take it on a regular basis (only when the heachache is unbearable) and i only take a half of pill.I highly recommend this medication and have suggested coworkers and friends ask thieir MD about this drug if suffering from constant headaches.The only side effect i've seen it that it makes me a little more hyper than usual...which sometime is good, becuase headaches can wear you down!I highly recommend this medication for people suffering from moderate to severe headaches on a regular basis.

I've tried variations: 2pills/3xday but now I take one pill/4xday which seems to work best for me.

I have disk problems from a car accident and a pinched nerve. other than making me unsociable ultracet hasn't helped a bit. My advice if your doctor writes you an Rx for ultracet, give it back and get vicodin. Ps: headaches and gastrointestinal problems likely.

I felt faint, sick to my stomach and so dizzy I couldn't stand for over 3 hrs! I called my dr immediately and he changed my Rx to Vicodin, which has been a life saver. I've never gotten sick since then, and I know that Ultracet was to blame.  I'd not recommend this to anyone for any reason.

Was first on Noproxen, which wore off after about 6 hours. Started this and it really does not eliminate the pain but lessens it from a 10 to a 7 but only for a couple of hours. I was expecting more from it. Takes about 45 minutes to kick in, then lasts about 2.5 hours and then wears off. I actually look forward to the next dose and take it every 5 hours instead of 6 as prescribed. A bit of tiredness and light-headed along with itching on my thigh and moodiness, which may actually be from the pain still being present. Decreases appetite as well and gives dry mouth feeling for which I find myself drinking quite a bit of water. Looking to get off of it and on to something else ASAP.

The ultracet helps tremendously with my overall pain. It makes me feel normal and able to get through my daily routine. My concern is that I am addicted to ultracet. When I don't take it or it wears off I get anxious and the pain comes back. I literally have to take it in the middle of the night so I wake up able to get out of bed. I've been taking ultracet for over 5 years. I get my liver checked periodically. Overall, I am happy with Ultracet.

I was so stubborn, I didn't ever go to a doctor for it. I was only diagnosed with the fracture 3 years later when I tried a chiropractor to fix my pain. I was in excruciating pain 24/7 and didn't want to move, much less ride 40 minutes to the nearest decent emergency room. Luckily, my sister is a registered nurse, and had access to samples of several medications. I tried oxycodone, it knocked me out. Hydrocodone made me itch. When I first tried Ultracet, one pill per day allowed me to lie still without any pain, and after a couple of weeks, it allowed me to walk without pain. It never made me feel &quot;good&quot; or better than normal, just normal. It never made me sleepy or twitchy. And once the bone healed, I didn't need any again until I did something to upset my back. Then all I had to do was take ONE! and my pain was gone until I upset it again, which could be a matter of months. I had 15 two pill packs that lasted me 18 months. Judging by a lot of these reviews, many people/conditions are not compatible with Ultracet, but I definitely am. I would recommend it to anyone to try in the safety of their own home. If you don't trust it, have someone watch you.

I am surprised at the negative reviews because this is the only pain medicine that has worked for me. It is not controlled or super strong like a narcotic, but offers pain control w/o putting you into a medicine coma. And it does elavate your mood slightly, which helps when pain makes you cranky...

It was not a great pain reliever, but I could function well verbally.  I recently experienced a seizure (uncontrollable eye movements) followed by loss of vision for 2 minutes.  I was evaluated and Ultracet was a suspect.  I had just recently been having chest pain also.  I have taken this for 2 months.

Pain	Jim, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	12/12/2007 4:50:49 PM	Pain associated with Celluilitus in my left leg was immense at times.  Motrin 800 and Tylenol 325 x 3 alternating every few hours in the hospital did not ease the pain.  Doc prescribed me Ultracet once out of the hospital and with the 2 pills every 4 hours, the pain is not totally gone but, on a scale of 1-10 (10 unbearable), the pain level is a 3.  No side effects felt.

Does not give me the &quot;doped up&quot; feeling you get from most pain meds.  It seems to stay in my system longer allowing me to take fewer pills per day.

Works only for me at the maximum dose, but works well. Side effects for me include itching and trouble sleeping. However, the pain relief is worth it.
