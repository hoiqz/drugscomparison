Pain	GamecockGirl97, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/31/2010 4:18:12 PM	I was given an injection of Demerol and Toradol for a migraine that did not respond to my abortive medication. I went home and slept and when I woke up, my migraine was gone. It was definitely worth the minor pain of the shot.

She was allowed by her MD to self inject at home and she died chasing a &quot;high&quot; rather than a migraine. All of your reasons are reasons for VERY specific and careful use of this DRUG! Very sad, and what a loss!  Cris RN BSN

Pain	shadylady, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	9/10/2009 8:44:54 PM	I was given this drug following my hysterectomy. I woke up in terrible pain and after several attempts w/another drug I was finally given demerol and experienced almost instant relief. The only problem was that it had to be given in the hip through a large bore needle rather than through the iv so after 3 days both of my hips were black and blue. But it was well worth it for the excellent pain relief and I would choose to use it again.

Pain	dabo12367, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	7/6/2009 9:06:41 AM	I was injected with Demerol after waking up after surgery for a detached retina. The surgery required a scleral buckle to be clamped around the injured eye so it would squeeze the eye in a way that would keep the eye an oblong shape so the retina would not separate from the back of the eye during healing. The pain was incredible. When I was injected with Demerol I fell asleep within two minutes and was out for ten hours. The Demerol brought immediate relief. This happened about 20 years ago but I still remember my one and only encounter with this drug,it is a heavy duty pain reliever that was a Godsend when I needed it.

Pain	scribblegenie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/3/2008 11:30:55 PM	I have had severe migraines for more than 30 years and have taken probably every medication that is prescribed for them over the years.  The only thing that has consistently worked is Demerol. I am also unable to afford imitrex and other meds like it so Demerol has been a wonderful alternative.  I have to take it with Vistaril so that I don't vomit.  Without Vistaril there is no way that I would be able to take Demerol.  The vomiting would increase the pressure of my migraines and make them worse.  So the two together has been a godsend and I am so happy that my doctor has prescribed it for me.  I don't know what I would do otherwise.
