I began taking this supplement and have had wonderful, restful sleep. Puts me to sleep within 30-45 minutes and I stay asleep all night. I would recommend it to anyone.

Other	Phyllis, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/15/2011 11:11:40 AM	I have used Valerian Root for 15 years for pain releif in my joints and back, headaches and for a restful sleep. I use capsule 500mg so I do not smell the strong fragrance. I take one during the day and 1 to 2 at night before going to bed. Fantastic and wonderful Valerian Root

It has been effective for both.  Use it for sleep in combination with melatonin and the two together help me go to sleep and stay asleep.
Other	Lastcaress, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/12/2011 1:46:49 PM	I started taking this supplement because I was tired of using Ativan to sleep and for anxiety. I have found that it works better, non-addictive, no horrible side effects, and I feel great. It does smell horrible, but I would take any day over using an addictive medication. 
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/7/2010 12:35:48 AM	Helps enormously with getting me to sleep.  Not great at keeping me asleep for more than 3-4 hours, though. No drowsiness when I get up, in comparison with other preparations, so it's the only one I take.

Other	Tom, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	12/17/2009 10:51:03 AM	I'm a 58 year old male. I have used valerian root for several months. I get up everynight to go to the restroom. I used to be unable to get back to sleep. Since I have been using valerian I'm always able to return to sleep immediately. I have not noticed any side effects. The product does have a peculiar odor but it is tolerable. I would recommend this product to anyone who has sleep difficulties.

It also did not help me sleep it just made me groggy all day.All naturall supplements aren't always so all natural.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	12/6/2008 12:25:46 PM	Works great putting me to sleep, and keeping me that way. Though it does make me a bit groggy in the AM, so be prepared to drink a lot of coffee.
Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	25-34	11/20/2008 4:05:58 PM	Not helpful at all.  It really upset my stomach in a painful way. But, it might work different on others.

Other	bobbinell, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	11/13/2007 4:13:16 PM	I usually have a hard time staying asleep once I go to bed, always tossing and turning and waking up during the night.  When I take the valerian root before bed, I fall asleep easier, stay asleep all night, and really feel rested when I wake up in the morning; not groggy like usual.
