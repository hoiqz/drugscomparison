Ulcer of Duodenum caused by Bacteria Helicobacter Pylori	audchild, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/13/2010 3:24:17 PM	So what if it tastes less than wonderful!  It works.  I've had doc's trying to put me on other, more expensive...and more dangerous drugs for 20 years.  Seems like all those so called more effective drugs either interact with other drugs, or have dangerous side effects for long term users.  Pepto is very safe, and will not cause aluminum toxicity, or low blood pressure, or any of the other myriad of side effects the acid blockers, and proton pump inhibitors and the like cause.  My motto is that, if its been around as long as I have (or longer) It not only probably works, but it's also probably more natural, and therefor safer.  Besides, bismuth is a trace element that most people with ulcers are deficient in.  Pig farmers use tetracycline and bismuth to heal ulcers in their pigs....kinda makes you wonder who's getting the better treatment, huh?

Other	13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	13-18	5/19/2009 7:04:46 PM	I have colitis and I took one pepto bismol tablet one morning but the diarrhea didn't stop so I had to take another tablet. Works good but too bad it can't be used for long because i get diarrhea everyday and I wish I could take couple of tablets everyday but I can't. I really recommend this for people who get diarrhea or other symptoms occasionally though.
Diarrhea	Dougr, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	4/26/2009 9:05:53 PM	For those of you who don't care for the taste; get the caplets and swallow them whole.  I can't stand the taste, but it help the diarrhea, so I get the caplets.  Generic brand is cheaper; can only find generic CAPLETS in Miejer stores, Wal-mart only has the chewable tablets, which has the same taste as the liquid.

Diarrhea	teaterror, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	9/27/2008 2:21:38 PM	I was told that Pepto-Bismol should not be taken for more than three (3)days, so I had to stop it.  It worked great, and I haven't found anything that works for my diarrhea caused by an irritable bowel!

Sometimes its so bad that I wake up in the middle of the night gasping for air with the acid in my throat and even feeling like the burning is in my ears.  It's the most awful feeling.  I also try to eat some bread and milk to get the burning under control before taking the pepto-bismol.
