Gout	Health Improved!, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	7/18/2012 6:23:48 PM	My first few cases of Gout was in my ankle, toes,fingers and elbow. Colchicine helps tremendously! I am afraid to travel anywhere without it. I take 0.6mg once a day. Soft bowels, no runny diarrhea, no stomach cramps - not bad at all, and no nausea. I take the medication around 9:00pm, before bedtime. Bowel movements begin the next morning. The benefits of pain relief are worth it.  Colchicine relieves MOST of the pain. I no longer take 800mg Advil/Ibuprophen for pain. Colchicine takes care of the night pain in my ankle that wakes me up around 2:00am. I sometimes have a little pain, but no pain like I had prior to my doctor prescribing Colchicine. The benefits definitely out way the risks.
Gout	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	7/1/2012 3:20:24 AM	I am female, age 65 and have had gout for 10 years.  My father, his mother and my brother also have/had gout.  I have attacks/flairs in my fingers, wrist, instep and lower spine(very rare).  I take Allopurinal 600mg. daily and take Colchicine 0.6mg daily for 5 days when I have a flair.  I have 6 to 10 flairs a year.  I go to a Rhematologist for treatment of my gout.  The Colchicine works very well for the flairs.  The Rhematologist does not want to increase the Allopurinal since it is kind of hard on the kidneys and he says I am still young-nice to hear.  I incourge everyone to go to a Rhematologist for diagnosis/treatment, that is one of their specialities.

The pharmaceuticals thieves in this country are at it again.  We need reform NOW!!!!
Gout	bruce, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	65-74	7/28/2011 7:53:45 PM	Oral colchicine was purchased as a generic medication for decades. Since 2011 this medication has been rated as a tier 11 medication, undergoing clinical testing for scientific review. At the same time nearly all previous manufactors stopped producing this medicine. I now find the cost per dose NOW to have increased 1000%.

Gout	tj56, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	45-54	6/7/2011 4:47:18 AM	I was a 15 year user of Colchicine from West-ward, and completely satisfied with the drug's performance. I took 0.6 mg/day, and a second pill if I felt a gout attack coming.  On a few ocasions a third pill was needed, which did lead to diarrhea.  All of my gout attacks were brought on by excessive strain to my feet, either athletic activity or physical labor, and Colchicine was an inexpensive, safe cure.  Pain free within hours.Then the FDA got involved and approved Colcrys from URLpharma.  With their FDA approval URL enjoined West-ward from making the real colchicine.  Then with their government sanctioned monopoly they raised the price 2700% (from $21 to $556 for a 90 day supply).  You gotta love our government's involvement in health care.Well after two months on Colcrys, I have had two of the worst gout attacks ever.  Both totally out of the blue (no excessive strain).  I am in day ten of my first ever gout attack in my ankle, and Colcrys has been totally ineffective.  At the first sign of gout I took a second and then a third pill, with no releif.  The second day four pills, and three more on the third day, still nearly dibilitating pain at the end of the day.  My Dr. has been on vacation, but I will see him in a few hours.  My message will be &quot;Colcrys is crap, thank you FDA.&quot;

I took Colcys for gout and have had intense stomach burning and dizziness for over 9 days now. In addition my kidneys shut down for 2 days and I didn't have a bowl movement for 5 days. Only took 1 .6mg pill.  Side effects were almost immediate so I discontinued use.  Will never take this med again.
Gout	777, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	35-44	4/15/2011 11:31:17 AM	I have had gout for 11 years now and never wanted to take any type of medication due to side effects. I finally went to my Doctor and he prescribed Colchicine 0.6mg and took it daily for a 1year and stopped just because of reading some of the possible side effects that could be a little worrisome. I have it on standby just when I needed it though... I have changed my diet over the years and has helped a little. However, Ive had some bad flares ups since I stopped taken it and had to start back on it daily. This Medication works but worried about the long term use that it might have on my body later on in life.
Gout	Walt, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	4/3/2011 8:58:56 PM	Great drug,I've had several PAINFUL gout attacts over the years. At the onset of and attack I take 1.2 mg, followed by .6 an hour later. Then .6 every 12 hours. Or you can take .6 mg daily for prevention. Works for me, with NO side effects.

Since I've been taking colchicine for the past 5 years, I only get a flair up 2 or 3 times a year. I take 0.6 mlg daily. Now Uncle Sam wants a patent # on it so the price has gone up TEN FOLD. I can't afford it. I'm now trying allopurinol but my gout now hits me in my knee and ankel. Can I sue Uncle Sam for causing me Lots &amp; Lots of PAIN?
Familial Mediterranean Fever	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	19-24	2/8/2011 8:29:23 PM	I started taking Colchicine almost a year ago for FMF. It took me a while to figure out a dose that worked for me, right now I'm taking two 0.6mg pills a day. I have severe side effects such as severe diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. But anyone who really needs this medication and anyone this medication helps will tell you that the side effects are worth it. FMF attacks are unbearable. There were so many times I wanted to die just to stop the pain, but with Colchicine I don't have as many attacks and I feel better on a day to day basis. I take Phenergan and Lomotil for the nausea/vomiting and diarrhea, so I'm fine taking Colchicine. Hope this helps.

About 6 years ago I was diagnosed with gout in my big toe.  I also get it in my ankles and knees.  I have taken colchecine for the past 4 years on a daily basis.  I am prescribed .6 mg but only take 1/2 a tablet a day.  A week ago I thought I would try to drop the dosage completely, within 5 days I had a huge attack in my knee could hardly move or walk.  At that time I needed to take up to 2 pills every 8 hours. totaling 9 pills in two day.  Thank god for this pill.   I have taken Allupirnal(not sure of spelling) but within days I have another attack and must go back to colchecine.  I have been hospitalized for gout when I first started taking Allupirnal It cause my leg to swell to twice its size.  Colchecine does work but it does cause diahria when you have to take large amounts.  that is a small price in my book.

If I wait till its full on attack it doesn't seem as effective, however; I have never taken more than 2 pills in a 24 hour period. Overall I'm glad this med exists as I've had attacks that leave me nearly unable to move. I dont over medicate and have had no side effects.

Now im forced to pay out the nose because Pharm url is the exclusive manufacture of Colchicine/Colcrys. They lobbied the FDA because Colchicine was a &quot;unapproved&quot; drug and brought on the market before the FDA even existed. So much for health care reform. Because of this we will all have to pay more for patients who need this drug under Obama care.

The rheumatologist said at the beginning COLCHICINE which I had been on that before but stopped as it gave me diarehae  that was the wrong thing to do had I known then what I know today and what Gout can do I would have endured the bowel movements and continued with COLCHICINE. If you are prescribed this medication don't do it your way do it the providers way.....otherwise suffer the results that GOUT can do and then you suffer...not only you but the care that is needed from the SPOUSE  which is an all day job.

While I did not know what I was experiencing, I suffered through many games where I thought my pain was an injury.  Through the years I have discovered that intense physical activity agravates the gout (at least I experience many attacks after long and/or hard workouts).  The pain has been in my feet (instep, arch, toes), hand (fingers, knuckles), wrist (feels like a sprain) and elbow.  None of these are at the same time, but the pain can shift from one area to the next.  Others do not understand the degree of the pain but they can certainly observe that I am in a great deal of pain because of my inability to move during a flare-up.  I have used indocin for years during &quot;attacks&quot; but I get headaches with that drug.  I experience five or six strong flare-up each year.  The doctor started me on colchicine and the pain decreased immediately.  I have had no side effects.  I have read many reviews on this site and it seems as though the frequency of use has been a factor in many of the excerpts.  I take only two a day, one early and one mid-day.  I have experienced no adverse problems.  Believe me when I say that I do not take medication.  I do not take any other drugs and I only use colchicine during the attacks and for few days afterwards.  Again, as I read these reviews it seems as though some medical professionals are precribing large doses.  Maybe, like anything else moderation is the secret.  Also, after reading some of these reviews, I realize how much I appreciate my doctor.

I started taking this medication in the hospital, but had stomach upset.  I went off of the medication since I was showing improvement.  It is March, and my symptoms have returned, and I have been back on the med. again for almost two weeks with very little difference in the squeezing of my heart- but I do have the upset stomach again.  I am supposed to stay on this drug for 6 more weeks at 0.6.  So, we'll see!!!  Is anyone else out there taking this drug for the same reason?  Thanks!

I had chills, disorientation and rapid pulse.  This is a really horrible drug. Be very careful is you have a reaction.
Gout	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	45-54	1/31/2010 1:53:22 PM	Balance is the key to taking this drug.  Since the pain I suffer from the gout attack is so great I'm willing to deal with some of the side effects. The only major side effect I receive is explosive diarrhea. What I have learned over time is to balance the dosage to receive the quickest relief and suffer minimal side effects.  The quick relief from this medicine is amazing but unfortunately I have not been able to dodge that particular side effect. It's all about balance and you will be so relieved from the gout pain.

When I feel what may be an attack, I take two at bedtime and reevaluate in the morning. If I have an attack, I take a pill every hour or two until I get diarrhea.  This way I know I have enough in me to do its work.

After a wicked case in my knee, I sought preventative treatment. I'm allergic to allopurinol so have been taking colchicine once daily.  Initially gave me bad diarrhea, nausea and flu symptoms. MD told me to stop it for two days and resume. Better able to tolerate but still have lower intestinal pain and bloating. I think this medication borders on barbaric.  Am now phasing in probenecid as the preventative treatment.

I now take the medication daily and have no problems. I have no complains since I have been on this medication. I'll deal with the side effects of the medication than the severe pain from the gout which is unbearable.

The last batch pill was yellow with a fancy V and number 2577.  Last night I began taking a new white colchicene pill number EP 104.  I have since had GI problems and have stopped taking the new pill.  My pharmacist told me that different manufacturers' versions of the same medication might produce different side effects. He has offered to try and find the old product for me.     
Gout	med.system unlucky, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	11/6/2009 3:05:07 AM	I was givin seroquel (the Worst drug) for a head injury, big mistake I suffered all side effect from it possiable, then when I finnaly found a new medicine, I experenced sever swelling of hands and feet, then it would subside then every attack was worse, finnally found a doctor who subscribed colchicine, still need to check for side effects (I am prone to them) and mild gout runs in my family, But I can run,walk, and work out again, no severe side effects, mild pain in feet BUT I CAN WALK !

Good Medicine (but never hurts to check for side effects, after seroquel belive me I know that medicine recked me.
Joint Disease which may include Attacks of Acute Arthritis	peteingilroy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	10/25/2009 9:02:24 PM	I have had gout in my big toe 4 times now.  Previously, I just rode it out.  This time (after the 3rd day of intense pain) I took Colchicine (.6 mg), starting with 2 pills and then took 8 more pills over the next 24 hrs or so.  My pain is almost 80% gone and the swelling in my foot is almost gone.  And I bet it is completely gone in the next 2 days.  This is far better than riding out the full 10-14 days of pain.Next time I will definitely start this therapy at the first sign of gout.I had absolutely no side effects (at least not yet....I just took my lat pill) and it has been about 28 hours.

However, I've had a handful of gout attacks over the past 10 years or so and my pain usually doesn't completely subside for about 2 weeks with the worst of it lasting about 2 or 3 days. I have usually waited to see the doctor until several days into an attack and was prescribed colchicine to reduce the swelling. I had some remaining from my last gout episode and this time, I was able to started taking colchicine twice a day immediately after the gout attack and have pretty much eliminated the pain in a week. I have to admit, the first attack I had about 10 years ago, a doctor had me taking it once an hour or once every 2 hours and it made me violently sick to my stomach, though.

Went to the ER specifically for colchicine because we heard of the pain relief that came with it.  Never again.  Explosive diarrhea came first, then the nausea, and currently, the projectile vomiting.  I am monitoring to make sure he doesn't start bleeding in his GI tract.  He is so sick, and the pain in his foot/ankle is only 50% better.

The Dr. prescribed both medications at the same time but has since raised the Colchine to 2 pills a day. I have had heartburn and gas but no diarrhea. Also have had dizziness, drowsy/sleepy feeling as well as a slight nauseous feeling. Not sure which prescription is causing the side effects. Maybe both?

My Dr. prescribed this medication and forewarned me that it MAY cause diarahea.  He suggested one 0.6 mg pill every four hours instead of every one to two hours.  It took just a little longer but after taking this for 18 hours the front of my foots swelling has gone down 50% and the pain has subsided by over 75%.  When this attack is over , he is starting my on Allopurinol to avoid this in the future.In short, Colchicine is a god sent medication.

Inflammation of the Joints due to Gout	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Male	55-64	3/18/2009 9:34:07 PM	I went to Urgent Care on a Sunday morning because of severe pain in my left foot due to Gout.  I was given Colchicine .6mg and told to take 2 tablets immediately and one every 1-2 hours till the pain subsided or until I developed Diarrhea.  The pain went away by bedtime after taking 9 tablets.  Monday morning I had explosive diarrhea and by noon had developed vomiting and severe muscle pain in my back and side. I received a call from Medco Health, my medication provider, about 2:00pm who told me of the side effects, one was the interaction it has with Zocor which causes the degeneration of muscle fiber causing severe pain.  I traded one pain for another.  The diarrhea and vomiting subsided after 3 days.  After a week, I'm still fighting the muscle pain with Oxycodine, but it does seem to be getting better. LOOK FOR AN ALTERNATIVE DRUG!!!!!

I have taken it 2-3 times per day for probably the last 7 years. It makes a huge difference in my daily comfort level. Yearly blood tests are done to make sure my liver and kidneys are functioning properly. Benefits far outweigh side effects.

I have experienced the painful condition of gout in my big toes in the past 4 years or so &amp; did not know there was some medication that would have relieved my pain. However the last time I had an attack I was forced to seek medical treatment. My doctor precribed Colchicine &amp; to make a long story short, I had almost 90% relief within 12 hours. No side affects whatsoever. It works.

With the use of colchicine my hands completely cleared.  Just to make sure that I was not experiencing some new and temporary reaction that led to this psoratic relief, I discontinued the use of the colchincine.  The psoriasis in my hand return almost immediately.  Upon returning to the use of colchicine, my hands cleared up once again.Every doctor I have talked to dismisses this because they say that gout and psoriasis are not related.  Thats fine, but the bottom line is that this drug suppresses both my gout and psoriasis.

Diarrhea and dehydration were severe. A portion of my small bowel stopped working for a while. The gout pain droped from a 10+ to 8-9. The jury is still out on colchicine for the prevention. I find drinking water 3 to 4 liters daily works well however, I wouldn't recommend this without talking for your MD(this much fluid could be devastating to a person in CHF). I now use water in theory of diluting the concentration of the uric acid in my bloodstream and a big whopping dose of IM steroids when an attack occurs. I now only have about one to two attacks per year.

In fact I had to take pain killers just to help deal with the medication.  Never Again.

I suffered with pain in my feet, when I would get up in am I could barely walk down steps.  The pain just got worse and my joints hurt and muscle pain. I work for a doctor but no insurance so I talked to her and at first we thought fibromyalgia. I just lived with the pain.  Taking ibuprofen, using hot packs etc. Then in Nov. 07' my great toe on my left foot turned a little red and very painful. I thought gout so I talked to the doctor again and she looked at it and said possible gout and Rx'ed me with colchicine for 5 days. AFTER 2 DAYS I WAS PAIN FREE!! NO PAIN IN MY FEET,SHOULDERS,ELBOWS,KNEES,HANDS,MUSCLES. ANYWHERE. I COULD RUN UP AND DOUM THE STEPS.  This was a miricle to me. I have been pain free up till about 2 wks. ago. I am breaking down and giong to have the uric acid blood test. If it is gout then she will Rx allipurinol(sp)? If I dont have gout then I dont know what I do have but colchicine was my miricle drug.

Treatment to Prevent Gout	moldy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	3/7/2008 1:32:22 PM	I took this drug back in the 80's for gout and it worked. In 2004 my pharmacy mis labled the instructions, instead of one pill every hour until vomiting, etc. they told me to take it every 5 minutes until vomiting.  Well, I took the whole bottle and puked for two days until I went to the hospital. About died but okay now, sort of. Had to take one a day to keep the gout away but my doc said to stop taking it after 4 months. Now I have gout again and after reading the reviews I see the reason for my doc to tell me to stop. Don't know what I can take now even with 400 mg of allopruinal a day, I can get gout just by talking about it. Can't use NSAIDs due to blood thinners, etc. Ouch! Can take good pain meds cause the docs don't like to prescribe it so what the hell?

It does cause some diahrrea after 3 days of treatment, butis well worth it, instead of enduring the excruciating pain associated with gout attack. A magic pill indeed.

Later I came to find out that Colchicine suppresses bone marrow function.  Conventional reasoning said that you would have to take a lot to have this happen.  I took a daily dose of .65 mg for gout.  Allopurinol is supposed to be more effective for gout, but at the time, I was taking Imuran which does not get along with Colchicine.  I don't take it now and it will take 3 to 6 months to find out if it was the culprit in my miserable energyless existence.

Treatment to Prevent Gout	taylorbh1, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	9/18/2007 5:34:13 PM	I started taking Colchicine about 6 weeks ago for the treatment of Gout. It has worked for me, but I almost died due to complications brought on by using this drug.  I am a dialysis patient and it caused my immune system to crash by supressing my bone marrow production of both white and red blood cells and platelets.  I developed high fever and headaches for lack of red blood cells carrying oxygen to the brain. I spent 6 days in the hospital until my white blood cell count came up to atleast 2.7 before they would release me. I am still waiting for results from the bone marrow biopsy and my primary care doctor called the hematologist to let him know about the Colchicine side effects and they are both confident that the drug was the cause of all symptoms.  Hopefully they will be able to find some other form of treatment for the gout without the adverse effects on my immune system and kidneys. I am confident they will.
