It also caused rashes and night sweats. However I am now effectively healed with proper nutrition and apple cidar vinegar. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/11/2012 11:59:51 AM	I have been using Arava (10mg) along and Plaquenil for 6 weeks. Plaquenil for 2 years priot to adding the Arava. I feel really good. I am also trying to eat glutin free and I exercise 4-5 days per week. I do spinnning and strength training. I feel stongly that this helps me control my RA. I am anxious to have blood work done in June to assure my values are in check. I am doing everything possible to stay active and strong.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Arid-Zona_56, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	55-64	2/9/2012 6:58:38 AM	Wrote a long post on ARAVA. Have no idea where my effort went to.Side effects after 1 month.25 years with RA and many modalities of treatment. Great drug but fear too many side effects to be tolerated well by many.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	CTM, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	2/1/2012 5:44:43 PM	I have been suffering with RA for 6 years and have tried almost every medication possible.  Currently on Plaquenil, Prednisone and started Arava 4 months ago.  Although I have noticed a significant improvement in energy level and my constant pain is now not a &quot;10&quot; but usually &quot;6-8&quot; I have side effects that I am finding more uncomfortable than the improvement in the RA. I have gained about 25-30 pounds since starting and have a very noticable increase of belly fat. Most troubling is a CONSTANT feeling of abdominal muscle tensing/cramping.  It is not painful but it feels like I am constantly &quot;bearing down&quot;. I also feel like someone has &quot;sprayed freon under my skin around my abdomnen and back.  I also have a constant &quot;burning&quot; on the center of my tongue as if the tongue was scalded by hot liquid. Lastly I have much more energy but feel very &quot;jumpy&quot;. I also can feel an acute increase of all these symptoms &quot;in waves&quot; throughout the day.  I stopped taking the 20mg for a week and then decreased to 10mg with the addition of Ativan 1mg 2xday and drinking Quinine Water to help the cramping.  Nothing has subsided.  I have reached the point of thinking that it is not worth all this discomfort.  I am discouraged and so wanted this to work.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Tess, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	1/28/2012 1:51:09 PM	Placed on ARAVA after some success with Prednisone and Methotrexate. Have been on Prednisone in varying doses for 10 years supposedly related to PMR (polymyalgia rheumatica). After a flare-up in my hands it was diagnosed that I now have RA. Started the ARAVA in Oct and got very ill on Jan 2012 with severe nausea and dry heaves with chills. Lost 10 lbs in 3 days and ended up in the hospital for 3 days with I/V antibiotics. Still not feeling very well but MD is insistent that I restart ARAVA. I intend to say no on next visit. Right now RA symptoms are under control.

In that time I did not gain a benefit from it helping to alleviate my RA symptons. After my first blood test, my liver functions were normal, but my white cell count and my platelet count was very low. After another month, these counts remain low. I am no longer taking the drug.

During the Summer of 2011 I had an exacerbation of my arthritis, which hasn't occurred in years. I am taking celebrex, plaquinil  and my new Rheumatologist started me on prednisone and Arava. Now I am experiencing heart palpitations for 2 weeks.  I weaned myself off of prednisone and want to stop Arava.

Other	Anonymous , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/6/2011 2:59:56 PM	This medication almost killed me because a few days after taking this medication, my family had to call 911 due to the severe vomimting and diarrhea which led to dehydration so bad that I was so weak I couldn't even crawl to my crying baby's crib. I passed out and when I woke up, I had severe pain all over my body. To make a long story short, I had to go to the infectious disease doctor for 2 and a half years with severe candida and infections in every oral opening on my body. I would not recommend this medication for anyone at all.I am still living with the effects 10 years later and I have missed out on a lot of my children's lives.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Desperately Seeking Cure, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	3/14/2011 10:43:41 AM	I have been on Arava for about 4 months and it stopped the swelling and pain almost immediately. However, I experience the itching around my ankles and buttocks, dry cough and throat, shortness of breath, massive hair lose, hot burning sensation on the bottom of feet, numbness of toes, some stomach pain, lose stool, headaches (at first, not s much now),  skin bumps looks like rash but feels like acne and when I scratch some come off. In addition, my blood pressure has been high the last couple of times I have been in for the Orencia treatment, normally I have 116/60 but the last couple of times it has read 130/60ish. My initial dosage was 20mg a day but now I am taking it every other day and have gone as much as five days, I have noticed a reduction in hair lose and coughing, and no more itching. I do blood work every six weeks and results are normal. I will see my Dr. in a couple of weeks and hopefully we can discuss and agree to reduce the dosage.  Previously I was on Remicade and Methotraxate for about eight/nine years but this stopped working. I feel okay but not a 100% like I use to when I first started the Remicade and MTX regiment eight/nine years ago. I also take Thistle and try to exercise often and hoping to get back into doing yoga two/three times a week like I use to.  In my opinion Arava is a very toxic medication and I dont like it but it has helped me some. My recommendation is to monitor yourself; hence you are the one that knows your body and keep on working with your Dr. to adjust the dosage to a comfortable level to get the most benefit and live life to its fullest.

I have been on it over 15 years &amp; my RA is under control. Have had RA 33 yrs. I have more problems with neurpathy (burning nerves) now.  It is a side effect of the rheumatoid. Diagnosed after 28 yrs of severe RA.

I have been on the brand name drug Arava for over 7 years prior to taking numerous other drugs that just made me sick. I am on a low dose of 10mg. My insurance required me to use the generic version of Arava when one was developed a couple of years ago, and I was told it was the same drug so I took it. After being on the generic for a few weeks I developed severe migranes and felt nauseaed and pain. Basically, sick as a dog! I talked with my doctor again and told him and he said it is possible that the generic brand had a different binding ingredient and I went back on the brand name Arava (after a lengthy review with our insurance company) and felt fine after a few weeks. I read that some of the other reviews mentioned migraines and nausea and wonder if they also used the generic version. If so, try the brand name and see if it makes a difference to you too.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Granny, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	8/27/2010 12:10:15 PM	I have taken Arava for 4months, and stopped a month ago in july 2010. I felt like I was on a chemo treatment. No energy,felt bad all over,2toes both feet numb,itching,no appetitite,sick stomach, and since I've stopped, I still have all the above plus, left fingers started numb, now wrist, no grip, severe neck and head pain,I go to a nerve and spine specialist Monday, CT scan now shows only of my neck, 3bulging discs and pinched nerve. I felt bad from the RA, and was hoping this medicine would help, but I know my body, and I know this medicine is what has started all the other problems in my body now. I will never try it again, and wouldn't recommend it to any RA patient. We have hard enough time as it is, without adding more nerve and muscle problems. I just be glad when this medicine is out of my body. Any advice on getting this out of my system would be greatly appreciated. Thank You, from Tennessee

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Janet, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	7/13/2010 12:15:33 AM	I started at 10mg for 1 month and then went up to 20mg, within a couple of days of taking it I lost the feeling in my pinky and ring finger along with terrible nerve pain.  I went off Arava and nerve pain improved but had ultrasound done and was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Cysts.  I have had RA for 34 yrs and never came across this problem until I took Arava.  I am also on 5 mg of Prednisone.  Has anyone come across this problem and how did you solve it.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	6/25/2010 11:40:23 PM	I was diagnosed with RA 2 years ago. Started off taking methotrexate, plaquenil and a round of low dose prednisone. Did well until side affects of methtrexate became too much (mostly nausea). My rheumatologist put me on arava and I've been doing well. Pain (mostly hands, wrists, ankles &amp; feet) is mild to moderate but definitely manageable. I feel confident that my doctor is managing my RA as aggressive and as safely as possible. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Sadie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	55-64	5/23/2010 1:20:18 PM	Started with methotrexate and within a month i could do everythings for myself, but coughing started. MD changed to Arava and I continue to do great, with the exception that i was having constant elevated liver enzymes. So, I would stop the Arava for 2 weeks and cleanse with thistle and my enzymes are back to normal. thats my routine. Most importantly, I changed my complete eating habits using tumeric in salid, ginger &amp; green tea, fish, omega-3 etc. Just hopes it keeps on working.  Exercise daily and with moderate force to areas helps. Just got to look out for yourself. You can tell the doctor, but you feel the pain and must act on it

I am itching so bad I feel like I have a million fleas on me and I just can't relieve the itch!!  It's driving me nuts!  I'm coming off of this stuff.

This med arava has helped me so much.a few months ago I had lost almost all the use of my left hand and arm.. some in my right but noe as much as left. Both knees had been inflamed and hurt all the time. I could hardly walk. After about a month of taking the med. the nausea went away, But I started taking it at bedtime, which helped. I slept through the nausea. The only problem I had was scalp itching, and my dr reduced dose. took care of the prob.

Took Methotrexate for 6 mo. Constant nausea. Not good trade off in my book. All the pain is horrible but at least have adjusted to that in past 18 yrs of mostly no meds. Can't adjust to feeling like have the flu for 4 out of 7 days. Tried Arava for 2 mo. w/ no nausea, now have red itchy burning rash all over face. Dr has taken me off Arava now. Can't say I'm too sorry. It hasn't worked yet and it frightens me. Gonna try alternatives. Heard about a nutritionist in WI. Adrenal Fatigue?

I have been on this med for almost 2 months and not sure if I want to continue. I have less swelling and I don't ache like I did when on metho. I'm so allergic to NSAIDS. I know these would help if I could take them. Is this the trade off? If anyone is on the injections or infusions currently please let me know how these are working for you. I think this is my next step.

At one time my blood count showed elevated blood sugar. I was referred to endrocrenologist (sp) for suspected diabetes.  He suggested lowering my Arava dosage, which my rheumatologist lowered to every other day.  Subsequent blood tests indicated normal glucose levels.  I have liver function tests each time I see my doctor, and they are normal.  I have problems with my appetite.  I am on many medications for chronic back pain and for my blood pressure.  Over all, my RA is under better control, even though I have had many operations for problems with my wrists, hands, and feet.  I also take plaquenil and 4 mg. of prednisone daily.  Overall, I am satisfied with Arava.

I was on gold shots before and the RH broke thru. I was put on Arava after that. Since starting Arava, I have had no, pain, swelling, stiffness, soreness or anything. I am in a chemical remission &amp; have been for several years.

Two years ago I started the Arava and have little to no pain and a lot less fatique. However, recently my white count went too low and Dr. took me off Arava and now I am experiencing more pain and stiffness again. I hope she will let me resume taking the Arava.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Btrswt, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	7/1/2009 12:15:44 AM	Because of the pain and rash, I took my last lefunomide today after first 30 days.  I could live with the rash (which was all over my body), but the severe lower back and trembling pelvic pain was too much to endure.  So severe I was losing sleep.  Then came stabing pain in neck and around shoulder blades with joint pain in the shin of my legs.  Dr. gave me a muscle relaxer.  Previously, I was on methotrexate and prednosone with celebrex.  Became too toxic, with feet tingling, inflammation and tired with same type of shoulder/neck stabing feeling. I've had 3 injections of Humira and hopeful that this is the only drug I will need to take and hoping no side effects.  
Rheumatoid Arthritis	sarah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	6/28/2009 12:08:01 PM	I was diagnosed with RA in 12/08. I took only Methotrexate and had no relief, I only got worse. I have been taking Arava for 1 month and have noticed little relief. One thing I have noticed is I have headaches everyday along with a few other symptoms. Does anyone else get headaches?

Rheumatoid Arthritis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	5/28/2009 6:28:51 PM	I was on Methotrexate on and off for the last 12 years, combined with either Enbrel or Humira. I recently switched to Arava. I have only been on Arava for 3 weeks but feel much better than the past year on Metho. I rarely have any break through pain. So far the only side effect I have experienced is nausea (and I take Protonix daily which gets rid of it) and some other stomach issues I will try to resolve with a daily probiotic pill. It is worth it to be practically pain free! Just be careful this drug is very toxic and can be damaging -- be sure to get your blood work done every 6 weeks!

I am just past the six month mark, and usually need Steroid injections in my hips every six months.  I have not had an injection in over 8 months and haven't scheduled one yet.  I have tried numerous NSAID's in the past some worked ok, but made my Asthma flare up.  I was hosptialized for five days due to a reaction to an NSAID.  I am very happy that this is working.

I also take multivitamins.  I find that the folic acid eliminated the symptoms I had at first.  I have lost weight but I feel this is an added plus as I needed to lose weight which has helped my condition. I take 10 mg in the morning and 10 mg at night along with 1 mg of folic acid.  I also take hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice a day.  I function normally with these medications and I feel I have my life back.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	LizH., 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	10/24/2008 1:51:13 PM	I do not recommend this drug in combination with methotrexate.  Liver enzymes have not been normal since. It made me feel ill - the doctor said it was a flare, but it was not a flare - it just made me feel sick all the time.  I was told by general practitioner, and she said that a lot of people felt ill on ARAVA.  History: I was diagnosed with RA 2 years ago. I tried methotrexate without much relief for 8-9 months. They dosed me with a wide variety of NSAIDs over time along with it, but none of them helped at all. Then, a new dr. put me on Arava, with the metho &amp; that's when my liver enzymes went sky high. They are still not back to normal after nearly a year with no meds at all. I just got scared away from taking anything, but wrist joint damage has begun. So, I started plaquenil, and I am trying milk thistle for my liver and staying away from all alcohol for the time being. We shall see, not much relief so far, just digestive issues, increased hot flashes and mid-afternoon into evening fatigue that wrecks my life. I have Sjoerens &amp; Reynauds also. I had wheezing yesterday  havent had that since on metho/Arava. But, of course the Drs. say it is not associated. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	10/22/2008 8:45:43 AM	I was on enbrel and methotrexate and doing quite well for about a year, but unfortunately developed methotrexate toxicity and had to stop.  My rheumatologist prescribed ARAVA to replace the methotrexate. It took about four months to build up to levels where it was effective, but have had no problems on it. I feel good. The only side effect I have experienced is some very slight numbness in my toes which occurs in the morning and wears off during the day.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Kimba, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/29/2008 5:13:12 PM	In Nov.2003 after Hepatitis C and Polio vaccinations on the same day I got a horrendous allergic reaction. After this event my RA began very aggressively. Rh factor 100. Took Vioxx, Methotrexate, Plaquinil, Prednisone. Was still in constant pain with huge painful flare ups in all my joints in the body. Sometimes I could not get out of bed and needed help to dress etc. Life wasn't worth living anymore, I thought. Then, in April 2006, I began taking 20mg Arava daily plus continued taking 5 mg Prednisone and after less than two weeks I was pain free. It was like a miracle and I had to get used to the new &quot;me.&quot; Since then, I have not had any stiffness or flare ups or used my wrist braces a single time. After one year, I began taking 20 mg Arava only every other day and will now try every three days. I am also down to 3 mg Prednisone daily. I hope I will stay this well forever. My liver enzyme values are monitored every three months. I was very scared of taking Arava at first because of the long half-life but I am glad I did since I have had two and a half good years now.

Other	bluesgrl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	5/12/2008 5:47:28 PM	This drug (the generic-leflunomide) was added a few months ago to hopefully assist my dosage of azathioprine and prednisone to increase muscle strength and slow the progression of polymyositis.  I felt more strength for the 1st week, but then the diarrhea started and I no longer felt better or stronger. That side effect gradually went away but shortly after my hair started coming out in clumps and just recently I cut it down very short and keep my head covered because of bald spots.  I see my rheumatologist again next week and I hope he'll agree for my illness, this is probably causing more harm than good.
