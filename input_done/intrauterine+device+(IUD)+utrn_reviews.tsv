Its a great method of BC. Only complaint I have is my period has drastically changed. It is very heavy and long. I've only had the IUD for 8months I hope periods get better.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/3/2010 5:26:48 PM	I got the IUD inserted when my son was 6wks old and I have had it for 2 years. I absolutely love it! I don't have to use a panty liner or anything when I am on my period. The only way I can tell I am is a little spotting but only when I wipe after using the restroom. I got pregnant with my son on the Nuva Ring, and i'm very happy that I chose the IUD. My spouse can't feel it either. I also like having the option of having it taken out early if I decide to have another child. I will definately use it again!!!

I dont have a period, just spotting for a day! I love that I dont have to remember to take a pill everyday. I work at a hospital and in the 5 years ive been here I have only seen a few women had embedded IUD's but to me that goes back to the Dr. I have spend a lot of money on co pays to a neurologist to just keep giving me pills to make the migraines better, I was just wanting to know if anyone else has had extremely bad migraines? to the point I have almost gone to the ER just for relief! any suggestions?

I had it incerted when my lastchild was 6yrs. old and he is now 13. It will be removed once he turns 16.This will be the full 10yr span of the IUD. There are no side affects to this device, other than a change in bleeding while on your cycle(heavy,light or nothing.) I have been wearing a panty liner since the first year.

The IUD had poked through my uterus, causing my appendix to move down to cover the hole and this caused appendicitis. The Dr. told my husband that if I didnt go to the ER when i did I wouldnt have woke up the next morning. That is how bad the infection was.

Other	IUD Me, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/9/2009 6:53:08 PM	I had my IUD put inserted in 2004, it was the best thing I ever did.  Stopped the periods, would sometime show a little but not much.  Plus no more remembering to take a pill each day. The insertion of the IUD is no problem, just a little cramping that was over super quick, removal was the same thing.  Strongly suggest IUD for any women who doesn't want the worry or taking contraception.
Other	PJ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	10/26/2007 11:47:48 AM	I GOT THE DEVICE 8/06 AND JUST RECENTLY I WAS TOLD THAT THE DARK DISCOLORATION OF MY FACE AND NECK WAS SIDE AFFECT.  IT LOOKS LIKE A PREGNANCY MASK.  I VISITED A DERMATOLOGIST RECENTLY AND SHE WANTS TO CHARGE $3000.00 TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM WITH SOME TYPE OF CHEMICAL PEEL.  IF SOMEONE OUT THERE CAN TELL ME A DOCTOR WHO CAN TREAT ME WITH ORAL OR TOPICAL MEDICINE, I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE.  BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE $3000.00 FOR SOMETHING THAT COULD POSSIBLY HEAL ONCE THE DEVICE IS REMOVED.  THANKS
