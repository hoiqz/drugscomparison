As doage increased, constipation has gotten worse. Take 4 pills with food. Last Phosphorus was 10.2 and I eat right. I only have bowel movements 1 or 2 times a week. Also, blood pressure runs 80/40 since I started taking. Would not recomend to anyone. Stopped taking today. They gave me Fosrenol but I am afraid to take for similar reasons. Same class of meds with same side effects. Any recommendations?

Take 3 renvela with each meal. Have been experiencing ongoing diaherrea and was told by the nurse at the dialysis clinic that I go to that Renvela would not cause diaherrea. Imagine my surprise when I read the reviews about how this drug can and does cause diaherrea.

Renal Osteodystrophy with Hyperphosphatemia	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	11/15/2008 3:16:17 PM	   Caused severe high blood pressure after using this drug for 2 weeks,for which my Md.prescribed Norvasc.   This side effect was not in the product insert under&quot;side effects&quot;.   Thankfully I investigated further using webmd and found that my sudden and severe high blood pressure was listed under uncommon &quot;side effect&quot;.   I have been a dialysis patient for 5 years and never had high blood pressure until starting Renvela for my high phosphate levels.   I've printed this information for my Doctor and am discontinuing Renvela.   I took lanthanum carbonate(Fosrenol) prior to Renvela and will go back to using that to prevent my high phosphate levels.Thank You Webmd!!!
