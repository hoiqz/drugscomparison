Now got scarred eyelids where I did not know it was what was causing the rawness of my eyes and the redness to be so much worst.  Eye dr. recommended it. My eyes got so raw that I could not touch them.  I was lucky enough to not have it on me and to by another type and that is when it dawn on me that you can have a reaction to a med that suppose to not be that reactive.
Drying and Inflammation of Cornea and Conjunctiva of Eyes	SmileyWitchFaerie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/13/2010 6:29:12 AM	Ever since I went to the optometrist and was prescribed Genteal which has this drug in it, my vision has been great . I also found out that my insomnia was caused by severe dry eyes , it was really bad. I had lesions behind my eyes and the pain was unbearable. It was as if there were lots of hammer drills , drilling behind my eye balls working over time. the migraines were making it worst. I actually sleep now for more than 2 hours at at time and no longer have migraines since I started using this in Oct. 2009. being an insomniac for many years sleep sounds like heaven!

This being the last one I use seems to really comfort the kitty's eyes (her name is &quot;Squint&quot;), loosening the hair that is rubbing into her cornea.  Speaking for Squint, I believe she's very happy with it!  :o)
