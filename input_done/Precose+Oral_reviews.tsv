I was close to becoming insulin dependant but thanks to this medicin among the metformin glipizide actose and jenuvia my blood sugars never get over 200! I am no longer afraid to eat. Thanks to who ever created this medication.

Great!  A bit of a pain to take at every meal (usually 100mg), but at least it's small and easy to carry lots in a pillcase.  I lightly break it into numerous pieces in my mouth (avoiding getting too much saliva on it), swallow with a little water, then eat.  If you end up tasing it, no sweat, as it actually tastes pleasant.  There was some diahrrea early on, but the only side effect that never completely goes away is the farting -- usually awhile after eating.  But it's worth it, and I usually find ways to be discreet about it when around others.  Good drug, but wish the generic wasn't so close in price to the brand!

The more starches I consume the more bloating and gas I get.  I cut my intake of white breads, potatoes, pasta and rice. I changed what I eat and now only have gas when I get careless with what I eat.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	pam, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	9/12/2009 8:43:42 PM	I am on my second month with this. 25mg I first introduced this at dinner for a week,lunch a week later and then breakfast so I had 3 per day. I was doing just fine with mild gas but no other problems. I have now started to have diarrhea and my DR. advised me to stop it all together. I am to reintroduce this again at the same dosage when my problem subsides. I'm willing to give it another try.
