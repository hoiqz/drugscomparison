Acne	O, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	19-24	9/18/2012 12:17:50 AM	I have been using retin a micro .1% for 4 months. I had a terrible initial breakout that lasted for the entire first 3 months. Everything is looking clear. My nose tends to get very dry and peel, but I'm currently looking at ways to prevent this from happening.

Other	TXDogMom, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/24/2012 1:47:16 PM	I was prescribed Retin A years ago for adult break-outs and dark areas caused by sun damage. It worked!  I have stopped using it because insurance wouldn't pay any longer and it was quite expensive at the Med Spas.  Recently I developed peri-oral dermatitis and say a Dermatologist. That was treated with Oracea, a low dose Doxycycline and she prescribed Retin A Micro.  The dermatitis cleared up and I am continuing use of the Retin A Micro on all of my face.  It is not causing the dryness that regular Retin A caused. I used to get crusting around my nose with Retin A and don't with the Micro version.  After just a couple of weeks of use, my skin is glowing and I am 61.  This will become a regular part of skin care from now on. 
Acne	-,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female		4/15/2012 11:39:30 AM	I have mild acne. I have been on Retin-A micro for approximately 9 days. I apply it every evening. I noticed the results after the first night, and by results I mean, what I expected to occur. My skin began peeling and more spots appeared, but as I mentioned, this was expected. Then, after a couple of nights, the spots started disappearing as my skin continued to shed. At first I struggled with the peeling, but then I began a routine of Cerave hydrating cleanser at night to remove makeup and then rubbing my face with a mixture of granulated sugar and moisturizer which I would then rinse off in the mornings (this got rid of all the shedding skin). So far, there's been noticeable improvement. I have confidence that this product works.
Acne	hopeful, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/4/2011 1:59:43 PM	Starting to see favorable results after 3 weeks of daily use at night.  Need to keep your skincare regime simple to avoid interaction with other products that can cause a chemical reaction (burning, stinging &amp; peeling), including cleansers.  Regular vaseline gives instant relief to any flaking and itching, which has started to subside with regular use.  Use only sparingly amounts of moisturizer as even the mildest contain a boatload of harsh ingredients.  I only use a cleanser at night and rinse with warm then cool water in the morning.  Also avoid foundation makeup, including minerals, if you are serious about wanting to clear up.  By not over stripping my skin I have a nice natural glow.  This is helping much more than Differin, Duac or Tazorac (which practically burned the skin right off me).
Acne	blackrose504, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	12/5/2010 9:30:14 PM	This is only my second week on it,and yes I am experiencing the redness,dryness(itching)and a mild burning. Yet I plan to stick with it, I was told that these effects go away with using it consistently. It is very important to use a very mild wash and to use a very good moisturizer and sunscreen. I was recommended a product like Eucerin or Cetaphil they are gentle and contain sunscreen. But any light moisturizer with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide works as well.  
Other	ECG, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	65-74	10/11/2010 10:53:37 AM	I have only been using the product for a little over a weeek.  I'm looking for a moisturizer that will not burn. I know to wait, after cleaning, before using, but even several hours later, my face burns when I put anything on it.  It doesn't burn when I apply the retin A only after washing it off in the AM. My Dr. gave me a sample of Aveeno to try but my face burns. Any suggestions?
Acne	missl, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	13-18	5/13/2010 5:41:47 PM	My skin is scaling and burning when I touch or wash my face.  The acne seems to be disappearing, but with this price, I'm not sure if it's worth it.
Acne	shemelly, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/30/2009 12:25:57 PM	I was on Retin-A Micro 0.1% several years ago for chronic acne, but my insurance would not pay for it, so I went back to &quot;old reliable&quot;--birth control pills.  Other than the BCP's, the only other treatment (besides the Retin-A) that has ever worked for me has been mega-doses of tetracycline, which has damaged my liver.  Obviously, the antibiotic is no longer an option for me.  A few years ago, I began having seizures and had to begin a new regimen of medications which rendered my BCP's ineffective.  As a result, my acne returned with a vengeance.  Having dealt with this condition for 20 years, I was desperate enough to pay full price.  Being nearly 40 with a pre-teen daughter, it is terribly embarrassing for me walking around with a face-full of hideous bumps.  I did commission my insurance carrier, however, and with a prior authorization, they have agreed to pay for my Retin-A prescription.  In a way, I wish that I had never stopped using it all of those years ago.  I am currently going through the &quot;sunburn&quot; phase, but I know that in a few more weeks, I will once again have the complexion of a seven year old.  While this medication works wonders for me and countless other, it may not work for everyone.  It is very strong.  I, personally have tried everything on the market to no avail.  I would only recommend seeking treatment with this if you have tried everything else and are still having complexion problems. 
Acne		5	5	5			8/15/2009 2:04:02 AM	I have been on this product for only 3 weeks and Luv it!!!

Acne	minilopmay, 13-18 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	6/20/2009 9:44:47 PM	My acne did get worse at first, and my face got a bit redder, but after a few months my face was completely clear of acne. After using it for a year I only get a solitary pimple here and there/on rare occasions. Retin-A also helped heal scarring.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	5/1/2009 5:17:02 AM	I had a horrible experience with this product. I used it for 8 months and for the entire time my skin was constantly flaking and peeling off no matter how much I moisturized. It was even more disgusting than acne and impossible to cover up with makeup-makeup wouldn't even stick to my skin in that condition. Furthermore it did not clear my skin or reduce my scarring. Not only did I continue breaking out but I actually started breaking out in bigger and more persistent pimples in places I had never broken out before! Since stopping this medication and switching to a benzoyl peroxide product I have noticed a significant improvement in my skin. I would NOT recommend this product-for me, it only made things worse.
Acne	RetinARadical, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/21/2009 12:10:27 PM	I had persistent acne (no redness) for a few years in my mid-to-late 20's. I am of east-indian background and don't have very sensitive skin.  I LOVE this product. It was a rough start, which we all dread when we start using the product but well worth it. At first my skin got shiny, peeled a lot and the acne got worst. I struggled a bit with my makeup to conceal what I could for work.  Within about 8 weeks it started to clear up.  Now I dont have a SINGLE pimple.  What is more amazing to me is that I dont have to use this product every day or every other day any more. I just use it once a week or so.  It seems that my skin is used to it now, so I dont go back to the shine/more acne phase. This is the best part for me.  Previously I had used Benzoyl P. products (akin to Proactiv): my sheets and towels were getting bleached, I was concerned about what the BLEACH was doing to my insides and if I missed ONE day I would have a flood of acne. Same thing with Salicylic Acid products. Although those two worked, I was dependent on them and my skin didn't look as good as it does know. For those of you who are using this for SCARRING, I would give it 3-6 months. Scarring generally doesn't go away that fast. I didn't realize it till I looked at pictures from December, just this week, but my scarring is all gone.  It's a dream really.  Also, FYI, I had no burning, stinging etc. I think it's because I used a very low dose (.01%) and it was Retin A MICRO. The MICRO component allows it to release slowly to avoid shocking your skin.  Best of luck!! Hang in there and it will probably work.  Often people who have success with products get lazy to write reviews and only the sob stories make it online.  Read reviews with a grain of salt. 
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/18/2009 11:00:10 PM	I like the medicine, though I agree that you have to WAIT at least 10 minutes after washing your face to apply or it stings. I actually was prescribed it to see if it could eliminate some scarring, sadly I haven't noticed a difference in that area though I am acne free. 
Acne	melissarn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/6/2009 11:06:19 PM	I used this when I was younger and had severe acne.  I eventually was able to get off all meds, but now, after 10 years of being off everything, I'm back on it.  My cystic acne, blackheads, and little whiteheads are creeping back into my life.  Ugh!  I worked for a dermatologist for 6 years and am now employed by a major cosmetics company (to remain nameless), and let me tell you that there is nothing better to help cure acne.  Yes, it will cause peeling and redness in the beginning, but if you stick with it, you will get the results you want.  A good moisturizer is a must (frangrance free, etc.) and sunscreen is also.  A lot of moisturizers now days have both in them.  The key is to stick with it and just use a very small amount where needed, and if you see irritation, back it off to every other day.  This is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone suffering from acne h---!  And in regards to aging benefits as well, it's true.  In fact, a lot of insurance companies will not pay on it until a doctor sends them a letter stating it's not being used for cosmetic purposes.  So, you get clear skin and help with some fine lines and wrinkles too!  Bottom line, it works, just stick with it and don't give up hope within the first month.  It's worth it!
Acne	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	19-24	2/1/2009 8:35:24 PM	I've been using the gel for about 3 weeks, in the first week my acne became much worse. I then started to have peely, red very dry skin. I went and got a new face lotion with SPF(sun protection) in it and no other acne medications included in the lotion because that can make skin worse combining medications. My acne is finally starting to clear up but my face is red and very dry. So for the past week i've been using it every other night...hopefully it continues to get rid of the acne and not dry my face out as much.
Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	12/28/2008 2:04:50 PM	After using consistently for a year my skin was clear but red,very dry and always peeling. Switched to Atralin which is less drying while extremely effective.

Acne	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	19-24	12/12/2008 4:04:42 PM	I used this, combined with an oral medication, in high school when I had bad acne. I tried Differin first, which was very ineffective. My dermatologist then prescribed Retin-A Micro, and it worked great. It got rid of troublesome zits in a few days of treatment. My only complaint is that it can really dry out the area of your skin on which you apply. This was not a big deal for me, I would just use a regular OTC hydrocortisone lotion for moisturize it and keep it from itching. Some dry skin is much better than red zits everywhere!
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	11/24/2008 10:16:21 AM	I have cystic acne on my chin as well as other pimples that I have been fighting for years. After many trials and tribulations I found a good dermatologist and she prescribed this to me as well as Duac gel. There is a transition process with the retin A, it does cause burning (temporary) and peeling, but that is because it is shedding all the dead skin cells, and as long as you exfoliate at least 1/week it's not that bad. I use it 3-4X week, any more than that might be too much for my sensitive skin. I also used a combination of salicylic acid and sensitive skin cleansers. Retin A has been the ONLY thing to clear my skin. I stopped using it for a few months because my skin was doing so well, but sadly the acne came back, but the retin A cleared it up quickly ( less than 1 month) so I will continue to use it. Just important to wear sunscreen!!!
Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	10/1/2008 8:40:45 PM	You have to be very careful about costmetics, and washes. They need to be gentle and not have any other acne treatments in the ingrediants. I found my skin is very peely. My skin definitely has less pimples.  I am going to keep using it.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/20/2008 9:59:20 AM	This worked for me. I had moderate but persistent adult onset acne. I was hesitant because of the warning that my acne may get worse. I started 1x every other night, then increased to every night. I think this lessened that part of the treatment. I have to be mindful of moisturizing or my face will get dry and peely. And I don't use any other acne drugs, just a good oil free cleanser. I have beautiful skin now. I still get a pimple here and there (5 a month or so). I can't pick them...my skin is tender and will tear. No waxing...no picking...moisturize, and be consistent and you can succeed on this drug. I reccommend it highly.
Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	3/19/2008 5:35:28 PM	After using it for a couple weeks I cannot go on with it b/c my acne has gotten so much worse and the peeling, dryness and soreness is not worth it for me to continue and see if it clears up.
Acne	lcw2008, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/24/2008 10:53:33 PM	Retin A has worked for me faster than any other acne medication however, I dont like the drying and peeling.  I haven't really experienced any burning though...just peeling and redness.  I work at a dermatology clinic so I get lots of advice and tips and the doctor there HIGHLY recommends Retin A and told me that over a period of using the drug for 5 years it helps with reducing aging.  He has excellent skin so I'm listening to him.  
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	5	Female	19-24	1/30/2008 10:13:01 AM	It burns pretty bad but they say beauty is pain. I guess if that's what it takes, I'll have to do it. I want so badly to have clear skin. 
Acne	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/23/2007 2:06:14 AM	It took about 4 months before my skin start clearing but when it start clearing, the scars went away, few line went away, my skin looked like it never had severe acne before.
Acne		4	4	5			12/8/2007 12:43:33 PM	
Acne		4	3	5			11/13/2007 6:20:33 AM	This was the only cream that has ever worked, although it took a few weeks to notice a real differance. I tried pro active aswell but after a couple of weeks with no real change I sorta gave up and stopped using it consistantly. I had to stop using retin-a when I became pregnant, and that was very upseting. not only did my acne come back but it came back with vengeance. If anyone has used product while breastfeeding let me know I what to get back on it asap!! oh also you CANNOT get your eyebrows waxed..at all! they tell you its ok if you aviod putting the cream in the surrounding areas for a few weeks..total lie that you'll regret as you apply a load of aloe to your raw skin.
