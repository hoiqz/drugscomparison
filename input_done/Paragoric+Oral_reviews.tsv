The doc said that this is a great drug and is an old drug so the new docs dont know how to prescribe it and are scared because it is opium based.  He said no prob.

Nothing settles it down, but this old remedy.  I have had N/V/D for 6 days now.  I awoke again this morning with no relief.  Even my mouth tasted like acid... I told my doctor that sometimes in the past this has been the only thing we could find to get my stomach and intestines to start working like they should again.  He ordered it for me.  It is hard to find a Pharmacy that carries it, but after 1 tsp of syrup, I was able to ear dinner with my family for the first time this week.  I got a little bit of an upset stomach, but it subsided quickly, and I can feel my gut healing already.  I don't know why this drug works, but it sure seems to work for me when I have this kind of a problem.

When the cramps were real bad a little paragoric with water was the only solution. It was inexpensive and would last indefinitely in the medicine cabinet.

Other	marc3, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	3/5/2009 3:49:25 AM	During my teens, I was given Paragoric when I had a stomach ache. Within a short time, my ache was gone. I would take only one or two doses per stomach ache occurance. This was a usual treatment for my colitious. After age 18, the condition stopped. After taking a colonoscopy exam 47 years later, my stomach aches just like when I was younger. Now, there is no remedy to relieve the pain. I am looking for a pharmacy that still makes drugs from scratch to fill a perscription that I will ask my doctor for. Its rediculous that I will have to go to Mexico to get my pain reliever.

We have recently been told that it is no longer being made and the pharmacy is having alot of problems finding it.  Has anyone else heard this problem and if so know where or who will be making this in the future?  
Diarrhea	Annie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	2/16/2009 8:11:23 PM	I have had Crohn's disease for the past 20 years of my 40 years of life. Diarrhea has been a part of my everyday life.  About 5 years ago my Gastro. suggested I try Pargoric to see if it would lessen my diarrhea and weightloss, from all the diarrhea. It has been the only thing that helps those days of 15 plus trips to the restroom.  I take it twice a day, when needed.  It really helps me not have to rush to the restroom before I can even finish my meal. The taste is terrible and burns all the way down, but it keeps having to the restroom as much, most days.

Diarrhea	Jeff B, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	11/23/2008 6:01:41 PM	I have Celiac Disease. This drug is invaluable when I accidently ingest gluten. The alternatative is lamodal which uses gluten as a binder. This makes it unsuitable for me with Celiac. It is a lifesaver. It is still availablein the US with a prescription but must be made at a compounding pharmacy.

Other	I1BlessedMomma, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/11/2008 8:28:07 AM	I was a very young mom and my little boy has severe colic. He would scream 8 hours straight every afternoon. It was so hard on me and my husband worked a lot. The doctor told me to put paragoric in my little boy's bottles 3x a day. He never told me when to stop and me being too young to really think that it might hurt him, kept giving it to him for 3 months. The doctor realized this and took him off cold turkey and it was like someone coming off of drugs. My 6 month old screamed like he was in horrible pain, threw up, shook, the whole 9 yards while we got this drug out of his system. It breaks my heart that I wasn't better informed on this medication, I was only 19 at the time. My son is now 9 and has learning disabilities, believed to be from being drugged during a crucial growing time in his life. It's extremely heartbreaking for me as his mom. I trusted my doctor, I should have been better informed.Yes, it made him stop screaming, and he was a happier baby, but I'd go back and endure the screaming if I could undo these problems he has now. He's a great boy, he just has a horrible memory, and has a very very hard time reading and comprehending. 
Other	Jacobite, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/28/2008 5:50:18 PM	I remember Paragoric from childhood. My mother kept some on hand and anytime we had a tummy ache a teaspoon of coke with a few drops of paragoric would work wonders. We didn't become some drug crazed addicts as a result either. Nowadays our government in all it's infinite wisedom has made it so sick people cannot get this awesome pain killer over the counter (or at all that I know of), but drug addicts can pick it up or something stronger anytime they want. My childs pediatrician looked at me like I was from the Armenian drug cartel when I enquired about Paragoric because my son had acid reflux issues, which I knew it would have releaved his pain.&quot;The man who trades freedom for security does not deserve nor will he receive either.&quot; - Benjamin Franklin

Other	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5	Male	65-74	4/9/2008 3:21:35 AM	I had a very upset stomach while on a business trip back in the 1979's.Stopped in to a small drug store in rural NC.,The Drugist gave me a very small dose of Paragoric and relief was almost imminate. I now suspect I have some food poisening, and believe that Paragoric would give immediate relief. Doctors should once again be able to perscribe small doses to patients, While in Mexico, I once again had food posioning and was given a very small white pill. Relief came in less than 30 minutes. The question is,Wht in this great country do we not have this drug with stringet controls for relief of these maladies?
