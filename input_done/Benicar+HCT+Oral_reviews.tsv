I have severe arm pain, so I researched my statin, Crestor, and now Benicar HCT.  During my research I find that either of these could be the culprit.  I take prempro and paxil. I got a shot of cortisone in my arms 21 days ago, no pain anywhere.  I will re-integrate the meds slowly to see which is the culprit.  I think no meds is better than the side effects...My bp is not too high now that I retired. 140/80!

Unfortunately, it is expensive without insurance $130+, excessive sweating and urination (HCT/waterpill side of the drug), and impotence. Well, when my time comes, I will be sweating like a mule and eating Viagra like tic tacs, but my blood pressure will be fantastic.

High Blood Pressure	fedup, 65-74 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3		65-74	11/14/2011 10:23:32 PM	I have been taking Benicar HCT for approximately 8 years and it has controlled my blood pressure adequately.  However, I have began noticing ringing in my ears that is constantly getting worse and I do have leg cramps at night.  I didn't realize that it could be the drug until I read some of the comments that are posted on this site.  I am also, like many of you commenting, a prisoner of insurance companies who are too busy trying to dictate to the doctors what drugs they should prescribe instead of trying to help their policy-holders afford their drugs.  I have been put on generic Hyzaar - 100/12.5 mg and will try this because of my insurance not paying for my Benicar HCT and to see if the ringing in my ears will cease.  I appreciate all the comments.

High Blood Pressure	ckk8cw, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	5/16/2011 1:07:35 PM	Benicar has worked very well to lower my HBP and keep it at a safe level. I feel good on this drug and I don't swell in my hands and feet. My Dr recently changed my med to Losartan and I'm noticing alot of side effects. Reason for change is that I no longer have medical insurance so I really can't afford Benicar but Losartan is also very costly and I don't feel well with it. I would like to go back to benicar.

Each day I took it, I felt worse &amp; worse. 1st came the dizziness, a feeling of just plain ill health &amp; suddenly a sharp pain under my ribs. Took Rolaids thinking indigestion--but no, by morning, the pain was worse, my mouth started watering &amp; and I was throwing up! I'd never advise anyone to take this med. I'm not a puker, really takes a lot to puke, nothing different in diet except this med! Went off it, took an entire day of feeling lousey (18 hrs) b-4 felt better

I thought it would be great taking one pill. Now I feeling weak, light headed, after 3 months and I feel restless. At times my blood pressure drops really low. I stopped taking and started taking the hydroclorized and hoping my doctor will put me back on cozzar. My pharmist thought it weird my doctor put on this after losing 24lbs. I just have to say be very careful taking this. I think more studies need to be done on this drug.

By the end of FEB 2010 I started noticing joint/muscle pain in my arms and legs. I was sleeping alot even when I should be awake during the day. At work it was hard to keep from nodding at times. Very strange, for me,  when I had a full nights rest. I felt tired all the time. My arms hurt to raise them and were weak. Edema in my hands, legs and feet. I was not on any other medication. I was very concerned. I got in to see my doctor but not until April 2010. He changed the medication to Triamterene HCTZ 37.25 last week. So far I notice my joints are still hurting but not all the weakness as before. The edema is going away. I am alert again thank goodness! Thanks for letting me share this if it can help someone else.

Had a case of psoriasis for the first time in my life at age 70 but could be from my other drug, but doctor said only rarely does it have this side effect. Have leg cramps and joint stiffness with this drug, but it beats coughing my brains out from lisinopril that I took for 8 yrs, then I changed doctors.

I was on the plain Benicar which didn't work as well.  Only side effects which I didn't think too much about until reading other reviews is VERY dry skin, dry mouth at night and a cough.  It is pretty expensive, especially when you have to gget it every month.

I was 220/190,walking dead. I had tried 7 other drugs prior to this one,and they only lowered my pressure just a little. I suggest walking a lot to keep up your energy when using this drug.

This medication is not for sexually active adults. This medication can cause erection problems and lack of interest in sex. I never had erection issues before but this medication made matter worst. I read all the reviews on webmd and I am thankful to people who posted their experience with this drug. I am sharing my experience as well..

During this time I haven't had any real issues with this drug, other than a constant need to urinate. I usually take it at night. I rather get up during the night to urinate than try to find a restroom all day long. In any event, I believe the drug worked well for me in the past.  It did lower my blood pressure nicely. However, recently I've been experiencing ringing in my ears. My doctors were unable to determine what is causing it. I'm not totally sure it's the Benicar. But I did note that other users have stated that they too have experienced ringing in the ears, since they've started this drug.  I do plan on stopping use for awhile to see if the ringing goes away. If it does, I will leave another comment regarding my experiences with Benicar.

High Blood Pressure	bringingsexyback, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	10/16/2009 7:00:13 PM	Since I just started taking this medication today at 5pm central standard time Benicar HCT 20mg/12.5mg.  My rating for its effectiveness and satisfaction is not accurate because I have not used it long enough to give a accurate rating.  Since it is only once a day, that makes its use an ease.  I can tell you that all through this month I have had blurry vision but it suddenly began to clear up a bit after just one hour after I took it.  So hopefully this is a good sign of even better things to come.  I will report on its use daily around this time for the next week.  Hopefully, I will stay side effect free but, I will report my personal experience with Benicar HCT 20mg/12.5 as the days go by.  See you all tomorrow.

Lowered BP but with the cost fatigue,blurred vision,heavy eyelids,general overall aches. EXPERIENCED EXCRUCIATING FULL LEG CRAMPING!! Relatively certain this med contributed to, or caused lumbar spinal nerve and disc complications I experienced near paralysis to lower extremities for past 4 1/2 months including right foot drop, the side on which I experienced the most severe cramps. Stopped taking Benicar HCT 20/5 after 45 days. Doc said &quot;no way&quot; med had any link with my subsequent physical condition. Have slowly recovered with aid of physical therapy. Believe my body flushing this med out of my system as I am regaining functions.

My bp went from 150/110 down to 110/80. At this time, I haven't had any adverse side effects and it seems to be working.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	2/11/2009 8:43:24 PM	Started on an ACE about 3-1/2 years ago.  Started having a cough, and my BP was not controlled.  Was switched to Benicar, and the cough was gone in a little over a week.  I read the posts on this drug, and had to respond.  This drug did what it was suppose to do, lower my blood pressure.  I have not had any side effects and I have been on it for over three years, no kidney issues, fatigue, etc.  In fact this is the best that I have felt in years!  I was a little dizzy at times for the first few days, but my DR told me that is was just the medicine lowering my BP.  He said that it took many years to raise my BP to 180/120, and I was lowering it in a few days.  That would cause the dizziness.  Sure enough in a few days it was gone.  My BP has remained at 117/ 75 for three years.  I cant ask for anything better.  Yes it is more expensive than a generic.  I pay $20 a month.  Ask your DR for samples, they will give them to you each visit.  For me the $10 increase in cost, over the generic, far outweighs the side effects.  As far as the people that have crazy side effects, and stop taking the medicine, and within a day or a few hours they are gone, I dont think it was the medicine.  These drugs take weeks to get into you system, and weeks to get out.  Even after you stop taking them.  Maybe it was all in your head, or was it something your friends at the local Bingo parlor told you that they experienced, and now you have it to.  The mind is a powerful drug in its own right!  Give the medicine and chance, and let it do what it is suppose to do.  I read that one lady said that her husband lost his libido on this drug.  Viagra, and the other ED drugs are failed BP drugs.  This drug should help his little soldier stand at attention as she said.  If you do research on this drug, you will find that it fights the hormone that constricts the veins.  If more blood is flowing to parts of the body, then...  Think about it!  Good luck with this drug, you will not be disappointed! A++

It was a god send he felt great re-energised,he said his mouth dry a lil, but no big complaints. he has been on it over a year and recently he has lost libido. I only seen 1 other comm. on this.its not full on E.D. but interest has declined alot and sometimes his soldier wont stand at FULL attention any ideas from you other guys? only 1 other have this? but he has been very pleased with med. untill recently anyway. he says it still works great for him. any comments welcome.

Er doctor said I needed to speak to Dr. about bp med.  Also had many problems on benicar hct.  Rapid heartbeat, feet cramping , severe diarrhea, feeling like everything inside of me was going awry,and just not feeling well at all.  Saw my Dr. and a heart Dr. but couldn't find anything wrong with me. I was sure the diuretic in the benicar was dehydrating me and pulling everthing out of me. My insurance made me switch to Diovan HCT and I still had the same problems.  I suspected the diuretic in the bp med but was told it was not. For 10 months I was sick with these symptoms.  In October I told the Dr. I wanted off the diuretics.  ALL SYMPTOMS WENT AWAY. Am on diovan 80 now and doing GREAT.  Please watch the diuretics!!!!! They could be your problem.

My joints do hurt but didn't think it was from this drug. Worst part is not able to do much because everytime I start doing something streanous my heart races. I have tried several different meds and with all heart medicine the first month of taking is always the worst. I don't have insurance so I get sample packs from my Dr. I do beleive however that it is the reason I have depression problems. I am a young person so fealing the effects of being old is very diffucult for me to handle.

BP immediately dropped.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	45-54	9/26/2008 6:08:10 PM	I was on Hyzaar.  My insurance co. decided it would not be a preferred drug.  I tried benicor HCT.  I was OK for 3 weeks.  Suddenly I became very fatigued and felt drugged.  I had terrible knee pain.  All I wanted to do was sit or sleep.  My eyesight seemed to be quite blurry.  I couldn't concentrate.  I went off the med this morning and went back to Hyzaar.  After just one day off the benicor, I feel 1000% better, my knee pain is gone, my eyesight is better, my energy is back.  I don't care if the drug lowers my pressure, the side effects aren't worth it... especially for a lousy insurance company.  I'm back to Hyzaar and back to being normal.
