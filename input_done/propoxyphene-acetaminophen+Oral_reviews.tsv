Pain	EEB, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	7/16/2009 2:55:13 PM	Take it for relief from a large bone spur on my foot.  If it's taken before the pain gets to severe and then another taken 4 hrs. later, it works great.  I've not experience any ill effects from this medication.  It takes approximately 30-45 min. to start taking effect.

However, did not relieve the pain of having dental work.  The medication only caused slight relief, and other pain relievers were needed.
