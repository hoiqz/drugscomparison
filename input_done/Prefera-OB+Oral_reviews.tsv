Love that this does not contain DHA, because I have problems with Lipase in my milk.  Easy to use, and I don't have any side effects.

Pregnancy	Babyme, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/5/2009 4:35:29 PM	I am 11 weeks pregnant and started taking Prefera at 6 weeks when I went for my first OB visit.  I chose to take it at night because it's easier for me to remember at dinner.  I have had nights of waking up very nauseas and gassy.  When I take it in the morning, I'm fine, but still chose to take it at night for memory purposes.

Pregnancy	 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5			12/18/2007 2:43:55 PM	I love this vitamin because it doesn't upset my stomach. I was on another brand before that was really hard to tolerate during my first trimester. I switched to Prefera OB and I haven't had any nausea or stomach upset related to the vitamins. Great!
