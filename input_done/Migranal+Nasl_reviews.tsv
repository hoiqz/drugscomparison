Migraine Headache	Patrick Kotara, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	9/11/2012 10:44:29 AM	I have been using Migranal Nasl for about five years with little or no problems.  My Dr started me on Viibryd about six weeks ago, about five weeks into the Viibryd I started having electrical like flashing in my head and affecting my eyes.  On September 5 2012 I had to take the Migranal for a migraine, on Sept 6 I started having a severe allergy reaction that still persists today even after getting a cortizone injection yesterday Sept 10.  My Gastro Dr stsrted me on Dexilant on August 10 2012. I have been tested for Allergy's three times in my lifetime each time the only thing that shows I AM NOT Allergic to is cedar of all things.  I am having difficulty understanding what triggered the allergic reaction I am experiencing and why Im not getting much relief with antihistamines and the cortisone injection.  My facial skin still feels feels like its on fire, I am still itching all over every inch and every part of my body. Aveeno Lotion has helped the terrible burning sensation that started with this out break.  I stopped taking the Viibryd on Sept 6th, the flashing in my head has stopped but all the other symptoms persist.  Is it to soon for the cortizone to take full affect and can you offer any help understanding what triggered this allergic reaction. If anyone is interested in responding to me, my email address is: patrick.kotara@tstc.edu

Also, you're not supposed to tilt your head back or sniff in the med, so when you spray it in, it just comes right back out

Migraine Headache	HaiBarefoot, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/17/2011 9:46:06 PM	I went to my doctor and my neurologist for a new onset headache. I've always had migraines and have taken other medications before, but this new headache was not like a normal migraine, and persisted for about a month.. Migranal is a lifesaver! after two days (four doses) my month-long headache is gone!
Migraine Headache	TammyLynn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/8/2011 3:42:08 PM	I have been on numerous migraine medications over the years. I currently also use Trexamet and was only prescribed Migranal as a backup when water is not available. I administered my first dose on Saturday and was do surprised at its effectiveness and rapid end of my migraine. I absolutely had no side effects from migranal. Many migraine meds make you feel weak, tired, numb, even nauseated. I experienced none of these symptoms with Migranal. This is a great treatment. YAY.

Triptans did not work for me at all, and acetaminophen gave me rebound headaches. I've been using Migranal for about 3 years and have only had 2 migraines that it couldn't relieve.  The taste is awful and it irritates my nose but that is minor compared to the side effects of other migraine meds. Assembling the spray pump is a pain especially when you are in pain. The cost recently skyrocketed but luckily my insurance still covers it.

Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/22/2010 10:03:31 AM	This stuff is a life saver! If I take it at the first sign of a migraine it will take care of it within an hours time frame. however, if I wait it is harder to get ahead of the migraine! I get migraines that have lasted weeks - now with migranal - hour tops and it is done!!

In between my preventative meds (about every 6 months) I get migraines about every other day.  I have never tried anything but Migranal cause I have never needed to.  It is very easy to use, and usually knocks out my migraine in 30-45 minutes.  This stuff is a life saver.  I have actually started taking it every other day BEFORE I get a migraine, and tat seems to work too.  I don't think I should keep that up for very long, but I am almost back to my preventative, so I will be done with migraines for the next couple of months.  Whew!

Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/2/2009 11:32:15 AM	A truly miraculous drug for me.  I get headache from menstrual cycle and maxalt gave disturbing side effects, axert did nothing.  The 1st day it brought it down to level 5, the 2nd day I woke up with level 2.  Took it again and now it's completely gone.  Bad taste, irritated throat, but who cares when you've been in pain for 10 straight days.  What a relief!!
Migraine Headache	Bill, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	3/11/2009 6:47:28 AM	Overall this is the best I have found to work.  And it is not habit forming.  It is not perfect BUT it knocks the pain down to a level that I can handle.

Side effects include very stuffy nose, bad taste and some anxiety due to the caffeine contained in the medication. Works within a half-hour and effective for several hours. Overall an excellent medication for migraine headaches, dihydroergotamine is an oldie but a goodie.

Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/16/2008 12:40:06 PM	I was having the worst migraine of my life! I had been in a cycle for 2 weeks and nothing would stop the pain. The neurologist said it was probably a bad rebound so he gave me the rx for the spray. I took it for 3 days in a row. My head felt better after the 1st dose but I did have some leg pain after a few days. Nothing like the head pain though! Whew! I had never had a migraine like that before. I couldn't even lift my head off my pillow for days. I tried other meds first, but this helped.
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	6/8/2008 1:42:15 PM	It helped break through a 2 week migrain. It dried my nose, didnt like the taste. Caused some muscle pain in my legs as a side effect, but I finally could function.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/30/2008 1:31:37 PM	This has given me the fastest and best relief of anything I have tried so far (I have tried many different meds. for migraines). The only draw back has been that it sucks all of the moisture out of my throat and sinuses. I drink a lot and use a nasel inhaler to help with this.

Migranal has relieved my worst headache within 15 minutes. This medication is great!
