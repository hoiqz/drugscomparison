Tri-luma has been the only thing that have worked for me, with the exception of a few spots . I got rid of 90 pct of my dark spots in about 5 weeks. I am using the generic ( compound) form, because the cortizone in the brand name is too strong for me

Yellow-Brown Patches on Skin	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/11/2011 2:56:18 PM	I have severe melasma on my forehead, cheeks, and upper lip. I had tried multiple creams in all price ranges but none had lightened the stubborn dark spots. My doctor suggested I try Tri Luma and it is a godsend! My spots have lightened about 90% although I have very small spots remaining. I feel like a new woman! I'm no longer embarassed to go out in public. I can actually wear regular make up that is not caked on and my skin looks so much better. Tri Luma is the absolute best treatment I have found.

Yellow-Brown Patches on Skin	tara, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/13/2010 7:09:32 PM	I had terrible hyper-pigmentation on my forehead, nose and cheeks(thanks to the EVIL tanning beds). I am in week 6 of using Tri-Luma.  It was worth the money.  I have noticed the fine lines have disappeared and the brown patches are almost gone.  I have a few stubborn spots, but the embarrassment of the discoloration, is fading with the fading of the melasma.  I plan to use it for the full 8 weeks, and if I have to take a break, and then re-start the treatment to finish off the last of the brown spots...that is what I will do....love, love, love it!!!  
Yellow-Brown Patches on Skin	35-44 Female 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	7/27/2010 5:02:46 PM	Don't Buy it. I got rid of the malasma by consuming 2,000 miligrams of vitamin C every day, and applying fresh slices of cucumber with lime on my skin daily.I also stay away from the sun and drink lots of water.I had malasma on my face after using birth control pills. I tried Triluma after reading an article on a magazine.Berore I tried Triluma I had malasma but my skin was very soft, I had no wrinkles. After I tried it my skin got very dry crating wrinkles, I had no elasticity in my skin and the malasma got darker,. It was a nightmare. I felt horrible. It took my a while to find a solution to get rid of the darker malasma. the wrikles and loss of elasticity stayed. 
Yellow-Brown Patches on Skin	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/20/2010 2:52:38 AM	I noticed brown spots on my cheeks and dark coloration on the skin above my upper lip, which is very embarrassing because from far away and in certain lighting, it looked like a mustache. I have been using this cream for about 4 weeks and have noticed a difference. The first week of using it, the area of skin I applied it to started to peel. This only lasted for 2 or 3 days, I just kept using the cream as normal. What I love about this cream is that you only put it on at night, so in the mornings you can apply face lotion and makeup. The only down side is the price and avoiding the sun, Especially when you live in Florida. But overall a great product!
Yellow-Brown Patches on Skin	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	7/18/2010 12:10:03 AM	I am about to enter week 4 and all of the lighter patches of pigmentation (left over from a bad birth control experiment) are gone. A few stubborn spots remain, but are far lighter than they were. I'll probably stop after week 4 then do another go around in a few months to use the rest of the cream up. Seems a shame to waste such expensive cream and even if I have no further improvement in the remaining spots, my skin seems to glow when using this cream. I had purchased some $20-$30 creams that claimed to help out with tone before this. Wish I never bothered, this cream is the best.  
Yellow-Brown Patches on Skin	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	6/22/2010 11:57:20 PM	I've used Tri-luma for eight weeks and it lightened the very dark brown pathes on my cheeks quite a bit so that I didn't look scary anymore, however once I stopped using it, the spots started to darken again.  Also, I'm a medium complexion African-American woman and the medication lighted in areas I wish it hadn't.  It made my complexion still discolored but lighter.  How long is the waiting period?

It's week 3 and the spots are almost completely gone. I feel normal and handsome again. I've used 2% OTC hydroquinone for a year before this and it did nothing. Must be the combo of the ingredients in Tri-Luma.

If anything it will make things even worse for your skin!!  Tri-Luma might appear to better your spots but then after a couple of weeks the spots come back with much more dark color.  I don't know why they selling this &quot;junk&quot; It is a nightmare.  I am now back to getting rid of my spots; first of all; using desowen to get rid of the irritation for at least 15 days; then, I found the best produt ever: Sunbright, the difference on my skin is absolutely amazing!

I apply it every night.  My face is rather red however 80% of the brown spots are gone.  I have a few tenacious ones that are disappearing at a slower rate, but definitely going.  I will report back if the spots reappear, but so far I am absolutely delighted.

I have used this for 8 weeks and have seen enormous improvement.  At first your skin will get a little dry and red, but keep with it.  The side effects get better and the results are worth it.  I am now taking the &quot;break&quot; recommended and will use again to remove the last of my now faint spots.

I'm hispanic, so my skin is olive so I have a tendency to have quite a bit of discoloration on my skin.  This stuff is expensive, but works.
Other	Maria Olsson, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	9/19/2009 5:01:37 PM	Hi! I am a russian who has migrated from Sweden to the USA. I have developed melasma (dark spots) under my eyes and on my forehead. I visited a dermatologist in the USA, FL about 1 month ago. He prescribed me Tri Luma that contains 4% of Hudroquinone. Have you ever read about Hydroquinone?- I asked him. As I investigated it I found the information that hydroquinone has been banned in many european countries including France, Sweden and Russia etc, for concerns about increased cancer risk.The FDA admitted that the risk of using the drug is not known and more testing needs to be done.In fact, the FDA also warned that hydroquinone has been linked to a condition that disfigures the skin. Anyway,I tried the cream, a sample that the doctor gave to me. He prescribed to use it twice a week - Mondays and Fridays. It was terrible!!! I used it just once a week on my pigment spots because my skin got red, burning and after 1 week it was peeling. Some doctors prescribe to use it once, twice a day!!! I put it on only once a week. Ok, after 1 month, 4 treatments I have the result: my pigment spots have not been improved at all. Moreover, the skin is burnt and now I have very obvious dark red-brown spots. I really look terrible. I can't put on any sunscreen because the skin is damaged by Tri Luma. I am so happy that I didn't buy the full size cream which costs $200 and the insurance doesn't cover it. I don't want to buy cancer for $200. Thanks. I've also contacted russian and swedish doctors. They've forbade to use it strongly!!! They've suggested to use natural products such as juice of lemon, parcley, put camomile teabags on dark spots, oatmeal etc... and of course, avoid the Sun. Please be aware, read more information online.

I use it (for 1 week) and twice a year and i always get the greatest compliments from friends and even the Avon lady is speechless cauz she has nothing to top Tri-Luma.  Expensive but totally worth it.  :))

Really hopeful.  Just a note, researched alternative prices...Canada offers it for around 140 and in my area it is about 200.  Maybe you could get it from there.  I have had malasma for a few years and also have tried lots of things.  Spent lots of money on products that were not helpful.

Save your money to pay for this cream because it is expensive, but worth it. I saw a big change on my melasma in just two weeks. I am on week five and my melasma is almost all gone. Your skin will peel a little and it will be a little red, but it wont hurt like a chemical peel would.
Other	dt, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/3/2007 12:41:23 PM	Tri Luma is a wonder drug that cleared my brown spots that i have battled for years. I tried other products such as Obagi and it was too complicated and cumbersome to use all 7 steps each day, twice a day. Tri Luma is only once a day and did not irritate my skin at all. I recommend this product to anyone that has sun spots, brown spots or freckles they want to disappear.

It vanished all my acne scars in less than 3 weeks. The only problem is the price. I wish is was less expensice so I can purchase some more. Other than the price it's great!
