I didn't prescribe it often, especially after release of the newer antipsychotics, but it is extremely valuable given its low side effect profile, especially low rate of weight gain (in my experience). I hope someone out there has the clout to persuade someone to resume manufacturing this drug.

My mother took it for 8 months.  She is now permanently disabled.  She cannot eat or drink.  She has to have a feeding tube put in her for the rest of her life.  She has uncontrollable head and mouth movements.  Along with uncontrollable movements in her legs.  She is only 63 years old, and had been in good health.  She will never be the same again!!!

She has to take Cogentin to counter act the side effects.  However, this drug has done wonders for her and is a life saver!  She could not take Abilify either.  She had horrible side effects from it.  However, my husband takes Abilify without incident.

Moban, though seldom perscribed anymore, has kept me out of the hospital for the last 12 years. I have to take it at night to avoid side effects.
