It took over two months for my stomach to recover although it is still very sensitive. The numbness has improved but not gone away.

And I was warned before taking it that it can cause some really weird reddness and burning, but to keep taking it and it would go away, and it has, they have even increased the dose from 500mg to 1000mg, and it doesn't bother me. No more burning or reddness.

I've only had a few times where I had a reaction, with super-hot skin and tingling.  I found that if I took another aspirin when I had that feeling, it went away within 10 minutes.

High Cholesterol	DLMMRM, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	45-54	6/26/2009 2:40:41 PM	I have only taken this the last 4 nights at 500mg. I have had none of these side effects. Do they come when the dose is increased? I have not been on long enough to know if it's working for me or not, but I'm satisfied because I'm not having the aches that I had from all the 5 statins I had been on in the past.  One question though - is there a generic for Niaspan yet? My new insurance will only cover generics, so I'll be paying the sky-high price for it if not.  Thanks.

High Amount of Triglyceride in the Blood	Jennek, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	3/29/2009 4:08:43 PM	 This medicine should be taken off of the market!! The doctors should not have this medicine in their office as well!!My body was burning hot to the point where I couldn't cool off, even with freezing cold water.  My whole body was tingling and I started to feel warm then burning hot and my skin actually did hurt.  My face was puffy and bright red and felt extremely tight...I couldn't even move my lips for a few minutes.  I had to lay down on my moms' bed (my son and I are visiting for spring break), with a washrag and ice on top of my face.  I was trying hard not to cry because it truly frightened me and I didn't want my 10 year old to be worried about me.  I want everyone who is prescribed this medication to make sure they can handle the side effects.  If I weren't laying down, I would've passed out flat on the floor.  I do not reccommend this medication to anyone.  I'm going to go to weight watchers and I'm going to start exercising.  I'm done with these medicines.  Good luck to everyone out there.  Remember ask your doctor about &quot;flushing,&quot; do not take any medicine without reading the information that comes with it.

High Cholesterol	Niaspan, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	2/10/2009 11:39:42 AM	WOW I agree with most.  Took it and within 30 minutes, I was flat on my face for 25 minutes.  I could not even get to the telephone to call 911.  I will never take this drug again.  The burning began at the top of the head and endend at the chest.  Thats the last thing I remember.  Thank god for carpet to soften my blow.

I had to have 48 hrsof fluids and my electrolites replenished. This medication is not safe.  The Doctors thought I was having a heart attack I quit breathing. it was a very violent reaction.

My whole body turning red and itching.  First time I thought I had an allergic reaction to a new memory foam mattress I was trying out for a possible bed replacement.  Ended up in the emergency room.  I didn't know what the heck was going on.  Was given benadryl and another medicine.  Symptoms went away.  Then a few days later sat down to eat breakfast and  the burning, itching, and swelling was there again.  Was told by family member to STOP taking the medicine and call doctor when holidays over. Wouldn't recommend this drug to anyone.  Got to be a better way.

My physician says it's a known side-effect, but I find it quite disturbing that the body exhibits such a dramatic negative response.
High Amount of Triglyceride in the Blood	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	11/4/2008 2:53:07 AM	I experienced a severe side effect of burning from my neck to my knees accompanied by a fine red rash and itching which initially I thought was prickly heat.  I have experienced hot flashes in the past; this reaction was no hot flash!  It was an outright BURNING sensation with an intensity that rendered me completely incapable of assisting myself for a good 5 minutes.  I felt the drug company literature completely inadequate at informing me of the possibility of such a severe reaction.  This drug may prove beneficial but I feel the severe side effects outweigh any benefits.
Low HDL Cholesterol	zemski, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	65-74	10/5/2008 12:03:35 PM	I was taking 500mg per day.  The doctor increased the dosage to 1000mg per day.  I had no ill effects with the original dose.  The increased dose has caused itching, hot flashes.  I will tolerate this condition until my next doctor visit.  
Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	9/23/2008 8:55:18 AM	wow, I'm glad i came here and read these other reviews! I thought i was having a severe allergic reaction to the medication, but it seems all the reviewers had the same symptoms as i did! I stopped taking it and didn't have any time to let the meds workd cause the reaction was so bad. Itching, hives, burning sensation, etc....this medicine needs to be removed from the market!

Low HDL Cholesterol	rdee, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	2	3	Male	55-64	2/14/2008 2:00:31 AM	It seems to work to improve my cholesterol ratings. However, it does cause some occasional flushing. They have recently introduced a new improved form that does not produce as much flushing. The tablets are orange in color as oposed to the original white ones. I do take one 81 mg asirin 15 minutes prior to taking Niaspan with Crestor.
