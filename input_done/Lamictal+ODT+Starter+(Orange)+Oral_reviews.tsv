Fit	Susa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	2/16/2012 7:07:28 PM	I have been on Lamictal for 8 years. I started it for mild seizures. It works. I also notice I am less anxious. I have no side effects. It does not change my thinking, as a anti-depressant would. I still have to work on my &quot;stuff&quot; baggage. It slows me down enough to do that.it is not a miracle drug. It does not numb you, you must do the work. Several of my friends with Bi-Polar are also on it with success.

Bipolar Depression	Tryinghard, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	55-64	8/18/2011 9:38:13 AM	I am on my second week with this medication. Perhaps this isn't long enough. I find that I am having mood swings. Dr. never said I was bipolar. Since adding it to my other meds at night I am sleeping solid but have a hard time shaking it off in the morning.

Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	35-44	1/1/2011 11:11:20 AM	I have been on this med for about 2 mos.  Have not seen any improvement, in fact, symptoms seem to be increasing.   It is very easy to use and does not leave an after taste, however, don't feel benefit is worth continuing.
Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/22/2010 12:47:44 PM	I have been on this medication for about 6 weeks now. I am so glad that I am. I haven't been cycling, or depressed since about week 2. I am still able to feel really happy, or really sad, or angry, with sufficient reason. But they are rational reactions rather than me just going off into a cycling mood without cause.

She has Autism and ADHD and has been having seizures and the doctors don't know why. When they run the test nothing shows up but this medicine works really good for her. She is even doing better in school. The only bad thing is it cost so much money and have to keep fighting insurance company to get it

Tossing this one down the toilet too!  It almost doesn't seem like trying anymore sometimes.
