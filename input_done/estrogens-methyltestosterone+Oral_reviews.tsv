Was amazed how much it helped.  But that was only temporary.  I have since gained 20 pounds without changing my eating habits.  No more for me. Note to others: I have finally found relief of my hot flashes by simply taking a multi vitamin.

I started out on a higher does and was changed to a lower dose a couple of years ago.  It doesn't help me as well as the higher dose did but my doctor wants me to go off of them completely.  I compromised with the lower dose.  I have tried to go completely off but get really depressed.

I've tried everything I could think of too get rid of hot flashes, nothing really helped. Was on premarin years ago and stopped taking it. My libido is gone, so my doctor suggested I take this one. I've been extremely dizzy!!! Very nauseous, but I'm certain, or I hope it stops soon after my body adjusts. My breasts are sore. But thats nothing compared too hot flashes.

I have seen zero increase in libido.  I have seen an extra 20 pounds added to my stomach, hips and thighs.  I work out 4 days/week on a treadmill 40 minutes each.  I'm active on the other 3 days.  My breasts have gotten huge!  I already had adequate size and didn't need to see additional growth.  Very displeased with the results.  What else is out there for us who have had a full hystro and over the age of 50 with hot flashes, night sweats, low energy (throw in an under active thyroid too) and lack of libodo?  This drug was able to level out my mmood swings - that is all it has done.

Other	lefty725, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/9/2009 9:39:22 PM	I had a partial hystro in 1990 and started taking full strength in '97 due to libido problems. I switched to half strength 2 yrs ago without any problem. In June '09, my prescription service took Estratest off their formulary. My doctor's MA then talked me into stopping HRT due to risks. My life turned completely upside down (hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, unable to sleep thru the night, problems with libido - I was starting to feel like a zombie due to lack of sleep). Switched to a female doctor and she put me back on half strength just yesterday. I can't believe how much better I feel with just one dose. I actually got a good night's sleep last night!!! This incident has taught me a very valuable lesson - I will never again allow a pharmacy or a doctor's MA dictate what I can and cannot take!!
