This was my fourth time on chemo.  Started out taking 4,000 mg per day, on 14 days off 7.  After second cycle developed hand-foot syndrome. Treatment put off for 7 additional days and dosage lowered to 2,000 mg. After 7th cycle severe hand-foot syndrome intolerable.  Had to stop Xeloda and go back to IV chemo. Recommend alcohol free lotions.  Overall, I was pleased with the effectiveness of the drug.
Other	FWT, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	6/22/2012 6:03:53 PM	I was now in my second cycle of Xeloda of 5000mg a day for 14 days and resting 7. I will do this for 6 cycles. This after radiation,xeloda and surgery to remove rerctal tumor. The combo of radiation and xeloda shrink my tomor from silver dollar size to what my surgeon said was the size of the end of his finger. No problem with any of this but a little fatigue in the afternoon.I was told that I went from Stage III to stage II after radiation and xeloda.I am satisfied with the drug and my treatmwent. Only ime and test will let me know how it all worked but so far so good.

Lymph Node Positive Colon Cancer	Nicola, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	1/10/2012 2:34:27 AM	Xeloda killed my 49 year old partner of 20 years. Darryl was the fittest, healthiest 49 yo I had ever known.  In February 2011 he was diagnosed with stage 3 bowel cancer (we since have found out it was hereditary &amp; unfortunately his family overlooked mentioning this to us).  He had successful surgery &amp; chemo was recommended as cancer was found in 2 lymph nodes.  (The oncologist referred to this chemo treatment as &quot;spraying for the possible weeds&quot;). Darryl died as a result of incurring a ventricular fibrillation after completing his 3rd cycle of xeloda.  Unfortunately he had no warning of the VF, we enjoyed a great lunch, went for a walk up a gentle hill one afternoon, he felt slightly short of breath at one point, sat down &amp; collapsed into a ventricular fibrillation. He had absolutely no previous history of heart problems.  We opted for a full autopsy and his heart showed no blockages or clots.  The oncologists have verbally admitted they believe Xeloda caused the VF.  The oncologists at the time of the initial consultation very much played down the side effects.  I have since made several complaints to the Auckland Oncology Department in New Zealand and they are currently considering adding a disclaimer which reads something along the lines of &quot;although it is very rare, chemotherapy could result in death&quot;, this needs to be approved by their Legal Team I am told. I am absolutely devastated at the death of my beloved life partner Darryl and absolutely furious that the full dangers of this drug were not disclosed to us.  I have since read several medical case study reports which clearly show coronary problems are a serious side effect of this drug. My belief is people need to be informed with all the facts &amp; potential dangers of any drug they may choose to undertake. Only then can informed decisions be made.  Had the full dangers been adequately explained to Darryl &amp; myself I know 100% Darryl wd not have opted for chemo, as he preferred the holistic appro

Began 5000 mg daily. Hand and foot syndrome  was interfering with my job.  Reduced to 3500 mg and 6 months later a Petscan revealed NO trace of cancer. Now on 1000 mg daily for maintenence. Some fatigue, hand foot sensitivity, neuropathy, joint pain, dry eye, dry mouth, irritability toward end of 2 week treatment. Supplements: fish oil, turmeric, B-Complex, Multi-Vit, Green Energy drinks (wheat grass, barley, kelp etc), 75% plant-based diet. Yoga. Google: PH balance and cancer. Google the cottage cheese flax seed recipe.  Google the research on Turmeric. Good information.Also prescriptions: 300 mg 3 X daily Gabapentin for neuropathy, low dose .5 Xanax and 5 mg Ambien to relax and sleep.  It seems like a lot but it helps along with meditation and increased time spent in nature gardening, playing with my dogs. I continue to work full time.  Have my hair, it is a little thinner/dryer, but Sabastian Drench products have made my hair very healthy.  Grape seed oil on nail cuticles is helpful or use neosporen.  Best lotion for skin,feet, hands anywhere you are dry is Aveeno Extreme Relief. Would recommend Xeloda, but urge patients to supplement with natural alternatives and advocate for selves if side effects become overbearing.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/28/2011 10:06:30 PM	My father had a severe drug reaction to this drug.  After only 2 days of this drug he went into the hospital and never returned home. He had a white cell count of .2 within a week of starting this drug, uncontrolled bleeding on his face and in his mouth, doctors say he was bleeding all through out his GI tract. He could not maintain platlets and in turn passed away. This was a man whom was never sick a day of his life and had so much more to live for.  Just a warning to people...drug reactions are real and they happen to real people. His doctors told him he might feel a little tired and get a rash on his hands and feet... that's a far cry from death after 2 days of treatment. Talk to your doctor's and pharmacists and do all the research you can...If the cancer doesn't kill you the drugs can.

Oct 2010 right lobe of liver and gall bladder removed. Dec 2010 2 lymph nodes showing activity. I began taking Xeloda 1,000mg twice a day January 2011. My feet peeled 3 times. I had diarreha regularly. My hands were sore and my eyes watered constantly. In June my Oncologist said I had very highlevels of toxicities and stopped the Xeloda. A PET scan last weeks shows the lymph node on the stomach is greatly diminished. The one on the aorta on my back is smaller and showing less activity. I now have an 8mm lesion on the right lobe of my liver.

Have had the Hand &amp; Foot Syndrome a few times, mostly the tips of my fingers looked and felt like paper cuts. Had the mouth sores once, and that lasted about 10 days. Ease of use not great as pills are huge. They made a smaller pill at first, then somehow they couldn't get it anymore at my Anthem RX plan. Feet are more dry than normal, but that's about the worst I've experienced. As to how long I may be on it- MD says we'll get as much mileage as we can with it.

All drs said not side effect of Xeloda. HA..Was previously on 5FU infusion, after 8 days was put in ER with severe chest/back pains. They diagnosed me withacid reflux. My chest and back was exploding. If you experience this, get to ER and make them do a cat scan or check for blood clots. This is serious stuff. I survived by the grace of God on the second ER visit.This is life threatening side effect in rare cases you may get it on either 5FU or Xeloda which is essentially the same thing...5FU.

No diarrhea, but Taxotere causes constipation so maybe they are cancelling each other out. CT scan showed 40-50% shrinkage in my lymph nodes and lesions on my liver so I can tolerate some peeling hands for these kind of results! I take a multi-vitamin, extra selenium, and eat lots of protein bars too which I think all help with my energy levels.

Very rare in the U.S.. Lucky me!!! I am a 69 year old male. I have taken xleoda now since June 2008 to the present. In Jan 2007 I had the left lobe of my liver removed and ducts and was declared cancer free, had &quot;0&quot; margins at the incision. Xeloda turns into 5FU in your intestines. My cancer has shown up in my peroteneum, with several small nodules. Has been the same size for two and one half years. I credit the slow growth and the absence of new lesions to the xeloda, so do the doctors.

After having surgery to remove the side of my colon that the cancer was in I was prescribed Xeloda for six months. I experienced extreme hand and foot syndrome, where my hands and feet would throb in my sleep and throughout the day. Every crack in my hand ached and peeled to the point that I had to wear gloves all day, including to bed. My hands and feet turned bright red and I formed sores on the bottom of my feet and could only wear Uggs or slippers. It caused me to have insomnia and strange dreams, this along with the other side effects lead my oncologist to take me off from work until I had completed my six months of chemo. I was extremely tired most of the time and lacked energy. I recommend Gold Bond hand cream or Ca Reez for the hand and foot syndrome. Believe me when I say that I tried every cream and lotion imaginable to try to assist with the itching, burning, and blisters. These two, especially Ca Reez, helped to ease the pain. Though the side effects were extreme I would prefer this treatment over IV chemo or radiation anyday. The benefits were worth the six months of discomfort. Once the medicine gets out of your system for a few months you will go back to feeling normal.

I had 6 months of FOLFOX after colon resection and removal of my ovaries.  I had no evidence of disease after surgery and starting chemo.  However, 6 months after finishing chemo small freckles on my lungs, and 1.8 cm lesion on my liver.  Back on chemo, this time FOLFIRI.  Had good success with this 3 of 5 freckles gone, liver lesion down to .5 cm.  They put me on Xeloda for maintenance.  I take 4 (500 mg) tablets twice a day.  I have some neuropathy in my feet from IV chemo but it hasn't seemed to worsen with Xeloda.  They warned me to be aware usually on the 11th day (today) for redness and even blistering.  Praise God not so far.  The worst side effects I have experienced are headaches, joint pain and stiffness, and slight nausea at times.  We shall see how my blood counts are on Friday.  CT 2 - 3  months out.  Good luck to all of you and may God Bless you richly.

It seems to working as my extreme bone pain has nearly gone away. I have not had hand and foot reactions, but I get sores on my legs that are very itchy. My face and arms have become darker and freckled, probably as the result of sun exposure. I also have lost some taste as part of my tongue is somewhat numb. I developed mild pneumonia last spring and now have fluid behind my other lung which has been drained 4 times but keeps recurring. They have found no evidence of cancer in the fluid so the cause is unknown. Related to Xeloda? No idea.  All in all, I am happy to be able to take it without having severe side effects.

When Avastin stopped working, my oncologist suggested Xeloda due to me having a mutated Rask gene.  The only thing that happened was a severe reaction with painful feet and hands and my levels going up instead of down.  So this did nothing for me.

My side effects began with very much pain in every part of my body. (This may also be the Avastin). I have developed hand-foot syndrome. I've lost all the skin off the bottoms of my feet and I'm now my hands are peeling. IMy feet and hands are very sesitive to anything with a texture. I even have trouble opening a water bottle. sometimes i want to stick my feet in buckets of ice! but most of the time it is bearable. I treat my feet with a layer of pure aloe vera gel and then a layer of Eucerin cream.  I tried Udder Cream but my feet were on  FIRE! I just recently developed severe eye irritation which I brushed off as bad contacts or pollen in my eyes. I finally went to my eye doctor and he found severe eye irrition and swelling in my cornea. After speaking with a corneal specialist, he determined it was the result of taking Xeloda. I am now using gel eye drops and antibiotic eye drops. In a week or two it should be cleared up. I hope this helps someone who is wondering about Xeloda side effects!

I have been taken off the drug, and they assume I have vascular disease of the small blood vessels perhaps due to diabetes. Be careful and report any unusual symptoms.

Minimal GI cramps and low blood counts, fatigue, &amp; shortness of breath but recovers pretty well during the week off. The MD's are watching his heart function as the treatments have affected the pumping action causing the shortness of breath. He has another staging in Dec. Last staging in Sept. showed slight shrinkage off the pancreatic and liver tumors. He was diagnosed the 3rd week of July.

Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	11/4/2009 2:41:23 PM	I am writing as an update. I was the person diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer that spread to the liver. As I previously wrote I went into remission after 4 months of taking Xeloda, Oxilaplatin and Avastin. To further update you my tumor came back slightly in the wall of the esophagus in May of 09. I was operated on in July to have the esophagus removed and today November 4, 2009 have returned to work again fulltime. I am having my bloodwork checked every 4 months and petscans every 6 months. I am also being advised by Surgeon and oncologist that it is very unlikely that the tumors will return. While Xeloda may cause drying and cracking of extremities my using cream nightly took care of those issues. I used xeloda to different degrees for almost 8 months. I was on origianlly 5 pills in am and pm then down to 3 in am and pm and then 2 twice daily. There are side affects but in my experience everything worked out as well as you could have hoped. You must stay positive and do not let negative thoughts enter into your treatment. I was even told by relatives to make sure I had all my arrangements in place to make my passing easier on my wife and children. I hope my experience helps you and your family.

Occasional dry mouth, minor stomach cramps (rarely) and some diarhea, which could also be partially from the RT.  Overall it wasn't too bad.  I'll find out soon how effective the RT/Xeloda worked.  I will have surgery to remove the tumor in the coming months.

The first two weeks I was on 5-500MG pills;twice a day..I ran a fever, had constant running to the bathroom day and night, upper gastric pain..well, you get the idea. The doc lowered my dose to 4-500MG pills-twice a day the next two weeks with everything improving BUT the trips to the bathroom...eventually I was lowered to two -500MG pills twice a day after I lost the skin from my feet(they are nice and soft now)they did nnot hurt me as much as they freaked out the doctor...Udderly Smooth helps IMMENSELY)I am on my last two weeks; my blood work(hematicrit and hemoglobin) are higher than they have been in 6 and years my cancer marker is lower than normal peoples'(whatever that might mean)NOW if my hair quits falling out I should be fine...

Looking at another 4 months of use.  Each cycle (4 pills twice a day) of 2 weeks on and 1 week offf, the side effects hit earlier and harder.  Mostly feet are cracked and painful -- like walking on broken glass.  Tons of cremes help a little, but most stop working after a cycle.  However, it's all worth it -- my tumors are shrunk by 2/3 are it's still working.  Joy, oh joy.

After receiving carbo, as an IV chemo it blasted away the left side of the liver and although it saved my life the side affects were awful.  Now taking Xeloda 500 mg/day 2 in the am and 2 in the pm, I have quality of life.  CA27-29 has dropped but after being on this drug for 5 months the numbers are now holding around 85. Only feet get sore and red, no diahrea, but some muscle soreness.  Sure beats the IV chemo. After not working for a year,I have returned to work 2 days a week.

My hands and feet are very sore during the last one or two days of my &quot;on&quot; weeks.

Doctor did not recommend standard chemo cocktail as being to harsh for Mother to handle.  We decided to start her on Xeloda 4 pills (500mg) daily and have gradually increased to 7 pills with minimal side effects.  She was fatigued and dizzy shortly after taking morning dose (not sure if due to this drug or other meds that she takes) but appetite has been good, very slight nausea and no diarrhea.  Dispensed by crushing pills in yogurt-bad tasting and large for her.  After 8 mos cancer has spread to liver.  Currently evaluating whether to pursue other options including irinotecan iv. As with any medication, recommend to take with small meal to reduce side effects.  If concerned about this drug, I suggest to confer with doctor regarding beginning with low dosage to evaluate tolerance.

He has never had a Heart problem,  However since his surgery with Colon/Rectal cancer there has been numerous problems with the latest being an adverse reaction to the drug Xeloda.  After determining there were no clogged arteries and identifying his use of the drug above it has been brought our attention this was and is a side effect. We were given numerous side effects of the drug however never told this could be a fatal side effect. The diagnosis was due to taking the drug Xeloda, my husband had what is defined as Acute Myocardial Infarction - NSTEMI secondary to vasospasm.  He was sent home with Nitroglycerin and diltiazem. He has been instructed to stop using the drug Xeloda.

I take the Xeloda for 14 days and then have a 1 week break. I have noticed pretty severe joint pain, mostly in my shoulders, wrists and fingers and also have developed insomnia.

She started on Xeloda on Jan.18,2008 along with her first infusion of Oxlaliplatin. She became sick with nausea and severe diarrhea on Jan 27 and was taken to the hospital on the Jan 29th. We were told it was a severe reaction to the Xeloda and they could not get the diarrhea under control. She was not able to eat much and became worse. On Feb. 4th,2008 she passed away in the hospital. we believe it was due to the Xeloda. Be very careful and get immediate attention at first sight of severe diarrhea. while on the Xeloda. We believe the Xeloda is the reason she died so quick. 
Other	herfriendsusan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	2	3	Female	25-34	2/6/2008 7:57:23 PM	My good friend, Catherine (who is in her mid-twenties and was in excellent condition), is suffering from Liver Cancer, which has spread to parts of her lungs and spine. She was diagnosed May 2007 and is on several chemotherapy treatments. One month ago (or less) she was prescribed Xeloda due to previous medicines' side effects. However, Xeloda is giving her stomach problems possibily due to one if its side effects of not being able to keep food down. Can anyone recommend foods that easily digestable alongside this medicine? Also, you may read her story and leave a note in her guestbook at her website: www.caringbridge.org/visit/catherinehutton ... Thanks! -Susan

I have been going along, doing CAT scans to track cancer spot growth on my lungs. Now I am near my end, so the dr. wanted me to try the Xeloda oral. First dose caused severe trouble breathing, severe dizziness, extreme muscle weakness, blurred vision, chest pain, so cold they had to pile blankets on me, and edema. This was not for me. These are all signs of &quot;a very serious allergic reaction&quot;. All I am saying is have medical help handy when you first try it. Maybe take it the first time in the dr's office, or sit in the local emergency room's waiting room. That was my dr's suggestion.
Breast Cancer that has Spread to Another Part of the Body	James W Moore, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	1/7/2008 6:35:23 PM	Xeloda killed my mother.  She died on December 27th, 2007, ten weeks after starting a Xeloda regimen.  She was 83, and she was in very good shape before beginning her treatment, in spite of the presence of secondary liver cancer (breast cancer metastasis).  The drug destroyed the lining of her digestive system, and allowed a combination of bacterial infections to attack and kill a portion of her small intestine.  She was within hours of death when emergency surgery repaired her intestine on 11/24/07.  It appeared as though she would recover from her surgery, but she contracted pneumonia while hospitalized, and her system was too weak to fight back.I am heartbroken.  I don't want my mother's death to prevent others from seeking proper treatment, but everyone should be aware of the dangers presented by bacterial infections that could cause major damage while this drug is being administered.James W.
