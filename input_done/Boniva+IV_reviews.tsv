However, the fact does remain that since its use, I cannot walk more than one block and suffer severe and debilitating pain. Nothing shows up in tests that could be contributing to this 'extreme' change in mobility.  Coupled with the fact that there has been no real significant changes in my bone density, I see no reason to continue injecting this toxic, foreign substance into my system.

Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	anon	1	1	1			1/2/2012 11:08:36 AM	I had my 4th Boniva injection in my left arm last week.  My doctor prescribed the every three months shots.  That night I couldn't sleep on my left arm.  First time ever.  Weird.  Felt like worms were racing through it and it also felt kind of numb.  It still feels like that. The next day I ached all over my body in places I didn't even know I had.   I mean, everywhere.   I thought I really must have some kind of flu.  This has lasted several days now and I've felt really achey and sick.  I'm reading these side effect notes from other people and now I know for sure that my &quot;flu&quot; is from this last Boniva injection.   Will talk to my doctor but I honestly don't want take Boniva ever again.  I don't want to feel this sick - it's horrible.    The first three injections I received had no side effects at all.   I'm just about to have my first bone scan since starting them.

After 9 months of quarterly infusions, I am now having more esophageal pain, severe photophobia with daily headaches and jaw pain.  Today I had several jaw xrays taken and I will be having an esophogram later this week.  Boniva is poision.
Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	10/5/2011 8:41:17 AM	This is my second injection.  The nurse had a false start and went outside the vein.  My arm began to ache a day after the injection.  I have loss of nerve sensation along the radial nerve path and severe pain in the nerves that control the thumb and pointer finger.  It has been three weeks now.  Ibuprofin 600 mgs nightly to sleep through the arm pain.  Can't sleep on the  arm that was injected due to deep throbbing pain.  Seeking help this week as the reaction seems to be perpetuating.  Heat and rest help, but symptoms become acute when I use the muscles of my arm and hand.

But my last bone scan showed improvement, so I am continuing the shots.  This last time I developed a pain in my shoulder blade that feels like a knot that won't go away. It's been there on and off for about 4 days and is keeping me up at nite. I am now considereing stopping the shots because each reaction seems to be getting worse and I'm afraid one of them may become permanet.

I tried telling my doctor that I was having problems after each injection - swelling, a hard knot, pain, and a hot spot at the site.  He said it was not the Boniva and talked me into taking another injection.  That was a huge mistake.  The medication I have been on prescribed by a neurologist is now losing its effectiveness. The pain is returning, at times my arm goes to &quot;sleep&quot; and at other times I wake up with my arm alternating from feeling on fire to freezing. To top it all off my bone denisty did not improve while on the medication. It actually improved when I got off Boniva and started taking large doses of vitamin D and increasing my weight resistence exercises.

Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	kanga66, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	1/16/2011 10:28:49 PM	My mother has been taking Boniva for several years now. Before she left for Florida in December, she had a calcium check at my urging. It came back that her calcium was low even with the Boniva. My calcium came back low also (it was 8.1) and my doctor recommended that I take a Tums with every meal. After just over 2 weeks, I had my calcium re-checked and it was up to 9.5. When my mom told me the results of her calcium test, I recommended she quit the Boniva and start on the tums since my calcium increased so much. Since she is paying so much a month for the Boniva compared to what a bottle of Tums cost, I would highly recommend trying the Tums since I saw such an increase in my calcium test. It may not work for everyone, but I saw the results of taking a Tums with every meal for just over 2 weeks in my reports of my calcium. I have already been diagnosed with early stage osteoporosis and will continue with my Tums regimen. I also have an allergy to milk which contributes to my low calcium, but like I posted previously, my calcium has gone up with the Tums.

I was told by the Dr. that Boniva does not work on the hip area. He wants to put me on the once a year Reclast injection. The reviews on that scared me, and I havent taken it as yet.
Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female		11/29/2010 6:35:06 PM	I had 3 Boniva injections over a nine month period.The first one was tolerable with perhapssome achy muscles for a brief time. On the secondone, shortly after the injection I felt a tremendous pressure rapidly spreading over the chest cavity. It lasted maybe 10 minutes. The doctor dismissed my reaction saying there was noconnection to the injection. The third time I had the exact same reaction but also experienced some fast nausea and a surge of water that accumulated in my mouth. Who knows what was in store for me on the forth injection? I gave up Boniva and that doctor. He told me after a bone density test there had been minimal improvement on Boniva. I gave up  that poison and now with another doctor I am taking Evista. 
Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	Queen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	9/26/2010 9:57:21 PM	I had my first and last Boniva IV on Sept. 23, 2010.I was told I may have flu like symptoms for 3-5 days.Well, 24 hours later I had such joint pain I could not even walk. My neck, back, chest,  knees hurt so badly. I I had trouble sleeping with pain every time I attempted to move. It even hurt to breathe and I felt like something was sitting of my chest. We called the Dr. and he said this will pass. Thanks, I hope so!It is now 3 days since the injection and my joints, especially knees, are so swollen I have to hold on to furniture to walk. I so wish I would have researched this drug before I had the IV. What is this drug doing to our bodies to give us these side effects and how long do they really last. No one seems to have an answer for any of this. I feel so mad at myself, because I am a person that researches everything and for some reason I did not research this properly. I asked lots of questions to the nurse practioner and she reassured me that the side effects would be mild, if I had any. This is NOT mild and I have beat myself up about this.The pain in trying to walking was just horrid. I am confined to the couch with a disabled husband that needs my help. What a mess. Please do not take this horrible drug.

In addition to a complete hystorectomy 8 years ago and steroids constantly for about 10 years I have developed osteoprosis.  I had 2 doses withheld while trying to resolve some dental problems, but have resumed taking Boniva to prevent further bone problems.  The biggest problem I have had is attitude of dentist when they find out that I have taken iv Boniva. Three dentist refused to extract roots of bad teeth so that I can  have permanent bridge implanted due to fear of osteonecrosis of jaw.  I am grateful to the Boniva for improving bone density.  I had over 12 rib and other bone fractures before taking Boniva and none since then. I think this is a miracle and don't know what I would due otherwise.  I have severe GERD so my doctor and I quickly decided on the iv route of adminstration. I have  had no infiltration of or other iv site problems.  I usually go home and take a nap after receiving the Boniva and cannot say that I have had any other problems.  Hope this helps.

Other	BluRydge, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	10/6/2009 5:30:37 PM	I ended up with osteoporosis because of a nutritional deficiency caused by an unrelated health issue.  I'm now on megadoses of Vit. D (once a week) and calcium supplements.  I've been on Evista for years, and in June of this year (2009) started Boniva infusions.  I had no problems with the first infusion, no side effects, etc.  My second infusion was appx. two weeks ago.  This time I immediately experienced a horrible metallic taste in my mouth resulting in nausea and heaving but that was over in a couple of minutes. That's been the only side effect I've experienced so far...no fever, no aches and pains, stiffness...nothing. I don't know why I would taste anything from an infusion but that's what happened. I also have no idea Why it happened the second time but not the first. But if that's the only side effect I have to deal with every three months, it's well worth that small amount of discomfort if the drug improves my bone health. I can't offer an opinion as to Boniva's effectiveness or my satisfaction with the drug because of the time factor involved before any results (or lack thereof) can be realized.
Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	KIKI, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	10/4/2009 2:22:50 PM	After just taking one Boniva pill, I experienced diarrhea, muscle aches and pains as well as joint pain.  It started the very next night and I have had only little relief three days later.  My back and joints still hurt and I feel run down as if I had a severe flu.  I was reluctant to take this medication and I wish my doctor had disussed potential side efffects more clearly before precribing this medication.  A pharmacist informed me afterwards that the medication is very corrosive to the stomach and causes significant side effects in some people immediately and for some people years later.  I am appalled that such a medication is given without specific discussion of the harmful effects.  From the information I have seen so far it appears that the side effects don't outweigh the benefits for many people.  There seems to be limited effectiveness and people are put through intense pains for little benefit.  I had Chemo in 2005 for four months and the side effects are similar.  With such wide ranging negative effects on the stomach and digestive system, muscles and joints, and potentially more serious consequences in terms of swallowing problems and ulcers etc., this medication should come with prominent and multiple warnings so people can make an informed decision about taking it.  I will discontinue it immediately and hope that it has not caused longterm damage.  I would not recommend it without extreme caution.

The ease of the IV  drew me to Boniva.  I have really severe pains in my shoulders and my arms. The doctor says they are not related. They only started after the first injection so I'm convinced there is a relationship between the drug and the pain. I'll NEVER use it again.Beware Boniva!

I had been taking the oral Boniva with no side effects. With the infusion I have been experiencing a reaction in my thigh bones of both legs. It feels like I have run a marathon when ever I do anything that involves walking. I cannot find this side effect anywhere to be able to describe it to the doctor. He keeps saying &quot;what does it feel like?&quot; I don't have any other descriptions.

In oct 2007 my echogram for heart murmur was ok.  In oct 2008 the echogram showed something wrong with the heart.  I am now in the process of waiting to see a surgeon for a valve replacement.  In Aug 2008 when I had the IV I swelled in the face the next day but it was gone on the second day.  I have had more problems with diarreha and swallowing food.  Also I have gottenn a terrific pain in the left leg which has been ckd for blood clots.  I am wondering if anyone has had the same symptons.  It was really noticed by my thyroid doctor before I took my shot in Aug 2008.  Thanks

After taking the IV Boniva for the 3rd time,my body went into an inflammatory response that i have never experienced! It affected my eyes &amp; lungs to my suprise and fear!! I have never felt this way in my life! I was very fearful for my well being. As i was coping with this,..the most scarey part of the inflammation,...i was also having to deal with the massive pain throughout my body...my doctors were trying to individually treat me....not connecting the dots together as i eventually  did! I  had told each doctor that the only difference in my life was the boniva i was taking...no one put 2 and 2 together till i did!This has definitely stopped me from ever taking this drug again!!!I can't find anything saying this is a side affect,...but i will keep looking on the internet. It has taken me 2 months to feel better again and i'm not yet back to my old self. I just know it scared me to death and people need to know that this could possibly happen to them!!(By the way...i had no side affects the 1st IV, the 2nd IV i can remember not feeling great-body pain etc,...but it went away after 2 wks,..but it was never like the 3rd time!!!) I will take a chance with my bones and not take the drug and eat more healthy!!! Good Luck!

I had a low-grade fever, aches and pains in places I never had pain before.  I was nauseated, dry heaving, and had great difficulty walking.  I had difficulty swallowing, and I felt inflamed everywhere.  Pain would migrate from joint to joint, sharp in intensity.  After the three months was over, my doctor switched me to the monthly pill.  Unfortunately, the side effects are the same.  I will never take this poison again and urge everyone to research this drug before taking it.  Get your information from PATIENTS, not the so-called professionals.  I am sure that when more males take this drug and report its severe side effects, Roche and the medical profession will decide that, yes, something is very wrong with Boniva.  BEWARE BONIVA!!!

She has received a # of infusions over the past 2 years.  Normally, she has had no side effects; however, this last one on April 7, took its toll.  She awoke the following morning with back pain &amp; has continued with severe back pain for an entire week.  Hopefully, it will resolve soon; she is thinking that she will probably not take the med. again.  Worse than her former rib fractures she says! She hasn't had a recent bone density study to evaluate the progress either.

Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	Jenny, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	3/2/2008 5:33:49 AM	I had my first Boniva IV in September, 2007.  My appetite was poor, following it, with stomach distress.  I was very weak with severe pains in my hips and legs.  Unfortunately, I didn't tie these symptoms to the Boniva.  I had my second Boniva IV on January 8, 2008.  That one knocked me to my knees.  By the time I got home, my husband had to help me to the bed.  I was having severe abdominal pain and weakness.  It is now March 1, and I am still having severe side effects. Added to the stomach and abdominal pain is diarhhea after any thing I eat.  A snack or a full meal.   And I'm having to deal with all of this with little help from pain meds.  I have a pain management doctor, and I have called and asked for his help and to have an appointment.  He refuses to give me help and refuses to talk with me on the telephone.  My internal specialist says that she doesn't &quot;deal&quot; with pain.  I have paid $1,000 out of pocket for each of the IVs.  I feel totally abandoned by my doctors.  I would get in a pit of snakes sooner than I would ever let anyone give me another Boniva IV.  I am in pain 24/7.  I also went to my gastrointologist and had a CAT scan and colonoscopy.  The pain is so bad that I thought surely I must have something very serious.  His diagnosis, when he pulled up the information on Boniva IV, was that all symptoms are rare side effects to the Boniva. The tests showed that I had no condition that would cause these side effect.  It's now March 1, so I am looking for at least another month or more of this suffering.  I had breast cancer and chemo in 1996.  I am MUCH sicker from the Boniva than I was with chemo.  And I thought the chemo would kill me.

Called my Dr. and talked to the nurse that injected me and was told to put a heat pad on my arm and it should fell better.  But on Wednesday after sleeping with a heat pad on my arm, my whole body ached.  Every bone, every joint and all the muscles in my body hurt.  Called and went to see my Dr's backup Dr. because it was my Dr.'s dayoff.  The backup Dr. told me to put a cold pack on the arm and gave me a prescription for pain pills.  The backup Dr. told me to don't go back to work til Monday, Sep 17, 2007 told me to go and see my Dr. soon.   Thursday, I went to my Dr. and had some tests done, because my chest was hurting.  On Monday, Sep 17, I went back to work and where the injection was put in, is still red and holds fever, but the large area that is red has also gotten hard as a rock.  Today is Oct 9, 2007 and there is still hardness in the arm.  I'm hoping it goes away and goes back to normal.  I will not be taking the injection again.
