When taking any supplements that you may build a tollerane to, you should take some time off from taking it when you begin to build a tollerance.  Any supplement can be addictive so if you have an addictive personallity don't take it.  It's a wonderful supplement that I take off an on for college and or to control my weight.  Drink plenty of water and take in moderation.

If you abuse this drug, OF COURSE it can have potentially negative effects.  I started using this years ago when it was still legal, to lose weight and keep up with my long hours at work as a paramedic.  I lost 45 lbs in a few months and I pretty much loved everything about it. I will tell you that the &quot;negative&quot; side effects I noticed were dry mouth and increased thirst (never let your mouth stay too dry, for too long -- this is how tooth decay begins!), I definitely felt like I had a shorter temper than normal after being on it consistently for approx. 6 months.  This is when I decided to cut back... to once or twice a week, at most.  I can understand why the FDA banned this drug, but at the same time, I think that under a physician's care it can do A LOT of GOOD.  It basically removes your desire to eat... thus helping you lose weight and helping any weight related issues you may have.  It has been proven to drastically aid in the relief of asthma symptoms.  I believe that IF you use this drug in moderation, and fully understand the possible risks, it's a wonderful thing.  Unfortunately, this country is FULL of people who abuse all good things, so you're going to have the bad effects that come with that i.e. Mental issues, stroke, heart attack, etc, etc, etc.  Be smart people!!  All good things can cause damage if you abuse them!

Other	chronic cougher, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	25-34	12/8/2011 5:34:20 PM	I originally started taking ephedrin unintentionally while in college, in the form of diet/energy pill as sleep-replacement.  I had no idea what it was, all I knew was that it made me more alert, gave me more energy/strength, and let me pull all nighters.Even when they took it off the shelves, I had no idea what it was or what it did.  I didn't make the connection at the time, but a few months after I stopped taking it, I started developing a chronic cough.  My primary care Dr wrote it off as a cold (for 4 months?).  My ENT wrote it off as post-nasal drip induced.  Finally, after it got progressively worse, a pulminologist determined that my cough was triggered by low grade asthma (which I had as a kid, and &quot;naturally&quot; went away once I started taking ephedrin).  We went through 4 different types of asthma treatments, to varying degrees of success, none satisfactory.Last year, I scored some ephedrin from a guy at the gym, and finally stopped my chronic cough.Within a week after my stash was exhausted, my chronic cough returned.  My &quot;guy&quot; disappeared, and I need more ephedrin!
Asthma	Cortisone is a dangerous drug, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	11/26/2011 4:51:03 PM	Have used it as combination medicine 60mg with Doxyllamine succinate 25mg, ambuphylline 180mg, Phenylephrine 25mg continuously for 38 years to manage COPD. My asthma developed into COPD through cortisone treatment in my youth. Ephedrine and derivatives of ephedrine (used in combination with the above)saved my life and my health. Cortisone treatment including simbicort is dangerous and entrenches asthma. I have also done weight training/ body building while on this medication.At age 59 my lung capacity is 17per cent greater than average male of my age and height. The negative comments about ephedrine are ill informed. The medicine improves mental focus and general health. I have six university degrees and professional qualifications. Ephedrine is a miracle medicine.

Other	Roger H, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	1	Male	45-54	10/31/2010 9:16:23 PM	I have been taking this medication for over 20 years. What started out as an effective way to increase energy, over time, it took larger amounts in order to have the same effects. Now when taking over 600-800 millagrams a day, it surves little purpose other than help me marginally function with some energy. Without it, I think I would sleep all day long and not have a job. I would not  recommend use of this product to anyone, regardless of how it may start out to serve its purpose, because in the long run, it will make you age faster than normal, not to mention the long term emotional and physical affects.

Started to help with asthma and extreme fatigue. Grew into a problem with taking close to 1500mg per day. Glad it was banned luckyI am not dead. It has been 7 years since I quit and I still crave it. This med fried my thyroid, and now have chf, emphsema, copd, severe anxiety, just to name a few issues

Asprin killsmore than 1000 people a year. Moderation is the key. Too much of anything will kill you.Banning this product is a mistake by the FDA.

She took it as an upper to counteract her prescription drug abuse--morphine.  While it may have limited use in asthma patients, I would strongly discourage anyone from experimenting with this drug.  It altered my wife's moods greatly and our family has and still continues to suffer from her abuse of ephedrine.  She was a great lady who now suffers from extreme paranoia, irritability, and drastic mood swings.
Asthma	TampaFlorida, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/1/2009 10:58:23 PM	Incredible, what a completely dishonest one sided description of this herb, because that what it is, an herb used for last 5000 yrs effectively for asthma and breathing related issues. How many people do you suppose that would add up to?I treated my mild asthma effectively for several yrs with 25mg and have additionally experienced significant weight training and cardiovascular gains with an ECA stack.In fact I have known dozens of individuals equally satisfied by ephedra or an ECA stack.I also read that 4mil American used ephedra at the time of the ban, so it seems to me being punished a few abusing a drug, any drug, is absolutely ridiculous and of course an incredulous reason for its ban and demonization.How many people die from aspirin over dose per year, alcohol, or cigterettes?You appear to me a medical site; I suggest practicing real medicine, real science, and not out appease big pharma who cannot patent an herb that provides high level effectiveness at a low price.Get real!

It's kinda like 'Legal Meth' because your tolerance builds, and you take alot. I DON'T advise aNYone start..I wish they would disappear. ThanX 4 reading:)
