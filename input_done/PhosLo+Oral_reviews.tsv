Been on Phoslo the entire time.  About 8 months into this I experienced cronic diarrhea and it hasn't stopped.  That was almost two years ago.  Nausua and diarrhea are a way of life for me now because of the Phoslo.  I have tried other phosphate inhibitors, but their side effects intensify the problems I already have.  Guess this is the best there is.  Pitty.

He is in a nursing home in another city. He is on dialysis for kidney failure. He is prescribed pills at 667 mg 4 times a day. Last week he was ordered 3 pills at each dosage. He was doing okay and had no problems. Yesterday he told me they upped his dosage to 5 pills at each dosage and he is vomiting. At this dosage he is taking 13,340 mg per day. I am hoping someone can help me with what the recommended dosage per day for a 48 year old man, 130 pounds, and 5 foot 9 inches. I am trying to get ahold of his dialysis center but it is taking longer than I want. His doctor at the nursing home is a fruitloop.
