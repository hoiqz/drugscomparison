Injection to cause Local Loss of Feeling or Numbness	DSM, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	45-54	7/20/2012 3:28:58 PM	In no way would I want to scare anyone, because I think that Septocaine, may very well be an excellent drug, but I had a severe adverse reaction to this medication.  I  understand this to be rare, but I ended up in the ER after having this medication.  My body went into a shock-like state, while cognitive part of the time, I was unable to responded coherently nor physically.  My heart rate rose and I became very unresponsive to verbal requests.  While the medication worked great on blocking any pain (This was my first cavity requiring any drilling!), any future dental work requiring anesthesia will require me to be under general anesthesia. No drug is completely safe!

It's been 5 weeks and I still have some tingling in my face, my lower lip goes numb sometimes, jaw aches, etc. this is a horrible, horrible drug. I said it was effective because DURING the procedure I did not feel a thing not even the three dislocations.  Have been on anti-inflammotories for 3 wks and liquid diet for 4 weeks since i still cannot open my mouth the whole way.

Quinn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/9/2010 2:39:52 PM	This medication can numb my teeth when all other forms have failed.  I was facing having all my teeth extracted rather than continue suffering with other injections which did not work.  My dentist finally used Septocaine to numb and drill several teeth for crowns.  I only wish I had had this drug available to me years ago.

It was painful getting the injeciton.  The filling process was very painful and the rest of my life looks like it will also be painful.  It caused trigeminal neuropathic pain which I've had for over a year now.  If I had know about this drug I never would have gotten the 2 very minor fillings I was told I needed.  Now I'm not even sure I needed the fillings.  I've had dentists ask me why I did this since they were so small.  The worst part is The pain and constant chewing on one side of my mouth cause TMJ and I now need braces.  Oh!  But the dentist did nothing wrong.Don't be naive, get the facts before you allow any medical profession to inject you or do any procedure on you.

After the filling was done and over with, my face was swollen and my whole left side felt paralyzed. hat has NEVER happened to me before. It lasted about 7 hours. Then i was in extreme pain and my eye was numb. The next day my cheek bone was sore and my eye was itching and still numb. Now from my top eye tooth to the back molar on the top and bottom of the right side of my mouth, are in so much pain. My eye is still a little bit numb. DO NOT USE THIS ANESTHETIC!!!

Nothing tastes right, and I have been miserable. My dentist still remains optimistic that I will regain feeling in my tongue. I just want the constant pain to go away. Please do not let your dentist use this injection on you, even for routine procedures like fillings and crowns.

Face and mouth still numb even after 12 hours from first injection. Upper lip and left face became increasingly more swollen. Septocaine injection was given about 20-30 minutes after a Lidocaine inj. in the dentist office.
