Other	Karleen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/7/2011 4:43:48 PM	After a hiatus of several years, I have again obtained an Rx for this med -- through a compounding pharmacy. It works to reduce/eliminate my hot flashes.  My doctor told me it had been discontinued; she did NOT troubleshoot a solution until I did some research and found it could be supplied through a compounding pharmacy.  My insurance won't cover it, but it is $30 for 30 pills - well worth it for relief from the annoying hot flashes.  I am surprised that it is not better known to women in menopause who want a non-hormonal solution to hot flashes.

Other	Kari, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/27/2010 7:09:20 PM	My Dr prescribed bellaspas for my frequent hot flashes.  I was having 15-25 per day and night sweats everynight.  The bellaspas have reduced the frequency of my hot flashes to about 2 or 3 a day.  I have my life back again.  I did have to have the prescription filled at a compounding pharmacy.  It is not available in most chain drug stores.  For those of you who can't find it, ask your Dr for the name of a pharmacy in your area that makes up compounds.

It has stopped my hot flashes while taking tamoxifen since having breast cancer.  Have you heard about this?
