My glucose used to go from 186 after meal and drop to 54 within 1-1.5 hrs. later.

Published this week in Dr. Gott's column in local newspaper, patient reports using it for fatigue.  (no mention of diabetes)I do not have diabetes, but do have post polio fatigue.

Gas-X doesn't make a dent in the gas production.  I stopped taking it days before a significant event and the gas production went away.  I have discontinued taking Acarbose until I see my endocrinologist next month.  I need an alternative to Acarbose.  I discontinued Actos because of the fluid retention.  At least fluid retention does not produce gas.

But my blood glucose level was not significantly reduced? Fasting Glucose is still 110 mg/dL , though I have reduced my total caloric intake and very careful with carbohydrates intake. I'm borderline Diabetic and a retired pharmacistI will continue for few weeks before I discuss with my physician and at present taking 300 mg per day in three divided doses. This is the max dose recommended.
