Pain	michelle, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	11/2/2010 10:29:07 AM	I have been taking Balacet in place of Darvocet for over a year now. (fibromyalgia) I like that i'm taking less tylenol and i like the fact i don't have the euphoria as with other pain killers. It doesn't take care of all my pain, i consider it mild, but in order to stay off of anything stronger it takes care of enough for right now.
Pain	ajlandis, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/11/2010 12:41:42 PM	I have a 4mth old and have been diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my knee, and it really helps relieve the arthritis pain without knocking me out. I dont feel loopy or wried like other ones ive tried, plus I dont want to be like that having to take care of my daughter. I really recommend this to anyone with OA pain, and that wants something stronger than motrion and tylenol, but not making you knocked out

My spine slips on my pelvis.  I've had knee replacement and epidermals on my theracic and lower spine.  I've done acupuncture and now my doctor has put me on Balacet 325 which isn't giving me any relief.  I understand the reasons for less asperin because of my liver but there has got to be something out there that will keep me pain free or something close
Pain	Always in PAIN, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/21/2010 1:02:29 PM	  I have tried many differant pain meds. I have had 18 surgeries and have been in and out of the hospital my whole life. I really like Balacet. Darvacet always made me feel really wierd, not high wierd but just I felt nasty. Its hard to explain,but anyway I don't get that with Balacet. I am taking Methadone for my chronic pain and the Balacet for my breakthru. I am very well maintained on the two together. I highly recommend Balacet.

This medicine works great for my back pain from a compressed disk. I would recommend this over Darvocet or Vicodin any day&gt;
Pain	ZwolleBoiler,  Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male		7/10/2009 8:14:13 PM	Partially effective, with minimal side effects. However, seems to increase sensitivity to extreme heat (120+ degrees). Overall not bad for it's intended purpose. 
Pain	doodlebug, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	5/7/2009 10:17:42 PM	It helps with my pain, but it knocks me out, and when I wake up I don't know where I am at first and feel a little hung over.

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/4/2009 9:51:02 PM	I have several chronic conditions that cause moderate to severe pain.  Darvocet makes me sick, but Balacet does not.  It does not kill all the pain, and it gives me a slight headache, but it makes my daily life much more managable.  For me the effectiveness outweighs the side effects. It has been added to my prescriptions of muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatories that just weren't doing me justice on their own. I would recommend it as a starting point for anyone with a chronic pain condition.
Pain	Care Bear 911, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/13/2009 6:25:53 PM	I hurt my knee on the job and was diagnosed with early arthritis and now have mild to sever pain. One of these helps almost any pain I am having with no dopey side effects, two of them will knock me out which is usually the goal to help me sleep at night with out pain. And I can still wake up in the morning which is more than I can say for Tylenol PM.

THE MEDICATION DOES HELP SOMEWHAT BUT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR MY PAIN. I WILL CONTINUE TAKING IT AND HOPEFULLY WHEN I GET MORE BALACET IN MY SYSTEM IT WILL RELEIVE MORE PAIN.  MONA D.
