Pain	HELPMECONSTIPATED, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	3/30/2012 8:42:27 PM	I have been taking this medication for a short period of time, only a couple of days. I thought it would give me a euphoric effect thankfully it did not. I have been on pain medications since 2006 so I am hoping this helps. I was taking oxycodone for years but the availablity has been too much of a problem and I go to the same pharmacy every month. Not to mention this is much cheaper and I have no insurance. I hope this continues to help me. I want to slowly get down to a point I am not taking so much medication due to constipation. I hate drinking magnesium citrate and giving myself enemas regurally. Does anyone have any suggestions. I eat healthy, I exercise as much as I am limited too, and drink tons of water. I am so over being constipated, I don't know what is worse the pain or constipation???!!!! Any suggestions of those taking pain meds, how do you get relief? I am desperate please. Sincerely, CONSTIPATED!!!!!

I have been back on it now for 3mos and it helps a lot, I take it 3 times a day for breakthrough pain.  I also take 30mg of ms contin 3 times a day.  I usually sleep for about an hour after taking my pain MEDS, but continue to have significant pain control so I can be somewhat of a productive member of my household, although I do spend a lot of time in bed.....chronic pain can leave you feeling very hopeless at times.

Pain	Kyllein, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	2/5/2010 5:10:48 PM	After taking MSir for breakthrough pain for over a year, I find it effective for that purpose.I use MScontin for general pain control, and for the most part it works well; but there are times when a sudden stab of pain or change in what I'm doing raises my level of discomfort to levels that would otherwise send me to bed or keep me in a chair until the pain retreats.  MSir when taken goes to work in about ten minutes and lasts long enough to keep me mobile and functional.A caution: MSir should not be used to completely mask pain since the chance of over-dosage is too great, and that pain may be a warning that something is going wrong and needs to be looked into rather than just masked.As with any opiate, there is a strong chance of constipation.  I usually take a very mild stimulant laxative if I need to use MSir more than once in a 24-hour period.If the pain persistss for over 24 hours, contact your doctor rather than continuing to dose yourself; there is a serious danger that you'll mask symptoms that need to be checked by your physician.Remember: Opiates are like fire; a useful servant but a terrible master.

Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	6/9/2008 10:10:51 PM	It does not take the pain away. Pain management perscribed this to me and I have problems with medication. If I take it like they want me to then I would be throwing my guts up and never sleeping at all. 
Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/1/2008 6:38:09 PM	The MSIR helps with break through pain with my fibromyalgia and rhuematic fever. I am unable to take other types of pain meds, ie vicodin, percocet, hydrocodone. This has been a great help to me.

It is as if when it became a generic the compunds used to bid the medicine lessened it's effect, I'd say the effectiveness dropped about 50%
