It didn't really help with the mood swings either. It helped my sleeping a little, but made me really anxious at times. I don't suggest it to just anyone.

Bipolar Depression	LoveJunky, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/17/2012 7:13:09 PM	I have Bipolar II (severe) and the depressive phase for me comes on fast and furious. I will go from laughing to wanting to die. I take .5 mg of Risperdal on after the depressive side hits the suicidal thoughts level and 20 minutes later, I can not even remember why I was sad... For me, it is a god send/ wonder drug for bipolar II depression.

Other	anonymous, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/5/2012 7:24:04 PM	I was put on this drug because I have anxiety disorder, causing major panic attacks. It was supposed to be used in combination with my other meds to stabilize me and help calm me down. Didnt help at all but I got horrible side effects. I was on the drug for not even 2 months. I gained almost 25 lbs, and I am a healthy eater who does alot of walking as exercise. Also, I started getting pimples not on my face, but on my chest, arms and back. Not one or two either, but several. It was disgusting. the funny thing is, my appetite didnt increase and I wasnt eating more than usual but the weight just kept adding on. It totally did not help with my symptoms. I would not recommend this drug to anyone. Youre just asking for more problems than you already have.

There were both pros and cons, Pro: I was actually very calm, and stable, and had no anxiety while taking .5 risperdal, i was one of the luckier people on this medication who did not get symptoms too awful, and for the time being on risperdal it was need, do not stay on this medication for long! i was also able to get a lot of sleep using this medicine, post-insomina.con: i gained weight, lactated, laziness, i did not really have a motive for anything. the worst thing about this drug though, was the fact that i felt like i had no feeling, coming from before being anxious and having too many thoughts and fears to having any makes you seem lifeless, it was good for overcoming my extremely bad anxiety, but once i got off the medication i got anxiety, it has however gone down.

Risperdal is helping, although I cannot handle feeling hungry all the time and knowing that this medication is piling weight on me. I plan on asking for lithium when I go back to the dr. So, good drug, not for someone with weight issues.

Other	justice1, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	4/7/2012 7:34:02 PM	Having been married for 26 years to someone with severe mental illness and addiction problems that I did not realize the extent of, (having been so close to this person), a transferrance of emotion, (from my ex to me), occurred while going through an unwanted divorce. All I desired was to see my ex stable for once in her life and I allowed myself to be talked into seeking help for myself, (hoping to set an example), when it was her who desperately needed it. The psychiatrist believed the stories fabricated by my ex and treated me with Risperdal. This drug is dangerous when it is not needed. I hallucinated, drooled, had high and low mood swings, heart palpitations, etc. and it made me feel so high, then low, that I literally wanted to kill myself. At times I felt so high, I felt invincible. I had the sense to realize that something was dangerously wrong here. Having the sense to stop the medication shortly after starting it, (within a couple of months), because of the dangerous side effects I was feeling, what was most unbelievable even to this day, was the idea that another human being, (the psychiatrist), could use someone like a guinea pig and drug them into oblivion while under their care. Thank God I am 6 years out of this predicament but the emotional triggers that were inserted into me while in the hospital are as real as if they happened yesterday. Every day is a struggle to maintain my perspective and realization that when medical mistakes are made and not acknowledged, people can die. Had I did decide to take my life while drugged, the psychiatrist would have been validated and I would have been considered the nut. Psychiatry is a dangerous business. I have not only reported this to MedWatch but also to my local, State of CT Practicioner's Licensing and Investigations Board, The Attorney General, as well as other authorities, all to no avail. I do not wish what happened to me on anyone. All the systems do is protect each other at all costs. This is immoral.

Other	Lisa, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	3/29/2012 2:36:16 AM	After suffering from depression since childhood and taking nearly all brands of antidepressants, which were not effective, I was diagnosed with chronic major depression. Initially the psychiatrist put me on Olanzapine, which helped with the depression, but the major side effects of this drug were weight gain of 60 lbs. in six months and sleeping 14-16 hours per day.  Now that I am on .5mg of Risperdal my life has changed.  My mood has improved immensely, though my anxiety has increased slightly. I have lost 20 lbs. in 4 months.  However, my hypersomnia has turned into insomnia, but at least I am able to get things done.  Other adverse effects are confusion, inability to concentrate and bladder problems.  As I was able to retire early, some of these side effects will not destroy my life as the depression did, though I would not recommend this drug to someone with depression who is under 50 or over 70 unless many other alternatives have been tested.  Everyone reacts differently to medication, but my recommendation would be to start at the very minimum dosage and slowly work your way up if need be to avoid serious side effects as much as possible. My major concern with this drug are the long-term side effects.

I was put on 2mg once daily, the overall use was easy but there have been complications with that. I have gained weight to the extreme, its only been 2 full months of this medication and I have gained 40 lbs. I have also have trouble sleeping, my anxiety is through the roof and at other times I'm so exhausted I just want to sleep all day. It was much easier attempting to deal with the mania than to take a medicaition that seems to be making it worse. I just stopped taking it today and am hoping for an easy break.

I had a twitch in my lip that wouldn't not go away. I told me doctor and she had me stop taking the risperdal and told me to start taking seroquel which I did not. I had UNBELIEVABLE side effects I stopped eating, started smoking again and would not leave my home or drive my car, my personality completely changed to a fun-loving person to some kind of mental case.   I was super paranoid and had unreal panic attacks.  Finally it all ended with a seizure (never had one in my life or history of seizures in my family)that put me on deaths door step. My daugther found me on my kitchen floor she thought I was dead. I fractured my right shoulder from the fall that had to be completely replace and I need additional surgery.  I was hospitalized from 10/29/11 to 12/31/11 and was in a rehab because my right side had also become paralyzed.  I believe with my whole heart and soul that risperdal did this to me.  I am now on 10 different pills including Keppra,seroquel, a multitude of vitamins, high blood pressure meds, pain meds and klonapin.  I was 45 minutes away from death..I have my ex-doctor to thank for this life changing experience and risperdal.  Be careful when taking this medication and never, ever just stop taking it you have to be weened...

Mainly anxiety. When a panic attack starts, I take one and it calms me down within 15-30 minutes. With that I become drowsy, but it's not as strong as the previous medication I took (Ativan). Only other side effect I get from this medication is dry mouth.. and I don't take it everyday, only when necessary. It's a good medication to use to calm you down.

It felt as if I had died in bed, now that I'm off of it, It feels like I started a new life. This medicine is very scary to take. It's not worth it to me.

Other	AS Chick, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	10/23/2011 5:57:18 PM	I was prescribed 2mg for irritablily associated with Asperger's syndrome.  Never mind the fact that anyone in my situation would have been irritable, not least of all because my father had just died, I could not get any emotional support, and I had been repressing all anger and irritation for five years previously.  Instead of teaching me to be more assertive, let's just make the emotions go away, right??Well anyway.  On 1-2 mg, I slept constantly, had such pain in my hips, shoulders, and pectoral muscles that I could not walk or lift my kids, and could not think clearly enough to do simple household chores without someone to remind me of each step.  I had all the negative emotions-- in fact my depression worsened until I became suicidal-- but my therapists thought everything was great because I appeared calm due to having no ability to think clearly enough to express what I was feeling.  All in all a horrible drug.  Unless someone is very violent, I would not even consider Risperdal for treatment.

I have had numerous side affects and have been told by my Dr they can be long lasting or even permanent! I have severe muscle cramping, joint pain, and burning sensation in the palms of my hands and the soles of my feet. It is has become difficult to empty my bladder..start, and then it's slow. The joint and muscle pain is targeted mainly to both hands and arms. My hands are also stiff.  The burning sensation stopped after discontinuation The cramping eased as well, after a few weeks, but the rest of the symptoms continue and are progressing! I also was lactating, but that stopped after discontinuation after about a week. I have been left 7 months later after total discontinuation of max dose of 1mg of Risperdone with hands and wrists stiff and sore, 24/7, cramping easily, feet that cramp, wake up easily, anxiety, the same bladder troubles, sensitive to other med side affects, and more! Just too painful to type any more! DO NOT RECOMMEND!!! Requires four 7.5mg of hydrocodone per day and 24 hour lodocian patches on hands and wrists plus tylenol to keep pain under control. Hope some day this will all go away!!
Bipolar Disorder in Remission	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	9/21/2011 10:28:20 PM	I have been taking Risperdal for 2 consecutive years, and I've gained 100.00 lbs. since the day I started taking it. Recently, I read up online and found out that Risperdal can affect hormones, menstrual cycles, and brain tissue. I have galactorea (breast milk) from it, my hair has almost ceased growing on my body, and the hair on my head is thinner. When I started taking Risperdal I was 130 lbs., now I'm 220; and if anything my eating has gotten better. It makes me hungry. I have been taking birth control for 5 years, and nothing's ever been different.. but now that I've been on Risperdal for 2ish years, it has significantly slowed down. I take Effexor XR for depression/panic attacks, Lithium/mood stabilizer, and Risperdal for anger and manic episodes. I have tried Geodon, Abilify, Saphris, &amp; many others. None of them have been as effective as Risperdal, but the side effects of it are killer. I am going to try Latuda and Saphris again because I didn't truly give Saphris a chance. Good luck

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	Barbara J, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	9/1/2011 4:54:52 PM	I was prescribed this med when I was in a pych. hospital for depression.  I am bipolar.  I questioned the doctor as I don't respond well to many drugs.  (I take Cymbalta and Lamictal with no horrible problems).  He assured me they didn't see side effects with this med unless someone was taking 9ms or more.  I took .50mgs for only 2 days and woke up with a charley horse in my left leg that wouldn't go away. My tongue, head, neck, arms and legs were moving involuntarily. I had had two inch long blood filled places on my legs, similar, but smaller sores in my mouth. I couldn't be understood when I spoke and had a rapid heart rate.  I ended up in the ER.  They gave me something to calm my muscles down and told me I should be back to normal withing 24-48 hours.  I saw my own Psychiatrist the following day; he told me it would be longer as my pupils were still huge.  19 days I suffered with those side effects before they wore off.  My doctor was ticked that it was even prescribed for me, as it is an older drug, not used as much for bipolars because there are others that work better with fewer side effects.  I now have it listed as a drug I am allergic to.  I wouldn't recommend anyone take this without trying everything else first!

A few months after this drug was added, I began experiencing vision problems, and, after seeing my eye doctor, was referred to a neurologist ophthalmologist who diagnosed me with Nystagmus in both my eyes, which is a ticking of the eye, much like a pendulum on a clock.  With the help of the drug, Lamictal, the nystagmus is controlled in my front and right vision, but not when I look to my left.  This problem occurred over a year ago, and it appears to be permanent.  This is a horrible drug -- I would not recommend anyone taking it.

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	betternow, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	4/21/2011 3:12:40 PM	I take this medication for a mood disorder, i take 0.25mg in the eve. I sleep well, dream alot, i was groggy for 2 weeks until my body adjusted to it. I have noticed a decrease in anxiety, paranoia, rapid thoughts. I am less suspicous and have more patience and focus. Cons were that it made me extremely thirsty and increased my appetite. I dealt with these side effects by using chapstick, drinking bottled water and controlled my weight by choosing to eat veggies when hunrgy instead of a cheeseburger. I still felt depressed on this medication, so i was put on wellbutrin SR twice a day for that problem.

This medicine was crap. If I missed one dose I could not sleep. I was irritable if I did not take it. I gained about thirty pounds while on it. When I dropped it cold turkey I lost thirty pounds within three to four months. After a two week detox period I could sleep normally and was not irritable. It's been a year and a half since I last took and haven't looked back. I used along with risperdal the generic prozac: fluoxetine. I feel my depression is in check and I have a pretty good handle on it without the risperdal.

Because of it, I can no longer feel emotions, sleep soundly, stay still, remember simple things, get an erection, or relate to other people. I have been off the drug for months now and I still feel like a lobotomized zombie. Honestly, I'd rather it had killed me.

I started this around Thanksgiving and at 1st it worked well towards my aggressive feelings towards my hard to get a long with mother in law, but needed to have the 4 mg. dose lowered due to feeling just BLAAAAA. No feelings whatsoever towards her or doing anything. Then that feeling soon changed and we upped the dose back to the original prescription again because the blaas went away and I didn't want to feel aggressive again as I'm not normally an aggressive person whatsoever, not ever. Then I started feeling anxious all the time from it,like on speed. As soon as I was taken off of it the other day and put on Seroquel, I could feel an almost instant change and a lot more mellow now. I HATE IT. It also gave me the 'munchies' all the time, which is bad because I had bariatric surgery back in 2006. I've been blessed so far in that Seroquel, so far, hasn't done this yet.

It never seemed to be doing much for him. He has also been on Zoloft for the past 9 months. His diagnosis is PDD he also has mental retardation. He is 14.I started to see his hand curling at the wrist and he started to hold his hands and arms curled up to his head. I was totally freaked out! He is non-verbal so he could never tell me what he was feeling. It turns out he was having a side effect called Tardive Dyskinesia. It is a serious condition and can become permanent.He is almost off this drug, but I can tell you I would never put my child on this medication ever. What expressive language he had (making lots of sounds, being vocal and clapping when happy) had disappeared. It is all coming back now that he is almost off this medication. A horrible drug!!!

The doctors did not take time to review my symptoms when I was admitted, so I was put on the drug almost immediately after admittance.As it turned out, I had severe OCD and moderate mood issues, NOT schizophrenia as they had thought.After being put on another medication, the Risperdal was STILL not working.2 years later, I started going to a different psychiatrist, and he FINALLY got me off the drug.The problem was now, not my condition, but my weight. I had always been underweight, but during the 2005-2006 school year, I nearly doubled my weight, going from 65lbs to 120.I was bullied because of my weight, and eventually it got so bad that I was homeschooled from late 2006-mid 2009.5 years later, I am a freshman (back in the public school system) and still have not recovered from the side affects of Risperdal,I am now almost 140 lbs.This drug did not work for me, and (even if they did have schizophrenia) I wouldn't wish this medication on ANYONE, even my worst enemy.

I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, ocd, tourette's syndrome, gad, and more. I am currently taking 40 mg's of paroxetine per day, 4 mg's of clonazepam per day, and the name brand of Risperdal 4 mg's per day and boom, i'm 75 percent better now! Thank you psyc meds, saved my life! Risperdal has some bad side effects, but they are much worth it if you respond to the medication like me! I rate Risperdal a 10/10. Enough said! Thank you Dr. Jannsen!

The only side effects I would warn others about is: weight gain and high blood sugar. I also had to deal with satiety issues with this medicine. My doctor had to prescribe another medication to counterbalance that effect! I am almost back to baseline, and I wouldn't trade that feeling of &quot;normalcy&quot; for anything, but the side effects are still hard to deal with.

I was first put on Zyprexa, which made me very groggy and caused me to gain weight.  I have been taking a very low dose (.5 mg) of Risperdal at bedtime for about 6 years now with no side effects.  I'm 5&quot;4 and weigh approximately 128 lbs.  This drug helps me to manage my sometimes uncontrollable emotions extremely well.  I have recently had some manic episodes, though.  I am going through a very difficult time in my life right now (separating from my husband of 18 years), and I would not dare stop taking my meds!  My doctor also prescribed Ativan for anxiety attacks-but I rarely need to take one.  Risperdal, for me, has been a God-send.  On a side note-my family can tell when I forget to take my meds for any length of time-LOL.

I have always had times where I have, you could say, went crazy.  I have had extreme highs and extreme lows.  In a rage I stuck a steak knife in my chest twice.  Then was hospitalized.  There they put me on this medication.  At first I thought it was helping wonderfully.  After about 6 months I began to hate myself on it.  I never had any emotion.  No happiness, no sadness, and no anger.  All are vital to being a human being, as long as none are extreme.  I decided to quit cold turkey.  Did not take long till I was losing my mind, literally.  At the time I had no idea why, I just thought I must really be crazy and need this medicine.  Then I would take it again.  Then of course quit.  I spent another 6 months trying to live a normal life.  I don't remember most of this time.  It is time I will never get back.  I just know that if ever I really wanted to die it was this time.  My brain was screaming at me daily, hourly, minutely, and every second.  No one including doctors understood what was wrong with me.  It was a nitemare.  To put anyone through any of this is horrible.  To be on it was horrible.  The dreams, the no emotion, the not wanting to live.  Still every show that I watched when I was on this, when they come on I get the most horrific feeling when they come on.  The side effects to using this will never, I do believe, completely go away.  I would rather be dead than be on this.  That is coming from the heart.  Please make sure you or your loved one is in dyer need of this before taking.  It will ruin yours and those around you's life.

Risperdal is the only one that worked to relieve my bipolar mania symptoms, namely hearing voices, being paranoid and having anxiety all the time. The only downside is I gained over 60 pounds. I was already obese to begin with so gaining so much weigh has just put a huge burden on me. Also I have trouble losing weight but I'm not sure that it's the Risperdal that is causing it. Oh, I finally ended up on 6mg. That's a relatively high dose for someone with bipolar but I do have a severe form of it.

One milligram and then two milligram. I took it to help me sleep. I believe it is dangerous because my triglicerides were so high I think I had a stoke I think It is more common for older people under a different term. I would not prescribe this drug. I believe it has caused damage to me. If I were I would only give 1/2 gram to someone. This is a very dangerous drug. It causes weight gain very quickly. I haven't taken it in years. Too bad you have to be dead to sue the FDA. I weened off it over two years or more. Since I dropped my weight and new the risks. It just should be monitored closely or else.

He has ADHD, OCD with the possiblity of Asperger's.  This medicine has help him very much.  He is in more control now and his outbursts are very few and far between. We tried the medication vacation during the summer and we can tell you there is a really big difference.  Our only concern is the weight gain and the enlarged breasts for a boy.  I thought maybe it was due to the weight gain, but I'm not so sure now.  Is there anything else out there that will have the same effect on him without the weight gain???  I sure hope so and I'll keep looking in the mean time.  It truely is a miracle drug that has made our lives much easier.  We just don't like the side effects it has.

It was like a miracle cure for our daughter with Autism. She is very obsesive. This medicine helped with that and she would not sleep. This medicine helped with sleep. Now years later I wish we knew more of the side effects our daughter is now showing all the bad side effects. She looks like she has parkinism. She ended up having breast discharge. She is having twisting of he extremities. Her feet are turned inward, her musles are pulling her hips out of their sockets.Doctors had a hard time determing that it was the medicine. Please be careful with this medicine and know the side effects. A miracle turned into a nightmare, but most other medicines work on the same part of the brain and effect the body's dopamine.

At first it worked great but after about 3 weeks we noticed it wasn't working as well. So the Dr upped her dose and again for a few weeks it was great. She has PDD-NOS and RAD. Now we are taking her off the the drug and trying Abilify...not sure if it will make a difference but hopefully it will work. I did notice it makes her tired but only sometimes and she used to sleep all night when she first started the drug but now she is coming into our room in the middle of the night again. She also has weight gain problems so they though this would work good to help her gain weight even though she eats more she has actually lost some weight since she started the medication so not sure what that is about she takes 2 mg a day of this and 15 mg of Buspar in addition. Not saying it is a bad drug or a good drug just make sure you keep an eye out for any changes that are unusual

Medicine, hospitalizations, therapy have saved my life.  I am currently taking Depakote and Nortripytline, but every day, without an antipsychotic, I am becoming sicker.  I called my doctor, and he will prescribe risperidone 2 mg bid tomorrow.  I cannot wait to get this medicine into my system.  I can feel that I am getting sick, I see it, but I cannot stop the symptoms from emerging.  I know in my heart or hearts that I need this medicine, as I have taken it before.I just need it to re-enter my system.I feel so out of control.  Thank God my psychiatrist hears my calls for help.  (My diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder.)  Thank you.
Other	3-6 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	3	2	Female	3-6	1/21/2010 10:25:04 PM	My 5 year old daughter is taking risperdal now for 3 months for conduct disorder. In that time she went from a size 5 to a size 10 in clothing. She weighed 43 lbs before starting and currently is 56lbs. I keep her eating under control and always feed her healthy food. She cries because she is always hungry. I had to buy her size 10 pants and hem the legs 6 inches just so she can wear jeans. I am doing all I can to stop her from scratching her skin because she is getting stretch-marks. I cannot even lift her anymore she is so heavy. The bad part is, she is still gaining weight. She also has had an increase in Absence seizures as well. She is taking Lamictal for seizures, but it isn't working. The only reason she takes risperdal it is because the school cannot stand my child's manic behavior. My advise is to think what is more important, satisfying lazy teachers or putting your child through physical horror. I feel terrible about her being on this med. I wish there was a safer alternative for small children.

Due to restless nights and hallucinations, a &quot;pediatric&quot;dose (0.5mg) was prescribed. After the third day, it took well over two hours and a trip to the emergency room to realize she could not tolerate this drug.  I now know why the FDA has posted their warning advising NOT to use it for seniors with dementia.  I only wish I looked it up PRIOR to giving it to my Mom. I'd like to know if there is a sedative out there that will allow BOTH Mom and I to get a restful nights sleep.

I wouldnt recommend this medication if your trying to get pregnant because when i was trying to get pregnant i could not which is really disapointing when your doctor tells your capable of concieving and its not happening. My OBGYN told me that this medication could affect your ability to concieve. now that i switched medications im currently 8 weeks pregnant. The medication is great for children, but I personally dont think adult women should take it. there are alot of other medicines that treat the same thing without so many side effects

I had put on more than 40 pounds in the first 6 months of use and continued to gain wait into high school. With no alternatives from my doctor I stopped use all together and began self medicating with marijuana. My weight slowly returned to a healthy range. My grades turned around completely and I managed to return to a normal life. I no longer use marijuana for treatment as my tics are very mild and not very noticeable to others any longer. There are many other drugs out there that can be used to treat tourettes and if you find adverse side effects from one please try something else. I would not recommend anyone using the route I did drugs are bad and pot is illegal.

They started me on it along with lithium. I have since discontinued lithium but am still on Risperdal. It really helps with irritability so much. I noticed a big difference twice when I ran out of the medication. BUT I also haven't had a period since Jan 09 -prior to starting the medication. I've seen OBGYN'S but they can't figure out why. I'm going to see another this week. But I did hear about and just now read the warning about the hormone problems it causes. It also took away my sex drive I believe. BC as I said I am now off the lithium and my other drugs are for blood pressure and I've been on them for a couple years. But I'm single now anyway so it doesn't matter. But I will discontinue if it is contributing to my lack of periods or I get a boyfriend anytime soon lol.

My dr put me on 2 mg of this in addition to the 50 mg of Zoloft that I already take. I took 1 pill the first morning with my breakfast at work. Within 30 minutes I felt drunk, could not walk straight and was slurring my words. I had meetings throughout the day so I could not leave. When I got home I slept for 12 hrs. I woke up the next morning and my eyes were still completely dialated. Thank God I didn't get pulled over on the way home. I didn't realize how bad off I really was. I had to call in sick and it took me sleeping that entire next day before I could actually function. This is the worst med I have ever been on!!!!

The overall effect seems to be effective according to her school teachers. She is awaiting an EEG to see if her blanking-out spaciness episodes are seizures. she used to have them 1 every 2 days or so, now since being on the medicine she has 12-14 a day that I notice. In addition she complains of headaches. I am not sure if this is due to the medicine or not since it is not a listed side affect. She has gained a little weight, but not much yet. The Dr. and the pharmacist assured me that this drug is common and she will still be herself w/o her &quot;meltdowns&quot; however, she falls asleep before dinner every night, she seems out of it more, and I am worried.

Now I have migraines nausea vomiting, I never I repeat never have appetite. I also developed muscle problems like I have had a cramp in my elbow for almost a year. The doctors did a biopsy and genetic testing they found the medication to have caused a cellular dysfunction in my muscles and most likely throughout the rest of my body and organs that is responsible for my symptoms and their is no cure. The genetic testing ruled out all known muscle diseases caused by genetics or genetic mutations, or inheritance, the doctors concluded the medication is probably the cause.

I empathize with you wanting to end your child's suffering, as well as having a child that is 'easier' to deal with...but once you start a child on a life of 'popping pills' to cope...you are going down a very slippery slope. A child will learn very quickly they are now perceived as 'different' and labels can fast become self-fulfilling prophecies. Please please please parents, I am not writing this out of arrogance or indifference...I am writing this out of compassion, empathy and love...all I ask is that you take a deep breath, do some homework, even get a second opinion before you start jumping on the 'pill band wagon'. Sometimes these medications seem like 'wonder drugs'...but they can also make for short term gain and long term pain. If I reach just one person with my statement here, I will have made a positive difference in the live(s) of someone already struggling and dealing with hurt, suffering and pain. Bless each and everyone of you trying to do the best you can with little or no experience dealing with mental health (a continued 'taboo' issue even in the 21st century). As I said, I write this not out of malice, but from my heart as someone who has endured the stigma of mental illness plus experienced adverse life-threatening side effects to psychotropic drugs during my adolescence!! I want to prevent further unnecessary suffering!

It has helped so much!  Her behaviors are better.  She's starting to settle down enough to learn.  The doctor suggested she may also need a stimulant and I agree, but after such a rough start on the drug (lasted about 4 days) my 5-year-old is also grateful for it.  She does have an increased appetite but will gladly eat fruit when wanting to snack so she's only gained a pound.

I was definitely feeling better. However the side effects were awful. I had an allergic reaction which put me in the hospital. I had difficulty swallowing, trouble breathing and couldn't ejaculate and produce any sperm. It also caused Edema in both ankles and feet. Twitching in my face, it raised my blood sugar, which is not good being that I am Diabetic and also made me gain 7 pds in a week. From now on I will be very careful and will look at side effect more closely before choosing a medicine.

I was feeling better and not so manic.However. the side effects of this DRUG put me in the Hospital. After the first couple of days I could not produce any sperm, and I had difficulty swallowing and dry mouth. I just thought that I was maybe getting a sore throat. I hat twitching a little in my face and it made me feel jumpy. I wound up in the hospital because it caused me to get dependent edema in both my feet and I could not breath. I had very short breaths and could not breath properly. I have a feeling that my throat was closing and was causing me to not get enough in my airway. I was in the hospital for 24 hours and they took every test in the book and I am very happy to say that they found nothing wrong with me. They didn't believe me at first that it was the deadly side effects from this drug. I had cut the dosage in half and stopped taking it while I was in there. Just a word of warning, I am also Diabetic, it raised my blood sugar and made me gain 7 pounds in a week. I have made a feel recovery. I can now produce, and my breathing is 90 % back to normal.

However, I have noticed that in the last 18 months she is hearing voices again. She is nowhere near as bad as she was 12 years ago, but can she have built up a tolerance to Risperdal making it lose its effectiveness?

Seeing no major differece, so we thought, we took him off after starting Kindergarten at age 6.  Mistake.  Within two months he was uncontrollable and worse than before.  He was suspended from Kindergarten for pulling out a peer's hair and deemed &quot;a threat to himself and others&quot;.  We sought support at Children's Hospital immediately that day and put him back on it, increasing to .5mg/2x daily.  His performance, attention and social skills improved at school.  He has experienced no weight gain but does have a lack of energy.  Recently, due to a new escalation, he is up to .5mg/3x's daily and is in therapy.  He turns seven in a month.  We aren't where we want to be, but Risperdal certainly put us in the right direction.  Although too young to officially diagnose, he is being treated as early onset bipolar.  We also added Trazodone to his regime to help the nightmares and inability to sleep.  I regret fighting the medicinal route for him and encourage parents to hear out your pediatrician or psychiatrist before deciding AGAINST use of this medicine.  I did more harm not listening to the professionals (Pediatrician, Therapist and Psychiatrist).  
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	3-6 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	3-6	8/12/2009 12:17:05 AM	This medication was prescribed for my son for his Bipolar Disorder and it caused him to have seizure type symptoms. He couldn't speak, eyes rolled in the back of his head and every muscle from the neck up tightened up and he couldnt move. I do not recommend this medicine. The doctors said that these side effects only happen to about 2% of the people that take and thats adults and less than 1% in children. I guess my 5 year old was in that less than 1%.And all of this happened with in a day and a half of him taking it. Be careful when it comes to this medicine.Use it with extreme caution.

Other	lp3333, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	8/11/2009 3:24:38 PM	Years ago I was falsely diagnosed with Schizophrenia. I am spiritually inclined, and my doctor was an Atheist. He made it very 'clear' to me that angels and god were fabrications, and false clutches, and there is no proof that my beliefs could be real. He also stated that imagination and faith are not healthy 'choices' in this world. I was suicidal at the time due to non-faith based problems, but pressures and events at that time of my life that built up to severe depression. But, he used his prejudice to diagnose me and ignored the real reasons I was in danger. I needed help for the events that happened to me, not medication for *one* sentence I uttered about prayer.  It sounds like a made-up story, I assure you it was not. This is an issue I have with the sector of psychology that assumes God is a mental illness. I am a colorful creative person, and he used his gray-stoicism to counter my beliefs, rather than help me. If you are indeed, schizophrenic or have dementia, this pill will work, since my great aunt took it for her dementia, and it helped. But if you are diagnosed WRONGLY this will make you even more depressed, despondent, zombie like, and coupled with prozac, I gained 55 lbs. I had a trainer and was on a diet, and still didn't lose the weight, which made me MORE depressed. It wasn't until I went to a new doctor 2 1/2 years later, that I was avenged. She saved me, told me I was GROSSLY misdiagnosed, and dangerously over-medicated. (he had me at full dose Prozac and 90% full dose Resp.) Nightmare. PLEASE PEOPLE. GET SECOND OPNIONS. It could save your life!! You are never 'married' to any doctor, regardless if they make you feel like they're the only one you should see. LEAVE THEM if you are doing everything correctly, and still are getting no results months later. 
Bipolar Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	13-18	8/7/2009 6:43:55 PM	I was diagnosed with Bi-polar and prescribed this drug. However, after stopping this drug, I have seen many doctors and all of them tell me it was a misdiagnoses because I do not have Bi-polar. However, while on this pill I gained over 100 pounds in less than six months (I was a size zero and now I am lucky to fit into a size 16). I can't say how well it helped my disorder since I did not have any disorder which would be treated by this drug. However, I can say, that it did affect my appetite and I was always hungry I did not eat much more than before, but I always wanted to and even without changing my diet I still more than doubled my weight. Now I have depression because of the side effects of this drug. While weight gain may not happen to everyone, talk to your doctor about other options especially if it is for a child who is under 18 since this drug effects weight in some people this could cause problems in mental and psychical health of children. If you have children who have doctors who are telling them to take it, I strongly recommend not doing so. I was  in high school while on this drug and I was made fun of daily for being fat which is all the worse when it was due to side effects of a drug. (I have been off this drug for three years and only lost 30 pounds so far so the side effects don't end when you are taken of this drug).

I could not do anything to keep her moods under control.  The doctor first put her on a medication for adhd which made her hear voices.  He then put her on risperdal and wow it has been heaven.  Her moods are way more under control and she is easier to handle.  She is on the .5 mg dose.  She helps out around the house and is nicer to everyone.  This medicine is a blessing for us.

At the time, it did help with disruptive behavior but mostly because it caused fatigue. My son gained almost 40 pounds, had breasts beginning to develop, and abnormal liver function tests. Whenever he was 16, last year, he suddenly developed abnormal liver enzymes which couldn't be attributed to anything else- every test short of biopsy was performed. And suddenly he started to gain weight- so much that he now has severe stretch marks. All of this happened 8 years after stopping the risperdal and returning to his pre-risperdal weight. I am very concerned about what even psychiatrists such as my son's previous pediatric psychiatrist are giving to kids. He is functioning much better on nothing but behavior modifications. He just graduated at 17 and made a 25 on the ACT. I'm just not sure of the long=term effects on children and I don't think anyone in the medical community truly is either.

She is on several meds for the OCD,which have been fairly effective, but the manic part of BPD was getting worse until we started Risperdal.  It has been very effictive for that purpose. The problem is that she has lost everything else in the side effects-She has experienced a healthy weight gain (40 lbs-which to a 105 lb woman is devestating), is very unstable on her legs and has fallen several times, can't concentrate on anything, increased prolactin levels, sleeps constantley and is depressed. I'm not sure if the side effects are worth it. Her life is miserable and at this point she is hardly more than existing. Is there anythnigs else?

Additionally, he is able to sleep.He is currently taking .5 mg at bedtime.  I do encourage parents to try this drug, but in conjunction with many other forms of therapy.  I have seen this drug work miracles for children with PDD and ASD issues. It has changed our son and it has made us a happier family.

The medication significantly reduced my hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and stuttering. But it did nothing to help my social anxiety/ impairment. The only side effects were weight gain. I started the medication at 165 and now after three years I'm at 220. Overall I think the medications very good, but I personally don't like the weight gain so may consider a different medication.

It helped to calm him down. However had to stop the anti-depressant after 3 months as the combination was making him hyper - he was on 3mg of Risperdal. After 4 months on risperdal, he started experiencing severe back pain with nausea and vomiting. Doctors did all sorts of tests on him to find the cause of the problem but none believed that Risperdal was causing the problem. I finally took him off it and the symptoms disappeared. However, after a week his aggressiveness returned. I put him back on risperdal but at a lower dose of 1.5 mg. His back pain and nausea returned. He is now on Abilify which so far seems to suit him better.

I did not have those happy highs, instead I had bouts of anger I could not control. One day I was screaming  at my 16 year old nephew, who never experienced this side of me, and I saw his eyes get big as he asked me why I was acting this way. I decided it was time to get help. A psychiatrist put me on wellbutrin for depression and 1 mg risperdal for anger. I read it was for schizophrenia and bulked at taking it because I know I do not suffer from it. My doctor confirmed I was not but asked me to trust his decision. I'm glad I did and wish I had taken this medication a long time ago. Initially there was some side effects of anxiety but was told to take benydryl to counteract it, which it did. It only lasted the first few days. My outlook is much different, my abnormal anger has subsided. I still get mad but its a normal emotion in response to normal situtations. I sleep through the night, I feel rested and not overly tired anymore, in fact I have more energy. I feel at peace and my family no longer has to walk on tiptoes around me. That is what I am most grateful for because as miserable as I felt, my family suffered more. I have had no wieght gain other than my normal fluctuations, I am geneticly large to begin. This medication has given me a new life.

It did help with the behavior, reducing the explosiveness, frequency, and duration of her tantrums.

We discontinued medication.I do know another family whose daughter has done very well on a low dose of Risperdal, with no apparent side effects.

I prayed I had werid rituals I would do,I wouldnt use round ash trays all sorts of very distrubing things. All this to allow myself to smoke and enjoy it. Recently I stopped taking the risperdal and It went away, GONE, this whole time I was trying to stop something that was a chemical side effect, and it was very distrubing to me to think this whole time it was that pill, I was on the edge with this thing, But, since I have quit its gone. This is not a listed side effect but I think its very well should be.

I am actually able to finish projects without losing sleep.  Sleep - risperidone helped stabilize my sleep, although the effect seems to wear off as I continued to take the medicine.  I like that I only have to take it once a day.

It has been a life jacket for me.  It has brought me out of my psychosis and depression (I'm schizoaffective).  Although I have the past 7 months noticed if I take mt. dew during the day I get these really bad chest pains.  I have even went to the doctor about this.  My psychiatrist tells me don't worry about it and my regular doctor says my heart is alright?  Had EKG done and that says my heart is alright.  I know that this is a side effect.  Even when I don't drink pop I sometimes, since 7 months ago, have chest pains.  Had been on 4 mg and now have been decreasing to 3 mg.  Also take Effexor XR and Lexapro.  Also decreasing effexor because my blood pressure has gone to hypertensive mode.  Have had weight gain of about 35 pounds over the past year, but hadn't gained anything initially the previous three years.

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	1/9/2009 10:47:18 PM	Well, it worked. It helped organize my thoughts, made me feel &quot;less undone.&quot; It also cause me to *lactate.* That's right. I was told it was a rare side effect. However, upon reviewing these other reviews, I found another instance in less than 5 minutes, so I doubt that it's rare. This is a classic case of the cure being worse than the disease. I'm absolutely disgusted by the lack of proper information and the general lax response I received from the doctor who prescribed it. Something seriously disturbing is going on in the body for drug to make a non-pregnant woman to lactate. The only upside is that it has made me swear off psych medication. I am not a guinea pig. Further investigation should be done on this drug, esp. in light of kick-backs and extreme side-effects.

Attempted suicide 3 times.  In general this drug calms her down and help her sleep, she takes 1 mg/daily at night with prozac 10mg.  However, after a period of 4~5 months she'd start to complain of the side effects such as weight gain, short term memory loss, high blood sugar...etc and will begin to refuse the drug.  In the past my father and I have complied with her and let her skip the doses, and shortly after she'd relapse.  She's in one of those phase now, refusing the drug again complaining that she can't even remember when my sister got married (just recently).  We had to talk to her for an hr last night to get her take it.  We know this drug carry harmful side effects, but the consequence of not taking is too grave.  I really hope there are better drugs out there that'd help my mother, but right now Risperdal is all we have that helps.

I wouldn't recommend getting on it though, unless you cannot function at all, as you may very well be on it for the rest of your life.

He started this medicine and within 2 days he was amazingly better.  He is almost 7 and is on .5 mg twice per day.  If we skip a dose, it's obvious, as he's angry and irritable again.  When he's on it without missing a dose he is happy, loving, appropriately energetic, sleeps through the night.  He still has a full range of emotions and is very caring and loving and social.  It has made a tremendous difference to our family as things had gotten very bad and he had even talked about leaving the family and suicide a couple of times.  He was on a higher dose (just .5 mg more) and he started having trouble swallowing, so I took him off it for a week while we decided what to do.  All his psychological symptoms cam back within 2 days... His psychiatrist wants him to stay on it but I'm vigilant for any swallowing issues and I will give him Benedryl at the first sign of anything.  He has oral dyspraxia also so he already had difficultly with swallowing and breath control/cooridination, so it's hard to say if it's the Risperdal or not.  He has gained weight, 8 pounds so far, but we are trying to develop better eating habits!

I was concerned at first about taking an antipsychotic, but she reassured me that the pharmacist would know from the small dose that I was not being treated for psychosis. The drug has worked like a charm. I feel calmer, function better, and sleep much better, without any side effects that I've noticed. I feel so fortunate to have found a psychiatrist who specializes in pharmacology who keeps up with the latest uses of different medications and is able to try different medicines for different uses.

I highly recommend it and to see your psychiatrist every 2 wks like I still am doing. My bipolar is finally under control after years of wreaking havoc on family and friends!!

She was in intensive care for 12 days before we decided enough was enough and took her home.  She is now doing well.

I did notice a difference, however after a couple years, I have just stopped taking it.  I am a man, and my nipples have become protracted...I assume because of prolacting levels.  My sexual ability has significantly decreased.  I have gained about 50 lbs, though I don't think I can blame all of that on the Risperadol.  My cholesterol level has shot up, as has my blood sugar level.  I'm hoping I can find something else to treat my Tourette's.

One of the allergic reactions, was a seizure while driving my car, resulting in a major accident. That terminated my career, and now has prevented me from driving for a couple of years. Recommendation: If taking the medication and you start to have an allergic reaction, immediately report it to your doctor. Also, log the information, the allergic reaction, date and time of the occurrence(s). This way, when you have an appointment, you doctor can see how often this reaction is occurring.

Doctor at first thought meningitis and was ready to order a  Spinal tap until he looked up side effects of this drug. the side effects he experienced maybe rare but not worth the pain he experienced. after an injection of benadryl he became well and was released. suffice to say, he will no longer be taking this medication. he just started this treatment Friday as a mood stabalizer in conjunction with ADHD his ADHD med is DEXTROAMPHETAMINE (10mg once a day). ER doctor says its a 1 and 1000 chance side effect, unfortunately our lottery winning odds arent as good. Hopefully no one you loves experiences this reaction. i can not comment as to whether it was effective to the effect desired though. but hope this blog gives you food for thought before starting this treatment. any questions contact me via my email.

It scared me to death. My doctor put me on risperdal initially with my anti depressant, but i was still very agitated and racy so she finally just had me take the risperdal alone.  I immediately felt normal again!  I can concentrate, I sleep through the night, I eat normally, and I don't talk up a storm anymore.  The only thing that bothers me is the lack of sex drive that i have now.  Oh, and the bizzaro lactation.  I'm already weaning off of it, which always makes me nervous, but it has been a huge help in getting my mind back in my control.

It controls the thought process that leads to psychosis. It is necessary to know that strong emotions tend to develope into my rapid cycling and extremes with anxiety. A calming effect is necessary to deal with everyday stress. Risperdal taken with cogentin is the medication mix that works with me. Since I cannot handle any kind of stimulant in medications nor anything that severly sedates me it helps me with both spectrumes.

My first reaction to the diagnosis was that the doctor was crazy, not me, but it fit. My many, many nervous habits, motor ticks and even vocal ticks that I hadn't noticed, were all characteristics of Tourette's. The doctor started me on Risperdal, which I've been on for about two weeks now, and so far I've been really impressed by it. I take 1 mg at night, which allows me to sleep a full 8 hours!!! I also take 1/4 to 1/2 mg as needed throughout the day for anxiety, and I notice a difference in less than half an hour. Along with Zoloft and Wellbutrin, its worked great so far. However, I'm worried about the weight gain, which seems sort of popular with this medication -- I've never been bigger than a size 3, and I don't want that to change!

Thank God for the Risperdal. He rarely even gets angry anymore, and I'm no longer afraid to confront him if he's behaved negatively. However, the weight gain has been enormous. He's grown a lot height wise, but the weight gain isn't in proportion. He's an athlete, lifts weights 5 days a week and works out with his track team every day. The problem is he's now 300 pounds, at 6'5&quot;, and he gained so much weight so fast he even has stretch marks on his waist, hips, under his arms, his shoulders, etc. His size is great for football, to a certain degree but not so much for basketball, as the extra weight really slows him down. He eats healthy, but enormous amounts of food. If not for the weight gain, this would be the perfect medication for him. Kids have started teasing him, even though he's a popular athlete at his high school. His success in school can only be attributed to being on Risperdal. We've had to gauge what's more important here, and since he was basically headed for a life of crime and juvenile detention centers followed most likely by life in adult prisons, we'll take the weight gain.

He has gained weight, and recently (with an increase in his dose) has started complaining of severe of headaches and neck pain.  He is still &quot;all over the place&quot; durning the day and cannot focus real well on his school work.  The only good I see from this med is that he is FINALLY sleeping through the night.  He would get up several times and wonder the house before he started this medication.  I see no other positive benefits.  His doctor thinks this is a good med for him, however  I worry about the stiff neck and headaches.  I have heard that this could potentially be a dangerous side effect.  We will be checking with his doctor soon about this and possibly be changing doctors.  Use with caution is all I can say.

Risperdal was given to me at the onset of my illness, which was drug induced.  Although many people find Risperdal to be an efficacious drug, I found it very difficult to tolerate.  Perhaps it was because I was new to the whole schizophrenia thing, but I have had much better luck on Zyprexa (which is the best anti-psychotic on the market; it just has terrible side effects) and Abilify.  Risperdal made me emotionally numb; it detached me from myself and my experiences.  Additionally, it (like most of the anti-psychotics to some degree) caused me to gain some weight.  Overall, I would consider talking to your physician (and doing your own research) before starting Risperdal.  I think that you may find more pleasant alternatives, such as Abilify.  However, tolerance of anti-psychotic drugs is a very subjective experience, so Risperdal may be right for you.  But it was certainly not right for me.

While it has helped with his aggression (this is a boy who at age 2 stabbed his father with a knife and at age 3 attempted to suffocate his newborn brother with a pillow) we are still not seeing a complete turn around in him. I am a parent adversive to medicating my children but felt in this instance it was the best course of action. The small dosage is why he maintains an aggressive talk therapy regime from many angles (not only a psychologist and psychiatrist but also with school counselors, church pastors, etc). So far we have seen a weight gain but cannot rule out this was not genetically based as I did the same at his age. No other side effects have been present. He has been on the meds for almost 6 months.

She had severe mood swings, suicidal thoughts, and was becoming violent in school. She recently switched to this medication 8 months ago and it has worked OK. Overall, she bahavior is stable, sleeping well, and bedwetting has not returned. No weight gain to report. The downside is at times she seems &quot;out of it&quot; just staring into space. Her ability to focus is also reduced. Now that puberty has set in and after a recent growth spurt we are showing experiencing symptoms again. One downside is that the doctors do not (or are not willing) to increase the dosage as a child grows because the pills are only offered in certain increments. Until she grows more, quite a bit more, we will have to deal with the issues until the medication can be increased.

Now, my doctor is taking me off it as my prolactin went up to 3 times the max limit.  The increased prolactin levels recently gave me E.D. which is why they did the blood work and found out about the increased prolactin levels.  I did like Risperdal as it really helped my calm my mood and helped with some anger issues I was dealing with.  I had been taking Risperdal to counteract symtoms from longtime use of Ritalin when I was a kid. Overall I was pretty satisfied and am sad to be comming off, but my doctor this\nks we might be ok on just the effexor and if not I'm to tell him right away and we'll try something else then.

I have looked up on the internet some side effects because I haven't been feeling well lately and noticed that I am experiencing quite a few of the side effects of risperdal. I am especially disgusted with my weight gain since I was always a size 10. I am 58 years old. I work full time but I am most of the time very tired. Three years ago I had my thyroid out and gained even more weight. I thought maybe I wasn't getting the right dosage of synthroid but my doctor did extensive blood work and could not find anything medically wrong with me. I am pretty sure that I am suffering from the side effects of the risperdal. I believe I had a brief psychotic disorder which brought on hallucinations when my husband ran off with my girlfried 15 years ago. My world had crashed and I was faced with keeping my house and had trouble keeping a job. So I was constantly faced with the possibility of losing my house under constant stress. My life is much better now. I am engaged and my 2 brothers live with me to help me financially with the house. I am wondering if I need this risperdal now. The side effects seem worse to me now.

He has been less angry and less violent.  He is very emotional though.  Instead of raging out, he cries more.  He definately has an increased appetite.  Overall, I would say that this is a very effective medication for him.

After being on the medication for almost two weeks, she developed uncontrollable slow eyelid closures and squints.  I counted over 11 in one minute.  We have just taken her off the med, and the doctor believes the movements will stop in one day to 2 weeks.  Say a prayer please.

He sleeps &amp; hasn't had an outburst since he began taking it.  He is very thin &amp; has stayed that way.  I wish they had a generic because of the expense.

It helps her anger outbursts some but makes her sleepy and she has gained lots of weight. She also had difficulty with breast discharge. We are trying to decide if we should take her off. She is having memory problems and not sure why?

(along w/serzone) for treatment of seizures, depression &amp; psychotic episodes. While the weight gain IS an issue-this has helped control his seizures &amp; psychotic episodes which have been attributed to possible schizophrenia.   I can always tell when he's missed a dose because he will have a seizure or a hallucination or his speech becomes slurred &amp; you can't understand his speech.

Although this is now used in a complete regime of other medications and therapy, I am pleased with how it works for him. It helps him to control his anger outbursts and helps to keep his emotions &quot;even&quot; through out the day. The ONLY bad thing we have experienced is weight gain, he has gained 20 lbs in one year. However, he is not considered obese or overweight, it is an issue for parents to keep an eye on.

She's been on it for 4 months now and seems to be doing better. Before risperdol she would cry before going to school, during school(up to 3 hours) and then if you would even mention going to school she was crying. Now she seems much happier. Doesn't cry about school.Not sure if it's the meds or that she finally realized she has to go to school every day even if she cries.

It is used as a mood stabilizer in conjunction with an antidepressant. I take it with Lexapro an antidepressant before bed, as the riperdal makes me sleepy. I take Provigil in the morning to counteract the sleepiness.
