Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Henry, 65-74 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	2	4		65-74	7/25/2012 5:33:35 AM	The only reason for my difficulty in using this drug, is that it apparantly does not come in 7-1/2mg tablet. Has this changed? I have to take 6 - 2-1/2mg pills a day, and usually end up droping one and sometimes losing it.

About 9 months ago I got a terrible cough like I smoked 3 packs a day.  However, I don't smoke. I wnet to the doctor, had antibiotics, chest xray, ear nose and throat with endoscopy, steroids.  the cough was so bad that people didn't want to be around me as I seemed to have some horrible disease.  I had a lot a sputum in my mouth and coughed all night long also.  Just yesterday I was out with a friend and we noticed that I wasn't coughing.  then I remember that I had not taken the glyburide that morning or that night.  It is now the next day and I haven't been coughing or taking the glyburide.  One thing that I do now remember is that at first I had pink tablets and about 6 months or so they stqrting giving me yellow tablets.  I don't know whether it was a dye in the meds or what but I don't ever want to have a cough like that again.  I truly thought that i HAD CANCER WAS GOING TO DIE!

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	7/31/2010 8:53:50 PM	this medicine has lowered my A1C level to 6.2. My blood sugar levels have been much lower. You have to eat regularly though, because I have experienced dizziness, hunger and shaking if I don't eat enough. I don't have the problems with nausea and the such I had with metformin. So I make sure I eat right, and keep much closer track of my glucose levels.

BS reading in am always 120 or below.  however, I have gained weight, and it does make me jittery sometimes and also lightheaded.  Don't like lightheaded feeling especially if I'm out somewhere.  It is very unnerving.  I am only pre-diabetic, so doc put me on 1.25 glyberide, and seems to be helping my A1C just fine.  However, not happy with these side effects.

Was able to drop to once daily and keep my levels in the 80-150 range.  When I didn't eat in the morning it would drop to 70 and I would get the shakes.  I also noticed bloating and my vision would get very blurry.  I stopped the glyburide and just stayed on the Metformin 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 at night.  My levels were always high 200-mid 300 range, although my eyes were better.  I am going back on the glyburide, can't seem to control my levels even with diet.  Also before starting this regimen my AC1 was in the mid- 9's. and immediately dropped to mid-6's and maintained this while I was on glyburide and metformin.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	GN, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	6/23/2008 6:36:03 PM	Have been taking 1.25mg twice a day for the past 2 years.  I am not on a strict diet, but my food intake now includes a lot of non-starchy vegetables such as broccoli and dark greens (all types) and nuts &amp; legumes.  I also stopped drinking sodas and now drink plenty of water.  This combined with an hour of aerobic exercise 4 days per week has decreased body weight by 50 lbs, and lowered my cholesterol and blood pressure too.  Exercising and losing the weight especially around my tummy area really made a big difference as my body is able to process the medicine and food more efficiently.

I now stopped glybuteride altogether as 2 hrs later, my sugar dropped so severely, i felt like jello and weak.  Tried several ways ie: different times with a bit of food later on,  of taking same result it's no good for me. Taking just Actos now reaction isn't as bad 2 hrs later.

My glocose levels now run between 70 and 140 all the time---very seldom does it go over 150. For me these 2 drugs combined work great. eating 3 small meals a day helps keep low sugars under control and has also helped me to lose some weight as well

As much as possible, try to control your diabetes through diet and exercise.
