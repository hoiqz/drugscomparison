I developed severe chest pain and nausea. I did not vomit but I had severe salivation I had a hard time to keep swallowed. I had just had a heart cath. and they left the sheath in for six hour so it was painful to remove. I was given somuch blood thinner my blood would'nt clot. I also broke out in a sever clammy sweat. The sweatran down my face and they had to change all my clothing. They didn't know if I was having a heart attack or a side effect from morphine. Whatdo you think?Verla

He was seeing rabbits on the wall, he was mean (not at all like him) and using my power of attorney I went to the nurses station and told them not to give him anymore of it to use Oral Loratab (which had worked from a previous surgery).  I walked into the restroom in his hospital room and while I was in there the nurse came in and as I was walking out of the restroom she was puttin more of this crap in his IV.  I through a fit, called a supervisor and showed them my power of attorney and made them remove the IV immediately.  As soon as the medication wore off (a horrible time) he was put of oral loratab and everything was fine.

It burned going in, made my arm stiff for a minute, made me nauseas for a minute, then I felt no pain. It's been 3 hours and I still feel no pain, which is extremely nice since my face had been very swollen with lots of headache pain.

But immediately after I get injected with morphine, I hardly noticed the pain at all. Does wonders until it wears out again, then I ask the nurse 2 hours later for more.
