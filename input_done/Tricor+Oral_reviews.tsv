My triglyceride level was at 1349 when I started and are under 100 now. My cholesterol was at 375 and is now below 200. I have never had any negative side affects. I guess tricor works better for some people and not so good for others.

I told him with my diabetic diet and exersice I wanted to be retested in a few months. The side effects are not worth the pain and inactivity.

No leg cramps, nightmares or loss of sex drive. I do have to urinate about 3 times before I can fall asleep. My Tri's were 1,200 2 months ago. I've been a little tired, but I've been walking 2 miles a day and have lost 16 pounds. I've also changed my diet drastically. I'm really looking forward to see my next blood work results. Hopefully I get some good news next month.

Increased nausea that worsened to every day, all day long. Brain fog. Sudden hair loss all over my head leaving me with much thinner hair! Stopped taking it. Statins all gave me chronic myalgia and I'm not willing to destroy my muscles for something else I MIGHT get in the future. Thus, at this point I am sticking with the prescription fish oil.

Soon after I read or heard about a law suit being filed because of people taking tricor having kidney problems. I stopped taking it and did not consult my doctor as have an appointment coming up in about a week. For about five days ago I started having disturbing synptoms of what I thought may be a stroke. From the very center (left side) of my lips, chin, out towards cheek, soon followed by left arm and left leg feeling weak and knee buckled on walking, etc. After several days it intensified and I dod a walk in to my promary care doctor. He felt I was or having or had a stroke. He drew blood for testing etc and was able to get right away an MRI of the brain, including contrast. I am a registered nurse and worked as a nurse for 33 years. A family memger looked on internet about stopping statin drugs suddenly (I forgot to mention on the doctor visit about stopping the drug. After hearing stopping it could bring on a stroke I started it back today. I plan to see my doctor first thing Monday morning. Right now it is Friday night. Thank you, sincerely.

I looked up the side effects and sure enough that was one of them.  I stopped the drug immediately and all of the pains went away.  I'm trying a different approach.  Be careful as your doctor may tell you that this is not in the statin family so it will not cause muscle aches ... rubbish!  It does!Good luck with your solution.

I didn't have that many side effects until I had a comprehensive metabolic panel of blood tests.  My kidney function had deterioated that I was in Stage 3 kidney disease function.  I looked up the side effects, for Diabetics this is not a good choice as it affects your kidneys!  I contacted the FDA.   I was on this 6 months.    My kidney function is almos normal, now after a year but am now using Lovaza or any over the counter fish oil plus cinnamon to lower my blood sugar.   I am also on statin meds.   Be very careful if you are a Diabetic.  Also, check each and every side effect this medicine has.

I can't tolerate statins so I was put on tricor 145 and have been on it for almost four months.  I have had arm numbness, excruciating pain in all of my joint.  I have insomnia due in part to the horrific pain in my back, legs, with arms that fall asleep for no reason.  I stopped taking this awful drug yesterday, and I am feeling better.  However, because of the pain I was given oxycodone which I will now have to be weaned off.  Not to mention all of the dr bills that are piling  up.  This drug has made my life a living hell.  No more cholesterol meds for me ever  again.  If you start to feel lethargic and groggy, or if you are in pain please call you dr.

Have tried other drugs to lower the fat and sugar in blood but they were not tolerable.  Tricor is tolerable but the side effects are becoming more prominent. I have noticed problems with 'depression' with this drug and being tired. Any similar problems?

Experiencing muscle pain in legs, tingling in arms, and bloating pressure in my left chest.  I am not going to take this medication anymore.  Just took a blood test today so I cannot judge how much this medicine lowered my Tri's.  I am going to take Niacin and Omega Red fish oil and see how that does.

High Cholesterol	ChasW, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	55-64	6/9/2010 1:57:33 PM	I'm a sixty year old male, and I have been taking this medication since February, at the suggestion of my doctor, to reduce the &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol in my system. I take no other medications. I stopped for about a three-week period to see if there would be any noticeable difference in my health and/or the way I felt. I have recently resumed the medication and have noticed increased muscle stiffness, soreness, headaches, body aches (similar to the flu). I have had sores break out on my scalp and other places on my body. I have felt lethargic, lifeless, and depressed. I am going to stop the Tricor and see if the symptoms disappear; based on what I am reading here, I'm fairly convinced that my symptoms are drug-induced, and I don't particularly desire to spend the rest of my time here on earth in pain and discomfort. I'm attempting alternative therapy by altering my life style and diet, as that is probably the best solution for ANY health problem. I've never taken any other prescription drugs for anything except antibiotics for infection prevention or painkillers for three damaged lumbar vertebral discs. I trust my own body to tell me when I'm doing something it doesn't like! And it obviously doesn't like Tricor!

I have not had any numbness that people have reviewed about, but I have had iritis 3 times. Called the pharmacist and asked if she heard of Tricor and iritis being linked together (since that is my only common demoninator) and she did say it can cause fussy vision and conjunctvitis. I am going to talk to my doctors about getting me off this medication. Only problem is I can't take Niacin either...Any heard about that new Cholesterol out that lowers Triglycerides?

Of course the Doctor said that these were not known to cause these side efects.  To me everyone is different so wouldn't the side effects be different for everyone? As soon as I went off the Tricor I felt much better. Also felt blotted. Triglicerides went from 345 to 213.

Just recently, I have been getting up to pee at least twice every night.  I'm 50 years old so I really didn't think anything about it until I got my physical and saw my ALT liver levels were twice the normal level.  My Dr checked me for hepatitis and cirrhosis, I have neither.  ALT liver levels indicate liver damage.  I have stopped taking Tricor and I will wait and see if my liver recovers.  I hope it does.

Had stress test, and heart Dr. put me on lisinipril for high blood pressure.  Had not ever had this before.  For the next week I had several days of 180's over 90's.  I finally figured the common denominitor was Tricor.  Stopped taking it and has been 120's over 60's ever since.     
High Cholesterol	rteye, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	1/26/2010 7:07:29 PM	I have developed very dry eyes and blurr vision. I stopped taking it, the left eye's vision came back to normal after one week, the right eye stayed blurry and developed macular cyst. It was very hard to diagnose. I visited an optometrist and an ophthalmologist within a week. I am seeing a retina specialist in two days. There is a possibility of loosing my vision in my rt. eye. I would rather live with high cholestrol than loosing my vision.I am not sure if tricor caused it. I am suspicious of the timing and one eye cleared while the other developed major problem.

Tried Welchol and it raised my triglycride level to ~500.  Dr put me on Tricor.  the good news - all levels are now where they need and even good Cholestrol HDL have increased significantly.  However, have experieinced some issues with sex drive and erections and have noticed chnages in vision over the past year.  eye DR. says that peoples vision can change rapidly so don't know if these vision changes are related to these meds or not?. Might be time to try something different - will discuss Lopid with my DR since I've heard Lopid has a generic and Tricor is quite expensive.

I got a sharp pain in the bottom of my right foot.  Couldnt walk.  Then for the last 18 months, its been one thing or another.  It took four months after stopping the drug for 80% of problems to go away but now I am left with severe muscle and joint problems and abdominal pains that strikie hard and with no warning.  I currently can't walk well since my right knee cant bend and bothe knees hurt terribly.  Of course after extensive testing they can't find anything wrong with me.  But it seems that when searching the internet it appears that there are others with the same problems as me after taking Tricor 145.

In April, 2009 the doctor gave prescription for Tricor. Earlier in the year my renal function was normal.  My eGFR was 59.  Gradually, in July 2009 I noticed my eGFR was 51 and brought it to the attention of the doctor who said my creatine was fine, not to worry.  Triglycerides reduced to 178.  In September did not feel well and had further tests.  Tryglycerides down to 128, but renal function decreased drastically.  Insisted on seeing a Nephrologist. My eGFR was now from 42 to 38 in two weeks.  Stage 3 Kidney Disease.  Stopped Tricor as this was the only new drug taken.  Called Abbott Labs and they admitted to me on the telephone that this is a side effect and should not be taken with a statin drug.  I also filed a report with the FDA.  Just took further renal function tests yesterday, but have not yet gotten results.

When he saw I was on Tricor he mentioned he and his associates are seeing patients with a reduced kidney flow who are taking Tricor. Once some of these patients stopped Tricor for a while their kidney functions approved without any other changes!I will be undergoing several renal tests over a month or so after stopping Tricor to see if I have similar results.Reduced kidney function is not currently listed a a side effect of Tricor.

I have fibromyalgia and other chronic pain issues, I even go to a pain specialist. This drug made me feel SO bad. My joints ached, I had no energy, felt like gravity had quadrupled. I gave it a full 2 months, then called my dr. He said to stop taking it and would put in on the list on drugs not to give me. So I am going to really give the diet and exercise a serious effort!! I am a diabetic as well, so this is life and death. I have every risk factor for heart probs so I will see a heart doctor too, maybe a nutritionist.

I personally don't see where it is making much of a difference in my triglycerides. (I don't have a recent number and won't have labs done again for about a month.) I have had side effects ever since I started this drug. I get severe muscle cramps all over my body, sometime in my back, sometimes the shoulders, but particularly the upper thighs, calves &amp; feet. They have gotten so bad, I've turned black &amp; blue. The most aggravating side effect I'm having, tho, is in my nose. I am continuously blowing it because it continues to run, and is sore inside to the point it bleeds sometimes when I blow it. I constantly have nose congestion. Also, after reading the reviews, I know now that my sleeplessness, and the foggyness I seem to have been having MUST BE from this drug. My doctor insists that I stay on it. I cannot take the fish oil due to being on Coumadin and prescription strength is WAY too expensive, as well. I don't know if there is an alternative for me. I stopped Tricor for about a month recently just to see if it would help. I felt so much better and my nose cleared up after about 8 months of constantly running, and blowing it and getting sore.  I told my doctor. She just listened but insisted that I HAVE to be on it. My tryglicerides are not even all that high (above recommended range, yes, but not in the 1000's, and not even over 500. They started in the 300's and came down on the Tricor.) Would Niacin work for me? My husband is on Niacin which we by over the counter. Much cheaper, and evidently it is working for him. I am ready to pitch the Tricor in the trash!!!  I know I felt better when I stopped taking it for that month. Doesn't seem worth it to me........

I didn't take the meds long plus I didn't take it right.  I wasn't told how to take it so that may have caused the reaction but I would never take this medicine again.  I am also allergic to many meds so that may be part of the problem too.

Has not helped the cholesterol/trig numbers too much. Have no side effects other than reduced sex drive and I think less patience (more edgy). Everyone should write down current state of how they feel before taking any new med and then compare it a few months after taking the med. Otherwise slight side effects get lost. Used to take Statins but always got leg acheness. I'm probably going to stop Tricor because it does little good and many of the comments I read here makes me think it is not worth it. Good health to all!

Food does not taste good anymore either. This has not kept me from eating, of course, but I don't enjoy so much.   I was searching for this response from another patient, but I guess I'm special.

Now I am having tingling in the feet and hands, dark yellow urine, slightly constipated, slightly depressed, blurry vision and most recently abdominal pain.

I did not try the Generic version. After 2 months I was experiencing signs of anger and depression. Inability to focus even on reading an simple article without my mind darting around.  Sexually, Zero libido and the inability to even focus on a fantasy. When it did occur, there was decreased erection stiffness and ejaculation volume. Also, night time Charly-horses in my legs and feet.  I stopped the medication with the reluctant agreement of my doctor and after another 2 months, all of the above signs have disappeared.

Extreme forgetfulness, in a fog, my feet and arms going to sleep, tummy aches, sleepiness and my vision is on and off blurry. Thank you all for your comments. My Dr just seemed to be pushing it under the carpet and it made me feel as if I were loosing it! I'm only 34 with four children. THANK YOU

Doctor discontinued LOPID as it was no longer effective in lowering Triglycerides. Prescribed Tricor. After 2 weeks I was told to discontinue Tricor as blood test revealed that liver tissue was dissolving and was found in my blood. No problem since then and no longer take any Meds to treat high triglycerides.

Brain fog was so bad that I was unalbe to function. Chronic exhustion that made me too tired to go the bedroom and get the meds for energy. Both conditions were diagnpsed as ADD!! Finally I stopped Tirocr for hig liver enzymes and the ADD is cured, the tiredness is gone, and my brain works as good as ever. I will never use that stuff again. I would ratner die than to live in that blinding fog of fatigue again.

I Have been taking this medication for over a year. After talking to some peole about their results I came here to review the rest. I stopped taking this 4 days ago. Why, because, I have no sex drive, am always tired, to the point if I eat even a small meal I am ready for an hour nap, and always am tired, no energy. In addition, Tingling from time to time in my left hand fingers and painn in my right leg joint. Since I stopped taking, all this has gone away. Now for an alternative drug, not sure what that is at the moment but I am sure there are other choices. I take this in consort with 40MG of Lipitor.This web site was more than helpful, thanks everybody for sharing your expierences

It has been 2wks &amp; am now getting blurred visions,headaches, very emoitional-crying, very hard stools w/constipation(taking Colase)and when I take my pain meds for thesternum &amp; bypass I CAN'T SLEEP!  I take 80 mg &amp; 145 mg Tricor w/bloodpressure meds and no diabetes meds. My daily calorie intake has been 1300 watching carbs,fats,sodium since July.  The cost for tricor being over $100 for 30 days w/rx benefits is outrageous. I have lab test in 2wks w/dr visit and was told this would work for the trigly's &amp; temp. for 2mo. This side effects began when tricor entered my daily rx's.I have been on &amp; still go to Cardiac Rehab 3 x's a week &amp; have noticed leg discomfort &amp; less stamina. my blood pressure &amp; sugars are now in control so phase 2 to get my trig's hella down &amp; get my good chol up. But now having READ ALL OF THESE REVIEWS I am contemplating on whether to ride out the side effects until I have the lab done in 2wks.  I just hate these add'l effects when all was going well except for the Triglycerides.  I found these reviews enformative and very useful, for now I have several questions for my Dr that I didn't know to ask abt prior to reading the reviews.  I think now that I am writing this review, I will continue the tricor &amp; contend with these side effects &amp; hope I get no more or any of the effects I just read about. Just 2 more wks only.  I want to see the numbers on the lab rpt.  I want to see a significant decrease in triglycerides before continuing the use of Tricor.  I'm glad this web site &amp; reviews are available.  It has certainly opened my eyes to know the hx of other's experiences and let me know that I'm not overly concerned! But should be concered.  Wishing good health to all.  I will be back to read more experiences with Tricoe.

I had a 2 week period where I would feel dizzy and some numbness, mostly facial or in my left arm. When it first happened, I thought stroke or something, but had no other symptoms. Now that I have read the reviews here, I am pretty sure it was the drug.

I started taking Tricor and it lowered both my cholesterol and triglicerides. I started have severe pain in my knee similar to when I had a torn meniscus. Went for an MRI and to the Orthopedic Surgeon. He said I had Osteo Arthritis. Hog Wash ! ! Did it come on overnight? Then I started reading all the comments on this website. I ache all over and have a foggy brain. Hmmm? I am stopping the Tricor as of today. I would rather die without pain than live with it. I will let you know how I am doing. My husband died at 59 from liver damage due to the drugs he was taking for his heart condition. The cardiologist kept his heart going just fine even though his liver enzimes were increasing. It is wonderful if statins work for some people, but I call them Satins!

Never had any bad side affects with Tricor. But we're trying a new drug now to see if it will work better. Of course, I'm sure if I would stick to an exercise program and lose some weight (I'm trying, just can't seem to get it off) that my lab numbers would be much better. But I do really watch what I eat, so we're struggling as to why we can't get the trig numbers down more.

Combined with Niacin and B vitamins and pull trigs in line. HOWEVER, issues with sex drive and erection persisted. I've dropped tricor and those conditions stopped immediately. Been 6 mths - Waiting on result from blood test to see how niacin and exercise is affecting trigs.

It is difficult to point to Tricor as the only source of this pain because of ostio arthritis. The coincidence that the arthritis and elevated blood sugars having occured in and around my 50th birthday is interesting. I am looking forward to a generic alternative for Tricor, as there seems to be none available at this time.tad suhm

Did have minor constipation but it passed. Have had some minor muscle aches but could be associated with increase physical activity.Haven't had my Tri.'s rechecked yet. So can't provide an accurate rating. Hope it works.

Since triglyceride levels were still high, doctor increased tricor to 145mg while still on the zocor 40mg....after 2 months, I experienced intermittent blindness caused by retinol hemmorhage, and frequent episodes of epistaxis, and chest and abdominal pain...ended up in hospital..now that I stopped the zocor and tricor I do not have the bleeding problems.........are there any other cases like mine?

Other	Hmmmm, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	12/12/2007 9:22:52 AM	Used to lower high triglycerides and raise HDL.  It lowered triglycerides acceptably but did very little or nothing for HDL after almost 3 years on drug. (Also lowered total cholesterol even though that wasn't an issue, but hey, lower is better right?) An aside:  6 months ago, at my request, doctor switched me to Lovaza (omega 3 fatty acids), all my blood lipids are better now and no chemical medication required plus I feel better and lost tons of weight immediately (30# in 7 weeks w/o changing a thing)!

It caused all of my muscles to get very weak &amp; I could hardly even walk or get up or lift my arms! I hurt all over.  It was really a horrible thing to have happen to me.  It has taken 1 year for me to feel better.
