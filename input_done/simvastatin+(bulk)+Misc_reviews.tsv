I developed a rare skin condition called Lichen Planus. This caused a severerash and itching on my hands, wrists and feet. I used several prescriptions that provided some relief. Not until about 6-8 weeks after I decided to stop taking Simvastatin, did the rash noticably start to heal. My cholesterol level was lowered by the drug, I just could not stand the rash and itching anymore!
