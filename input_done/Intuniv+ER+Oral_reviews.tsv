It did work on her hyperness and did allow her to form better friendships.  It did not help her with the school work as her grades continued to go down and teachers emails to me increased.  It also made her gain alot of weight.  She was craving carbs all the time.  When I took her off, her cravings went way down.  She put on over 20 pounds while on this med.

After trying everything, he's now on a combo of 3 mgs Intuniv and 5 mgs methylin solution, 3x/day. We give him the Intuniv around dinnertime b/c the drowsiness takes effect 10 hrs after taking so this helps him sleep a litle later; he awakes between 6-7 AM, as opposed to 4-5 AM. We also have a behaviorist come to the house once per week to help us family members create a personalized &quot;toolbox&quot; so that we can manage the behavior in all different settings including home &amp; family time, shopping, restaurants, etc. With our &quot;tools&quot; we share with others who come in contact with him at school, babysitters, etc. so that there is consistency. We obtained the behaviorist via DDD and pay nothing for a most invaluable service!

We are on her second week. She started with the typical 1mg the first week &amp; has moved up to 2mg. She is a sleepyhead! Our doctor warned us of this prior to starting, so I am adjusting her dosage time to late afternoon. She has had a huge appetite &amp; we couldn't be happier. She only weighs 40 pounds. She has been on stimulants for several years now and she never slept or ate. We are on summer break right now, so I'm not too sure of her focus. She seems to be happy &amp; has only had a few outbursts. We will stick with this for awhile &amp; see where it takes her. Hopefully she will gain weight &amp; have continued success.

Her Doctor prescribed one 1mg of intuniv 1td and 0.2 of clonidine at night to sleep with. The clonidine made her grey in color and almost like a zombie effect took place. So i stopped the clonidine and continued intuniv. I have found that most dr's prescribed intuniv with another adhd medication as intuniv for a &quot;boost&quot; i only give her one 1mg 2x's a day. One before school, and the other at bedtime. It does work well. But if you read the instructions for use it says to use no longer then 9 weeks. I have used it for about 6 mths and i can tell that its potency isnt as strong as it was in the beginning. Overall intuniv has the least side effects and os a great med for treating ADHD in children. I do recomend it for a child that is newly diagnosed and for parents to start them on something mild. If you were like me i did not want to put her on meds and thought the problem was my fault and it wasent even mine or hers. But i believe it is better to treat it know than to wait to late in there life to start medication therapy. Thanx you and gOd Bless you all for it can be a struggle sometimes in this situation. :)

I know that a pill won't fix me completely, but I don't feel that much different on it. It's been almost a year now. At first it really worked well. I took it in my first semester in college and I outlined my ENTIRE psychology book. I have a paper due next week that I haven't even touched because I'll get distracted so easily and forget that the paper exists until the next day or at midnight when I'm going to sleep.A horrible side effect that it gave me after the first couple months was the drowsiness. I take this medicine before I go to sleep, but during the day, I'll fall asleep and start dreaming without even realizing it!

We did not see any effect until we worked up to 3mg over a series of weeks. On this dosage, he is much less hyper and has better self-control.  He also follows directions better and is less argumentative.  The doctor may want to see what 4mg does.  He is not exceedingly tired or sleepy on this medication, as I had feared.

Before that was Adderall XR.  The difference between the 2 meds is like night and day. He can stay focused, he eats, sleeps and is even gaining weight.  We did have a problem with the sleepiness factor, but I started giving it to him at night, and no problems since.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	alwells, 7-12 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	7-12	11/29/2011 10:04:25 AM	My daughter actually did quite well the first week on a small dosage. Then the doctor upped her dosage to and her blood pressure dropped severely. To make a long story short, we ended up transporting her to the hospital in an ambulance due to SEVERE drop in her blood pressure. It was a nightmare I don't wish on any other mother. Beware of kids seeing spots and extremely sleepiness.

He is almost 6 1/2 months old and has adhd, odd and anxiety. The 1 mg dose seemed to &quot;calm&quot; him then the 2mg dose he was swing between all over te place to calm behavior..his concentration is NOT any better so the dr upped it to 3mg. He is so tired, sleeping all the time, has a &quot;whinney&quot; melt down most afternoons into the evening, wakes with very strange night mares sitting straight up, he can't seem to think at all. Dr had me switch it back down to 2 mg but I am scared, he is a creative kid when not on this med, I am worried that it seems to be a sedative restrait not one to help with focus at all. The calm is for he wants to sleep 15 hrs, it is not helping with a productive life and I worry about long term effects.

Intuniv/day for 2 years. After only 6 days of the medication, I noticed a significant reduction in her impulsive, irritable comments. She also said it helped her &quot;remember stuff&quot; better (i.e., organizational skills improved). I don't, however seem much change in school performance. She's still highly distractable. Not the &quot;magic pill&quot; we had hoped for but, when all stimulants failed to help (and some were just awful for her), Intuniv was at least helpful with regards to her behavior.

He wakes up early in the morning also around 5 a.m. and will not go back to sleep.  I hate this medicine and hopefully we can find something that will work better for us.

The biggest downfall is the side effect of  weight gain (she was small and in 4 months is now at the top of her weight for her height) and early breast development.  She's only 8 years old. Also we had sleep problems - sleepy in the day and not tired at night, no matter what time we took the pill. Looking for a better fit!

We lowered him to 1mg and although he was able to focus better and stay on task longer he was experiencing a lot of anger and was very difficult to console or redirect, so we have taken him off.  when we took him off, he had no appetite for 2 days and was still a bit irritable, now he's back to his baseline and the anger issues are gone.

I ydo not fit the &quot;hyperactive&quot; part of this disease, more so the inattentive. I hated this med! I always fell asleep while working and constantly had a pounding headache. I was not able to concentrate any better, &amp; at times i found myself too tired to concentrate. My parents made me stop taking this medication when I almost passed out while driving home late one night. I'm now trying concerta so hopefully it will workout better!

And it made me seem like was calm and paying attention but it just made me tired. Then my doctor uped my dosage slowly every month until i was on the 4mg. The small tiredness that i felt then got from managable to unbearable during the school year. Every day i would end up falling asleep in class and i couldnt do anything about it. I tryed waking myself up in the morning various ways, but no matter what i did i always fell asleep. I went to the doctors soon after but he said everything was normal, blood pressure and all that, i was taking it at the same time every morning before i went to school, going to bed the same time every night, and eating a salad and a chicken sandwich at lunch every day. I still dont know what the problem was but i stoped taking intuniv and switched back to the adderal and im doing much better now thanI was on the intuniv.

We started at the typical 1mg which worked gr8 for about a mth. We upped it to 2mg which continued the positive change until last week. He was at 2mg for 8 mths but started having really bad outbursts again &amp; losing focus. The dr's &amp; I decided to try 3mg &amp; I also changed fr giving it to him at night to the morning due to the outbursts at school. The change in time has worked gr8. He really doesn't get sleeps fr this until early evening. The only difference I see is that he gets irratated pretty easily about 7 to 9 hrs after he takes the pill. This was not happening at a lower dosage so I hope he will adjust to it in another week or so. His grades have improved since being on this drug &amp; changing the time the teachers tell me he's doing much better &amp; can focus on his work easier. He also is able to ignore inappropriate behavior fr other students. Though with all drugs you have your pros &amp; cons, but I find this to have more pro's than cons in our home. 
Other	aidensmom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	5/29/2011 12:07:14 PM	My son is 7 years old and after trying various natural methods via diet/supplements I caved and tried this non-stimulant.  Administered in the evening before bedtime.  The first 8 days were the hardest as he experienced severe headaches and sleepiness.  I was ready to take him off of it but when I came home that day he'd had a great day and no headache.  I went day by day from that point and we're now 3 weeks in and we're seeing very positive benefits.  I am also giving daily probiotics to counter help the stomach pains and  this has proven very helpful.  My advice stick it out as long as you can before you give in and try something else.

He was diagnosed with Oppositional Defiance, ADHD...He was extremely defiant and distruptive at school. He was also very senstive to external noises, light as an infant/toddler. He has tested to be highly intelligent, well above his age. With Intuniv he is now successful and part of the gifted program. The school psychologist has been amazed by the &quot;new&quot; little boy she now observes in the classroom. He has been released from Special education (due to ODD/behavioral issues) and is now strictly 504. We did have to switch to taking it at night vs morning. After about 6 months of use, it was making him too tired during the day. Taking it at night is perfect. We do hope we can work on modifying his behavior and rewiring his brain so that he does not have to take meds &quot;forever&quot;. We do hope to avoid stimulant use as well. I too have ADHD and went on Vyvanse for 6-8 months. During this time i worked intensely on my own cognitive/behavioral modification and was able to quit taking the medication. It takes a lot of conscious effort to &quot;do well&quot;, but I was able to do it and I am helping my son learn to understand his &quot;gift&quot; and how to function within society's expectations. he will always march to a different drummer...but most likely he will be leading and creating / inventing. ADHD is a gift not a sentence! 
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	4/25/2011 5:30:17 PM	My 9 yr old daughter started on this almost 3 weeks ago.  She has Tourette's Syndrome and has a lot of anxiety.  She has explosive mood swings and gets very frustrated very easily.  Cries or screams very loud!  She has been on Depakote for a while which seems to have subdued her tics from Tourettes.  We tried Zoloft and Straterra... to calm her moods and make them more balanced. Neither worked.  She is on the 3rd week of Intuniv (up from 1mg to 2mg).  She is a very very skinny girl.  She has started to gain weight.. maybe about 5 lbs at ths point.  She has always been a great sleeper.  Now she gets tired in the afternoon and goes to bed ok but has been waking up every night around 4AM and unable to go back to sleep very well.  She has also complained of dry mouth a little.  From the other reviews I have read, these seem to be fairly common side effects.  Until about 2 days ago, I would say that the meds haven't affected her behavior at all.  But, yesterday she was an angel.  I kept expecting explosive behavior in the typical situations that would normally set her off.  She did not react that way at all.  So far today she has been great too.  I am keeping my fingers crossed that we have finally found something to help her and that the side effects will get better.  As far as the weight gain I am hoping it stops where it is at now.  She was skinny enough that a few extra pounds are ok.

Currently on 3 mg as it is based on weight.  She has taken this for a year, and she started with 1 mg.  We could tell right away when it was time to increase the dosage.  She takes it at night, and we have marked drowsiness in the afternoon right after school. Has made a big difference in behavior at school and home.  She does complain of stomach pain which is a listed side effect. I was pleased to find this medication since other ADHD medications did not work for her.  My theory is that as a child with an FASD, her brain is different from the trials/study groups.  We recently added 1 mg of Melatonin in the evening and that has stopped the sleep issues at night.  It was hard for her to fall asleep at night since she would often sleep the 30 minute ride home from school.  Overall, very pleased and will continue to use this.

At first he was like a walking zombie, but the sleepiness has eased off. He has always had a problem with constipation and has been taking Miralax for over a year, but since on this medication I have had to increase the amount of it he takes. He has started complaining about his &quot;tummy&quot; hurting, but it is hard to know if it really does or not. He also has autism, and can't always communicate how he really feels. I have noticed that around mid-day he seems to have a meltdown. Meltdowns can be common for children with Autism, but these are happening at about the same time everyday. I am wondering if it is the medication. Maybe instead of wearing off gradually that he could be crashing. We have an appt with his doctor on Friday, and I hope she can answer some of these questions. Overall though, I do think this medication is effective.

Been under treatment since was 5. Has been on Intuniv for nearly a year now. He takes 60mg of Vyvanse also. Before being put on the Intuniv he was taking Tenex however it wasn't lasting long enough. Since being changed over to Intuniv, we haven't noticed any changes at all. Evenings are still rough. Never know from one minute to the next what mood he is going to be in. Teachers love him because is so well behaved. Recently however his grades have started dropping and is having trouble remembering his assignements. We are looking to get his meds changed and try to find something that works more effectively for him.

He plays sports and has not been able to function to play and he is not funcioning at school or at home either.

Since taking Intuniv, we have our old son back and impulsivness is under control. The only side effect he experienced was sleepy at first but after a week of each new dose, that wore off and he was use to it.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Mikeys-Mamaw, 3-6 Male  (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	3-6	3/25/2011 1:09:25 PM	It has made a drastic difference in my Grandsons overall attitude including his ODD, Obssesive Defiance Disorder and Serious Anger problems. I saw a change within a couple days. He has been Loveable, doing what he's asked the first time...well not cleaning his room...LOL He is 6 after all and has been like this sense he was 3. But after taking the trial pkg of 2 bottles we got from the doctor, my Grandson started started on the 2mg ER. He's on his first week and is starting to have stomach aches. He normaly eats after dinner again before bed so I'm going to make it cereal (lots of milk to coat his stomach) and give him the intuniv then. I hope it works cause I have raised him since he was 4 months old and watch him get progressivly worse. Now we have found something that has given me hope that we both can have a normal life (whats normal any more any way?) By the way he has tried several different kinds of ADHD Meds alone and is now on Concerta which was helping more than the Ritalin that he was on previously or the other ones before, but it seemed those aggitated his other problems while helping the ADHD. I honestly feel Intuniv was God Sent, at 52 I wasn't sure how much longer I was going to be able to keep up with all my Angels problems. My grandson also has Aspergers Syndrom. It has alot of the same symptoms as ADHD and he couldn't show his feelings before unless it was Anger. Now he tells me he Loves me and Kisses me so many times a day, that at first all I could do is cry. And Thank God.Praying it keeps working,Mikeys Mamaw

We of course began with the 1 mg dose and titrated up the dosage as recommended. His nightmares are constant to the point he is afraid to go to sleep and the dark is out of the question. Dizziness is problematic, with him developing severe abdominal pain with pain radiating up through his chest and into his throat, he has constant joint pain and headache.This medicine was so constipating it caused him to develop a &quot;Mega colon&quot; which has been horrific to correct. I do not recommend this drug for my son since it has had some horrible side effects for a 10 year old to tolerate. But, again it may be the perfect drug for others. My recommendation to all parents/patients is to try the medication, follow the doses closely. Medicine is not an exact science but a trial and error process.

In the beginning, it reduced his impulsive behavior and moodiness.  Now, those behaviors/symptoms have returned. We can't increase the dose because his blood pressure is low to begin with.  It's time to reevaluate and find something else that will help.  Luckily, he is very honest about how any of the medications make him feel and will tell us if it helps him and how.

I'm hoping he will get adjusted, but overall I'm just glad he's off of the stimulants!

This is the latest treatment and we absolutely love that our daughter is herself and can now concentrate on her school work and other activities with out distraction. Much better than any of the stimulant meds out there. Highly recommend this med to parents of children who need some assistance focusing, yet don't want to lose their child to the side effects.

She was on Concerta for 4 years and it effectivness was starting to wear off and we were seeing some negative behavioral issues.  We tried her on Strattera and she was getting violently ill after 3 days.  So far with this medication we have see no improvment, and we are only on 2 mg.  Not sure how long we will be able to keep her on with out changing to something different.

Her behaviour was improved, no more tantrums and less attitude. However, she was like a walking zombie on this medicine! I couldn't stand seeing her that way. She became lost on it, my energetic daughter was no longer! Then I noticed that her eyelashes were gone. She had picked them all out! This was not ever a problem prior to taking this medicine! Her blood pressure was going up as well as her weight. I took her off the medicine, am now trying Omega 3 vitamins. They seem to help a little. But I am not willing to jeopardize my daughters personality for a medication! The hair pulling has since continued to be a problem, and has now expanded to her eyebrows. So now I have my daughter back, but with a new problem that wasn't present before. She says she does it because she is bored. When she was on the medicine she said she would feel like she was bored even when she was doing something.
Other	xmom523, 7-12 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	7-12	1/10/2011 1:18:12 PM	My 7-yo son is has high-functioning autism w/ADHD. The first three months of this school year were a nightmare; his meds were overdue for a change and his behavior was aggressive, disruptive, uncontrollable, and caused us nothing but trouble at school and home. We took him to the doctor in October and she changed him to Intuniv. By the time we hit the full 3-mg dosage in November, his entire personality had changed for the better. He has since gotten almost nothing but happy faces and good reports at school; he's calmer and more able to sit through a movie or interact with family; he's more agreeable and better able to calm himself when there's a cause for upset, and he's just massively improved overall. It's like he's a whole new kid. I'm in awe of the changes, and for the first time in a long while I'm looking forward to his IEP meeting today, because we can finally get on to plans for the future and stop dwelling on problems of the past. One caveat: I will say that his tantrums are few and far between, but when a bad one hits, it is REALLY BAD. Much more intense than I've seen him in a quite some time. They do resolve relatively quickly, but they are severe.

Ok so O really WANT to like this medication.  My son is much calmer and can focus on a task longer and his irritability seems much decreased.  He isn't acting out aggressively &amp; impulsively nearly as much BUT and it's a hung but... He is miserable!  He is nauseous, has stomach pain, headaches and extreme lethargy!  This is only on 1 mg/day!  I am frustrated because nothing has had such a positive response regarding his behavior but I can't leave him on a medication that makes his so uncomfortable.  One week on and already discontinuing it.  So frustrating!!!!

He has ADHD and struggled in school because of the symptoms. He has been taking it for a year and the only side effect was drowsiness. We gave it to him at bedtime until he tolerated the dose. The drug is expensive and our insurance covers very little. He takes one milligram so, we purchase a 90 day supply and cut the pills in half: this gives us a six month supply. My son also participates in martial arts and basketball to assist him in self-control. He had trouble making friends because he inadvertently invaded people's personal space. Intuniv coupled with a therapeutic routine has given him the confidence he needs.

Staying on task at school. We had noticed in the first month of taking this medication he was able to finish a puzzle, coloring a page and even in T-ball it has seemed to help. We are able to enjoy game nights together also.  I am so glad we did try Intuniv.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	MomieX5, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	4	3		45-54	11/25/2010 9:26:43 AM	We have had three children on intuniv - our 11 y/o with extensive issues is already on other meds, and we're still hoping Intuniv will replace the clonadine he takes; our 9  y/o son is taking it for ADD and it has been effective - especially once we got through the falling asleep and switched to taking it at night.  Now for the dissatisfaction - our 6 y/o daughter, dxed with ADHD has had the same initial reactions as our sons - it worked to help her focus in school - but she would nap when she got home - not a bad thing.  That is no longer an issue - but the aggressive behavior has become a nightmare.  We are at our 2nd week on the second month at 2mgs.  Concentrating improved at school, but her impulsivity is back - and she is so very angry.  This is beyond tantrums and is as if watching this out of body anger, out of her control ballistic, and frightening behavior.  As of today, we will continue with Concerta (is only day 2), and will be taking her off of Intuniv.  So you can take this as a mix review by a mom with 3 (of our 5) children experiences.  Good luck to all - this is a ever-changing journey for our wonderful children - answers are out there, you just have to keep looking for them.

So no stimulants for the ADHD. He is having surgery to correct the apnea, and taking 1mg on Intuniv.  The results so far have been great.  The explosive episodes have ceased and he is so pleasant to be around.  Always a sweet boy, but now, not walking on eggshells when he is in a mood.  So far, love this medication. 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	11/17/2010 1:13:30 PM	My 9 yr. old (67lbs.) has ADHD, is currently taking 20 mg of Ritalin a day. Was still not able to control his impulses so we started 1 mg. of Intuniv also. At first it worked wonders, but he was very tired.  Each week he seemed more tired, dark circles appeared under his eyes and his voice was nearly gone.  After 4 weeks, I took him to our family doctor.  His blood pressure was 80/50 VERY LOW!  His throat was exptremely dry and his weight had dropped.  While the medicine was effective for the ADHD, his healthy was deteriorating. We stopped it immediately and are now searching for something else. Please monitor your child's blood pressure while on this medication   
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Male	13-18	11/15/2010 2:56:24 PM	My son is 13 years old and has been on every ADHD medication out there except the patch. He is also Bipolor.  He is currently on 108mg of Concerta in the AM( I know this seems like alot, but it is the only thing that works with his high metabolism) and Risperdal 1mg/Conjenta AM/PM.  We started to see lots of issues this year in school as he is starting to mainstream.  He was oppisitional about everyday things, sometimes completing work, but failing to turn it in. Not remebering anything he had done in class.  We were sinking fast.  He was started on Intuniv and we are now in out starting our 4th week (2nd on 3mg).  He has changed immensly.  He is more upbeat, less emotional about anaything said to him.  Easier to talk to and he responds appropriatly.  He is able to focus and in turn I think he feels more in control which then gives him a good feeling about himself.  So far so good!
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity		5	5	5			11/4/2010 2:51:46 PM	My 12 year old son was started on this due to side effects from his stimulants such as inability to sleep and decreased appetite affecting his growth and developement.  This has been alife saver.  He now sleeps through the night without wandering the house, has control more consistently throughout the day and eats like a normal child.  He has gained weight and now is 5 foot 5 and 140 pounds.  when he began taking this medication he was 5 foot 4 and 96 pounds.  It takes a week or so to adjust to the medication and get through the initial drowsy spell, so i suggest doing a med change over a school break to help ease the transition, but once you are on a proper dose.. it is a lifesaver

It was really incredible,no irritability, no explosiveness, a very pleasant boy, I was overjoyed.  Week 2 on medication he became irritable again,but not quite as bad as previously.  Week 3 he seems even more irritable, but still not as intense as pre medication.  We are still at 1mg, and he weighs about 55lb.  I was hoping we would not have to increase his dose, will see what MD has to say.

I cannot say enough good things-its an old drug and the sides effects are non-existing. We ran the stimluant gamut for 2 years &amp; it ceased to work &amp; my son couldnt eat or sleep-it was HORRIBLE-we will never go back on stimulants &amp; I am thankful our DOctor let us try the Intuniv-I really cannot say enough good things about it. My son has 100% in all his classes but two so far this year &amp; in those other 2 he has 98%-people are enjoying being in his company &amp; he has gained 7 much needed pounds-he focuses &amp; listens to directions and I just cannot believe the difference in him. I ALWAYS knew he was a smart funny lovable kid but most people couldnt get past all his other ADHD characteristics to see it themselves. Now he has friends &amp; it makes me so happy!!!

Concerns are ADHD and not being able to put him on stimulants due to his recent diagnoses of Tic Disorder.  Last night was the first night we gave him 1  mg at 8pm.  Sleep through the night well which is usually common for him.  Today, I received calls from school and PSPM teacher that he has been sleeping in school all day.  Called doctor to lower medicatoin to .5 mg for tonight.  He appears more relaxed, less hyper but he's been sleeping/tired most of the day so hard to tell.  Will continue at .5 for the first week to see if it's helping him.  The reviews for children with Tics and ADHD  seem wonderful so I'll hang in there.

He is 6 years old and when I found out he had ADHD I refused to give him stimulants so we first tried Strattera which wore off after a few months. Then the doctor talking me into Adderall which he only took once due to a night of hallucinations. Now he has been on Intuniv for almost 3 weeks. He has been doing great at school and good at home except he has been having bad dreams (dr doesn't think its related) and he wakes up in the middle of the night and he never used to. (Dr. also thinks is unrelated) He is scared of the dark ever since the hallucinations from the aderral and has been complaining of bone pain. (Again Dr. says is not from the meds, so I honestly don't know) I'm not sure what to do since he's doing so well at school, but his sleep is important too. (And so is mine. I have a baby who has finally started sleeping through the night, but now he's keeping me up.) I believe this medicine is helping him though to focus and not be nearly as impulsive. However at times he actually seems anxious and moody. Overall he's is far better behaved now. We stopped giving it in the  morning because the sleeping issues and since he ends up very sleepy after school the doc thought giving it before bed would help but I really haven't seen much of a difference at all. Maybe I'll try giving it at like 5pm like some one else mentioned. this is truly difficult for a parent that only wants the best for her child so I wish every one luck!

His handwriting has changed. He is involved in school. He is outside playing football right now.  It has made him easier to be around, less aggressive and implusive.  I believe that it is well worth the money that is charged for it, though the ones that need it most usually can't pay that. As medicaid will not pay for it, My son will soon be again changed to the drugs that havenot worked in the past. Please help as I know that I am not the only parent in this situation.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	9/20/2010 12:51:20 PM	MY 10 YR OLD SON HAS JUST BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH ADHD. HE COULDN'T GET HIS WORK DONE AT SCHOOL, WAS LYING AND HIDING IT FROM ME AT HOME, AND COULDN'T GET ALONG WITH HIS SISTER. THE DOC WANTED TO TRY INTUNIV INSTEAD OF A STIMULANT BECAUSE HE ONLY WAYS 54 LBS--WHICH IS PRETTY SMALL FOR HIS AGE. SHE DIDN'T WANT HIM TO LOSE ANY WEIGHT. WE ARE AT THE END OF WEEK 2 ON THIS MED. WE STARTED AT 1MG AND ARE NOW ON 2MG. HE IS GETTING HIS WORK DONE AND HIS HANDWRITING HAS IMPROVED. HE IS GETTING ALONG WITH HIS SISTER SOOO MUCH BETTER. I CAN SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE. HIS TEACHER SAYS SHE HAS SEEN A DIFFERENCE TOO, BUT NOT TO THE EXTENT IT NEEDS TO BE. WE ARE SUPPOSED TO INCREASE TO 3MG TOMORROW, BUT I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO TRY TO KEEP HIM ON THE 2MG FOR AWHILE TO SEE IF IT IS ENOUGH. I'LL TALK TO HIS DOC ABOUT IT. THE MAIN PROBLEM WE'VE HAD IS SLEEPINESS DURING THE DAY. WE TAKE IT ABOUT 7:30 PM TO HELP WITH IT. HE HAS STARTED COMPLAINING ABOUT NIGHTMARES AND NOT BEING ABLE TO STAY ASLEEP. I ALSO WANT TO TALK TO THE DOC ABOUT THIS. I'M NOT SURE IF ITS CAUSED BY THE MED, BUT IF IT IS I HOPE IT WEARS OFF.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	MaryM, 45-54 Female  (Caregiver) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	9/14/2010 10:42:30 PM	My 11 year old daughter has been taking this medicine for almost two months.  She had had to slowly increase the dosage as she become a zombie child when she takes the higher doses.  This is so bad that she has had to start taking a low dose of Vavyanase (sp?) in the am to keep her awake.  She has had nightmares, and sleep walking since she began the med.  She even called me on my cell phone while sleeping and does not remember!  I was told that these symptoms decrease and her Dr wants her to give it two months/or a 3mg dosage level before changing her to another medicine.  He wants her to take the Vavaynase in the interm to get her through the sleepiness.   Over all I have not seen a huge difference in her ability to focus.  She is much less hyperactive, but she needs to be able to focus during class and I don't see this happening yet.  I will give it a few more weeks to decide to have a conversation with her Dr. but, if I had to grade it now I would say it is not very effective in my off the chart ADHD child.
Other	PHallMom, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	13-18	9/10/2010 9:12:17 PM	I chose the above stars because my 14yr old son just started Intuniv 3 days ago.  The first two afternoons he has been asleep by 5pm and it took forever to get him up the next morning. Don't know if this is a normal side effect or if it wears off eventually or not....so I guess it remains to be seen if this is a good med for us or not.  He had been taking depakote/vyanse &amp; celexa but once high school/puberty kicked in, his depression and bipolar tendacies have increased so perhaps he has gotten &quot;immune&quot; and that is why we've switched.  My fingers are crossed that we will see less aggression, back talk, hyperactivity, impulsivity, arguing and defiance......and although I enjoy the silence in the evenings (I'm sorry to say that out loud), I don't feel it's healthy for him to be this sleepy so much. So I'm not sure how this is going to play out.  THANK YOU to all the folks that have taken the time to post their experiences, it's comforting to know I'm not alone.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	ang1970, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/7/2010 9:59:31 AM	My 11 year old son was experiencing severe depression and self-loathing on his stimulent meds.  We tried them all.  They would help his physical symptoms, but eventually they all put him in a very dark, angry place.  We started the Intuniv 1mg about 3 months ago, as school was ending.  This summer has been a dream.  He is actually a happy kid under all that anger.  When I ask him to do his chores, he says ok, and then does them! When I ask him to turn off his video game and go to bed, he does it without it being a 30 minute ordeal.He gained 6 pounds in 3 months, and is sleeping well every night.  We give him his pill at 7pm. With school just starting up, we upped his dosage to 2mg, a few days ago.  He's had a little nausea the last couple of days, but still eating like a horse...I love this med!  I don't see the dramatic improvement in the physical manifestations of AD/HD that I saw with the stimulants.  This helps in that area, but the major benefit is the lack of side effects, and the fact that my son is happy.  He actually said he loves me, for the first time since he was a toddler.  He can visit friends without me being worried he would fly into a rage and hurt someone.  When I say no, it does not start World War III!  This morning, I overslept.  So I come tearing out of bed to find he has gotten himself up, made himself some cereal, packed his homework up, remembered to wear the right tennis shoes (gym today) and walked to school with his friend Jay.  All quietly, so that I could sleep in on my first day off in 10 days.  Yes, Intuniv is expensive. But it is worth every penny!!!!I love it!!!!

He has been placed on every medication possible but the ticks, depression and anger episodes were always present.  My son started two weeks ago and is currently on the 2 mg. and I already see a difference.  He smiles, laughs and does not fight with me in the morning.  He actually did his homework in his room when I thought he was playing video games and said &quot;Here mom will you check his for me&quot;?  This has never happened in the seven school years to date....I am optimistic and hope this is a miracle in a bottle.

I was a little scared to put him on this at first since it is new but I am in love with it. He has been on it 3 weeks now and is it 2mg every morning. There are no more meltdowns, no more aggression. Our house is happier and so is he. Yes he is more talkative but I am more than ok with that. Due to the Autism he kept to himself alot. I feel like I have my son back. This medicine has given me a new hope for him and his future!!!

Previously, he was taking Concerta (and had been since 2nd grade) but he capped out on this medication and it was no longer effective. We are trying out Intuniv and are now at 3 mg.  We, including my son, do not think Intuniv is effective. He is still having trouble with impulsivity and is as disorganized as ever.  Sleepiness occurred at first but does go away. We may go up to 4 mg in a couple of weeks before trying something else. Per our physician, if Intuniv does not work, we will try Vyvanse.

He has been on Concerta 72mg plus citalapram for about 4 years which have slightly curbed his outbursts. We started Intuniv only 1 week ago, but there has been a dramatic change in behavior. THIS IS A MIRACLE PILL. I can actually have a conversation with this boy which is something I have NEVER been able to have before. NO MORE FIGHTING. NO MORE OUTBURSTS.  He is agreeable and NICE. (I never ever referred to him as nice before)!!This is on the 1 mg pill.. we are startingg 2 mg tomorrow,,, hopefully this trend continues ..

We tried about 4 different medications. She was on Ritalin LA for about 4 yrs and then it started to not work any longer. So her dr. said we should try Intuniv. I was REALLY leary at first and told him that I was'nt sure. But then my husband and I thought about it and decided it would be worth a try. This medicine works better than Ritalin. It does take time to actually work. (unfortunately it does not happen over night.) So far it has been really good. I just hope for my daughter's sake that it will be the last medicine we will have to try. God Bless to all your parents out there that deal with these same issues. It's not easy.....

I was worried we would never find anything that would help him but not make him a zombie either. He has comb adhd, bi polar/possibly odd. Not only did it help him with school and focusing, but he also has stable moods and the anger seem to disappeared. It's a little expensive, but worth it! P.S. it's not a stimulant and they don't become addicted to it!

We tried intuniv without the vyvanse and he acted like an obnoxious drunk.  So we added the vyvanse back.  The first few weeks were great then he got to where he wouldn't go to sleep until around 1 or 2 in the morning.  He was taking 2mg of intuniv and the doctor upped it to 3 mg.  He now goes to sleep by 9 but is easily frustrated and acts as if he is in a trance.  Talking to doctor tomorrow to see what else we can do.

Very sleepy in the early evening - really have to work to keep her awake.  Teacher sees improvement, but my child is having significant mood swings in the late afternoon - probably related to being tired.  Has not impacted appetite, but slows her down, so she may actually gain weight!

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	juststevieandme, 7-12 Male  (Caregiver) 	5	4	4	Male	7-12	5/1/2010 12:40:42 PM	My 8 year old came off Concerta and started on Intuniv because of my concerns with the use of stimulants. After taking 1mg daily for 7 days and then 2mg for 7 days the Dr wanted to increase him to 3mg but we've kept him at the 2mg dose because it seems to be effective. The teacher says he is doing just as well as he was when he was on Concerta so I'm pleasantly surprised. Concerta used to keep him up until 11:30 at night and he was mr crabbypants in the morning. With Intuniv he is ready for bed at 8 or 9 and a complete joy in the mornings! Very impressed so far especially when the Dr told us that Intuniv is usually effective for only about half of kids that try it. I feel much better knowing my son is not taking a dangerous stimulant.

He was VERY tired the first four days, had a dizzy spell on day five and now nothing.  It was like the dizzy spell was a fever breaking when one has a cold.  He got dizzy at school and ever since, the tiredness is now completely gone too.  I have a call into his dr to see if he can take 2 mg on Saturday (which would then be day 15).  I am not sure the 1 mg is doing anything or enough for him.  When he was on Ritalin we had to increase him from his original starting dose of 10 mg to 20 mg, so maybe same thing here?  Awaiting her return call...

He has taken clonidine 2 help in sleep @ night, focalin, adderall (neither of those 2 worked), daytrana gave him a rash, but worked. Ritalin LA was the miracle drug, 20 mg, until he grew tolerant 3 1/2 mos in2 taking it.  His behavior became awful &amp; the problems in school reverted back 2 how he was b4 the Ritalin began.  So 2day he took Intuniv (prescribed by his dr) 4 the 1st time.  She was wary about pushing him up 2 30 mg of Ritalin &amp; wanted us 2 try Inuntive b4 increasing the Ritalin.  He took it at 8:10 this AM, played his t-ball game, played out in the yard with his sister &amp; is now taking a nap (he still always naps on the weekends).  I didn't notice anything different in him this AM, still very hyper, got upset easily over a couple of things, talked a lot and argued with me a couple of times.  I know it's only, literally been 6 hrs on this new drug so I will wait and see...I read it takes a little bit to c the effect.  Has anyone else had experience with their children becoming immune 2 the stimulants?  The Ritalin was helping him SOOOO much, I just can't believe it wore off like that?!?!? I am really hoping this Intuniv will help him, it sounds very promising from it's website and other postings. BTW, the price is expensive, but if u go 2 the Intuniv websie u can download a ONE time $25 coupon. Good luck 2 all u other moms who are battling the adhd, I pray 4 each of u and your children, it has been hard for my son &amp; our family as his problems occur with following rules &amp; being obedient in school - he just started Kind this year and we had a great run w/ the Ritalin, but he had problems again in March when the Ritalin wore off.  He goes 2 school until June 15th so I am hoping the Intuniv can help him make it through. I feel 4 each of u &amp; your children that struggles with this as I know how hard it is on us &amp; them!  God bless!

Like many others we tried several different treatments but have found intuniv the best.  The only problem was he was falling asleep in class and went to bed at 5 in the evening.  We started giving him the 2mg at night before bed and that seemed to work for a while but now he is starting to get sleepy again.  I may try to give it to him when he gets home at 5 or so and see if that works.   The cost is also really expensive and eats away at my fund.

He started with 1mg for the first week, and the second week 2 mg. We just started the second week and I know it takes time and patience. However, I can already see it is helping. And bed time is much easier, he's not as tired during the day. I am excited to see how much better it is going to work when it has the right time on it! Overall, I don't see any problems with it!

I gave him a 1mg tablet over the weekend to see how he would react to it and he became very silly, almost drunk acting and refused to do anything I asked him to do. Ok, I know that was just one pill but I don't know if  that effect will go away after he takes it for a while. I would hate to send him to school acting the way he did. I really wanted this to be the answer to getting off the stimulant....has anyone else experienced this?

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	7-12 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	4	5	4		7-12	3/25/2010 10:25:23 AM	My son is 10 years old we have tried all meds.  Some of which caused sever mood swings.  When we first tried Intuniv we took him off all other meds.  He did ok on 1 mg then we moved up to 2mg( still a little hyper but all other areas great improvement) then to 3 as he went to 3mg he was a walking zombie.  We went back down to 2mg.  There was an adjustment period where we found he still needed the daytrana patch but at a small dose to stay focused.  He was unable to take the daytrana at higher does due to weird side effects.  I have discovered a new child.  He no longer tries to hurt other kids or his little sister.  He is actually making friends now, in the past no one would stay his friend for long.  He no longer fights me to do his chores or homework.  He will even joing the family now for activities.  In the past he always just wanted to play video games.  We now limit all video games to 1 hr a day.  This really helped reduce the aggression issues as well.  This med helps if you do no give up on it right away but watch his blood pressure and heart rates.  DO NOT GIVE THEM ANY SLEEP AIDS WHILE TAKING THIS MED.  INCLUDING BENEDRYL. Also in the beginning I call the makers of Intuniv and they were very helpful in aswering my questions without pushing their drug.  If you are having problems with them being sleepy during the day try giving the meds around 4-6pm.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Mom, 7-12 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	4	5	5	Male	7-12	3/17/2010 4:43:43 PM	My 12 yr old has been on several different ADHD meds (Vyvanse, Adderall, Focalin XR..) since he was 7 yrs old.  All of these meds gave him tics, not to mention the fact that he stayed underweight and small in stature all of these years.  Every night he was agitated and tired.  Recently his doctor put him on Intuniv.  We started at 2mg and then quickly went to 3mg which was way too strong for him.  3mg caused him to sleep all day.  After dropping him back down to 2 mg and being patient, I have to admit I really think we have found a drug that is finally going to help him in all avenues.  He is acting better at school, better at home, and has gained 15 much needed pounds in the last 2 months.  I think he has even grown an inch or so.  He is also sleeping better at night.  The only problem we have had is that he is still very hyper and uncooperative in the mornings.  We recently started him on a low dose of Vyvanse which is helping us get the morning going.  Also he has not complained of any tics!!  All in all I am pleased.  My advice would be to be patient with this drug and if your child is sleeping way too much, then have the doctor lower the dose.  Good luck to all!

It is the first medication we tried because he was getting facial tics.  It made him very tired and irritable the first 2 weeks, but we are seeing less fatigue, no tics and his teachers report better attention in class.  His behavior at home has also been easier to manage.  Fingers crossed this will continue.

Just got up to 4 mg Intuniv last week and he swears he has fleas in his bed and heartburn. He itches mostly at night and cannot sleep. Has anyone else had these side effects? He is somewhat sleepy in the afternoon, but by bedtime the itching starts. Also, I really have'nt seen any benefit, he is still on 20mg ritallin and I can't tell any difference with this drug added.
Other	Trevor Kraus, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	13-18	3/8/2010 12:20:52 AM	I have aspergers syndrome, which has a lot of the same things as ADHD/AD  what ever you do don't give your children or take this drug yourself the risks outweigh the benefits. it does exactly what it says it does, it calms you down, but by calm i mean asleep. i take this and ( im an insomniac by the way i usually get less than 6 hours of sleep but my body is conditioned to work on that much) I sleep at least 18 hours and when you are awake you fell dizzy and weak. i could barely clench my fist this medication made me so weak. it also made me extreamly thirsty, there were times where as i lay in bed i had to decide if had enough strength to get myself a bottle of water. when you are awake you also cannot think straight, Nothing seamed real to me. I was in that constant state where you just awaken and you don't know if your still dreaming or not. it also depresses you to the point where you just don't care about anything anymore. and the headaches are a whole other story alltogether. i am finally dosing off of this stuff and the side effects are still almost the same. i went out side to ride my bike the other day to see if some exersise would wake me up and i made it half the way up the street before i was so tired i had to walk my bike home. read the pamphlet on this drug, all the things that this drug &quot;cures&quot; are things that normal kids do every day. in my opinion this is just a drug for lazy parents to give their children so they don't have to be a parent and deal with or take care of their children. by the way im 17, 18 as of this may, so none of the side effects are from old or young age

This medicine has worked wonders for us! with other meds, he was up most of the night never getting enough rest. he now is asleep within 15 minutes of going to bed! I watched while other meds caused stomach pains, chest pains, and watched him wither down to 65 pounds. This medicine has caused no stomach pains, he can eat and does he eat, no chest pains. My best thing to share is the harmony in my home now. He's less likely to argue, he gets along with his little brother and isn't on edge all the time!!!

We switched to Intuniv (2 mg) 6 weeks ago.  Great!  Appetite is back, ADHD symptoms still in check, teachers comment he is more tuned in and happy, and I see the same at home.  It's working well for us.  We still have some attention issues, so we may try 3mg to help him catch up with school expectations.

He is a bit more active but i have never had a 10 year old boy who isn't medicated. He is learning how to focus and get it together. the only draw back is he is so tired in the morning. We need to find a happy medium. Over all he is HAPPY

Although she has improved and has less accidents, she complains of stomach aches quite a lot and can only tolerate 1 mg so far. At 2 mg she seemed sad with dark thoughts and negative feelings. I stopped the med one day and she became manic, hyper silly with strange comments and complained of whirling mind.  Not sure what to do next... will discuss with dr soon.

We just titrated up to 3mg today.  The biggest concern is that he is covered in a rash, which the Dr. suspects is a reaction to the medication. (The rash is not bothersome, just ugly.) Results of taking the medication thus far are:  less aggression for sure, slightly calmer, slight improvement in attentiveness/focus, and almost no mood swings.  We have had absolutley no sleepiness issues like those mentioned on the med label and by other online reviews. We may have to stop the medication due to the rash. We'll give it a few more days.

He has been doing better on this meddication, it is also suspected he is suffering from Bipolar, but not diagnosed as of yet, he still has bouts of anger, but nothing near what he was like before. I will continue this drug to see where it takes us, so far we are happy with it!

He also has aspergers and tourettes and we had tried other medications to for his impulsiveness and hyperactivity including vyvanse. the vyvanse made his tics teriible but this medication does not. the worst thing I can see is he is very tired in the afternoon and will sometimes take a nap.

We have tried and tried many many different rx. This is the miracle that we were looking for. My ADHD only child is happier, less aggressive, easier to get along with, and is not bouncing off the walls in the morning. However he is still a a great child and he is not zombish. My child that suffers from numerous medical conditions is not the same child that he was in any way prior to starting this medication. He never smilled, never got along with anyone and was very impulsive. I can't tell you when I got a hugh or was told mom I love you. He now smiles all the time and plays with is brother and sister unlike I have ever seen, now he can't love you enough. This was my miracle. He is still on numerous medication, but this one seems to be the one that makes everything else work better. I am loving my life since this medication. I am glad we gave this a try.

I had her on Vyvanse and she was constantly telling me that her stomach was hurting. Now I have her on this medicine and the first week went well. When I put her up to the 2mg pill she has done nothing but sleep 20 to 22 hours out of the day. This is unacceptable! No child should be zombiefied!! I am now taking her off of this medicine and plan on putting her on something that will help her without making her into a lifeless child. Its not fair to her or anyone in her life. She deserves to have a childhood where she can play and have fun.

He has titrated up to 2mg so far, but I noticed a difference the very first week!  He was taking Vyvanse 20mg, but we found that he had developed a tolerance for it.  When we attempted to increase his dose, 30mg was just too much for his little 50lb body to handle...he developed terrible side effects!  Tics, excessive talking, not sleeping, not eating.  So I did some research and found Intuniv.  I was skeptical, since it is newly used for this purpose (Tenex was the shorter acting version of this drug, which was used for Tourette's and high blood pressure).  But after thoroughly researching the clinical trials on both Intuniv AND Tenex, I decided that it couldn't hurt to give it a try.  After all, this isn't a stimulant...and the list of side effects is SIGNIFICANTLY shorter and less severe.  So far, it is fantastic stuff.  We're going with 20mg Vyvanse during the tiration period, and may or may not stop it once the Intuniv is fully effective.  If you are considering this one, especially if your child does not do well with stimulants, and Strattera didn't work for you (sure didn't for us!)...give it a shot.  I am pleasantly surprised, and pleased, that we don't have to increase the dose of stimulants anymore.  Awesome.

Since taking intuniv, she has been much more focused and on track and now able to manage her adhd without distrupting her bipolar.
