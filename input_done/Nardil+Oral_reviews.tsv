Depression	Tonga4161, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	45-54	6/25/2012 1:52:56 PM	In 1983, I never weighed over 125 lbs in my life until Nardil. I've doubled my weight since starting and CANNOT get off this poison. I've tried everything. I have hyperinsuliemia and remain constantly exhausted. Withdrawal was unbearable. Down to 30 Mg per day now and seeing an edocrinologist next month but I doubt it will help. I will probably try to wean myself off it VERY slowly, since I can't find a doctor who knows anything about it, but I'm sure it will take months or years. DO NOT START NARDIL unless there is no other option!!!!
Depression	At peace, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/29/2012 2:45:29 PM	I have been on Nardil for 25 years for depression/ anxiety disorder. It saved may life. Several years ago I went off it under the instructions of my dr. I felt absolutely no withdrawal effects. We tried almost every SSRI out there, with no positive results. I went back on Nardil and have been fine. For those of you out there afraid of a possible surgery, I have had an appendectomy, removal of a uterine cyst under general anesthesia, colonoscopies etc. and have had absolutely no issues. If you are depressed and anxious and nothing is working, do not be afraid of side effects. They are bothersome at first and then mostly disappear. This medication can ice you peace and sanity.
Depression	normajane, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	3/24/2012 11:09:48 PM	I have been taking Nardil successfully for over 30 years.  At one time I consulted a psychiatrist about a replacement.  Ultimately he said that since it worked so well I should stay on it, and that he had put several other patients on it.  The &quot;dangerousness&quot; of Nardil is directly related to consuming things that are on the &quot;forbidden&quot; list.
Depression	babcent, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	65-74	1/20/2012 7:23:42 PM	I have been taking Nardil for about 10 years.  Almost everything else was tried.  It worked extremely well in the first few years.  However, my depression continued to get worse after a couple years.  Was put on Xanax and Remeron.  I know Nardil and Remeron shouldn't be used together, but it worked.  Then I went on Seroquel also.  The 4 worked well together.  However, the weight gain was awful.  Then, my blood sugar was very high. Found out, Seroquel can cause diabetes.  Went slowly off of that.  Then tired Abilify.  After 2 weeks on it, I totally lost 2 days of my life, no memory and totalled a car.  Got totally checked for a stroke.  No stroke.  What was the cause?  Probably Abilify.  Be careful, it's a scarey drug.  Now I am in big trouble.  Only 2 drugs I haven't tried.  One 25% of the time causes hair loss and the other can have a deadly rash.  I already have 0 Stage Melanoma. Am scared of any rash.  Sometimes I feel like I am in big trouble.
Depression	jg, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	65-74	1/9/2012 2:28:02 AM	After trying everything else my psychiatrist put me on phenelzine, the generic for Nardil. It worked!I can easily handle the dietary restrictions.My only negative comment is the weight gain that others have commented on. I also hate it!

Depression	Jeane, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	9/10/2011 3:52:30 PM	In 1985 at age 44 started Nardil and after 6 mos was new person who talked a lot.  BUT, doc uncomfortable continuing so took me off - never felt that good again, but am close now after back on at 30 mg/day.  As with everyone else, tried everything else, and always back to Nardil.  Prior to removing original Actifed from market that was my in-between med.  After extreme stress of past 2 yrs taking 2 per day, always b4 took 3.  Works better actually and side effects of diarrhea and balance GONE!  
Depression	thomhtm, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	3	Male	35-44	8/13/2011 6:50:04 PM	I was on this medication in the 90's and then returned to it in 2011 because of tremendous anxiety/depression due to home and work pressure. During the interim, Pfizer reformulated the generic and there has been much controversy over that because the old formula is said to have been better, and it was - though like this one it seems to become less effective over time. In any event, at 45 mg. a day it decreases my depression and significantly decreases my anxiety.  The main problems are fatigue, feeling oversedated, and being mentally foggy (this latter side effect was not true of the 90's formula). I also suffer with insomnia.  All in all, I would say it's good enough to temporarily get yourself out of a deep funk and to numb you if you're panicked, but I don't see my self functioning well and staying on it over the long haul. 
Depression	marylou329, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		5/20/2011 1:46:21 PM	I was first prescribed Nardil in 1961 for depression. Several times I weaned off at the instruction of a doctor and prescribed other anti-depressants. In fact, I have been on nearly every one on the market. Each time, I went back on Nardil because it works. In recent years, I also suffer from aghoraphobia, which made it difficult to leave home. I am again taking Nardil for the past 18 months. I started on 15 mg.; raised to 1 1/2 pills per day. My primary care doctor prescribed Ambien for sleep, which is working great, as well. I feel each person's case is different and the effects of medication act differently. I am sticking with Nardil cause it works for me.
Depression	elegant bride, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	3/17/2011 5:58:25 PM	I have taken Nardil for 34 years. I have tried every updated anti-anxiety/depression drug there is and I always have to go back to Nardil. I've finally given up trying to get off Nardil. I HATE the weight gain that goes with this medication. I have no problem with the food restrictions - I eat everything. I have also had major surgery and did not go off Nardil. Tell your anestheologist that you take Nardil and everything will be fine. I do wear a medic alert &quot;charm&quot; on a chain around my neck 24/7. You do NOT want anyone to administer DEMEROL to you. Nardil + Demerol = life threatening high blood pressure in minutes.
Other	julieann, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	3/14/2011 6:34:33 AM	Have been taking Nardil since I was 20. (Had terrible panick attacks.) Luckily I was put on it early &amp;  it worked great.  Went off it twice, tried all other Anti-depressants or combinations of drugs.(felt bad)  Finally put back on Nardil.  Feel like a regular person again.  This time, though I'm having insomnia. Will work around it &amp; talk to my doc.  Life w/Nardil is far better than w/out it!  I think I LOST weight on it last time.  Maybe I was just more active.  Have no problem w/diet &amp; it is also cheap. Can't do w/out it.Will probably take this medication for the rest of my life &amp; it's OK by me.   
Depression	Qwacker, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	3/11/2011 4:51:16 PM	I have been using Nardil since 1993. At age 45, I had a full blown panic attack after having suffered stoically most of my life, trying to fix &quot;my problem&quot;. I also had &quot;High Achiever&quot; tendancies.  The root cause of my suffering was social anxiety and it's partner, depression. After trying several SSRIs with no success, my Psychiatrist suggested &quot;The Big Gun&quot;......&quot;Nardil&quot;. The combination of Nardil and Ativan worked like a miracle for me. Nardil was used successfully in Europe for many years before it was introduced into the US. It's a shame most US Doctors do not know much about it. For the right patient (Me!), it is literally a lifesaver. I have not had any adverse food reactions in 18 years, and plan to continue on Nardil for the rest of my life. 
Depression	therapist58, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5		55-64	3/8/2011 6:12:24 PM	I have been taking Nardil since 1985.  I have periodically gone off it and tried other meds, and inevitably go back to Nardil.  It is the only thing that works.  I have Treatment Resistant Depression and am currently utilizing a new procedure called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.  That, along with Nardil, have allowed me to keep functioning.
Depression	gene, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	35-44	2/27/2011 2:49:40 AM	Nardil helps w/anxiety and depression.  It's sort of numbing and makes me calm.  I've also taken parnate which is more stimulating.  The problem w/both is the side effect of insomnia (which is worse w/parnate).  True, without it, I probably wouldn't be sleeping anyway.  But it forces me to take a benzodiazipine, which affects my memory and is not a long term solution. So, yes it works, and hopefully you won't experience insomnia. If you do, you'll probably up at 3 in the morning like me busy doing these reviews.  
Other	profiler, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/30/2011 12:34:51 PM	Have been on Nardil since 1984 when diagnosed with panic attack disorder and depression. I strongly agree with the person who said this was a mniracle medication. I didn't know I was depressed until I wasn't anymore, and the panic attacks are gone. I tried going off twice and wound up with severe panic. I will stay on this the rest of my life. It was easy to adjust to the food and OTC meds I could not take, they have always found a substitute.
Depression	patriciasatx, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	1/25/2011 1:28:43 PM	I've been on Nardil about 25 years. It helps me more than SSRI's. Going off Nardil several times has been so difficult I would end up in the hospital, try a new drug, then go back to Nardil. My psychiatrist calls me non-responsiive to treatment: no meds, ECT, or psychotherapy have erased the MDD. Nardil helps me live with it more easily than any other treatment. I have little trouble with dietary issues. I eat any cheese I want as long as it is not labeled &quot;Aged.&quot; Most are not. I drink white or &quot;pink&quot; wine almost every day.  I am able to eat Italian green beans and snow peas. I never heard of fava beans until I started Nardil, and have no desire to try them. I use soy sauce whenever I wish.Medications are a different story. Once when hospitalized for my type 1 diabetes, my endocrinologist gave me a &quot;diet&quot; pill, which name I don't recall. It raised my BP so high the staff brought the crash cart. I was glad I was IN the hospital. I avoid decongestants and treat allergies &amp; asthma with antihistimes &amp; steroidal meds.I still take 90 mg/day, 3 tabs BID, but often forget the bedtime dose. I think I'm getting an average of 75 mg/day, and have no intention of discontinuing Nardil in the future.

Depression	Pia, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		7/24/2010 3:28:58 AM	I've been on nardil now for 27 years. It has saved my life.I've gone off about 4 times thinking I no longer needed it. LOL, not so. Dr. had me try newer anti-depressants but no relief. I did have a shortlived happy expierence with Abilify. I'm very fortunate I've not expierenced any side effects from any foods. However I can not drink wine. That tought me a valuable lesson. Hopefully I've got 10-15 years of life left and hopefully I can afford to buy Nardil as I know if it were not for this drug I would not be here today.
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/17/2010 12:47:12 AM	I have been taking nardil for 34 years. It is a miracle drug for me! I had a number of terrible life stresses occur in my life all at the same time (divorce, only child moved out of state &amp; got laid off from a job I loved for 25 yrs). These major stresses caused my severe depression to come back.  I tried everything under the sun.  Nothing worked. My doctor said I should have added lithium or another medication to boost the nardil, rather than going off it.  I feel lucky to be alive and am enjoying my life on nardil.It truly is the ONLY medication that works for me. Thank you, God!!!!
Other	Qwacker, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	3/5/2010 9:35:04 AM	Started on Nardil in 1993 for anxiety/social phobia. Use in conjunction with Ativan. This combination was a &quot;miracle combo&quot; for me. I have also never experienced any food reactions......I eat pizza, drink beer, and yogurt.....all in moderation. For anxiety, and esp social phobia, this drug is very effective. 
Depression	bigdaddyhockey, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	2/28/2010 3:29:49 AM	Wow, do I feel different, for the better, after just two weeks of being on Nardil.  I have been suffering with depression,Bipolar and social anxiety for most of my adult life, none of the SSRI's have worked. I just seemed to worse and gain weight. My past Dr's have tried everything, tyhroid therapy to increased levels of vit.D and light therapy, plus more, with all the tests I went through I felt like a human pin cushion. I was involved in a Prozac plus a unknown medication case study but was taken off the study due to extreme side affects and dangerous blood pressure increase.  I was told by the Dr's invovled that I was untreatable and would possibility have go it alone without medications for the rest of my life, until now I hope. I found a new understanding Dr., I've noticed a big difference in my mood after just a few weeks.  If you have being suffering with no response, talk to your Dr. about Nardil. Nardil so far is working for me, but I am a &quot;newbie&quot; and other the conficting food &quot;no-no's&quot; you read about. Nothing you read about with the food  interactions are the same from report to report.  I guess no one is the same?
Depression	wendy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/26/2010 3:35:53 PM	thank you for your response re the dentist,(what a relief). I am really trying to gather info bc my dr. has never prescribed it before, but since my brother is on it an it worked like a lightswitch, I am going to try it..I do love cheese and know I won't be able to eat that, but my dr. said Velveeta cheese is okay to eat.do u know this to be true? I agree Nardil is a last resort drug, but my depression is so bad that I can hardly take care of my children anymore. Thank you in advance.
Depression	Flower, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	2/24/2010 9:03:15 PM	This medication is at the bottom of the list of Antidepressants given, and I have been told to try newer ones by Drs. constantly.  I have been on it for many, many years and it works well.  The dentist is no problem.  He uses non adrenaline novacaine and I have had many dental procedures without incident.  Nardil should be considered as a good choice in Depression.  I don't know what I would do without it.  
Depression	wendy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	2/24/2010 5:34:25 PM	I am starting Nardil in 3 weeks. I have been on prozac for 15 years and bc of the half life it has to clear my body before I take Nardil..My question is: what do you resort to regarding dental treatment, I am prone to cavities and crowns and heard novicaine is forbidden...does anyone have any experience with this?
Depression	happynardil, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/15/2010 10:10:26 PM	I've been on this drug for 20 years. It's the best thing I have taken. I went off of it for about a year trying literally everything on the market. Nothing worked for me; except Celexa, but I had such bad memory problems is was not worth it. After going back to Nardil my life returned. I will never go off of it again. It's very sad to me that most doctor's do not even discuss it with their patients. It's a miracle drug and the fact that it has been around for so many years, only proves it's effectiveness and safety in spite of the diet restrictions.
Depression	87_blueangel, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	2/3/2010 5:46:02 AM	Being depressed since childhood, I had no idea what it felt like to be &quot;normal&quot;. Doctors kept asking me if I was depressed and I would respond &quot;no, I feel like I have felt my whole life. Wish I had not been born but decided that this was the way life was meant for me and managed to survive.&quot;Although I was considered brilliant and won many scholastic awards, I had no self-confidence. It wasn't until I was over forty years old, that a doctor insisted I try an antidepressent. He picked Nardil. After four to six weeks, EVERYONE noticed a change in me. People wouldcomment that they never saw me smile before. Never had any side effects (except in me, it could build up in my blood and I would end up in a manic state). I learned to sense when I was becoming manic and would discontinue use for two days and then go back to normal dosage. Miracle drug. Have nothing nice to say about the ssri's. Have been taking for over 20 years.

Depression	antiqueart, 65-74 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4		65-74	12/5/2009 10:25:36 PM	I have taken these meds since 1989 and have tried others but this is by far the best for me. Many doctors are leery of using MAOs and there are some things to watch. There can be negative interactions with things such as anti-histamines and some foods.  If you watch your food carefully and beware of things such as anti-histamines. Its best to consult a druggist with any over the counter drug just to be safe.... I plan to take this drug from now on. these is no generic and probably never will be so my insurance doesnt pay much on it. There are warnings about red wine...coffee and lots of things but one has to see what their tolerance is. Tou do have to limit coffee and red wine but I can tolerate about all I want to have.If you have sinus and allergy problems you have to navigate what to do there. I can tolerate Claritin and get the generic which is cheap at Walgreen or CVS.  You have to pay careful attention to what you can tolerate without having an interaction.A drug interaction here can cause high blood pressure and a bad feeling so one has to be on guard. You also need to know that you cannot tolerate things that are normally given to people in auto accidents and have to make sure that any paramedic knows you are on an MAO. Some people wear bracelets and necklaces to be safe but I dont I just have it in the window of my wallet. You need to review all this with your doctor.

I also developed it in both of my hands and forearms but not to the same extent. The onset of this problem was quite sudden. My hands and forearms have since recovered but to this time I have not noticed any improvement in my legs and feet.
Depression	Glenn, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	11/15/2009 1:30:57 AM	Nardil has been a miracle drug for me.  It cleared up 90% of my depression and 100% of my migraines for a year or so. Have had to stop 3-4 times because it stopped working. I'm lucky in that I lose weight on Nardil, but the ED problems have gotten worse as I get older.

Still can't believe it. Miracle in a little orange pill. Makes my eyes water to write this, I am so grateful. I've been totally depression/anxiety free for six years now. Will never stop taking it. Had one food reaction, don't know what it was. Took emergency nephidipine and was fune. But I regularly eat all the diet no-nos with no problem. I really wish more doctors would try MAOIs, particularly Nardil, for their patients who have failed other drugs.

To day I asked my Phara is they ANYTHING I can take to releave this synus presure and pain?. The only option she said was the shoot salin up my nose. I NEED A SYNUS PAIN PILL, BUT APPARTENTLY ACCORDING TO HER, I will die because of the MAO reaction. I reather be depressed then have this cold!!!!........CAN ANYONE HELP?

This drug saved my life &amp; now I am afraid it is not working...too soon to know?  Or do I have to start like before with higher doses &amp; taper off to my maintenance dose?

Did not work.  Have only had two episodes of allergic reaction where blood pressure went up extremely.  Both times  close to a Doctor where emergency treatment was done to lower pressure. I will most probably remain on it for the rest of my life but now I'm dealing with being Bipolar and cannot find a drug that will help with the mania.  I take 75 mg daily along with Ambien to help me sleep and recently put on Zyprexa to help with mania.  Going through Bipolar episode as I am writng this.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	25-34	8/11/2009 9:14:56 AM	I took Nardil for several months.  It did help with my depression.  Sleeping was difficult.  My brain never seemed to shut down.  I was up most nights cleaning out the attic, cupboards, closets, etc.  Drove my family crazy!  I unexpectantly became pregnant.  My doctor gave me specific directions for weaning off off Nardil.  I followed them to the tee.  A week or two into the weaning process, I started convulsing, shaking uncontrollably.  This went on for three or four days and I lost my baby as a result.  I know this drug helps with what seems to be a very hopeless and helpless illness, but this is a very dangerous drug.  Nobody told me the possible side effects.  Learn all you can about this drug before you take it and, please, be very very careful.

Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	25-34	4/10/2009 5:25:45 PM	I took this medication for Social Anxiety Disorder about two years ago (when I had a job, and medical insurance), and it worked very well, but I did experience a few side-effects-- moderate insomnia, and anorgasmia being the most annoying. My pharmacologist and I came to agree that I have an extremely active liver-- average dosing of any oral medication has never been effective for me, and so it was with this stuff. I ended up taking 90mgs daily (three 30mg doses) in order to get the desired effect. But, I eventually started having severe dizzy spells, and actually fainted on several occasions, assumingly due to dips in my blood pressure. I also accidentally ran out at one point (due to a nasty ice storm), and found out why they warn you not to stop cold-turkey. After 48 hours, I began shaking uncontrolably, and couldn't even hold a spoon steady enough to eat a bowl of cereal! It felt a lot like a miniature episode of Parkinsons disease. I did follow the directions (as much as possible) when it came to food and medication interactions, but it's powerful stuff, so please-- be careful!

Depression	AF, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	3	4	Male	45-54	2/6/2009 6:04:53 PM	I took it for 8 years (89-98) for depression and OCD and then was placed on SSRIs. I found none of the SSRIS as effective, tried all of them, dreadful withdrawl symptoms from Paxil. Back on the Nardil, unsure about the new formulation '03 onward) Slighly concerned about the interactions, I find it strange that Wikipedia says only a few people suffer from tyramine interactions and would like to know more
Depression	catlady, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/3/2009 3:45:03 PM	I tried every antidepressant on the market, that either did not help or caused severe side effects.  I was depressed for 20 years until I was prescribed, by my own research, Nardil.  It was a miracle drug for me and I have felt normal since taking Nardil.  No more horrible depression!
Depression	Lola, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	55-64	1/11/2009 7:41:06 PM	I have been on Nardil for 15 years.  I have been advised to withdraw from it and take another &quot;more updated&quot; antidepressant by some physicians.  Withdrawal is surely an unpleasant experience, even slowly.  I am now thinking that if it is not broken don't fix it.  By that I mean if the Medication works for your problem, why change it.  My only concern is if illness or surgery occurs, what happens when the Nardil is removed totally.  That is a frightening thought.

Depression	Max, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	55-64	9/22/2008 9:36:43 PM	I have been taking Nardil for 32 years.  I tried about a dozen drugs for my major depressionw/panic disorder and eventually was given Nardil. I got my life back after 6 years of suffering (I was losing hope...). I have not had any significant side effects or dietary complications, after the first 6 months of &quot;adjusting&quot;.
Depression	ddnos, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/26/2008 3:36:29 AM	I've been taking Nardil for about 17 years -have tried to go off it spuratically 3-4 times mainly to avoid drug and food interactions, but each time, had to go back on Nardil. My doctor and I finally agreed that there was no sense stop taking something that has worked.  I won't be going off Nardil anytime soon; it has literally been a life saver!

Depression	Larry, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	55-64	11/3/2007 4:18:19 AM	I have been taking Nardil for 20 years and it has been very effective in treating my depression. The side effects are difficult, particularly sleep problems, however they are not life-threatening like depression can be. I would not be able to function without it.
Depression	Winston Smith, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	3	Male	19-24	10/25/2007 12:12:28 PM	It's a bit premature for me to be writing a review of Nardil, I've only been on it about 2 or 3 weeks, and I'm still not up to the recommended dose of 45 mg per day (three 15s) because I'm worried about interactions and side effects, of which Nardil has many, including food interactions. I haven't noticed any effects, positive or negative, at this point, probably because I just recently began taking 30 mg, after about 2 weeks at 15 mg. 
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	10/11/2007 5:09:33 PM	I have taken Nardil for many years.  In February of this year, I decided to go off of it and try newer medications, SSRI's. The result is that I have had traumatic or vivid dreams from February to the present.  Consequently, I have had to go back on the drug to try to stop these devestating side effects resulting from going off of Nardil.  This drug is effective but very tricky as far as the diet and side effects are concerned.  And, especially if you must have surgery, and you go off of the drug, you may have the same experience I have had, vivid dreams or nightmares.
