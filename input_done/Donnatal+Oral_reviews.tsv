I don't understand why the only medications that successfully treat my IBS are becoming so hard to get. Perhaps there isn't enough profit from them for the big pharmaceutical companies.

I actually lost a good job because of my IBS and in desperation asked my Dr for something that could help.  Now I'm hoping to find another job fast, no luck so far...  The pharmacies in Des Moines, IA don't carry donnatal but have to special order it for me.  The Dr wrote me a 'script for donnatal extend tabs but that had to be special ordered and is WAY too expensive for me as there is no generic available.  So I have to get the generic of plain donnatal.  I asked &amp; researched for another drug that does the same thing but is more available; my research &amp; my pharmacy told me there is no such drug.  Generic donnatal should be more available as IBS is a very crippling problem - surely it's not a rare condition!

Irritable Colon	tummygurl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/2/2010 9:42:38 PM	I have used this medication in both liquid and pill forms for the last 10 years and only use it as needed when my colon goes into full spasm. The liquid form brings immediate relief - the pill form takes longer to work but is obviously easier to travel with.  Although I'm allowed 4 doses a day, I find relief usually after taking the first pill and I am fully functional to go about my day in just an hour or two. If I have to take a second dose 4 hours later, I experience enough doziness to not drive.  I rarely stay in spasm longer than a day at a time. The only regular side effect I have is a &quot;bounceback&quot; from severe cramping/diarreha to a system shutdown resulting in constipation 7 days after taking the medication.

Irritable Colon	13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	13-18	10/4/2009 2:47:16 AM	I have been on Donnatal for almost 6 months and it has helped my symptoms of IBS. It is a good medication. My doctor was hesitant because there is phenobarbital in it, but we came to an agreement and it also helps with my anxiety, one thing I am worried about is that there is a withdrawal symptom from the phenobarbital, it can cause seizures! Each Donnatal tablet hads 16.2mg of phenobarbital in it and it also has low amounts of hyosciamine, scopolomine, atropine. I just works really well. I am taking it before meals and at bedtime and my diarrhea has calmed down and I only use the bathroom once a day!

Instead of going to the bathroom 3-5 times daily, I go once daily. Effective at 1-2 doses daily, RX is for up to 4 doses daily.  SIDE EFFECTS: Severe tiredness/sleepness at first. This only occours now with the full dossage. (2)  Sometimes it becomes difficult to impossibe to go to the bathroom.

However, since pain often comes at night, the medication sometimes brings on nightmares and leaves me with a hungover feeling throughout the next day. But overall, I'd say the benefits outweigh the side effects.
