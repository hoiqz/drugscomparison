Migraine Headache	mgrimms, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	7/12/2011 3:34:02 AM	I have had migraines for as long as I can remember. This year, I finally went to a doctor because I was tired of my migraines controlling my life. She first gave me the sumatriptan pills (10 mg at first, then 20 mg), but it didn't stop the vomiting. Therefore, I couldn't keep the medicine down long enough for it to start working. So, she prescribed me the nasal spray. When I took the first dose, I was a little worried that I wouldn't take it correctly. The directions made it seem so complicated. I also didn't realize how AWFUL it would taste, so I thought I had taken too many deep breaths or something after inhaling it. It took about 2 hours before my headache was completely gone. The migraine was pretty intense, but I didn't vomit at all, which surprised me. So I think the nasal spray does work. Sure, it's not as easy as the pill, but if it stops the vomiting and completely gets rid of my migraine, I'm happy.

I started useing the spray after the tablets made my stomach upset. Although it did work, I found the spray difficult to use correctly and it left a nasty taste in my mouth. I prefer the shot.

My migraine was never relieved by the medication.  Then to put the cherry on top of it all, it left me with an itch rash all over my face for 2 days!  It was not fun or  pretty.

I will tell you that the taste from the medicine down your throat is awful, but as everyone else said, totally worth it. As an fyi, I have the best luck with it if I take it immediately in the first signs of a migraines.  Otherwise, it doesn't always work for me.

I use the nasal type and it does leave a bad taste in your throat, but it's far better the suffering the pain of these cluster headaches so I guess I can live with that!

I had much better results with either the tablet form or the injection. The spray always left a very bad taste in the mouth.

I used to have migraines that lasted 8-10 hours, and now they are gone within about an hour!

Migraine Headache	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	4	5	5	Male	35-44	6/12/2008 9:17:14 AM	My eight year old son was given this medication after developing migraines.  He was hesitant at first due to the nostril application but after trying it he was so excited because it worked within five minutes.  I think it's great for children who may find migraines scary and confusing.

After years of suffering migraines, it was finally prescribed.  My migraines are accompanied by severe nausea and the nasal spray allows the medicine to stay put.  It works for me in 15-20 minutes. There have been rare occasions that it did not work but I now have a different script to use if that is the case.  I would not recommend taking more than 1 dose in a day or 4 in a month.  It sometimes makes me feel a little &quot;off&quot; or dizzy but it is worth it to not be suffering the migraine pain and the vomiting.
Other	DTM, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	35-44	12/29/2007 1:51:04 PM	42 year old male that has had cluster headaches for 10+ years, usually 6 weeks cycles each year.  Use 20mg spray when I feel the headache coming on and it often stops it right away.  Much better than the pills because of the speed of relief.  Often works in 5 minutes.  Always have 1 in my car or 2 during the cycles, and stock up over the year from insurance restrictions.  Since insurance looks at this as migraine relief they don't consider the cluster sufferer in the same way and will often not cover extra medicine during cluster cycles.

Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/21/2007 10:19:28 AM	I don't like putting things in my nose, so after suffering for two days with a migraine, I finally used it.  Within one hour most symptoms were completely gone and I could rest.  Now I use it at the first sign of a severe headache and its gone within 15-20 minutes.  Great stuff.
