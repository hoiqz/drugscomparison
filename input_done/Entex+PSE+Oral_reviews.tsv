We've taken Entex PSE for years and now our pharmacy said they can't get it any longer. Our MD told us to try the Musinex D OTC. The Extex worked great for our congestion in our ears and nasal area...too bad it's pulled from the market.

It has been very effective and the only side effect has been a constant thirst, which I can live with.

I guess I needed the rest, and I have definitely seen improvement  in my nasal congestion and post-nasal drainage.  It did what it was suppose to do, now I just need  to be able to function !
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	3/8/2008 4:36:59 PM	I took this medication to alleviate the pressure in my ears.  It's been a little less than a week now, and I am somewhat satisfied.  Although, I did not have trouble sleeping, I had to increase my fluid intake, because I was very thirsty all the time. Therefore I had an increase in urination. I too had cold hands and feet at times. I was jittery the first time I ingested it.  My suggestion would be to eat first before taking, haven't been jittery since. 
Cold Symptoms	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	1/23/2008 8:38:15 AM	I just started taking the Entex PSE generic version yesterday.  This medicine alleviated my runny nose, sinus pressure, and sore throat very quickly.  However, I am extremely jittery, have a racing heartbeat, awoke all throughout the night, have cold hands and feet, and feel like I am not myself.  I feel like I am outside of my own body, if that makes any sense.  In terms of the racing heartbeat and anxiousness, I feel like I am taking some of those diet drugs that were dangerous for you that were popular a few years ago.  If you take this drug, know that it works, but the side effects are not fun.
