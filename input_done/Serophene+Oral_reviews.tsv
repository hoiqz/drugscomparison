Female Problems Causing Trouble in Getting Pregnant	baby wisher, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	19-24	11/12/2008 8:36:13 PM	Well I have been using the medication and i find that every month I get more and more disappointed because the drugs inhances the feeling of being pregnant every month you takes get.  There fore giving you more and more hopes of being pregnant and then bomb, your not.  The first 3 months on the medication at one pill a day (now I am on two a day)it made my period cramps harder but every month I got morning sickness, mood swings, breast tenderness, cravings,etc.  I really was more convinced every month that I was.  Now I here that this has helped others so my situation may be different but I just had high hopes and ended up with low satisfaction.
