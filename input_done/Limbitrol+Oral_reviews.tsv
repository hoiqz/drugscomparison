Anxiousness associated with Depression	S. Texan, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	8/2/2012 8:08:55 PM	I took this for over 25 years and found it very effective; however, when I tried to switch from this to another drug, I had severe withdrawals as I did not wean myself slowly enough. Mom has taken it for 20+ years and now that she's terminal, the doctor switched her to ativan, supposedly to keep her comfortable. Disastrous! I switched her back to Limbitrol and she is nos calmer. Beware of withdrawal!

Take 15m and it does the job MOST nights. I have tried to stop taking, no problems except I go back to sleep issues.

Since this medication was taken off the market in 2009 all of my original symptoms have returned and intensified.

Most of that time it prevented any reacurring depression problems. Helped me to sleep better and helped with anxiety. Have only taken a smallest dose only at bedtime. Side effects like sleepiness and dizziness did disapear with time. Weight gain?

I have GAD, some depression, and overactive bladder (which did not allowed me satisfactory sleep). Everything were very improved with Limbitrol. Some three months ago, I stopped it for while to see how things went on without. I am planning to ask my doctor to continue with just Amitriptlyne to see what happens.

Other	kathyq, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/25/2008 10:22:16 PM	Have taken daily for over 10 years for migraines.  Now it is impossible to find at any local or mail order pharmacy.  The generic, amitriptylin does not work for me. I take amitriptylin with librium, and it does not work as well as limbitrol.  Wish I could find a pharmacy that could fill my prescription.
