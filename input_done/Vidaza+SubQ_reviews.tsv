I will be completeing 6 treatment cycles. All blood counts are coming up, especially bone marrow which was at 5% (yes this is correct) and now I'm up to 115 which is way up from nothing. Did have terrible neausea at the start of treatment, but Dr. changed the neausea meds, and no problems with this issue now..... great. kyerle I believe is the name of the drug for neausea.  Dr. say I'm getting near remission..I say ...come on.. lets get at it. This treatment has been a blessing, considering my other options.. which was supportive,till the leukemia knocked at my door. I'm not asking for a cure..but a little more time for the family. ....... I would use this drug again in a heart beat.......... At this timeI have MDS....RAEBII ( REFRACTORY ANEMIA WITH EXCESS BLASTS.

I have gotten a reaction from the sun. Is that usual?  I don't seem to be getting anywhere. I get an IV for 3 days every month, and my blood gets worse, then by the next iv, is better.
