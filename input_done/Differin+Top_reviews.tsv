Acne	Hawkinsm3, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	9/17/2012 6:19:07 PM	For a teenager, my skin has always been pretty good. But around March of this year I woke up with a horrible breakout. At one point some of it became infected. I went to the doctor and she gave me antibiotics for the infection and Differin for the acne. The antibiotics cleared up the infection in about a week. As for the Differin, well, it's been a bit of a journey. As expected, my acne got worse when I first started using it. Some redness, a bit of peeling. After about two months my skin became used to the product and I saw a slight improvement. However, about once a month a new zit will form. Differin will quickly get rid of the new zit, but it still hasn't cleared up the acne that popped up in March. Don't get me wrong, it has faded a bit, but I still don't have my old skin back. I've been using it for about 5 months now and I plan to keep using it because I feel it DOES work. However, it definitely takes time.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	25-34	9/16/2012 10:24:49 AM	Differin worked great for me as a teen, so when acne returned to my life at 25, I was excited to get my RX for it. Although it does help to clear up acne quickly, I had an allergic reaction to it that made my life miserable. I developed a painful, itchy, red rash all over my face and neck, and my eyelids swelled up to the point where I could barely open them. Now that I've stopped the Differin, it is starting to go away, but slowly. I'm in nursing school and just dealing with this has put me behind with my studies. I'm miserable. I know Differin can be great for some, but it has made me miserable. Just keep a heads up if you have a history of being sensitive to meds.

Acne	MSIMFAMOUS, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	10/4/2011 10:40:43 AM	I started using Differin about a month ago with the gel version. It did start out as the typical drying and redness. But I then started t develope dry patches in areas that I didnt have any dryness or redness. I then called the doctor to let her know that it was worse than previous. She prescribe me the lotion version and it works the same but without the extra patches. My skin has less acne, and feels great after I apply the moisturizer. I just wish it eliminates the black spots. I will give it some more time to work.
Acne	problem on acne, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	13-18	9/11/2011 7:26:12 PM	at first, i feel afraid because my acne seems getting worst, well thats natural. but then again, just like my dermatologist said, it will get worst before it will get better, yeah, and she's correct, i didnt stop using it even though i feel already worried, after 3 weeks of usiing it. most of my acne starts to get remove, and also some scars. so i can say that this medicine really works. well, goodluck. dont get despair if it will get worst at first. okay :)
Acne	thatgirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/3/2011 4:38:19 PM	LOVE! I battled acne (and lost) for 10 years before going to the dermatologist. She prescribed me Differin along with Duac and together they are MIRACULOUS! For the first time in my adult life I have clear skin! Anyone with acne knows how much it can affect you and being free of the self consciousness and embarrassment is incredible. A few words of CAUTION - it did dry me out at first. Really bad. Like peeling from a sunburn level of dry. But it only lasted a few days and then my skin adjusted and I was fine. Don't do the &quot;if a little is good then a whole bunch will be better&quot; thing. Just use a small amount like they say, have some patience, and suck it up for a few days - it will get better! It did for me anyway. Everyone is different but based on my experience this stuff combined with Duac is a lifesaver! Quick story - my derm recommended several drug store brands for cleanser and moisturizer. I started with Neutrogena and had a nasty reaction - I was COVERED in little red bumps. I thought it might be one of the rx's so I went back to the derm. After some experimenting it turns out it was the cleanser. I switched to Aveeno and have been fine ever since. So if you, like me, start an entirely new regimen and have a reaction don't assume it is the rx. Had I done that I would have missed out on some awesome results. The only thing I am unhappy about is that I didn't start this years sooner!!!
Acne	MsShavone, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/6/2011 8:05:01 PM	I was prescribed this medication by my dermatologists for my acne (in conjuction with Bactrim). It has been a miracle worker. My skin is clear and glowing and has been for the past year. I feel comfortable not wearing makeup and get compliments on my glowing sking all the time. If I feel a flare up happening, I immediately put this on at night and by morning, it's gone. 
Acne	rae rae, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	13-18	1/25/2011 12:33:16 AM	7 days into my treatment with differin and i can't even smile due to my cracked, chapped, and raw skin. i was warned, but i never thought it would be this bad. my acne has gone down but i honestly think i would rather live with zits than with this pain.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/17/2011 3:21:41 PM	I started taking this drug over five years ago when I was seventeen and it has cleared up most of my acne (still had a few pimples here and there but they were very minimal).  It works very well but can be harsh at times with dryness and itchiness.  I remember the first two weeks it made my acne a little worse but then it got a lot better.  Any time my acne flares up, I use this medicine.  I highly recommend it.  
Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	12/14/2010 2:25:41 PM	I used this medication for only 2 weeks.  My skin became very dry and it was extremely painful.  I had to go back to the dermatologist for a new medication. 
Acne	JNL, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	10/15/2010 12:09:18 PM	I started using Differin 0.1% 7 months ago in conjunction with Benzaclin. I had cystic acne and tons of dark pigmented scars. My dermatologist told me it would take 12 months for my scars to disappear, but with the use of these two meds together, 2 months later, my skin is perfectly clear and free of scars! I don't have to wear makeup anymore. My skin is flawless and i get compliments all the time. So far it hasn't irritated my skin at all. Very satisfied.
Acne	candj1316, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	3/2/2010 3:07:51 PM	My daughter has been on this now for 11 weeks.  We were told that her acne would get worse initially, and it has.  Unfortunately, we are a week away form the &quot;up to 12 weeks&quot; mark, and everyday her face looks worse.  And she's also taking Junel which shuold a help a little, also.  Not sure what to try next.  I think we've hit everything over the counter.
Acne	michele12, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	2/2/2010 1:13:20 PM	I've been using this product for about two years,  my skin is much smoother and basically clear of pimples, however before my menstrual cycle starts I usually breakout and the differin gel does not help prevent them, and it's not good for spot treatments.  Overall my acne is under control.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/29/2009 2:45:54 PM	I've been using it for the past 6 months and it has done a wonderous job in clearing my skin. It does take a couple weeks to start working, but once it does the results are amazing
Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	3	5	3	Female	13-18	12/18/2009 10:28:38 PM	I have used this product for 2 years now. It was working really well, and here recently my acne has gotten really bad. I think my face may be immune to it now. I luckily am going to see a dermatologist very soon. Hopefully, to return with something that will help my recent acne go away.

Acne	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	5	Male	19-24	10/23/2009 1:07:17 AM	Yes, you will get an initial breakout (still not too bad compared with my normal breakouts), it makes your skin peeling/dry and it took &gt;2 months to see results. That said, it works wonders and my acne has gone down a lot recently. I had moderate acne with frequent nodules and now I rarely get nodules and only a few non-inflamed whiteheads. Used Duac in the morning for a while but rarely need to use it now (only for badly inflammed spots).
Acne	lisa, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	10/8/2009 12:08:33 AM	I have been using this product (along with another topical)for about a week and my skin has improved. The first few days I used it my skin got really dry (was using it every ither day too) and irritated. So I've been religously mosturizing and my skin is practically cleared up compared to before. 
Acne	joshua, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	13-18	6/8/2009 1:35:06 AM	I am a teenager and this stuff is  amazing. Your face will get worse after using it for  couple weeks but your dermatologist should tell you that. Also acne takes a long time to get rid of. I have been using this for about roughly 3-4 months and it's been working great. No more giant red pimples that used to be flaring up my skin. I still have some acne though, a lot smaller, but it is worse on my chest, its getting better but slowly. i also have to use some benzoyl peroxide wash and some pill. i used to have a prescribed pill but the insurance ran out so i use a generic capsule now. Apparently this capsule prevents malaria and treats STD's. It is basically an anti-biotic so i could why. Well, hope this review helps, and if you have bad acne see a dermatologist.     
Acne	cool16202003@yahoo.com, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	13-18	3/17/2009 5:43:05 AM	I started using Differin over a year ago, and it didn't do much for me. My doctor prescribed Epiduo for me almost a month ago, but because of the cost, I was unable to purchase it. Well, Epiduo is just Differin combined with 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide. So, I went to a drug store and picked up &quot;Neutrogena On the Spot Acne Treatment.&quot; It's the only Benzoyl Peroxide I've found that is 2.5%. The 2.5% works the same as the 5% or 10%, but without as much irritation and dryness. Your face WILL get dry after the 2nd or 3rd application, so you'll need to apply moisturizer. Here's what I do: I wash my face in the morning and put Cetaphil Moisturizer on after. It's fairly cheap for the amount of cream that you get. Any good moisturizer will work, though. Then at night, I apply the Differin, SPARINGLY; too much Differin can cause irritation. After the Differin has dried, I apply the Benzoyl Peroxide, also sparingly. This will clear your face up FAST. It works better than Differin or Benzoyl Peroxide alone. Just make SURE you moisturize. Your face will get dry if you don't. It works like a charm : )If you have any questions, my Webmd screen name is my email address.
Acne	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Male	19-24	2/13/2009 2:39:19 PM	this has worked great for me. i had it so bad and within a couple of weeks i noticed tremendous results.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	1/21/2009 10:50:49 AM	Differin just didn't work for me. My skin got so oily and I broke out everywhere. It's supposed to get worse before it gets better, but my skin never improved. I still have scarring I'm trying to fix. I've had some friends who were successful on Differin though.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/24/2008 9:43:15 PM	Works great!  If your acne is getting worse within the first few weeks to month, it's okay.  My dermatologist told me that it would, and then it would get better.  She was right!  :)
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	10/30/2008 1:04:03 AM	This gel is AMAZING!! Not to mention, I think I've tried every other gel or cream out there and nothing, I repeat, nothing compares. Definitely get this if you're dealing with acne! I finally have my skin back!!
Acne	olivia321, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	10/4/2008 2:14:55 PM	i've been using differin right before bed and it has gotten rid of a lot of my ance. after 2 days of putting it on a pimple it is gone.
Acne	number5, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/30/2008 3:57:30 PM	I'm using this with tetracycline (oral pill).  I have dry, flaky, acne-prone skin that inflames easily and the cream form of Differin doesn't dry it out too much as long as I use extra moisturizer on the place of application.  I've been using it for about a year and it works great!  My skin looks so much healthier,  LESS red, and more even-toned than just tetracycline alone.  At the beginning, it actually seemed to worsen (my doctor warned me about that though so I was prepared) and after about a month it all seemed to clear up overnight! and now I rarely get a pimple but when I do, I use Differin and it's usually gone that same day!

Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	13-18	8/4/2008 12:25:44 AM	I've only been using Differin for the past two weeks.  So far, my acne has gotten a lot worse.  I'm not having any trouble with dryness or redness, however, just more breakouts.  So I came to WebMD to see what was up.  Hopefully in about two more weeks I'll actually be seeing some positive results that the other reviewers have been talking about!
Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	13-18	7/31/2008 9:35:03 PM	i began using differin once a day, right before bed and really was not satisfied unfortunately. i, with my luck, was one of the few patients who experienced horribly dry, flaky and irritated skin. my face was extremely red and scaly to the point where my already low confidence (from my acne) was getting even lower. after about two or three weeks, i was so worried about my face peeling off i discontinued use of it. also, for me, my acne was only getting worse on this because of the irritation.
Acne	13-18 on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	4	5		13-18	6/21/2008 3:21:05 PM	I have been using the cream form of differin for only a week and my skin is almost 100% clearer. The morning after I first applied it I saw results.It has also made my skin smoother.And my skin isn't really dried out bybthis product, but when it gets too dry I just skip a dose and that seems to help. 
Other	 on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5			5/16/2008 7:41:47 AM	My two teenagers are using Differin and with amazing results!  I tried it as an anti aging product and it is not only helping my adult acne and my skin looks pretty amazing.  The gel is a bit drying but for the kids oily skin it's perfect, I may try the cream to see if it is better for my &quot;mature&quot; skin.  :)   I do hope this works for you...after years of cystic acne I found Acutane to be the only way to resolve my skin issues.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	5/11/2008 12:47:24 PM	I started using it about a year ago and I only noticed a slight difference at the beginning, but my acne wasn't horrible to begin with. However, I would say after about 6 months of using it my skin became clearer and I was noticing less frequent outbreaks. Also, I never really had much dryness/peeling which was my main concern when I started using it. I only have it occasionally on my nose. If anything, it makes my skin feel a lot softer. I would definitely recommend using it. 
Acne	pinbacklady, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	4/21/2008 12:46:19 AM	I have only used the cream at night and morning for almost a month now and it is working obviously well. It doesnt dry out my face one bit (shockingly!) and it feels as if i'm wearing a light mosturizer throughout the day. It is reducing the amount of pimples and time of them. If i break out, no later than 48 hours they will be gone. 
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	4/9/2008 3:47:56 PM	It has been about 8 weeks since I started using Differin at night in conjunction with another topical in the morning. If you use this medication, don't apply it anywhere near the crevices of your nose or anywhere near your mouth. If the gel gets too close to my lips the skin around them peals horribly and is very painful (using Vaseline helps to relieve it). My skin is clearing up, especially on my forehead where I get alot of smaller, more painful pimples. Unfortunately it does nothing for scars.
Acne	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female		2/7/2008 12:04:26 AM	I've been using Differin for 6 weeks now but I get the side effects of scaling, itchy, and very dry skin. I don't use any other topical prescription but I have to moisturize at least twice a day, and I'm not using it on a daily basis either.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	1/25/2008 10:35:33 AM	I have been on Differin for six weeks. I apply it at night time and use it in conjunction with topical Duac and Nicomide the vitamin. I feel like among the three prescrptions the Differin is the best at preventing future breakouts. I broke out a lot when I started taking it and now I am finally getting the clear skin I was looking for. It just had to fix all the clogged pores under my skin. So I give it a thumbs up.

It hasn't completely stopped my breakouts, but it does a good job keeping them under control and clearing them up quickly. I would also like to note that I am on 4 prescriptions for my acne (including the differin) so my results could also have something to do with the other topicals and pills that I am using. 
Acne	Kim, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	10/19/2007 8:22:00 PM	It takes a long time to see results with this medicine.  The texture of my skin improved considerably, but it was not effective in treating my acne alone.  I have to use it in conjunction with other acne treatment medicines.
