If I take it at the firt sign of a post nasal drip or sniffle, I am clear with in 30 minutes. I then remain clear for more than a day. I could not make it through spring and summer in Texas without it.

Non-Seasonal Allergic Runny Nose	Sue, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/7/2010 9:02:09 AM	I have chronic hayfever that escalates during the spring. Usually I have to miss days at work.  Nothing over the counter brings relief like Tekral for me.  I am grateful that my doctor prescribed this. I have used it for 2 days now and feel great! The doctor also prescribed Omnaris 2x daily along with this.  It is a winning formula for me.

Unfortunately, I experienced most of the listed side effects.  most notably, numbness in my hands, diziness, anxiety, rapid heartbeat, loss of apetite, loss of sex drive, and blured vision in one eye.  I rarely experience side affects from medication.  The effects of caffeine and alcohol were greatly magnifide.
Cold Symptoms	George G., 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/3/2009 5:20:28 PM	The Tekral worked great on my allergies. I live in San Antonio and every year around this time I suffer from horrible allergies.  My doctor prescribed this for me and it worked better than any thing else I have tried.  I did't eperience any drowsiness either and was able to work all day without any problems.  The drug's info said it was a  12 hour medicine but it lasted for longer than that!
