Pain	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	6/14/2011 9:55:24 PM	After taking the drug I became so dizzy I found it hard to walk straight.  I went to bed for a couple of hours and slept and upon waking most of the side effects had ceased.  I will not take it again since there are indications that this is a serious side effect.
Pain	tangytomato, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	4/12/2011 12:57:37 PM	Was given this medicine for kidney stones and it is wonderful. I'm a big fan of hydrocodone anyway because it allows me to work take care of daily task and does not make me drowsy like some other pain medications.
