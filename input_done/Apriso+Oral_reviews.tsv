Crohn's Disease	designer58, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	55-64	9/9/2012 10:09:15 AM	I am a 59 y.o. male with a lengthy history of Crohn's Disease/Regional Enteritis, since 1968. I have been on just about every drug used to treat Crohn's including Prednisone, Azulfadine, Entocort, Asacol, Pentasa, Xifaxan, Remicade and Humira, long with systemic drugs like Hyocyamine, Lomotil and Questrian. I have been on Apriso almost 5 years and I am unsure the drug i helping . Now my GI Dr. has been getting me to try using Questrian which is supposed to bulk me up. I should be more diligent with it, but it tastes clumpy and not so good. I also have only 25% of my colon, from a partial Cholectomy in 1997 when a puncture  occurred during a routine Colonoscopy. I have sometimes up to 20 stools per day, frequent accidents, and mostly loose, watery stools, usually bringing on a very chaffed, irratated and painful rectum. I will say I am not always diligent with my dirt. Even when I am sticking with my Crohns diet, i have loose stools. Today I have used Apriso for about 2 to 3 years. The biggest concern is not only have I gotten Diabetes type 2, Miniscus tear in right knee but both are painful, and now I noticed Psoriasis, and I was told I tested positive year for Sleep Apnea. Please read up on Apriso. I am very curious and need to know if in fact Psoriasis has come from taking Apriso, yet Psorisis did not paper visible until 3 years later. Don't know if I should stop Apriso, use Enticort, go on to Azulfadine?   I am on SSDI, been out of work actively looking for work over 5 years, and I am sure that the resulting depression has helped manifest these auto immune diseases. Is there ANYONE who has had Psoriasis while taking Apriso or other major side effects? Is there any way to tell if Apriso caused the Psoriasis?Thanks for reading and responding.

My doctor advises that I keep on taking it and said I could try reducing it to 3 tablets rather than 4 a day. I am sticking with 4 tablets. I also take the probiotic Align with the Apriso and the two have worked for me.
Ulcerated Colon	 Female  (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female		6/28/2012 8:45:36 AM	I took 2 tables the first day 6am, beginning 10am the diarrhea was acute, every 2 hours, which continued until the next morning by the way, by 2pm I was experiencing abdominal pain, 5pm nausea, 7pm influenza like illness. No I will not continue with this medication.

Tried Lialda, but it gave me severe stomach pain.  Switched to Apriso and it has worked wonders.  It took about 3-4 weeks to get into remission.  Not bad at all!  The pills are a little hard to swallow because of size, but it's worth it to feel &quot;normal&quot; again!

I have had 3 flare ups in this ammount of time and have one now but overall it is good medication, very expensive for a drug i have to take til I die but we all do what we have to do...advice..don't ever stop taking it, get a credit card just for that if you need to, but it will tear you up if you stop taking it..trust me!
Ulcerated Colon	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	3/15/2012 3:49:42 PM	I started out on this medication and because of cost, switched to a generic alternative, which did not work as well.  Am back on Apriso and are doing very well.  This medication does have an adverse interaction when taken with Flagyl 500mg.  I cannot take them at the same time.

My doctor has instructed me to keep taking it and I will. The only side effect is occasional stiffness. I also take Align, a probiotic everyday. Using the two has worked well.

It seems to be very effective to treat a flare of ulcerative colitis, but after he is on it for a while, he starts up with some weird symptoms with lower Hct and hemoglobin.  Also has bleeding under the skin and bleeds easily under the skin if he hits his forearms.  These symptoms subside when he quits taking it.  This last time he has had bad headaches, fatigue, body aches and fever like symptoms. Got him to discontinue other meds to try and pin down what is causing these nasty cascade of symptoms.  Only other med left is prozac 20mg, sooo.  Believe it's time to cut back on the two of these- Be careful, Drs will keep adding more med for symptoms instead of looking at cutting back on meds to treat.  
Ulcerated Colon	Linda, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/9/2011 10:45:59 AM	I've been taking for 14 months now &amp; almost immediately had no pain &amp; definetly less trips to the bathroom. Sleep thru the nite.  I however take 8 daily &amp; therefore the manufacturer won't honor the $50 discount as over recommended dosage.  It is a nonformulary drug &amp; costs more but worth it.  No loss of hair.  I eat fresh fruits &amp; vegetables with caution.  Life is almost back to normal.

I was taking Entocort but my doctor had me switch to Apriso and am very satisfied. Apriso while expensive is about one third the price of Entocort. I read it is for use for up to 6 months but now I see many people have been taking it for much longer.On May 27, 2011, after taking Apriso for 10 months, I had a colonoscopy and my doctor reported that my colon had actually improved since I was on the medication. I currently take 4 tablets a day and my doctor said I could cut down to three if I wanted to. I asked him about the long time side effects of Apriso and he said he knew of none. The only side effect I have experienced is joint stiffness in the morning which usually subsides within twenty minutes. I will keep taking 4 tablets a day.

I no longer eat lettuce or onion anything.  Seems to have worked!  I can say may hair seems to be greying not sure if Apriso is the reason.
Ulcerative Colitis currently Without Symptoms	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/10/2011 12:30:15 PM	I started taking this medication in January 2011 and it worked for me immediately - I felt 120% better than I had in years. No more cramping/pain. It is a miracle drug as far as I am concerned :) It is (unfortunately) very expensive.

Crohn's Disease	Amy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/25/2011 10:58:07 AM	Haven't been on any medication prior to starting Aprisio due to lack of insurance. Its only been 2 weeks/4pills a day and my diahhrea has increased tremendously-very watery,loose,expolsive, barely making it to the bathroom.  The doctor recommended that I stop for a few days to hopefully give me some bowel rest and then I'm to restart the drug but at a lower dose (2 pills-daily) and see what happens.  Not a big fan right now of this medication. I've lost a few pounds but it wasn't the way I had planned to lose them.

Ulcerated Colon	pamel, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	1/18/2011 3:36:23 PM	I started taking this medication a little over a week ago, I stopped taking as my symptoms seemed to become more severe, along with more blood loss, more stomach pain, adominal swelling, and a groggy, disoriented feeling.  I have been off the med for 4 days now, and seem to be some better other than fatigue and nausea.  I will not take this again.

Ulcerated Colon	Linda, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	12/3/2010 1:55:35 PM	Been using for 6 mo &amp; has been the most effective.  Showed positive signs in 1st 3wk of use with pain being the first to go.  Lesser trips to bathroom.  Closer to normal since disease started but know I'll never be normal either.  Started with 8 daily &amp; now down to 4.  Cost is outrageous as insurance looks at as new drug pays 50%.  I would strongly urge physicians to use this more &amp; get it off BLBS formularly list.  Then this could be more affordable for more.

It took about 3-4 weeks.  I have been on it for over a year and can't imagine life without it.  Recently had throat surgery and couldn't take it for a week. Man I suffered. Glad to be back on it.  Downside: Pills are so big and it is so expensive.
Crohn's Disease	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	11/12/2010 6:58:59 PM	An active Crohn's episode subsided within only 2-3 days of starting this medication.  The biggest benefit was in the subsidence of the severe cramping that preceded and succeeded bowel movements.  Bleeding during bowel movements has also disappeared.Side effects have been minimal in the 3 weeks I have been taking this medicine.  The most notable is a slight headache, which is worse when my energy level is down.A psoriasis outbreak started in the second week, and has not gone away.  I will have to monitor this since, in my case, it can bring back a previous condition of acropustulosis.  The use of anti-inflammatory medications tends to worsen my psoriasis.With regard to appetite, I suggest you take it slowly.  My latest Crohn's episode was in it's fourth week.  So, when I started being able to handle eating, I went a little overboard!In all, this has been a true blessing.  I wish I would have known about it years ago.  Not quite a miracle cure, but I do feel much better.  I will continue to monitor my health and have a big concern over the potential for renal failure as a possible side-effect.Good luck!
Ulcerative Colitis currently Without Symptoms	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	10/17/2010 9:52:04 PM	A few days after I started taking this, my bowels were back to normal and I had no more bleeding or pain. Fantastic drug. It's like I never even went through all the pain from UC. The only thing I dislike is how large the pills are and taking 4 all at once every day, but it's completely worth it to feel normal again. If only it weren't so expensive without the $50 off coupon...

And rightly so. This medication has actually cuased an increase in BM's and cramping since I have transitioned to it. It has been over a month now and the medication does not work for my level of Crohns Disease. It may work for someone with extremely mild Ulcerative Colitis but even that is doubtful.
Ulcerative Colitis currently Without Symptoms	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/16/2010 1:06:07 AM	I started taking the Apriso on its own and the first few weeks were pretty good. Then it was as if I had never taken it. My doctor took me off for a few months and tried gastrocrom and it was not much different. Then within the last two months my doctor paired it with Gastrocrom and its amazing. Very little pain and no diarrhea within the last four weeks. I am also having daily bowel movements which has never happened in my life! They are also offering a coupon on the web for $50 off of your copay a month for a year, which is awesome since there is no generic and my copay is $50 for each refill. Take advantage of that!

All of my symptoms were gone and after the first dose I had a formed stool. Once week 4 hit everything changed. Bloody stool, abdominal pain, fatigue...all of my previous symptoms came back. :( I was so happy that I'd finally found something that worked, but it only lasted a short while.

Other	It Works!, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	3/3/2010 12:59:16 PM	I took Entocort EC for six months and only had minor improvement for lymochatic (sp?)colitis. It also made me extremely ill. I had to insist on a medication change and was given Apriso for the past two months. I feel so much better and it works for me 95% of the time. Minimal side effects of headache and some hair loss. The only other problem is that I do have the problem of immune system suppression so I'm catching a lot of colds, sinusitus, etc. that aren't responding well to antibiotics. It takes twice as long (and twice as many antibiotcis) to get better as it should. I would still recommend Apriso as the best choice of the medications available.

I don't think it helped at all. It was so easy to take, however.

I do not feel much better than I did before I began taking this medicine.  I wake up early mornings with horrible stomach pains and have slight headaches throughout my day, as well as feeling fatigue.  I do not feel that this medicine has helped much with my symptoms.

Asacol was not keeping it at bay, Prednisone was no longer able to put it into remission.  Went on Remicade which was fantastic and on Apriso for a daily maintenance.  It's easy since it's only once a day and it seems to be OK. I'm about an 8 out of 10 for symptoms, so no complaints.  I really can tell the difference when I forgot to take my pills in the morning.I would recommend giving Apriso a try.
