Underactive Thyroid	watchdoggie,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female		8/22/2012 7:23:37 PM	Went with Nature Thyroid by Phoenix based pharmacy and it made my thyroid levels go lower! made my thyroid worse, armour is fine but the Nature-thyroid brand was a huge mistake for me and cost over $300 
Underactive Thyroid	Aster, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	7/28/2012 10:57:29 AM	My dad had been on thyroid forever and that's one indication. My shower was often completely clogged with my hair, I would get so weak I could barely stand up and had heart palpitations for a year, day and night plus I had to take this years ago. Now: palpitations GONE suddenly, no shower clogs, sleep better, normal energy for a senior, not depressed anymore and my hair is shiny again. Skin on legs not as dry either. Taking lowest dose for 2 weeks and have lost 2 pounds. Husband had neck lump; they wanted to REMOVE HIS THYROID without saying it was cancer! Now his neck lump is gone after a week!! 
Cancer of Thyroid	Kathy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/26/2012 11:20:08 PM	Right after having my thyroid removed I was put on Synthroid.  I had horrible side effects from it including terrible pain in all my joints. I could barely get out of bed and the doctors insisted I had rhumetoid arthritis.  Long story short, I found a dr. that prescribed me Nature-Throid and I couldn't be happier!  I feel GREAT!  No more joint pain or other nasty side effects like I had from Synthroid.  This is truly a wonder drug.  So many doctors that I went to completely discouraged me from taking any natural thryoid med and INSISTED that synthetic T4 only meds are the best way to regulate TSH.  WRONG!  I can't say it enough how wonderful I feel.  Good luck to anyone out there that has had thyroid cancer.  Keep searching for docs that will cooperate with you and who will listen to your symptoms and complaints.  It's your body and you have to find the drug that works best for you.

Struggled forever with other medications. Now I feel better than ever! I hope and pray that they never take this off the market!

I have been on it for 6 weeks and I could not be happier! My hair was beyond falling, it was raining, my energy level was as low as you can get and still be able to somewhat function. I swear there is some kind of sedative in it as I have never been calmer in my life - very uncharacteristic - but I am not complaining. I am surprised that it could be the cause of my mild insomia, but compared to my barely functioning self a few months ago, its a small price to pay. I hope all keeps going good and I can eventually see some weight loss. I have gained 30lbs in the past 2yrs and loosing that would be awesome since it would mean my BMI is back to normal. So far so goos and I am loving it.
Underactive Thyroid	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	55-64	12/10/2011 5:00:06 AM	I have been using this medication for about 2 months. I first started on 1/2 gr and after 3 doses developed atrial fibrillation, although brain fog improved. Skipped one day, atrial fibrillation resolved spontaneously, and restarted on 1/4 gr. However, I have had increasing migraine (cluster) headaches and insomnia that I have never had to this degree before.
Underactive Thyroid	Route66, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/31/2011 11:35:19 AM	WOW...If you are feeling sluggish, hair is falling out, feeling depressed, weight gain with no end in sight, and a host of other symptoms you may feel that you have never felt before thyroid medication, then Nature-Throid just may be what you are searching for. I have personally tried Synthroid for many years with doctors insisting this is the right medication for me, and to basically ignore these symptoms I was having.  I was on Cytomel, and was finally able to convince a new doctor to prescribe me Armour Thyroid.  This worked....UNTIL it was on a neverending backorder and suddenly the formula was changed...Getting Nature_throid changed my life.  I have energy like before, weight has come off, no longer depressed, hair doesn't fall out, and many of the mysterious pains have gone away.  One thing, when I was on Synthroid, my pharmacy changed me to generic, and I had a cough for 2 months straight before I even realized that I was on generic.  I switched back to regular, and the cough went away, but all the other symptoms remained.  If you have had no luck with anything, please give Nature-Thorid a chance.  This may be YOUR answer too!  Good luck!

It has been almost 1 year that now she is on Nature throid, she is feeling great and so happy, and lost almost 10 lbs.  This is the best medicine ever. Thank you.

Since I've been on Nature-Throid, I feel normal again.  I have energy back, depression is gone, my hair loss has stopped.  I'm so happy my doctor put me on this drug.   My blood tests show that it is helping my thyroid better than synthroid ever did.  I will never go back to synthroid.  
Underactive Thyroid	frankie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	8/27/2010 12:10:11 PM	I've taken Nature Thyroid for 2 full months. I've only had mild increase in my energy level. I have headaches, joint pain and bloating/full feeling with this medication, but the worst symptom is that it keeps me from sleeping all night.  I'm wake 50 times a night.
Underactive Thyroid	 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5			7/13/2010 10:04:33 AM	I have tried just about EVERY thyroid med under the sun without remedy until I discovered Nature-throid. This med is THE BEST. It jolted my body back into livelihood: more energy, skin and hair look great-- without any annoying side effects. Best medicine ever...at least for me. 
Underactive Thyroid	hurting, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	4/5/2010 10:47:53 PM	The NEW Nature-Throid gives me a lasting headache and increased joint pain, within a few minutes of taking it.  The OLD Nature-Throid worked perfectly.  RLC changed something.  It is unusable for me.  
Underactive Thyroid	Hypothyroid patient, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/23/2009 3:32:47 PM	This thyroid medicene Nature Thyroid, has been the best I have ever taken before.  I have been on Synthroid which is as good as taking nothing, I had still hair loss with that and my muscles still ached.  Then Armor Thyroid and that was &quot;okay&quot; the symptoms went away but not alot of weight loss and I excersise 30 minutes a day on a mini trampolene jogging hard on it. Then the pharmacist could not get &quot;Armor&quot; and it was on back log (what is with that anyways, why can't they get that??) So then I found a natural pharmacy called Pharmaca and they were nice and told me about &quot;NATURE-TYROID&quot; so I tried that for one month I felt great and dropped 3 pounds that month and anyone who fights hypothyroid knows what I am talking about.  I loved &quot;NATURE THYROID&quot; but not it is on back log, at the pharmacy I buy it at.  The Doctor then put me on a medicene called &quot;Thyroid&quot; which I have been on for about 15 days now and I can tell it is not as good as &quot;NATURE-THYROID&quot; was as I was taking that and I can not WAIT for them to get &quot;NATURE THYROID&quot; back at the pharmacy from back log.  I would HIGHLY advise trying &quot;NATURE-THYROID&quot; &quot;EXCELLENT MEDICENE&quot; FOR HYPOTHYROID, at least for me it was!!!
Cancer of Thyroid	Karen Rae, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/20/2009 7:53:59 PM	I was on Armour Thyroid for approximately 4 years after trying every synthetic thyroid replacement hormone.  The synthetic drugs just didn't work for me.  I never achieved the TSH level I needed to supress cancer or relieve my smyptoms with synthetic drugs, only natural desicatted thyroid. I took Nature-Throid as a replacement for Armour Thyroid after Armour reformulated their Thyroid and I had extensive problems because my body was not absorbing the Armour any longer.  Nature-Throid improved my overall well-being after one week.  Currently Nature-Throid is on 90-day back order (Aug 17 2009).  Do not go back to synthetic preparations.  Natural thyroid is available in Canada, manufactured by Erfa. Do a search for Thyroid at the Canadian drugstore and you will find what you are looking for.  Available in 30 mg., 60 mg., and 125 mg. tablets.  Shop around as prices vary widely. When RLC Labs gets the back log under raps go back to Nature-Throid.  I recommend it without reservation.  Keep educating yourself and talk to your doctor about your symptoms.  Look at websites like &quot;Stop the Thyroid Madness&quot; (www.stopthethyroidmadness.com)for information.
Underactive Thyroid	enterprise**01, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/14/2009 7:36:45 PM	After 15 years of mediocre response on synthetic thyroid (both T3 and T4), I decided to switch to Nature-throid after extensive research on the differences between synthetic and real thyroid. I've only been on Nature-throid for 3 weeks and feel like a new person. No more muscle pain, being cold all the time, constipation, fatigue, hair loss, lack of normal stamina in every day activities, etc. I'm sorry I wasted so many years of my life taking synthetic thyroid that only gave me a small improvement in my hypo symptoms.  
Underactive Thyroid	Natural Meds, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/23/2009 5:28:55 PM	After taking synthetic thyroid meds for years and still not feeling well, I decided to try this natural compound after researching it. I feel a lot better and have more energy because it combines T3 and T4, just like the hormone that our bodies produce. The company that makes it also has even higher purity standards than is required and has never had a recall for Nature-Throid and its other version, West-Throid. (I've also taken it and it's just as good.) I highly recommend this medicine. Unfortunately, it's not stocked at many pharmacies and you may have to check with the company itself about who has it.Note that the product name is NOT Armour Thyroid. That's a mistake on this website and it's a totally different drug.
