Psoriasis of Scalp	Carol,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		3/13/2010 2:31:22 PM	This is great for my scalp, and I use it occasionally.  I basically use it on the weekend mid morning leaving it on a full 8 hours, then wash my hair and then go to bed rather than having to do it in the morning and going to bed with wet hair.  I must say too it is a great &quot;conditioner&quot; although its not intended for that.
