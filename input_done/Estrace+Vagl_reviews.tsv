I wanted relief from painful intercourse and dryness. I found that was solved plus I sleep better ( without waking too frequently) and hot flashes have been greatly reduced. I am not as irritable either. I feel like my old self. I wish someone had told me about this years ago. I am 5 years menopausal.

No more dryness or itchiness, irritation, am sleeping better and has greatly improved my sex drive to levels I can only remember, ha&#160;But you do have to apply it faithfully. I now apply it just occasionally and this seems to maintain the good effects.

Thereare so many indentations you have to use a Q-Tip to clean out all the little places that will not wash out with just soap and water.  PLEASE ask manufacturer to redesign the applicator.

Vaginal Inflammation due to Loss of Hormone Stimulation	Magatha, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	2/10/2012 3:29:53 PM	I wish I could review this product, but it is far too expensive. The pharmacy quoted me a price of $188.00 for one tube. I can't afford it. Without my prescription drug plan, it would be $250. This pharmacy has always seemed to be in line with other places. Checking online produced tons of listings for &quot;generic&quot; Estrace, or Estrace-like creams, but I don't want to risk getting a fake product.

I now have ovarian cancer.  Have your OBGYN check your ovaries after using this cream.  Not sure if this is what caused it but the cancer was in the early stages when found.

Also, headaches that were not part of my life, became a daily thing.  I thought that this medication was identical to our own bodies.  I had to go back on Premarin/cream.

Asked Dr to reorder for 90 day mail order &amp; this time instead if 3x/wk filled for 2x/wk.  Called Dr last wk w terrible pain on intercourse...reordered Estrace 1 Gm 14 dys HS &amp; 3x/wk... I am to see a GYN specialist at University Center...GYN regular Dr wanted me to go last yr but sick of Dr's.  I have multiple medical chronic conditions that require meds or I will be in pain, etc  ...In short these probably cause the vaginal dryness. I am hoping this works.  Yeast infections per GYN Dr &amp; I had no discharge or complaints other than pain on intercourse.  Does this help this problem  I don't know yet. Reason for my uncertain answers. Specialist may put a new light on entire problem.

I even urinated blood.  Urine culture indicated no bacteria.  Symptoms caused entirely by base carrier ingredient of Extrace.  Tried it a second time...same results.

However, I find I have mild dizziness, slight headaches, mood changes and mild depression.  Accompanying literature with RX says it should be reviewed ever 3-6 months of use.
