Increased Facial Hair in a Woman	susiewill@aol.com, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	7/6/2012 4:36:51 PM	Vaniqa deliberately misled customers by failing to explain that one must buy 2 tubes of their product to qualify for the $50 rebate.  I purchased one tube for $93.00 as a trail purchase, expecting the full rebate, but I received a check for only $25.00.  It was not until I called the company (very long wait, by the way) that they explained how their rebate actually works. Be aware that up to $50 means that they can give you any amount that they choose.  Their advertising is a least misleading.

I stopped using it about a month ago because I was considering getting my second treatment of laser hair removal. OMG within the last month I have noticed the hairs on my chin and neck are increasingly thick and black... disgusting!! I thought vaniqa wasn't working but OH BOY it was! Many people give up on vaniqa too easily.. if you stay consistent with your treatments (twice a day), it truly does work. I haven't experienced any scalp hair loss whatsoever.. I highly recommend vaniqa for women who are sick and tired of thick dark facial hair. I didn't believe it worked.. but I do now for sure. 
Increased Facial Hair in a Woman	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	4/1/2012 9:51:09 AM	The first time I tried Vaniqa, I followed the directions of applying it twice a day. It worked beautifully, no more bumps or chin hairs. However, my hair started to rapidly thin. I stopped using Vaniqa and the chin hairs came back in full force. My head hair eventually started to regrow. I liked the effect of the drug on my chin, and decided to try it again, but this time using it only ONCE a day, and applying it with a Q-tip, not my fingers. I am not experiencing any abnormbal scalp hair loss now. The effects of the drug on my chin are not quite as good as the first time, but it is a definite improvement over the time spent tweezing and the irritation that produces on my chin. 
Increased Facial Hair in a Woman	designerbabe, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/2/2012 4:49:18 AM	Reading some of the comments from women who shave instead of tweezing having less success, I have this thought. On areas that I tweese around my chin and my mouth (not a lot there) I get very fine and much reduced hair growth using a small amount of Vaniqa..about a 1/4&quot; size drop, once a day. The area that I trim using a scissor around my cheeks to lip area I see much faster hair growth using the Vaniqa there. I believe the secret is in the tweezing of the hair that helps the efficacy of the Vaniqa. I have been using it successfully since it came on the market...Used to tweeze every day and more with ingrown hair and irritation from trying to tweezze the short stubble. Now the hair is finer and easier to pull out. The one BIG negative, like a few others who have used it for a while I too have noticed a fairly noticeable hair loss since using it. May just be an age thing, but my Mother and Father had thick heads of hair into their 90's. I know there is an enzyme that attacks collagen and bone loss, and might also impact hair as well. Any dentist can tell you. Would like to see further information on this.

I use it every day and it seems the hair on my upper lip is growing fast that usua.  Could this be a bad patch of Vaniqa??
Increased Facial Hair in a Woman	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	65-74	11/28/2011 1:54:04 AM	At 65 now I have used Vaniqa for a at least 3-4 years without any success. I have short &amp; fine white and black hair on my chin. I have noticed wrinkles around the upper lip &amp; I don't have many wrinkles at all for my age. Plucking has caused discoloration as well. Have been to several Drs. including Dermatologist, talked with Drs. about Lazer treatments which will not work on white hairs &amp; most of mine are white. I had test run to see if it was an inbalance of hormones. Dr. says it does not look bad and she does not notice it but &quot; I DO &quot;!!  Can't take a trip without tweezers, mirrow and bright light. It horrible and what's worse my 21 month old grand daughter was looking at my sons facial hair and looked at me and started to touch my chin. This really, really bothered me. I think she is aware of my facial hair at her age. Sorry this is so long. But I truly wish they could come up with something that would help all of us. The use of this product has not helped and am slowing down on the useage. Good luck to all of you that use it and am happy for those it has helped!!!!!!!

I saw results from Vaniqa after about 2 months and it worked great for the next 3 months or so.  Hardly any plucking and hardly any hair growth.  Then, the results gradually went away over the next 2 months or so.  I'm getting laser treatments starting next week and can't wait.

Pay close attention to your scalp. If you start seeing more scalp than you used to stop using the product. After 2 months of of using vaniqua my scalp started turning bright red in areas and it felt like someone was standing over me trying to lift me off of the ground by my hair. I am still having this pain after one month of not using Vaniqa. I am also now seeing a dermo who has prescribed liquid steriods to stop the pain, redness and hopefully start the growth again. Just as horrible the hair on my head has stopped growing. It's not falling out other than the usual 50 to 100 hairs a day. But my body is no longer replacing those 50-100 hairs in the hair growth cycle. pay close attention to your scalp. Had one of the risks said hair loss on the head I would never have used the product. hopefully after this stuff gets out of my system the hair will grow back.

I asked my doctor to write me a script. I religiously applied the cream twice daily - along with continual tweezing and then at 4 months everything (hair) disappeared completely!  I started using Vaniqa in November of 2007.  The embarrassment and wasted time was gone!!  Thank you! -I would like to know if there are some long term studies on this drug i.e. effectiveness over time/years, one application versus two a day (by changing chemical strength). -I confess, I have missed one of the applications every couple of months or so.

Eventually I noticed the hair on my head started thinning dramatically and turned to &quot;baby hair&quot;. Doc said she wasn't aware of that as a side effect. A couple of months ago I cut back to once daily usage to see the difference in facial hair. It's a little courser but not objectionable. The big difference is my sparse mane! All of a sudden it turned very soft &amp; I no longer need conditioner. My skin also turned soft; no lotion needed. And, my hair stopped the rapid thinning. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

I have had facial hair on my upper lip, chin and neck area for about 40 years.  I am 59 years old.  In addition to the black facial hair, I now have white facial hair in the upper lip, chin and neck area.  I have used this product for about 8 months now.  This product works on the black facial/chin/neck hair.  This product does not work on the white hair at all.  I will continue to use the product for now.

I have also noticed increased wrinkles around my lips.  I do not think it is as effective as it once was. Lastly, the price has not decreased in seven years!

Increased Facial Hair in a Woman	pratt6789,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		5/11/2011 2:14:22 PM	I am 51 and have been saddled with heavy, dark facial hair on my chin since I was in my twenties.  Have gone from plucking once a day every morning to twice a day and it was getting increasingly worse. I am fare skinned and tweezing has permanently discolored my chin area.  I went to my dermotologist who mentioned Vaniqa but didn't seem convinced it worked.  Two years later I was referred by an endocrinologist to a dermatologist from the Mayo Clini.  He immediately put me on Vaniqa and it has been nothing short of a miracle.  I noticed a difference within a matter of weeks.  I have now been on it for 11 weeks and am so thrilled.  The growth has nearly stopped, the hair still coming is lighter and less course and easy to remove. I am no longer get ingrown hairs.  This has been a game changer for me.  I was tweezing at least an hour a day and it was getting worse.  Now I wake up with almost baby soft skin.  As for price, I estimate I can get by with purchasing 3 - 4 30 gram tubes per year. I have a prescription card at Walgreens and one tube cost me $70.00.  Do yourself a favor, if you truly suffer from male-like facial hair, and buy this product.  I just hope its effectiveness continues!

I am wondering if this is an unusual side effect.

I have seen few reports from  users over 3 years and little data of follow-up clinical  trials.  My own experience after 5 years is somewhat disturbing...While it has been effective in managing hair growth, I developed excessive wrinkling on my upper lip after about 2-3 years which continued to get worse.  Despite the fact that I am 66,the rest of my skin is fairly smooth.This is not listed as a side effect--isolated?, related?--but again, the lack of data is a concern. Any long term users?

A girlfriend suggested shaving, but I have sensitive skin and shaving created all sorts of problems.  At-home waxing and depilatories were likewise too harsh.  Finally I went to my dermatologist, who prescribed Vaniqa.  Within two months the facial hair growth was substantially reduced.  However, I also noticed that hair growth on other parts of my body (under arms and on legs) was reduced as well, and I am beginning to wonder about the hair on my head!  In other words, the medication appears to be absorbed systemically, even though it is applied topically. I am just wondering if this stuff is doing anything to my hormones.
Increased Facial Hair in a Woman	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/17/2010 8:49:03 PM	This is a miracle drug, though no &quot;magic bullet&quot; - it does take awhile before you see results, so patience is needed.  I am a very light-skinned woman in my early 30s, and since my teens have suffered from dark, coarse hair on and just below my chin.  The hair is as coarse and dark as a man's beard!  The affected area was initially perhaps only half an inch across, but over the years has spread and is maybe 3&quot; x 3&quot;.  Prior to using Vaniqa, I would remove the hair in the morning and have stubble by the end of the day. I began using Vaniqa about 10 weeks ago, and religiously followed the application directions.  I saw slowed growth within about 8 days.  At this point, growth is extremely slow and much of the darkest hair is coming in fine and light.  I still shave every day (followed by &quot;buffing&quot; with a smooth away pad) but the shaving is quick and easy and I don't end up with a 5 o'clock shadow at the end of the day.  Even by the next morning I have barely any stubble and what I do have is more felt than seen.  I also tweeze the darkest hairs, which come out easily, with the bulb, and don't seem to return.  I am confident that with continued use my facial hair will almost completely disappear.The cons are that it IS expensive - I pay about 90 USD for one tube and most insurance plans do not cover it.  But, one tube lasts me 8 weeks, with twice a day use.  Considering what else I spend $90 on in a two-month time span, this is well worth it.  And I am not worried about having to apply it twice a day for the rest of my life - I routinely apply moisturizers twice a day, anyway, so this is really not a lot of extra work.

I see no change and wish I had spent the money towards lazer hair removal. This is just a temporary solution anyway if it would work. It certainly has not been the results they advertise.

The pharmacist at Long's said I would have to continue forever to see continued results; but I have to say after initally using it; I don't see results. I've been using it for some 5 months, and still have to shave my upper lip and chin. My chin being the worst area. I have a fair complexion, and the hair grows in dark and stubbly. I hate it, and have been dealing with this for years. I thought I found my answer to the problem, but must admit I am dissatisfied------------------Boo Hoo.

Although the hair was fine and I bleached it regularly, the moustache would actually show up in photographs.  I asked my dermatologist for Vaniqa and she warned me that it would take at least 8 months to see any difference.  She also told me that I would need to use some form of hair removal at the same time.  I never wanted to do that because, even when plucking the few really long hairs, they would grow back thicker and darker.  It is not a myth.  So I experimented with a depilitory cream on small patches of upper lip hair.  Sure enough, I now have a constant &quot;5 o'clock shadow.&quot;  I thought I had started to see a difference in hair growth when I started the Vaniqa, but since using the hair removal cream as well, I am convinced there is not efficacy to Vaniqa.  I am now 4 months into the Vaniqa.  If anyone has had similar experience, please weigh in with any advice on whether you would continue concomitant hair removal or to just let me know if I can expect improvement.  Thank you.

I know that sounds dramatic, but when you are fair skinned, and wake up everyday to a face full of black hair you need a dramatic change! The growth is much slower, I was using a cream which left my skin burnt, red, and painful everyday.  Now I use the smooth away thing you see on TV and vaniqa...wow what a difference.  It is expensive but when you figure the waxing, the creams, the pain it is worth it. I wish I had tried it a long time ago!

I still haven't found a job so I have not been able to get back on it. I have PCOS and a full beard. It is not covered by my insurance either. I was looking online for my mom at the Latisse thing, and there was a lot of talk about using online pharmacies from other countries. So I looked up this on all day chemist and they have it for only $18 however I do think that shipping is about twenty dollars. And I don't believe you have to have a prescription for it. I just thought that I would let everyone know about the price for this. Best of luck!

The reduction in facial hair being problematic has been remarkable! I find myself hardly having to pluck hairs anymore, which has dramatically  improved the quality of my life. I suffered for too long with unsightly hair and Vaniqa has not only retarded the growth of facial hair at an incredible rate, it has also been gentle to my skin and I can tell you that there have been no adverse reactions at all to Vaniqa. Another wonderful component to Vaniqa has been its compatibility with Meladerm, which I use as well. I started using these two products together 2 weeks ago and there  have been absolutely NO negative interactions between these products. The Meladerm continues to fade problems due to hyper-pigmentation while the Vaniqa has steadfastly been eliminating the need to pluck unwanted facial hair. I am thrilled with Vaniqa and highly recommend it to ANYONE who suffers with excess facial hair in a daily basis. Stellar product and it's also compatible with other products as well.Vaniqa has completely improved the quality of my life.
