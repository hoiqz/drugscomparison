I have found that different makers of the pill gives my pain a so so to good releif! I have had 2 total knee replacements and 1 has never healed right. I asked the doctor to take me of the Phentonyl(I know I spelled it wrong sorry) patch for the pain and he placed me on Loratab 10.5 with the Soma it has helped! I have been on this for 3 years. I don't like to be on medication but my pain gets to be a 9 out of 10 other wise. My back reaps the releif also due to disk issues.

But when u have extreme back spasm's nothing works more effective then soma. The side effects can make u nervous at first. Dizzy,slur speech,shakey,tired,hot flashes,etc. But once ur on it for awhile you over come those effects. ALSO VERY EASY TO OVER-DOSE ON [CAREFUL}

Simply put-this is the best drug there is for relaxing your spasms.  i love that it has a generic and i get it so cheap.  it helps me sleep and work 8 hours a day from a desk.

It has vastly improved my quality of life and my ability to keep up with my 3 young sons :) And as far as addiction i can see how some people would abuse it, but those people are screwing it up for people like me who really do need the medication. But overall I have to give it a 5 * rating

There were nights when i couldn't sleep at all from the pain. This drug has really helped me and its helped me to cut down on taking narcotics. I've been on lots of different meds from morphine to lortab and every know muscle relaxer in the world. For all those people who can only talk about it being so addictive and so bad, I think its probly helped more people than hurt. Maybe its not the drug thats their problem maybe its within themselves because as we all know any drug can be abused.

I have used this drug for over a year and it has been quite helpful.  I have had a fractured hip and broken pelvis for over 5 years and tend to favor one side while walking.  My right side started hurting and having spasms. I tried flexerol and Xanaflex nothing helped like the soma.

It is the only one that works for me. I have fibromyalgia, lupus, RLS, arthritis and severe chronic pain. My new medical coverage will not pay for this medication. I have tired several other muscle relaxers that they have told the doctor to prescribe and all of them have been worthless!! If I had to chose one of the medications that I am on, Soma would be the one that I would chose to take.  If patients would read the information that they get with their prescriptions and learn how to take the drug correctly, they would know how it works and the side effects that come along with it. Think about it... it is a muscle relaxer, it does not just relax the one muscle that hurts, it relaxes everything!!! It really bothers me that so many people abuse and misuse this medication. That is making it almost impossible for the ones of us that use it for its intended purpose to be able to get it. PLEASE take this and all medications responsibly!!! If you abuse this or any other drug, you are not only hurting yourself but you are hurting those of us that REALLY need this medication. I would be bed ridden most of the time if I could not take this medication.

Have taken it for 10 years and it helps me more that other anti-spasmodic drugs from neurologists.  I helps me stay flexible and rested when MS is trying to keep me from exercising and functioning. Some MDs are worried about abuse or addiction but I don't experience either.  I challenge the MDs to live with this disease and handle it with less effective drugs.

Other	samantha, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/9/2009 7:28:25 PM	I began taking this medication because I was in a car accident with severe whip lash. But because of taking this medication, I was able to relieve my migrains and only found this out by accident.  I do continue to take this medication 4 times a day as prescribed.  I never thought about taking more than prescibed. I think at first I may have felt dizzy but I didn't have the pain in my neck and shoulder.  I have taken it for so long and have not had a migraine in over 10 yrs.  This is documented at my doctors office as I do see the same doctor.  After taking this medication for 6 years I got shingles and this medication worked for the pain associated with the shingles as well.  The doctor gave me hydrocodon and it only made me very sick at my stomach, funny thing was I had the shingles for over a week with pain in my back, that it wasn't until my son saw the blisters did I go to the dr to see what it was. Now grant it the shingles would not have gotten so bad had I known what was causin that nagging pain but I would recommend this medication and know that it is only through abuse do rules get stricter; whether it's medication or wearing a seat belt. But when it comes to pain, each person is different, just like addiction; not all people have addictive personalities and nobody enjoys being in pain.

Now it does work well for spasm however, but the drug defiantly gives a 'feeling of well being'. Michael Jackson and Anna Nichole Smith were both on this drug. Do yourself a favor and try flexeril if you have problems controlling yourself in this area.

Finally I found a doctor more interseted in my health then his oppion. I have been on SOMA 350 for over a few years now and it is a wonder drug compaired to all the others I have taken. Even if some people have problems with a drug it should be my choice to try the drug and see if the side effects are better or worse then the cure!!!!!!!I will not stop taking this drug even if it is nolonger legal.

Of course you build up a tolerance and it does not work as well every dose which is a mystery to me.
Other	TMJ Sufferer, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/28/2009 12:40:19 PM	I've been using this for TMJ/TMD for approx. 30 days now.  For the first time in a LONG time, I can open my mouth and eat without pain.  It does NOT resolve the 'urge to clench' my teeth, as narcotics do (and are hard to get prescribed).  It does not 'dope me up', but if I take it on an empty stomach, I get slightly dizzy, so I just drink something, eat a little something, and/or move around, and it goes away.  The dizziness goes away within 30 minutes on its own anyway.  The knot at my jaw joint is around 75% less, while using this drug.  I do not get sleepy taking it, unless I am already tired.  I finally got a TMJ mouth guard, and by 30-days, had chewed two holes in it (while trying the Soma Rx, from my family physician).  The dentist is making a 'harder, thicker' mouth guard now.  Soma has not helped my neck/base of skull and back spasms.  I also suffer from RLS (moderate/severe), and Soma doesn't help much for that either.

Soma is the only thing that works for me. If I had to pick 1 drug out of all of I have taken, and currently take, Soma would be that 1. I have no side effects, and to me it is a wonder drug. I only wish that physicians here on the Island of Hawaii would realize that just because some people abuse and sell their prescriptions, those of us who &quot;take only as directed,&quot; shouldn't be penalized. That is to say, it is almost impossible to get a prescription. Drugs are created to alleviate certain conditions, and I think Soma is getting a bad rap. Shame on you who are making it hard for the rest of us who have a legitimate need for this R&amp;D marvel.

After four spinal surgeries and suffering Complex Regional Pain Syndrome/RSD, I needed it more than ever. I was taking 350 mg every 4 hours. I was also taking other pain medications and my usual drugs for heart and thyroid. I began fainting without warning. It didn't matter if I was being physically active or not. I would be feeling painful spasms and I would take the soma and within 20 minutes I'd faint, and one time I stopped breathing. After 4 years of this I stopped it abruptly and without doctors advice. I went through severe withdrawal. Alone in my bedroom. I thrashed around for 4 days. I thought I'd have a heart attack or stop breathing.Months later after being diagnosed with a rare auto-immune disorder called Sjorens.   I was in severe pain with my RSD and had no choice but to go back on it. Two pain specialists put me on it every 6 hours. It seemed to do better. After a year I was doing better so again I stopped it. My vision had gotten so bad I had to get glasses. Once I stopped soma it was clear again. My reaction time was back to normal. I could think and remember better and I was hungry and not so thirsty anymore.Many hospitals and doctor's are not prescribing soma anymore. FDA gives it a poor rating. It is too dangerous and addictive. I am glad that when I stopped it the second time, I had no withdrawal or side effects. 
Muscle Spasm	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	35-44	7/18/2009 12:01:38 AM	I have had numerous issues with my neck and back. I was in a severe car accident and have been prescribed soma 350 along with morphine. For me this med is much better than any narcotic pain reliever. I am able to sleep and it takes the pain level down more than the morphine. I hope others will be able to suggest this medicine to their doctors if injured I would have. It is simply the best option in my opinion for severe pain. Thank you for the people that created this drug it is a godsend.

Muscle Spasm	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/25/2009 1:11:12 AM	 Soma was much more effective than other muscle relaxants, giving relief in about 20 min of the first dosage. The only thing that one should be careful with  Soma, is the euphoric feeling it gives you. It's a wonderful drug but could be ADDICTIVE if not used correctly. I used it for about a week, daily, for a pinched nerve in my back and found that when I went off it I had really bad headaches as well as aches and pains in other parts of my body. So I decided to take it even after the pinched nerve was gone and found that I began to abuse the drug. I read some of the other reviews and it seems to depend on the individual, whether it's addictive or not. I found it to be very addictive and when I spoke to my dr about it she said that they are reclassifying it as a narcotic due to the several cases where people become addicted to the medication.

First, it is NOT like a qualuld as one person stated. I guess if you abuse them, you might think you're on street drugs. I thank God for this medicine. I have no insurance and am having a hard time being seen for my bulging dics (c6-7) pinched nerve other ailments due to a car accident. Take them right, and you'll have no problem. But as with any pill, know how this pill will affect you before doing anything that could cause you or someone else to get hurt.

My doctors given me Soma 350 4x per day now for 12 years. It doesnt take the pain away but it sure helps. I've had other doctors tell me to stop taking it and put me on junk like flexil, the pain was horrible. I also have high blood pressure and COPD. I know its a bit unorthodox but it has surely helped me live a less painful life.

I have had ten major back surgeries and muscle spasms are a constant pain.  soma works wonders, never take more than what is indicated as it will not only releave the spasm but make you look stupid for its effects are very good and too much makes one appear intoxicated.  just follow the directions and you will experiance tremendous relief.

When taken as directed, stretching, and excersise has been a great combination to keep the pain under control. In my opionion soma should only be taken for people who can take as directed, and only take when hurting, cause Ive heard they can be addicting. But they work very well for constant painful muscle spasms, and help lead a much better life then dealing with pain all the time! In my own experience its a good drug!

I have been given every muscle relaxer you could think of. Just 3 days ago my doctor gave me Soma 350 along with my Oxycodone for pain. My spine L-4/L-5 and T-10 are injured. BUT it was the constant leg pain and cold foot that was dibilitating. I took 2 Soma right before bed and 1/2 hour later, I was so relieved. I did feel sleepy so If I have to take it I take just a quarter during work. BUT!! I didn't have the pain level as I always did a 7 to 8. Now it is  on a scale from 1 to 10 a 4. A friend told me she suffered from the same problem and recommended I talk to my doctor. He had no problem prescribing me the Soma and taking me off Ambien and Diazipam. I sleep on Soma and feel soo much better. All though, I have noticed a bit of depression. The doctor told me it is because I'm not taking the Ambien or the Diazipam anymore and that is a normal side effect after taking them both for more than 8 years. But it will pass and I would rather have level 4 than level 8 pain any day. It worked find for me. I get through an 8 hour work day easier than I have in over 23 years. This new doctor is wonderful and with his exercise program I am hopeful again. Why didn't the other doctors think of this sooner. 23 years of my life in that pain, now my body does not know how to react to minimul pain. I consciously now try not to walk with a bad limp.

I had been going through decompression therapy for c-spine compression and nerve impingments, bone spurs, etc... The Somas worked pretty good as long as I took them along with a loratab or percocet but alone they only made me sleepy. Taking 2-350 mg @ once is a big mistake. To habitually do so would equal abuse. If I ran out of one med the other alone would have no significant pain relief value. Now the Dr.s think that when you tell them what works 4 U they assume Ur a drug seeker. Never had a dizzy episode or euphoric aura from a single Soma-350. A good short-term med for generally healthy and only minorly injured individuals who seldom take any drugs-OTCs or RXs.

Myself, I have a very high tolerance to any drug due to the fact that I've been on MAJOR pain relievers for a long time. So..I cant take just one soma. I have to take 3 or 4 for them to work at all. Sometimes I can get by on 2. The problem with that is, it's a drug that seems to affect (at least me and my husband) differently...like sometimes 3 will knock me on my butt, to where I can't even walk well. Other times, 3 will barely affect me...but when in that fog they sometimes put me in..its easy to take more without remebering you already took some....I've ALMOST but not quite overdosed several times. Unfortunately, my 13 yr old daughter has seen it too many times...when she's here, I try to keep it on the down-low, only take 2, but even that many, once in awhile, will knock me for a loop. I like it, it works for the pain, relaxes the muscles, BUT it's soooo unpredictable. I advise anyone to NOT take it until they're in bed and settled. and not ever around your kids.

Do not start taking this drug if you like the the effects of alcohol or are prone to be  addictive to things.           I almost died 2 nights ago. I started abusing this drug about a year ago, always taking 2 somas with a couple beers. My husband became very concerned as well as some friends and other family members. They all tried to stop me, but the high was just to good, and you often forget how many and when you took them.You also build a tolerance to them real FAST! After not taking them for a weak (when I got them refilled I would take them as fast as i could so i would always run out) When I finally recieved my refill I was so happy I took 4 or 5 somas with beer in a matter of maybe 5 hrs. I also had not ate anything that day which made matters worse. From about 6:30 to 8:30 pm I slowly went down. I was in a restaurant with my family, when my husband looked over at me, my eyes were half shut and I was drooling and my breathing was shallow. they called 911. I woke up @ 2am tied to a hospital bed with iv's stuck all over my arms. The worst part was that my 5yr old son had to witness the whole incident! I thank God i'm stil alive and well, I will NEVER take another soma as long as I live. I was not trying to kill myself, I just loved the high (I guess more than I loved my family at the time).PLEASE if you decide to use this drug be very careful, do not drink alcohol it becomes so addictive!!!!

I could not talk to the doctors do to the slered speech to tell them what was happening to me and when I took all that I could to explane to them what happened, they didnt beleive me. even though this med works well, be very I mean very carefull when using it.

I have lived with the pain all my life and these make it alot easier to get through the days.
Muscle Spasm	Murphy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/26/2008 12:29:27 PM	I have been successfully taking this medication for many years on an as needed basis for muscle spasm in back and legs.  This medication was recently refilled for me but it looked different, was made by a different manufacturer, and I had a very different reaction to it.  I was assured by the online pharamacy (mail order company) that it contained the very same ingredients.  Well something is very different in how I am reacting to this new refill.  The duration is hours, with fatigue, lethargy, and dizzy.  The previous prescription was a quick onset lasting about 20 minutes ( I would be sitting, reclining), had good muscle relaxation and then was able to get up and move about with motivation and lack of pain, it was great.  Has anyone else had this extreme experience of supposedly the same Soma 350 mg, but made by different manufactures with extreme different reactions?I know for a fact that something is very different.  Is anyone familiar with these two manufacturers: Vintage (Qualitest) vs.  Corepharma?  And why do they have to change from one to the other?  Please offer your experience and opinion.

Muscle Spasm	Sal, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	5	4	Female	55-64	9/16/2008 4:43:26 PM	I use this drug along with neurontin for an  essential tremor which affects the R side of my neck and back. I also have severe arthritis in the C-Spine which causes severe pain along with the twitching. Soma has been a wonder drug. I use it only as needed to be carefull not to become addicted but no more than 3 times a day

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/17/2008 12:07:23 AM	This is a wonder drug.  I have severe muscle tension in my neck which causes horrible headaches and I don't sleep.  Taking this medicine allows me to get the sleep I need and I wake up refreshed with no pain and no headache.  This should not be taken anytime other than bedtime.  I don't see how any doctor can say you can take this during the day.  It makes you really drowsy.
Backache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	7/24/2008 4:39:34 PM	I am recuperating from bilateral lumbar surgery and this is combination with vicodin has been a godsend.  I had horrible muscle spasms and pain in legs after surgery and this combo has made the pain barable and am able to walk for short periods.  
Muscle Spasm	Moses, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	45-54	6/18/2008 2:26:12 PM	I have taken this drug for Back Spasms due to a broken bone,(a congenial defect)in my lower back. It does work. HOWEVER, This is a very dangerous drug that is so easy to get prescribed. My wife got hooked on these and it was terrible. She was so incoherent on these that I was afraid she was going to kill someone in the car or get a DUI if she ever was stopped by the police.Slurred speech,passing out,unable to wake her,she couldn't even talk or communicate with any of the family.Taking this drug you cannot remember how many you have taken and easily OD on them. I took my wife to the ER and the Doctors acted like it was no big deal.They should have seen her sitting in the floor in the middle of a Bag of chips she spilled on the floor.She couldn't even hit her mouth or the Bag to get them off the floor! I tell you these are very addictive! She loves them, but it is destroying our Family! We have been through all the rehab and counseling and all that so don't go there. The FDA needs to take another look at this drug as it is so dangerous. While I am not an M.D. I know what I see. I had to meet with our Doctor to stop giving the RX. I was ready to get a Lawyer! BEWARE, I am from the 70's and when you take more than 1 of these it's like taking those Qualude's in the 70's. If you take more than 1 and drive and get pulled over by the Police,I assure you a DUI is guarateed! I CANNOT BELIEVE THESE DOCTORS DON'T KNOW THIS...DO NOT TAKE THESE IT IS NOT WORTH IT........

Backache	BookLover, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/12/2008 7:14:07 AM	This medication is so easy to use and so helpful that it becomes addictive VERY fast.  I am now in the position of fighting 10 years of addiction.  I would never do drugs, I only took these because I am a severe and chonic pain patient.  I write this because coming back from this drug is the hardest thing I have had to do and I don't want anyone else to have this problem, especially when it seems so benign, easy to use without side effects, and it helps the pain.  BEWARE, it's not worth it, it ruined my life.  I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news.  I know when you hurt you will try just about anything, but I beg you, don't try this, it isn't even close to worth it.  I am educated, from a good home, never have and never will do drugs so this can easily happen to anyone, even though it would be an accident!  Please at least talk to your DR.  Best wishes and be well!

I ALSO HAVE MY NECK FUSED AND THE SAME PROBLEM IN MY NECK AS WELL AS THE LUMBAR. UNFORTUNTLEY, MY SCIATICA NERVE IS GIVING ME GREIF. THE SOMA MAKES A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE ALONG W/THE OTHER PAIN MEDICINE I HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED. WHEN I TAKE THE MED.'S AS DIRECTED AND AVOID DOING THE THINGS MY NEUROLOGIST TELLS TO ME DO I FEEL BETTER. UNFORTULEY I WILL BE ON MY MED.S PERMANTLEY.
Other	bgreen34, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	4	Male	25-34	11/28/2007 1:14:01 AM	I don't see why people get hooked on it; I can go for months without a single dose and I am fine.  I will be in pain, but fine as far as I'm not doctor shopping to get it.  I worry more about Lortabs and such being addictive than I do Soma.  I am actually going to ask about Soma+Codeine when I go back to my oain doctor, it would kill two birds with one stone.
Muscle Spasm	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	19-24	11/18/2007 11:23:35 AM	Slightly addictive. But it really helped my condition. Believed to be a pinched nerve or siactica. I would occacionally hit the floor out of nowere. With combining Soma, Mobic, and a Chiropractor that Does NOT happen anymore. Although the pain is still there (not quite as bad) I am happy because I cannot afford better treatment. Like the MRI to even get started. It's got to be healthier than Pain Killers.
Other	25-34 Female  (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	11/17/2007 10:09:38 PM	I don't use this drug, but I have a family memeber that does. It is very addictive &amp; I wished this never came on the market. This drug makes her have slurred/slow speech &amp; very slow movement. Also, it makes her very forgetful. She is so dependent on this drug that she will get angry if she runs out. I hate this drug very much!!!

Other	35-44 Female 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	10/23/2007 3:58:32 AM	I was not given this medicine but I do have a comment about it. People are misinformed about this drug, it is highly addictive and addicts do seek this one out. I am experiencing this with an addict right now and I feel that people should be properly informed. I am very angry that this drug is even on the market and so easily given by most doctors when they do not know a patients drug use history!
