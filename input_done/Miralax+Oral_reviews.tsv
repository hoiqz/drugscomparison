I was satified with the relief from constipation. However, I developed life effecting dehydration causing excessive fatigue, headaches, lower back pain and muscle aches. I read that these laxitives can cause electrolight imbalances. I have stopped taking Miralax. I am in process of increasing hydrating and rebalancing electrolights. I hope I feel better soon. This has really negatively effected my productiveity. It has been scary.

My life before Miralax was miserable.  Hard stools, hours in the bathroom, and many days between bowel movements.  It got so bad that I would actually black out when the pain got so bad.  I hope Miralax never goes away.  I've tried every other stool softner, fiber supplement, etc.  They taste bad, and have no impact. Miralax mixes easily into my morning hot tea or juice.

She was having green diarrhea for months, as the background for her GI problems, and we put her on this for a day and it got worse. Then later on that evening, we had to take her to the emergency room because she had an allergic reaction to it. I would never use this again and the &quot;wonderful&quot; doctors at her GI office are treating me like a moron and saying that having a reaction to this medication is impossible. Obviously not!

The first 6 weeks were a nightnare.    Icouldn't leave the house bowels were crazy and had cramps even wwhen I stopped going.  With my type of ibs doctor said anyother laxative would be too strong for me.  I couldn't find the right dosage and was going too much or not enough  I actually kept a log too figure out the right dosage .   Drove my family crqzy thank god they are understanding.  Now I take half a cap every day and so far so good.  Cramps are much better and I pray that it atay this way.  ONe Problem I still have is still lots of gas around 8-10 pm so now i am afraid to go out at that time.  Hopefully it will get better and I will have my life back. MY family says my mornings are better and they are optimistic about the nights.  so I pray to god that my nights get better and I can live my life without these limitations.    goodluck to all.

As I aged, it became worse.  Finally, I told my doctor that I could not go on like this with passing little hard marbles as a stool.  Even fiber did not completely help.  I have been taking Miralax for two years and it has absolutely changed my life.  Once in a great while I go a little too often, but rarely.  I eat fiber (a must) and am so relieved.  If you are suffering, talk to your doctor and try it!  I take a little over a tablespoon daily in water mixed with a little fruit juice.  How simple!  Oh, and you absolutely MUST drink plenty of liquids throughout the day.

An X-Ray reveled I was severely constipated. My Dr. prescribed Miralax to be taking every day. It helped alleviate my constipation. As a Quad, I rely on a Bowel management program to keep me regular. The problem now is the Miralax is working to well. Almost every day I have an accident because my bm is so soft it comes out at unknown time. Im getting ready to talk to my doctor about scaling back how often I take it, because this is just as bad or worst then when I was constipated all the time. At least then I didnt worry about being in public and having an accident with no warning.

I took it with no real progress for 3 days, but on the 4th day I finally started having normal bowel movements! I did not experience any side effects whatsoever as you do with laxatives. (No diarrhea, gas, bloating,sudden urgency etc.) I finally had complete relief! Also, I mixed Miralax with cranberry juice. It had virtually no taste and dissolves completely. I highly recommend this to anyone suffering from constipation!

Dr. recommended I take 1 capful every day and have been doing this for 3/4 of a year. He says it is harmless for extended use. Miralax (and generic versions) works well, except my movements are now ridiculously huge (really long soft stools that completely void rectum and transverse colon) and a bit scary. Have settled into 1 bm per day, but since there is a LOT of strong gas, it is difficult to do this in a public or workplace bathroom -- a definite problem that needs planning for every day. Have lately had a lot of sleepiness and a spacey feeling in my head -- might be electrolyte balance is off, or might be unrelated to Miralax. Wish I knew if extended use is really safe.

Also, YOU MUST make sure that you mix it, THOROUGHLY side effects get worst. I've started taking 500mg of Magnesium daily(no more than 500)and this works wonders! I also use citrucel in tablet form which helps to bulk like fiber. Occasional use of Miralax is fine, but it is not a long term daily solution, it will cause pockets of gas and constant bloating. Also a glycerin suppository will occasionally get things moving if your problem is at the very end like hemorrhoids or swollen tissue.

Incomplete or Infrequent Bowel Movements	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	1/23/2011 8:55:48 AM	My experience has not been a good one with Miralax.  I've dealt with severe constipation for a long time now so my doc prescribed it for me.  It worked in the first few days and was very easy to put into my coffee/juice, but caused swelling of my face and ankles and feet.  I experimented with it to make sure it was he Miralax that was causing this, and it definitely was.  When I stopped taking it, the swelling went away.  The worst part was it made my stomach also swell to look as though I was pregnant.  I'm not sure why this happened other than Miralax is supposed to cause water to go into the colon to help with constipation, but I have been diagnosed with 'leaky gut syndrome' and think maybe this is how the water escaped from the colon and into everywhere else.  I've seen many blogs where it has worked wonders for lots, but think people with leaky gut should know this and try a different product.

In the last 2 years he had become withdrawn and quiet and just not quite himself. We thought it was because of his bowel problem but also noticed learning problems surfacing, attention and not focusing. My daughter read on-line a post about Miralax being involved with side effects similar to the ways her son was acting, So she took him off the Miralax in August of 2010. When we saw them at Christmas, it was like seeing a new child! He was alert, out going, happy, attentive and focused. My daughter said he's doing very well in school and seems to have come out of his shell, so to speak. I notice a significant difference in him and believe the Miralax WAS causing him to act the way he was. They need to put more warnings on the bottle for long term use, longer than 2 months! Please do that, MIRALAX, and save these little ones from Permanant damage, as well as the elderly, that use this medication frequently and for long terms.

I have had no pain meds, and therefore could not understand when I developed a serious digestion problem.Due to problem, gastroenterologist put me on MiraLax, a double dose. I took it for 4 months, and then started having bizarre, troubling thoughts very unlike myself, horrible pictures/day terrors including suicidal urges. I have been off Miralax for 10 days and am seeing an improvement, however the effects are not completely gone and nights are horrible. It has scared my wife for my safety, and in researching she found it listed on FDA as being watched for &quot;neuro-psychiatric events&quot;. I realize there are few instances where it does this, however, one death is too many.  I have since found a recipe for an organic concoction that really works and am still seeing doctors to identify the problem with the digestion while using the fruit brew to help with chronic constipation, and it really takes care of it. I am wondering if anyone else has had psychiatric reactions/depression/suicidal thoughts while using  miralax.

It is not habit forming as some people believe; you can take it when you need it.  In my opinion this is my miracle drug! Before I knew about this medicine it felt like I was passing ROCKS through my intestines and not stool softeners, laxatives or fiber drinks were effective They only made things worst with the horrible side effects.  Miralax has no side effects.  I mix it with a glass of orange juice and I drink half and my son drink the other half. I believe the reason children and adults alike have the problem of chronic constipation is because of our diets that are packed with so much unnatural chemicals and preservatives and OTC drug and prescription drugs that people take with a sip of liquid dehydrate our bodies. Also, If people drink soda then they are not getting enough water a day which adds to the constipation problem.  I know I have to remind my son to stop playing and go get a drink of water. Anyway, I've had this problem all my life and Miralax is the only thing that works.

I have been on several different medications, laxatives, over-the-counter treatments, and diets. Luckily, I had the opportunity to use Miralax, and it has been the most effective treatment for me. I occasionally have the side-effect of bloating, but that is about it, no stomach cramps or pain. I can usually get away with taking a dose once every week or week and a half. I don't know what I would have done without this, it has been effective and I have had less side-effects from it than some other treatments.

Miralax has returned my bowel function to normal after years of fighting with constipation (for unknown reason).  I recommend Miralax freely to others, and it comes in a little bit cheaper generic form now at Wal-Mart.

My system had stopped working gradually. I would have a bowel moment, but then I couldn't finish. The bowel momemt would be incomplete. I figure, like everything else, my body would eventually fix itself without taking any medicines. Well, it didn't work &amp; it eventually got worse. I guess me freaking out didn't help any. Up until now, I've have been healthy. I have never taking any medications at all. I'd barely take Advil for headaches, so dealing with this issue has turned my upside down taking everything from senekot to stool softeners to milk of magnesia. After tryin' them, I found that Milk of Magnesia works quickly, which I know it's not good for your system. I would go back &amp; forth between Magnesia &amp; stool softens, yet taking them every other day. Mind you, I'm not very consistent taking these meds, which probably could be my problem. Miralax has been &quot;haunting&quot; me to give to another try. When I tried it the first time, I felt so bad that I felt like I was dying; headache, heart beating fast, sweats, bloating. It did work a little, but I don't think I stuck with it long enough to be &quot;my miracle&quot; or drank enough water with it. I really &amp; truly want Miralax to work for me 'cause I heard so many good things about it. I'm just scared to feel that same feeling from the last time, but something has to work better than what I'm doing. I know that this is not a &quot;support group,&quot; but is there any way I can find an online support system for my health condition? Or to even start one?

He started using Miralax at the age of 2 1/2 yrs old because of constant constipation. It helped for a very short time. Then his constipation got worse. I kept taking him back to see his pediatrican and he advised me to keep using the Miralax, so I did. Last year, we switched pediatricians and his new pediatrician sent my son to see a pediatric gastroentronologist. They did test after test trying to find out why my son has been constantly constipated for 4 years. As it turns out, it was nothing really to do with him and his anatomy. I took him off the Miralax that he has taken everyday for the past 4 1/2 yrs, and now my son has absolutely no problem with the constipation anymore. The Miralax was the problem all along. I think it would be ok to use for a very short period of time, but I would NOT recommend use for any long periods of time. My poor boy went through alot of unnessisary hell because of this stuff!!!
Other	NavalGurl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	1/8/2010 6:55:40 PM	Was prescribed Miralax by my Dr 2 substiture for large dosage of Senna (in combo w/ docusate sodium) I had been using 2 combat constipation associated w/ scar tissue &amp; adheasions from Endometriosis &amp; the fact that I am also on oral morphine for pain control. Additionally, I have GERD &amp; a Thyroid condition. Had some relief w/ this product, but had 2 experiment w/ dosage levels &amp; never got 1 that did not include diarrhea accidents combined w/ constipation. In 1 episode, it took nearly 3 wks to the day 2 have ANY movement at all &amp; then it was several BMs cumulating in 24 hrs of diarrhea. During 4 months of using this product I experienced SEVERE cramping, bloating, nausea, dizziness, gas gurgling &amp; stomach cramps so bad (reminding me of when I had colonitis) that I had 2 take 2 my bed w/ a heating pad on my stomach. Something I've not had 2 do since my Endo was active. In all the years I've had infrequent bowel movements, I NEVER experienced these types of stomach pains or cramping. I quit this product nearly 4 wks ago &amp; went back 2 my previous regime, but w/ lower Senna dosage, &amp; am still feeling like I have yet to get all the Miralax out of my system. Still have alternate days of nausea &amp; stomach cramps. The gas gurgling has yet to stop. If I were employed right now I'd have been calling in sick more than 50% of the time. These side effects are considered &quot;common&quot; to &quot;Infrequent&quot;, but in each case &quot;less severe&quot;; however, I agree w/ the Reviewer who stated they thought they would die. Unfortunately, the V.A. will not consider other products, such as Align, due to the expense. My previous regime had actually worked quite well, but I had asked my primary physician to prescribe the Senna (from the V.A.) as I could no longer afford it OTC. When she learned how much Senna I took (as recommended by the Pain Control Pharmacist), she switched me to the Miralax due to concerns about Senna's effect on the Heart. I will never touch this stuff again. Exceedlingly dissatisfied.

Other	sherhere, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	12/24/2009 3:02:28 PM	I've been on Miralax for approx 2 yrs. It was like an OTC miracle. I have severe, painful impactions(or spontaneous evacuations). Miralax (Rx by DR)worked wonders. No more impactions and for those 2 years I felt almost 'normal'. Was no longer afraid to leave my home. Now it seems to be less effective...I am not having a 'daily' BM and I swear, I can smell Miralax when I perspire. I have trouble itching in my pelvic area.I've tried to solve the itching every way I know (stop other meds, etc. I'm taking pain meds and must have something or I'm back to the impactions!) I know I'm describing 'allergy' but if I stop Miralax,and have the insueing problems, I'm facing a colostomy or more years of being house-bound. Does anyone out there have any similar problems? Any solutions that work for you? I'm wondering what happens to our bodies when we take Miralax for a prolonged period of time.I've read bits and pieces about even removing salt from our brain!I would appreciate some feedback if you understand where I'm coming from.Thanks.

I also had such serious chest pain in the eveing for over 45 min. while I was trying to cook, I was about to call an Ambulance to rule out a possible Heart Attack.I am now undergoing Cardiac Tests to make sure I don't have a Cardiac Problem.My GI Doc. doesn't think it was the Miralax, but since I stopped it, this - the serious chest pain has not re- occurred.Wondering if anybody else has experienced chest pain that bad.Thanks.J.

I am taking hydrocodone 10 mg/500 tylenol and have to take something for constipation due to this pain medication.  It works well most of the time.  Sometimes I have to miss a day or two because of too many bm's, and have learned to make adjustments.  Don't know what I would do without this medication.

I used it once for like 4 days, and then I could go for a whole month without taking more.  Then again I needed it another time.  I got so sick.  My stomach cramped up so bad, I thought I was gonna die. no lie.  Almost called emergencey room, but I held strong, and by the morning, the pain was done.  I went, but at what cost?  I promised myself I woudlnt eat anything ever again to avoid that pain,  but you know that is not possible.  I have to take it now for like 4 to five days straight to even get a movement, and then it only works for one day.  That miracle that happenned the forst time, Never aghian.  What is whith this stuff?  I'm confulsed.  I think it's the genereic form that is not working right.  One time I hit the end of a bottle once, I'll bet all the medicine dropped to the bottom, that was the time I almost went ot the emergency room.  I went, buyt man was it terrible experience.  I wish it worked like it did first time.  I just think my body is so sensitive to anything new, it get' s used to it so fast, and bang, never again.  I don;'t even use it much and still it wont' work like the first time.  I'm really confused.  anyone else have that happen to them?  I'm curious, so many of u seem to be so happy with it.  Tell me though.  How long do u have to take it for it to work, and how often do u take it.  ?  Is it something u take on a constant basis? Thanks .Constipation sucks.  Drink lots of water, lots, eat lots of veggies and fruit and no matter what, even if u do that n u on a lot of pain meds, forget about it, u in trouble like me.  Although when I also exercised on a regular I went better but not comfortably.

Miralax did help with the constipation however was not worth the side effects of pain and looking like she was 4 months pregnant.  Important to mix product thoroughly - our doctor said to stir for FIVE minutes (was advised of this after first few days of instant bloating)  Very frustrating experience - was on for a total of 2 weeks - started taking Amitiza today - so expensive $300/month and concerned about potential side effects - however could not remain on Miralax any longer.

I got fair results while I used the product for 10 days. I increased my water and juices intake to help move things along. But after being off the colon cleanse for about a week, things were getting sluggish again. After another week I was back where I started before the colon cleansing program. After a few more weeks, my colon was blocked on the left side in the sigmoid colon region. I was cramped, very uncomfortable, sluggish and getting headaches. Things were stuck, so I called my doctor and left a message on his exchange that my colon was blocked and I didn't know what to do. In less than 5 minutes he returned the call and told me to describe my symptoms. He then told me to get to the pharmacy ASAP and pick up a small bottle of Miralax, a laxative I hadn't heard about. He told me it works differently than Metamucil or Ex-Lax, a tasteless powder, and it used to be a prescription product. He also told me GI specialists have patients use Miralax to cleanse the colon for colonoscopy.So Immediately I got to the pharmacy and picked up the Miralax, got home and poured a caps worth dose that I stirred into 1/2 glass of organic prune juice and 1/2 purified water. I drank it down, but honestly didn't think anything positive was going to happen. But that evening I got the bathroom urge and then a miracle happened. I had a massive comfortable cleansing and could literally feel the relief of the pressure in my left side where I was blocked up.I learned my lesson and went to the market and bought all fresh fruits and veges I could get in the car. For 3-4 days all I ate and drank were quarts of purified water, oatmeal with cooked apples, juices, salads, grapes, cherries, baked potatoes with olive oil, corn on the cob. No wheat, breads, sugars. And I took the Miralax everyday and got my gut healing and back in shape!

If you are concerned about the cost try buying in bulk, I was previously purchasing the Miralax (30 Doses, 510 Grams) for about $18.99 but then I went to Sam's Club and was able to purchase 2 at that size for a total of  $27.00!!!!

I get bloated and crampy at times now but mildly compared to before and not real often. I take 17gms 2 X per day. I have never found anything else that helped. I have the constipation type of IBS and it really, really helped me. I hope this will help others who have tried everything else. Why not give it a try?

I had taken every kind of laxative and also had an enema to no avail I had to go to the er for an impacted bowel and they recomended miralax. I have taken it for4 months and I am normall!! The only worry I have is that I don't know if it makes me lose weight!!!

I finally have a medicine that works!!! I LOVE IT!!!! THANK GOD!!!! My doctor prescribed this the last time I had to go to the ER for fecal impaction. After being cleared out she prescribed when it was over the counter. I have been taking for a little over a year now with great success!!! Down side I was told I would have to take for the rest of my life twice a day but I have already downed the dose to an as needed basis. I believe in the power of prayer so I have been praying that eventually I won't have to take at all. I also recommend Beyond Fiber Super Seed that you can find at a health store for people that want an organic remedy. My sister was pregnant and was extremely constipated but I was scared to share the Miralax and I gave her the Super Seed and after 5 minutes she was able to go.

I HAVE SUFFERED FOR YEARS BEFORE I WAS TOLD ABOUT MIRALAX. I TRIED MANY DIFFERENT STOOL SOFTNERS,LAXATIVES AND NONE WORK AS WELL AND WITHOUT SIDE EFFECTS. I MIX MINE WITH A GLASS OF ROOT BEER IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE TASTE OR THE TEXTURE. I CAN'T BELIEVE I SUFFERED FOR SO LONG BEFORE I FOUND MIRALAX.TRY IT YOU WILL BE SO PLEASED WITH IT'S RESULTS.

I still go between two and three days in between bowel movements. It has made it somewhat easier to have a bowel movement. I still go longer in between bowel movements than was normal to me. The doctor said my constipation is secondary due to the meds I take. I hope I get more frequent bowel movements.

My doctor said I could use it daily.  No side effects and I'm very sentsitive to some other meds and have some food allergies.  I started with a half dose then worked to a full dose a day ever morning. I'm now going up to 3 times a day, where before it was maybe 3 times a week and uncomfortable. I feel sooo much better!

The OTC can be very costly.  I am being patient to use this treatment and think in time it will help.  I am on so many drying meds that this is the only thing close to working without pain.  I hope this has been of some help to you.

I took it for at least two weeks. I had a bowel movement for the first 5 days at least twice a day. No diarrhea. afte 5 days it stopped working. Mixed the powder with a 8 ounce glass of juice. Originally effective. But after a week no results at all.

I have noticed I have a headache since starting the medication don't know if that has anything to do with the meds or not I do have bloating and gas.. I am going to give it some more time before I give up completely.

No other laxative worked for me, except Milk of Magnesia. Since I have been taking MiraLax, I can depend on a daily BM.  No side effects, so far.  Love it and would definatlt reccomend it.

Incomplete or Infrequent Bowel Movements	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	2/23/2008 1:21:37 PM	I have been using Miralax for at least 3 or 4 years now, due to chronic constipation from pain meds, (and 2 hemmoroid surgeries), it was the &quot;miracle dust&quot; for me. I have never had any bad side effects until now.  For the last 2 months I have been having chronic diarrhia, with no other symptoms.  Now I see on this site, that Miralax can cause it due to overuse. This is bad news for me, although last month, I backed off of the Miralax and seemed to get better. What a roller coaster ride! Overall, I think this product has saved my life, and my bottom!

Their claim of non bloating, non gas etc. was not the case for me. I had terrible bloating, and rancid gas, and it was almost constant. My BM's were different than they've ever been, not looking or smelling the same. I was miserable. I quit taking it, and would rather live with the constipation. Nothing seems to work for me.

I was expecting to have to &quot;clean out&quot; by using another drug, called &quot;Go Lytely&quot;, but when my nurse came in with this powder and a glass of ginger ale...I felt more at ease.  It was a choice of having something like 3 ounces of powder in 12 ounces of ginger ale, as compared to about a quart or so of Go Lytely, and I have a weak stomach anyways.G

I did not realize at first it was the laxative. AFter taking it I would bloat up and get a bad headache. Then I would break out in horrible sweats, experience extreme lower back and leg pain. Every muscle in body felt like I had been beaten and I would be so weak it would take a couple days to get my strength back. Just because it is OTC does not mean your body can handle it!

WE did a clean out as the doctor prescribed and it wroked.  She feels so much better.  Now just take it once a week to keep things moving. (As for previous commenter - talk to doctor about mineral oil. Little ones can hold it in because it hurts to go. Mineral oil is not abosorbed by the body and makes it easier to go.)

EVERY TIME I'VE USED IT SINCE HE'S BECAME ILL HE BECOMES PUFFY. I WONDER, DID THE MIRALAX SOMEHOW BRING THIS CONDITION ON? HE WAS PERFECTLEY HEALTHY BEFORE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME CONSTAPATION. HE'S BEEN SICK FOR THREE MONTHS NOW. HE USED THE MIRALAX FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO GETTING ILL.
