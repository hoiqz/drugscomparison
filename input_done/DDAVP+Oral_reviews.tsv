Diabetes Insipidus	Sam, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	9/28/2012 12:52:57 PM	I was diagnosed with DI a year ago and started with the nasal spray. I wasn't convinced that the spray always worked so switched to tablets. After several changes in the dosage I think we've got it right now. I felt like I'd got my life back. Now I am wondering if it is changing my mood as I am feeling depressed.
Bedwetting	Shelley, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	9/5/2011 5:01:18 PM	My daughter (9) has been on this for more than 2 years. She is using the  nasal spray, 1 squirt each night. No bedwetting unless she forgets to take it. My concern is she has gained weight in the last 2 years and am not sure if its from this medicine or not. Are there any other alternatives to bedwetting than desmopressin??
Bedwetting	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	5/12/2011 9:43:28 AM	My son,11, has taken this med for over 6 months.  He was dry from day 1 with just one pill.  We did not 'take a break' after a couple of months as directed by the md.  About 2 months after beginning this treatment, he became very irritable, angry and prone to explosive episodes of frustration and aggression, even hitting himself in the forehead with his fist.  We started behavior therapy and I took him off the drug 8 days ago.  He has been dry every night since, and his mood has improved to the point where he has stopped hitting himself and is much less irritable, more like a normal 11 year old boy!  We will keep him off for another week or two and watch his mood and behavior and talk with his md and therapist before deciding whether the drug is to blame for the episodes.  Hope this is helpful.

Bedwetting	Mom of 10 year old boy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	2	2	1	Female	45-54	4/5/2011 11:36:37 AM	My son was on this medication for a year... with mixed results. I took him to the urologist at Childrens Med Center WA, DC. and was told NOT to use this medicine, it was put on the FDA black box list, AND was told by the doctor that 80% of the children they see are merely DEHYDRATED.. and DON'T need medicine, they merely need to drink 8 oz of water and then pee and continue that throught he day. The doctor stated the bedwetting is a function of their stools not passing due to their dehydration. The next day, and every day there after for the past 3 years, he has been drinking his water, peeing, and NO MORE BED WETTING. Doctors should be sued for presribing this medicine, when a simple solution (drink fluids and pee) is the answer...  I hope this helps every Mom out there, who is tired of cleaning bed linens. I learned about the water drinking issue when my son was 10.. All pediatricians should know this simple solution, drink water and pee. 
Bedwetting	7-12 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	3	3	Female	7-12	2/9/2011 12:00:37 PM	My daughter is 7 years old and we just started last night on 3 pills because 1 and 2 did not work.  She was dry this morning so we will see. :)  My question is if anyone has experienced drastic mood changes or obsessive behaviors from their kids while on this medication?

The doctor told us about this drug but said it works beeter on kids age 6 and up, we got the doctor to give it to us at age 5, we started with 1 pill and still had wetting we increased it to 2 still wetting, when we gave him 3 pills a night NO MORE BED WETTING! It was a mircle drug for us he used it for a year after that, we decresed to 2 pills and still had sucess. By age 7 we would do 1 or 2 pills if he had a late night sports practice or game in which he drank a lot other regular nights we just watched the fluid intake after dinner and he went to bed with no pills and did fine. He is now 9 and I can't remeber the last time we used them. This medication was the best thing that happened to our family, we all started getting a good night's sleep and waking up refreshed ready to start the next day! We never experienced any side effects and he never complained about taking the medicine. It is a huge boost to be able to sleep at a friends house and not have to tell them you are a bed wetter. I say try this medicine for yourself before you make up your mind from these reviews.

I was having to get up during the night every 2 hrs at least and was drinking somewhere around 10-12 litres of fluid a day. Had to be icy cold fluids as well. Taking the mess has been a great relief even though the amount I take still needs adjusting. I currently take 3 a day and although not perfect it is a vast improvement. Had brain surgery 2 weeks ago so that's caused some problems and thrown things out of whack (not enough fluids, nil by mouth) but generally I'm very happy with it.

Once we started the ddavp she hasn't wet the bed once. She takes the lowest dose, just one pill. It is wonderful and she is a much happier child.
Diabetes Insipidus	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/22/2009 12:34:19 PM	I had a rathke's claft cyst, that after was removed I developed diabetes insipidus. Had a problem for 4 yrs with exccessive thrist and urinating. Became pregnant &amp; problems became worse. In a 24 hr period I drank about 3 gallons of liquid &amp; urinated about 2 1/2 gallons. Endocrinologist started me on DDAVP and problems became better. I take it at night and longer get up 2-3 times to use the bathroom. Sleep all night! Worked great for me!!

All i can say is that they are awful. They take way longer to work whereas the nasal spray is instant relief . Trust me people if u have to buy this medicine get the non refridgerated nasal spray it is so much better and more economically priced as their are generic atlernatives out there.

Bedwetting	justjulie, 7-12 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	3	1	Male	7-12	11/9/2008 8:18:48 PM	My 11 year old son took this medication for 2-3 months and had only 1 dry night. Not work the risk to his kidneys so we stopped it.  We just started a new drug tonight after being drug free for several months with no relief.  I would skip this one.
Bedwetting	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	6/20/2008 10:55:47 PM	My son took this for about 7 days and then started feeling faint and would just lay on the floor and couldn't get up.  I took him off after the 2nd day of his faintness.  It was pretty scary to watch.  The drug did stop the bedwetting after the 2nd day of taking it but it's not worth the risk to see an 11 year old healthy boy faint like that.

Then I found out about the pills and I like taking those better.It was just easier with the rest of my meds.
Bedwetting	7-12 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	1	3	1	Female	7-12	12/4/2007 10:11:43 PM	My 7 yr. old was put on this medication and it did not help his bedwetting.  It should be out there that the FDA put out a worning about this medication.  This is from the YAHOO website.  The Food and Drug Administration said it has received 61 reports of seizures, two of which were fatal, among patients taking desmopressin, a drug that lowers the amount of water eliminated in urine. The agency said the drug can sometimes lower the amount of sodium in patients' blood to dangerous levels, causing the seizures.Desmopressin is sold by several companies, including privately held Ferring Pharmaceuticals, under names such as DDAVP, DDAVP nasal spray and DDAVP rhinal tube.The FDA has requested manufacturers to change the labeling on the drug's nasal-drop formulations to no longer recommend use for bedwetting, as children may be especially susceptible to dangerously low sodium levels. The proposed revised label would also state that desmopressin should no longer be used by patients with a history of sodium deficiency.The drug is still approved to treat excessive thirst, urination and dehydration caused by injury, surgery and certain medical conditions.Labels on desmopression tablets, the FDA says, should also advise patients to stop using the drug if they experience vomiting, diarrhea or other conditions that lower fluid levels.The agency said all forms of desmopressin should be used carefully by patients taking drugs that cause them to drink more, including antidepressants.This is a medication that I am glad my son had been taken off of about a month ago.

Diabetes Insipidus	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	9/23/2007 1:01:15 AM	I have to use the bathroom very frequently. Sometimes I've gone once and then was able to go immediately following. This is a very effective drug. It will reduce frequency by a vast amount. I'd say about 50%. It also allows you to hold your blatter better. Instead of feeling like you have to pee as bad as you do when you just wake up, its just a minor feeling. A side affect of this drug is that, while it does help reduce the frequency, the feeling that you need to go to the bathroom does not go away completely. All in all, its a great drug and it helps a lot. I have not yet noticed a reduced effectiveness, but my usage has been sporatic. I will also add that, while I don't know all the medical facts, I was told that if you take in too much fluid while on this drug, you can be put into a coma; though, this might be specific to diabetes insipidus.
