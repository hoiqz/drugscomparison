Previously my resultant spasms were treated with narcotic pain medications. Feeling frustrated that I was unable to be up on my feet for short periods of time, I dug out my Amrix ER. This has made such a difference in my stamina. My spasms started from my low back up into my neck. Amrix has made a total change in my symptoms. I do experience a bit of drowsiness, but feel like I have gotten part of my quality of life back. Granted, I have a high tolerance for pain, but I firmly believe in this medication for the treatment of back spasm symptoms.

I have 2 bulging discs in my neck and this is the only thing that has helped enough to where I don't have to take pain pills everyday (I have pain 24/7) but this helps to where I can deal with it most days. I still have bad days from time to time but those are the days I combine Amrix with my pain meds. I take it at night &amp; don't have any trouble getting up. It is very expensive (not sure why) but I'm on workers comp so they have to pay for it Thank God cause I def could not afford it on my own. I can only say good things about this medication.

I had little or no relief until my neurologist added Amrix 30 mg to my regime. This is the miracle drug I have been searching for!! I still get my headaches but they now respond to the migraine meds (triptans) and are less frequent. The ONLY side effect I experience is dry mouth. It is very expensive...I am anxious to try the generic form. If it does not work I will pay for brand name. It has made a huge difference in my quality of life!

I do take Imitrex for the migraines but needed something for the muscle spasms. The doctor prescribed Amrix ER and it worked great! I felt a little quiet and tired but as long as it continues to work I can deal with my almost non-existent side effects.

I was shocked at the fast effectiveness, lack of side affects and overall great way this med did what it was suppose to do. This is my go to pill for severe pain. No more stacks of pain pills I can't take. This was given to me by a pain specialist. I'm so sensitive to med's. This is my miracle in a bottle. Only took since 1983 to get the right one.

I take a medication to help me get to sleep, but it doesn't keep me asleep for more than an hour or two.  Once I fall asleep now, the Amrix keeps me asleep for 6 to 7 hours.  The only problem is that I feel sleeping in the morning, but that is cured by getting up and getting going.

Flexeril worked well also.  Flexeril 10MG @ 3 pills a day would have been fine costing me $4.00 copay.  This medication in extended release form of 2 15MG capsule per day cost $619.99.  I think doctors should be informed of the cost of different medications that do the same job.  The medication was still in the Mfg. packaging

I was completely non functional the whole day and went back and forth between spinning uncontrollably and passing out. Luckily my husband was home to watch the kids. I am writing this almost 24hrs since i took the pill and I am still spinning and nauseous. waiting to desperately get off this ride!!

It has not help me sleep at all.  It actually has had the opposite effect.  The pain from my pleurisy is much better and I am now able to lie down at night to sleep instead of having to sleep sitting up to relieve my pain.  The first night I took this, I slept well.  The second time, I was awake until 4:30 am and up for work at 6 am without feeling drowsy at all. I have more energy throughout the day but this may be working against other meds I take to help calm and slow me down.
Disorder characterized by Stiff, Tender &amp;amp; Painful Muscles	NeckShoulderBack, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	4/28/2011 12:13:05 PM	I took this medicine for a neck and shoulder blade strain of moderate intensity.  I was still able to move and work but in constant discomfort including trouble sleeping.  I felt immediate relief in the area of pain an and tightness within 30 minutes of taking this drug.  As anticipated, it made me very lethargic and drowsy.  I slept for over 12 hours and had trouble rousing.  At the end of the 24 hour release cycle, I was still very dopey and experienced dry mouth and slight stomach upset but both were tolerable based on the relief to the area.  I am someone who tries to take only the minimum of muscle relaxants and pain killers during a flair up because my body has a strong and long term reaction, which seems to be the case here.  Along with physical therapy at home, the one dose of this drug was very helpful to me. I would not drive a car even the day after and missed some work, I still felt too woosey.  But the time off helped my body to heal so I don't get upset about that.  I much prefer a muscle relaxant that wears off sooner in the event that I can better control the effect.  I took this pill because it saved me a trip to the doctor (it had been prescribed the previous flare up of this same ailment) and I had received several samples.  In summation, try to have the doctor prescribe &quot;normal&quot; muscle relaxants as opposed to this long ball hitter for more control and less side effects, in my opinion.  I honestly believe that the drug companies leverage the doctor to push their drugs over others.  This one is only a long lasting, time release of the same drug in another form (flexeril). Feel Better Everybody!

I fell out of the tub face forward. I woke up laying stomach down with a knot on my head and everything hurting. When I passed out I was out for 5 minutes, now have a brusied face, knees, and elbows and had a concussion. Also twice through that same day I blacked out.

Regular cyclobenzaprine made me extremely drowsy, but amrix isn't quite as bad.Other medications like soma or valium have worked better on a short-term basis, but each has their problem-- soma wears off very fast, and valium builds a tolerance very quickly.  So amrix seems to be a good middle-ground for me so far.

It did nothing whatsoever for the pain and completly freaked me out.  Quit making new scary drugs and give us the stuff we were taking in the 70s that didn't kill us.  Dang!  What is up with the pharmaceuticals?  Im sitting here wondering if I need to go to the hospital.  Maybe if they are gonna make killer pharms we should be admitted to the hospital upon before we take the pharms and be monitored at the hospital.  What has happened to USA medicine and medical care - GREED GREED GREED.  I'm sick of em. From now on I want traditional tried and true been out forever drugs - if its been recently developed in past ten years I'm not TOUCHING it.  Ever.  If I live through this dosage of the pharms trying to kill us off.  And btw NO PAIN RELIEF - NONE.  AT ALL.  We want to relax the muscle - not ramp up the heart.

I've never felt &quot;emotionaless&quot; before but I felt completely disconnected, like a robot, and I knew logically it was the pills, but MAN what an awful experience.

Muscle Spasm	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	4/28/2010 10:54:06 AM	I have a pinched nerve in my neck and my new doctor put me on this.  I've been on it for two days and I might as well have taken a sugar pill. No pain relief, no drowsiness, no anything.  Wasted my money on this medication.  Luckily he gave me a coupon for it.  Makes me think he's more interested in kick backs from the manufacturer than giving me somthing that works.

Once on protocol my neck improved but my emotional state had declined. By the end of one of medication, I was in deep depression, and considered signing myself into a psych ward. I have no previous incedences of depression. My wife found that one possible side effect of drug was changes in mood, personality and psychosis. After stopping daily dose, my mood inproved each day. I WOULD NEVER TAKE THIS MEDICATION AGAIN. Give me the neck pain and headaches, I prefer that to the resulting emotional changes.

The cost is absurd (at least $9 a pill) for nothing more then a time released version of Flexeril.  If your Dr trys writing this, ask for something else that is more cost efficent.

I am reading a lot of &quot;too groggy next morning&quot; reviews.  I am thankful my Dr. told me clearly TAKE 3 HRS BEFORE BED, THEN SLEEP 8-9 HRS.  My problem is electricity feeling causing muscle spasms and involuntary muscle action.  ie: looking like a contortionist without any control on my part. It is very embarrassing in public. This medication is too expensive for me to buy, $647.25 for one month supply, my insurance doesn't cover it at all.  I am thankful to have had samples from Dr. office.  Those of you who are groggy, talk to your Dr. about that, dose too high? Maybe taking it too late at night?  It is too good a medication to only try once. I wish there were tons of samples out there.

Muscle Spasm	loretta, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/9/2009 10:50:07 PM	I had right knee surgery back in June of 2009. Needless to say I was still having a lot of pain. I would wake in the night about three,four in the morning in tears crying to my husband where my knee would be having killer spasms. I was taking flexerill three times a day, mobic, and lortab. All done no good, my doc put me on this Amrix I have been on it for a week now and I can already tell a big difference, I actually get to sleep in the night. He still wanted me to take my flexerill twice a day and this Amrix at 6pm. So happy to say I have not had to take my flexirl all week. It does make me sleepy but, he said that is why he has me taking it at 6pm that way when I go to sleep and by the time I get up for work, I will not feel so drowsey. It works for me, I just hope it can help others like it is helping me.

I'm still so tired that I can barely get up in the morning. It' a shame because it really does help with my pain.

I take Opana and Soma which I can function on daily.  I have a terrible time on Flexeril....I am out like a light for 6 to 8 hours.  I am normally willing to try anything my MD puts me on but this has me totally freaked out.  If I can't take flexeril how would I ever be able to take Amrix.  I get drowsy very quickly so I am worried about dropping my face in my Oatmeal.  Is this medication so strong that I would have trouble functioning the next morning?  Does the drowsiness go away after a couple of days?  Thank you so much for your help.

Taking this before going to bed at night helps me get out of bed in the morning. Without it makes it harder on me, especially with a 15 month old. The only problem is a 30 day supply is $380!!! I can't afford it, so each time I see my doctor I can only hope he has samples.

Every type of muscle relaxer given to me made me feel too dopey to do anything and, as a single mom, made things very difficult. I was finally given Amrix, and at first I didn't think it was doing much. After the third day the spasms were all but gone. If I go off for a day or two they return, and I need to build the level back up again. It works to keep the spasms under control.

Other	Ron, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	65-74	6/5/2009 11:20:12 PM	This medication (Amrex) caused a severe systemic reaction; i.e., severe rash over trunk, feet, back, face.  I also experienced weakness in my right arm and leg which led to my hospitalization.  Also, I took Benadryl to counteract the rash and I believe the Benadryl and the Amrex contradicted each other which ultimately made my symptoms twice as bad.  This is a bad, bad medicine for susceptible patients and the consumer should be strongly forewarned...

I constantly had pain in my neck and shoulders that would not go away. One time I had a headache that lasted for two weeks straight. After that I was diagnosed with tension headaches potentially brought on by stress. I have been on amrix for almost 5 months and I love it. I take it every night at 6pm and I have to be up at 6:30am for work and it's not a problem. It made me tired at first, but once I got used to it I was fine. I still get headaches about once every two weeks or so, but I am SO grateful to have found this drug. For everyone who has problems with their co-pays- talk to your doctor, drug reps give them $30 off coupons to promote their product. My doctor gave me an entire packet of about 15 of them.

Decide whether it is worth the price of being unproductive and lethargic the entire time you're on this drug compared to the relief you may get from muscle spasms.I prefer Valium which does the same thing without the long lasting side effects, but was told by my Doctor that this version of Flexoril minimized the extreme drowsiness that characterizes it.   It clearly does not.I will think very carefully before taking this medication a second time.
Other	Cal-Phil, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	19-24	4/30/2009 5:23:34 PM	Great drug, but it is quite powerful at least with its effects/side effects. Worked wonders at relieving pain with a bulging disk, allowed me to continue on with life instantly. Gives good long-lasting relief, but did make me pass out by the end of the night. I didn't even have to take vicodin which was also prescribed for the pain. I am young and larger, so I usually don't react too strongly to medication, and it made me cottonmouth and sleepy, so I would recommend only taking a small dose until you know your personal reactions. Very good find though; relieved pain all-day and through the night, instead of taking numerous vicodins.

It is the only pill that helps my pain.  Tylenol and Ibuprofen do nothing.  I take this every &quot;few&quot; nights, before I go to bed.  It is a wonderful drug for me!

First two doses made me very sleepy and I slept for a good part of the first two day of the injury (which I needed). It definately took away the pain!  Also it gave me mobility in the injured area. All other doses I took at night and it helped me sleep but NOT to the point that I couldn't wake in the AM. Very Satisfied!

It puts me into a little bit of a fog, but it is pretty effective in controlling the spasms. Sleeping at night was nearly impossible with the spasms I was having but sleeping now is definitely not a problem!

Did not help much when in major pain.  Took the amrix last night about 8:30pm and fell asleep about an hour later.  Did not wake up until 10:00am, and I had to be woke up.  I don't think this is something I can take when I have to work the next morning.  I'm not sure if I will continue this drug.
Muscle Spasm		5	5	5			3/1/2009 2:33:25 PM	I have been using this med 15mg once daily for 6 months; I have horrible TMJ and this is a tremendous help.  If you are getting drowsy take it at bedtime.  Also if you're used to xanax or valuim you may not like this because it does have the sedating side effects you're used to.

I have been on SOMA for years . This Med works a lot faster but in the AM it take a long time to get out of your body. As for SOMA 2-4 hours and it is out . One note for everyone and others have said the same thing to take AMRIX after your last meal at night. I find 9 PM and it might be out of your boby by then . Still working on that. GOOD LUCK

This is the only one that has helped. I am very tired all the time and I feel like I am in a daze but I am just happy I am not in pain anymore. It takes about a week to kick in and you have to take it every night at the same time. I suggest taking it at 6pm if you have to go to work.

I have noticed an improvement in my neck stiffness and tight muscles in my upper back. I was on zanaflex for years prior to this and it lost it effectiveness. My only problem is that my pain Dr. said that it is a drug that  should only be taken for a short while and he is probably taking me off it next month. I dont understand why if its working well for me, he would do that. He is very concerned with meds that may cause drowsiness and seems to be overly cautious.I think this is responsible of him but is very frustrating to me because I have chronic neck/shoulder pain 24/7.Has anybody else experienced this with their Dr.? It is expensive, the Dr.gave me a $30 card to help with my copay and I still had to pay $67.

I will not stop taking it, as it has helped me tremendously , giving me some of my life back, from severe chronic pain !

I'll keep trying others, i guess.

After an hour into this med I broke out in hives and itched for hours. About the same as flexeril. Being switched to Skelaxin so I hope it helps.

He felt that Amrix would allow my shoulders to relax and therefore relieve the headaches.  The pain in the headaches is not as severe - but they are still present.  Don't know if this drug is helping as well as I hoped.

Dis. in my neck and knees, PCOS, cervical stenosis. I have taken this drug for 1 week, and have noticed much better control of my mm spasms and pain. I have lived with pain and many similar drugs for 10 yrs. now. Only take this at night tho... It can make you a little &quot;goofy&quot;.

Muscle Spasm	Jenny B, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/29/2008 7:47:09 PM	My dDr. started me on it 2 wks ago, after 1 week I left him know that it wasn't helping with the pain. (Fibro &amp; Degenerative Disc Disease)he advised that I up it from 15 mg at bedtime to 30 at bedtime...still no relief and I can't sleep and my stomach stays upset.  I am not going to take it anymore as I have enough issues with pain and medications messing up my stomach and digestive sys.  Oh well keep on as a guinea pig I guess.  I cannot tolerate any serious narcotic/opiate pain meds.  Between the Fibro and Disc problems I am a walking Muscle Spasm, I don't remember what it is like to have a day pain free.
Other	Kathy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	3/9/2008 9:21:31 AM	I recently began taking this medication for severe muscle spasms from Fibromyalgia. I have found it to be somewhat effective, certainly better than Flexeril or any other muscle relaxer I've tried.
Muscle Spasm	cowgurl67, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	2/24/2008 9:46:51 AM	I have hynerated dics in both back and neck and stay in pain constantly. I just started taking this medicine about 5 days ago. I have taken flexeril for years now and never really received the releif I felt I needed. I'm guessing that since this is extended release it could be the reason I feel a little relief. I don't feel groggy or drowsey from taking this medicine. I plan on continuing this medicine to see if over time it will help my pain more. I'm not sure how expensive it is, but when my doctor gave me samples, they also gave me a coupon for up to $20 off, the doc made the comment that it must be really expensive to offer $20 off. I'm on workman's comp, so they paid for it. I probably wouldn't have been able to get it if I had to pay for it.
