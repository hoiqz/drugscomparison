We kept going to the doctor because I kept thinking he had something worse. It did turn into a massive sinus infection. Luckily she switched us to clarinex. So far it has solved all of our problems.
Other	audubongirl54, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	4/14/2012 7:10:43 PM	For the last 10yrs (ever since I moved to LEE COUNTY, FLA) I have had a terrible time with watering eyes (tears just roll down my face !!!) and I'm 99% sure it's from all the MALALUCA TREES in this county !!!!! My doctor gave me CLARINEX starting in March 2012 &amp; about 45minutes to one hour after taking it my eyes dry up, NO MORE TEARS RUNNING DOWN MY FACE !!!!!!!  But it doesn't last all day. If my symptoms are bad I take another dose when that one wears off ! I was given 5mg tablets and I guess that's as strong as it comes, but I've found it doesn't dry up my watering eyes as it did the 1st few times I took it, so I've started taking 1 1/2 tablets (I cut a tablet in 1/2), but at this rate my meds won't last the month. And my doctor probably won't allow me to take more, but I'm gonna tell him that 5mg just doesn NOT dry up my eyes !  This medicine really works, but I need at least 7.5mg per dose and sometimes 2 doses per day. but I doubt I'll be allowed that much so I'm gonna add ALLEREST (which has a very similar drug  in it) cuz I can't get a darn thing done with tears rollin' down my face &amp; blurring my vision. Good medication in my view, no bad reactions as far as I can tell.

I've tried eye drops, Zyrtec, Benadryl all with minimal relief. This was the 1st year I've tried Clarinex, about an hour after the 1st dose the itchiness is gone, what a relief!

Obviously, the likelihood is greater that the reverse may occur (and for this reason this post will also appear on the Oxycodone comment site) MANUFACTURERS OF BOTH SHOULD CONSIDER CHANGING APPEARANCE OF ONE OR THE OTHER.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	5/4/2010 11:01:31 AM	I developed a serious allergy that had lasted for several weeks.  I used several over the counter medications including loratadine with no effect.  I finally went to my doctor and got a prescription for allegra which did nothing.  My doctor then gave  me a prescription for clarinet which my pharmacist had to order because a lot of insurance companies do not cover it.  Clarinex made an immediate improvement. I am sold.

We couldnt find a link to anything...It was so horrible that I had itching spells that would last a good 45 minutes. Nothing would help till I started taking clarinex (desloratadine) There has been a huge difference. I still itch but not as badly as I used to.

Seasonal Runny Nose	itchnomore, 7-12 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	7-12	6/29/2009 3:34:33 PM	My daughter suffered from chronic hives and allergies from the time she was 4 months old.  Finally discovered a doctor who prescribed this to her when she was 4 YEARS old and it has been her miracle drug.  She can now go outside of our home and even into others homes and only have a minimal (if one at all) breakout. LOVE IT!  She has been taking it for four years now.  At one time they told us she would have to be home-schooled.  Clarinex has allowed her to be able to go to school, join a sport, and do all the fun things a little girl should get to do.

I have a drawer full of prescription creams and every alergy pill under the sun until I found Clarinex. I have had no negative side effects at all.

We had ten uninerrupted nights' sleep and good reports at school.  When we ran out of Clarinex we went to Zyrtec as recommended and the difference was like night and day, Clarinex works, period.  Caveat:  We've only used it for a short time so far.

I had to take 2 days off work. Finally got to see the Dr. and he gave me this as a trial. WOW! Within 5 minutes I could feel it clearing up! 4 days later, 1 tablet a day, and I'm still fine!

Even Claritin only worked marginally.  Doc moved me to Clarinex when Claritin went generic, and I have never been healthier and happier.....but the insurance companies all want to take it away! Please, will someone please tell them it really DOES work better?  It is &quot;metabolized&quot;, so it's effects are quicker and stronger, esp. if you also take meds for acid stomach.....less acid, harder to digest things....docs understand this, but pharmacies don't seem to get it!

I have tried everything under the sun to prevent these coughing spells that she would have after a cold. She has been on steroids, albuteral as well as a host of other meds. This one has been effective but it dries her nose out. I only give it at bedtime, once daily and it has worked so far.I never believed she had asthma.

Instead, my nose ran constantly after taking it.  What would cause that to happen.  I intend not to take anymore.  I have taken two pills, so far.

I tried Allegra &amp; Zyrtec...no luck.  I'm allergic to chicken, beer yeast, and 7 molds.  My symptom is itching under the skin, which result in hives. My doctor put me on 25mg at first and it made me very sleepy.  I take it about every 2-3 days and it works great for me.  However, the insurance company is wanting me to try something else...they need proof that I have tried something else...we are currently waiting for their answer.  In the meantime...I itch, cuz nothing else works.

Tried others that didn't work,alegra,zyrtec,claritin. Has gotten expensive as an RX. ALAVERT is over the counter and exactly same loratadine tab, much less expensive for me at least.

Some friends who are on clarinex as well say you're not supposed to eat graphfruit while taking this but I'm not really sure how true that is.

I went to tell my husband I didn't feel right and boom - next thing I know I'm laying on my back looking up at the ceiling. He said I was 'out&quot; for about a minute. Went off the drug immediately. I later read in the PDR this was an 'uncommon' side effect.

Clarinex has provided a prophylaxis effect now for over 8 years w/o side effects.  Optional drugs were ineffective (Zyrtec, Allegra, etc) and decongestant forms decreased alertness noticeably.
