Pseudotumor Cerebri	Caitlin, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	13-18	4/2/2012 2:04:52 AM	I had to get on Diamox last month when i was diagnosed with IIH , but I now have more issues than I was having before the drug. My IIH caused me to have vision loss with some backaches along my spine and neck. I also had a spinal tap in which the pressure was 56 in which normal is 12-17. But i always felt like a healthy teenager, just one that couldn't see the board. But now with my Diamox I'm constantly feeling weak with tingling on my face and feet, I get confused often, I sunburn easily, and soda is gross. Diamox makes me actually feel unhealthy, but its better than becoming blind.

I had neck decompression surgery done and I was put on Diamox in 2008. This medicine has helped me and I can tell if I do not take it, that I start feeling pressure where my CSF is built up at. I take the capsules 500mg twice every other day. I deal with cranial pressure daily and I have chronic migraines. I recently had botox injections for my migraines and that seemed to help some. I also had a shunt put in 2010.

So far, this is my second week going on Diamox and I haven't noticed any changes other than having to urinate way more frequently. Still experiencing symptoms of sudden blindness in my left eye and occasional tingling throughout my body. Soda tastes the same though, I still drink it all the time (wasn't asked not to) but I'm still experiencing symptoms of my diagnosis. I'm only 20 years old and my spinal tap pressure was at 45 (neuro told me its normally supposed to be about 12-17, 17 being high) so no wonder my head felt like it was going to explode lol. I'm on a research study to see if weight loss alone can help, but am also on high doses of diamox (possible placebo). Will update once more time has gone by.

Pseudotumor Cerebri	BrookeJacoby, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	12/4/2011 9:11:16 PM	Well I just starting taking Diamox and although its hard to remember to take it I guess its ok. I have tingling in my feet, hands, lips, nose,side of my face, and ear that I have noticed so far. I can eat everthing but soda taste like spoiled soda. Its absolutly horrible. Which I think is funny cause the doctor told me to stop or atleast cut back, well I have no choice now. I am begining to get a blister or something on my lip but I don't know if its because of the medicine. But I did't have it before starting. Those are the only side effects I have right now and hopefully that will be all that I have. Hope I help someone. 
Pseudotumor Cerebri	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/9/2011 9:13:00 AM	I was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri in late summer 2011.  I was NOT able to take the medication until 2 weeks after the spinal tap because the spinal tap pressure was NOT high enough by typical standards.  I have been taking the medication for 1 week total.  Tired, yes, but bearable, soda, YUCK tastes horrible, but who cares.  Pins and needles in my feet come and go.  Overall I am happy.  It takes some getting used to.  If you are a caffine drinker (coffee for example) that does help with the headaches.
Pseudotumor Cerebri	Mavournine, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	10/26/2011 8:24:25 AM	I have been on Diamox for approximately 6 weeks now.  I started out taking 250mg for a week and then was increased to 500mg/day.  I saw my neuro approximately two weeks ago and my dose again was increased to 1000mg/day.  I currently get a good bit of the side effects, i.e. numbness and tingling in my hands, face, legs, feet, everywhere really.  Soda tastes gross, but that is okay.  I am completely tired, ALL THE TIME.  This is the toughest part for me to overcome, as I used to run 4-5 miles approximately 4-6 times a week.  I also work shift work as a paramedic in a very busy, demanding city service, and I am certainly having difficulty keeping up like I used to.  Which is tough for me, because mentally I want to do everything I used to, but physically I need to sleep.  I also get winded walking up the steps or putting my uniform on, which again, is tough for me.  My headache has never completely gone away, and today is the fourth day that my head feels like it is going to explode.  I see my eye doctor in two weeks to again check my papilledema.  When I saw the neuro, from his exam he felt that it hasn't changed, but obviously he wants a better picture taken.  I just keep going every day.  I can deal with the side effects, even though they are frustrating, if it prevents me from going blind, however I am certainly sick of having headaches.  I guess we will just see how this treatment progresses.

Was advised by MD that Diamox could prevent altitude sickness.  I experienced no symptoms of altitude sickness, but did have some tingling in fingers and toes (also upper lip).  These effects were mild.  The trek was wonderful.  Would recommend to anyone climbing trekking the Inca Trail.

It stated out working good and then the headaches and stiffness in the neck came back so my dr. uped it from 250 mg 1x day to 250mg 2x day, same thing happend a few months later symptoms came back, so now i am on 500mg 2x a day and the symptoms are coming back. I have had on spinal tap done and it only helped for about a day or two my dr wants to do another but i am hesitant because the first one didnt work. seriously thinking screw the medicine and just go ahead with the shunt, I have every side affect there is for this pill tingling in the hands feet and even my upper lip, stay tired have a consatnt headache, i am sesitive to light and anything else u could think of. 
Altitude Sickness	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	8/26/2010 2:45:51 PM	I climbed Kili and didn't want to take the chance of severe altitude sickness and was quite pleased with the drug.  I did not vomit (which can be common) and no real sign of headaches except on the summit day (but nothing until about 17k feet altitude).  I was concerned with taking the drug after reading the side effects - yes there is tingling in the feet and hands, but nothing severe.  Also - the first couple days I felt very tired and cranky, but after that no real mood/energy side effects. I would recommend this for any true high altitude hiking/climbing.
Other	Daisy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	8/4/2010 7:36:35 AM	I have a form of paroxymal dystonia, which did not respond to the medications typically used to treat this condition. For 25 years, I have taken Diamox or the generic form of Diamox with very good results. There are some side effects, but they are minimal compared to complete disability, which I experienced prior to treatment.

I am taking it to prevent migraines which so far hasn't worked but it's side effects are what get to me most. I don't mind loss of appetite as I need to lose weight. The increased urination is bothersome as embarrassing as this is I wet my bed :( I take in mornin to avoid this prob but it didn't work. Tingling hands and lips, nausea, and I've heard of people getting muscle pain but my knee is so bad I can barely walk and wake up in pain. I'm unsure if that's related but can't think of what I couldve done to hurt it this badly. The pain has me in tears :( put call in to doc for answers as I am sensitive to all meds and typically I get the side effects as well as rare side effects. So for me the side effects outweigh benefit. Oh and I can't drink any carbonated beverage it tastes so bad and sour seems more intense.

I also have a shunt because I developed hydrocephalus. I have tried MANY different meds but I get ammune to everything. I have been on Diamox for almost 7 months now and it has been great. I take 3 550mg pills a day. I do have the annoying side effects of the pins and needles in feet, hands and face. I can not taste soft drinks and I have to force myself to eat. I will continue to deal with the side effects as long as it helps my headaches.
Pseudotumor Cerebri	GHFan, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/25/2010 7:17:36 AM	I was diagnosed with Pseudotumor Cererbi in Nov 2009.  I went to the eye DR for a flashing in my left eye and went from there. My eye test at that time was great 20/20 so no vision issues at that time.I went to see the neuro opthamologist and he did few test including a field vision test and my vision was fine but the fluid was bad in the left eye(flashing eye) and moderate in the right.In Dec to check the pressure I had a spinal tap which also helped with the pressure and I started the medication right after that.I started taking Diamox 1 a day 250MG  for a week uping the dosage each week until within a month I got to 4 a day. I took 4 a day until March when I went for a follow up and the fluid was WAY down. He dropped me to 3 a day then and this past Friday May 21 I went back and it is WAY down again  I am down to 2 a day. The tingling was bad at first but almost totally stopped, ANY carbonated drinks taste HORRIBLE which is OK since I should not be drinking soda anyway.  I do feel fatigued late in the afternoon which is also a side effect.My Neuro Opthamologist has said that I am very responsive to this medication, I have a follow up in August and may be able to totally come off the meds.For me any small issues like tingling are not really any issue when faced with possible going blind. This medication really really worked for me.

At first I did have tingling in fingers and toes, but that went away. I am taking the long lasting capusal 500gm 2x a day, and at first it was hard for me to rememeber to take them, but I just set my alarm clock for the times I need to take them. I am peeing more, and I do have cotton mouth, but it is helping me lose weight at the same time.

So far the medication has worked for me. I still get the occasional headache here and there, but so far they are manageable. The only side effects I have had are loss of appetite, tingling in my fingers and toes, and I cannot drink ANY carbonated beverage, they taste awful. My primary Dr. said to cut the pill in half, so I'm trying that starting today,to see if that helps at all.

It was not effective, I was losing my vision and I ended up getting a shunt. I had my first shunt put in 2 yrs ago that shunt malfunctioned so I got another one and now the second shunt which was installed over a year ago doesnt seem to be working completely because i recently began getting the horrible headaches again where I think my head is going to explode. my doctor put me back on diamox for the time being. It seems to work in combonation with the shunt. i do have the horrible side effects of tingling in my hands and feet, fatigue(I could sleep all day), change in taste especially with soda, decreased appetite (I have lost 12 lbs in 2 weeks). If you can deal with the side effects this medication does seem to work. My headaches are still present but less frequent and less intense. My vision is doing much better. Each person will have their own side effects so it is important to follow your doctors orders and report side effects if they occur.
Other	Thanos, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	25-34	4/2/2010 7:26:14 PM	I began taking this for a chronic vestibular migraine condition.  I had a bunch of migraine-related symptoms but no headaches--dizziness, extreme sensitivity to sound and motion, confusion, difficulty following conversations and anxiety.I slowly increased the dose to 500mg out of a possible 1000mg.  Side effects--increased frequency of urination and feeling jittery/wound up.  It didn't seem to be working and the doc said it's OK to quit cold turkey.  Did so a few days ago and now have increased dizziness and splitting headaches right between the eyes that last for hours.Began taking nortryptaline (sp?) yesterday so hopefully that will work.

The good thing about this medicine has been the weight loss...hard to believe looking back that I was once 50 pounds heavier. The down side has been the annoying &quot;pins and needles&quot; all over the body, loss of intrest of the thought of food, and the annoyance of having to be tied down to the meds. The meds have done wonders though to say the least, but apon a recent appointment, I found out that prolonged use of the medicine can infact cause more headaches. If you are still experiencing headaches that may be something to consult your doctor about. Good luck to all of you out there, I know exactly what you're going through! It is frustrating to no end but it can and will get better.

My side effects have been: pins and needles, dizziness, and fatigue, which at times can be frustrating. It has helped the pressure though. Be sure to drink orange juice or something like that everyday though.

I've lost 15 lbs and that has not helped either. vision keeps worsening, i can't put my head down, side effects from all the drugs make me crazy, but i can get out of bed in the morning without them i cant even do that so i guess it's a toss up!  I used to be able to go to excersize classes and run with my kids and walk miles and hike and now i can't barely walk up a flight of stairs im so weak. I've lost 20%color and peripheal vision and have decreased motor function on my right side.  my neurologist says its because i was 25lbs overweight but there are so many other reasons it could be i'm not so quick to belive them all when they say that it is caused by weight.  Do your homework first look up ideopathic intercranial hypertension which is what the preferred name is and you will find much more documentation on the subject.
Pseudotumor Cerebri	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	55-64	7/15/2009 12:29:24 AM	First, there should be a category for IIH -- pseudotumor cerebri is a misnomer.  My symptoms presented 8 years ago, and I was diagnosed with IIH about 6 years ago.  Fortunately, my eye doctor saved my eyesight by putting me on diamox almost immediately.  While it decreases the Ifluid and headaches, the side effects of pins and needles after even mild exercise, the changes in taste, the tinnitus and dizzyness, and the depletion of potassium - fatigue... (was not told to supplement my diet to accomodate for this -- it helps; bananas, avacados, artichokes) -- do NOT eat salt!  It has decreased my need for spinal taps (that's a big deal, folks!) and side effects ebb and flow over time.  Am on 1500 mg/day -- three 500 mg time-release per day. 'am not sure how many years this will work, but is worth delaying surgery as long as possible.  Short review; do not be passive -- change up your diet and lifestyle to deal with this drug.  Maybe someday someone will decide it's worth researching a remedy actually designed for something as rare as IIH.  In the meantime, this is an option.
Water On the Brain with Obstruction of Cerebrospinal Fluid	pdemko, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	45-54	6/28/2009 4:44:09 PM	When I first took it I got tingling around my mouth and in my fingers. After a month and a half that has decreased a lot. I had a mild rash on my neck and that is occasional but gets worse with sun exposure. NOw I have a rash on my body and arms and the doctor says it can not be from the medicine. I went off of it for 3 days and the rash did not go away, so I started it again.  It has helped my headaches tremendously. The thing I do not like is that you have to stay out of the sun. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	5/10/2009 12:07:17 AM	Before I went off to college I decided that I needed to take a trip to the eye doctor to get some glasses because I still have a slight astigmatism.  The eye doctor found that my optic nerve was swollen, signally high pressure in the brain.  I was then referred to a neuro-ophthalmologist where he diagnosed me with an acute chiari syndrome.  He prescribe me Diamox, very low dosage.  Easy to take/remember 2-3times a day.  I had to go to the bathroom SO much and it made my hands,feet, and face tingly.  Also it made me extremely drowsy.  I decided to stop taking it all by myself.  When I went back to the eye doctor on my break he said my optic nerves have gone back down to regular size.  He was positive it was because of the medicine until I told him I stopped taking it.  Overall, this pill is not effective unless you really want to lose some water weight (which is REALLY great!) you lose weight really easily with this stuff, I know it's horrible to say but it's the truth.  
Other	shayb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	5/7/2009 8:59:58 PM	Currently I am undiagnosed, and getting ready to go to a new doctor at the University Hospital in Denver.I have been having severe headaches (first time ever in my life) for about 4-mths.  MRI showed only white spots on my brain, but no masses.  Spinal tap showed increased pressure, but not real high (25), and did not help, but actually made my headache unbearable the day after I had it done.  Waiting on blood test results now.  I have lost 20 pounds in the past month.So neurologist has me on Diamox.  I started out taking 250mg twice a day (for a week), and she just increased it to 500mg twice a day.  I have now been on it a total of 2-weeks.  Ever since starting the Diamox I have had nausea, ringing in my ears, hand and feet tingling, loss of appetite, extreme fatigue, dizziness, and no let up of my headaches.  So really, my condition is worsening.  The neurologist wants me to continue taking the Diamox for a month to see if it is going to work before going of off it.  She says I have to give it a chance.I would love to hear from anyone else who has gone through or is going through something like I have been.

Since I have been on the diamox I have not had any headaches, it has been a life saver.  The scariest parts of having these headaches were the vision distortions, this was an awful experience.  My sight has since then approved and I am still on the diamox, taking 125 mg 4x's a day.  The tingling is also dreadful but it beats waking up and going to sleep with these awful headaches!

I had a spinal tap done and then ended up having to have 2 blood patches done to get rid of the spinal headache. I was in the hospital for 2 days. I started Diamox yesterday. So far the only side affect I have had is that I can not drink sodas. They taste nasty. But that is ok I don't need them. I am diabetic anyway. Still have the headaches. I am hoping they will get better.

It has been very hard to stand all the sideeffects. I think I have almost everyone listed. My hands and feet constantly sting like they are on fire. some days i cant even hold a conversation with people cause i am so lost. The worst has been the fact that I have never been a cruel person and now I could bit someone head of at the drop of a hat. I am almost afraid I am going to hurt someone. I have to my Dr and he just ups my dose. so now I have switched nero surgens and have decided to go ahead and do the surgery becuase I cant stand feeling like this and the med isnt helping with the intercrainal pressure.
Pseudotumor Cerebri	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/19/2009 6:02:19 PM	I have been taking 1500 mg per day since March 2006 due to pseudotumor that presented as a severe headache due to elevated brain pressure and double vision.  The headache, double vision, and elevated brain pressure are resolved due to Diamox.  I did experience very intense side effects initially:  tingling, tinnitis, hives, high frequency hearing loss, metallic taste, loss of appetite, weight loss.  As time has progressed, tingling occurs infrequently, the tinnitis has decreased, hearing has improved slightly.  I was able to return to normal, productive life due to Diamox...I am very grateful for the wonderful medical care I received that enabled me to resume my life.  I do experience extreme fatigue daily after about 10 hours....but it seems like a small price to pay.  Please hang it there...it will get better..this is a very frustrating medical problem.  I did see a neuropthalmologist....she indicated another medication could be Topamax.
Pseudotumor Cerebri	dueinjune, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	25-34	3/29/2009 6:50:24 PM	I was diagnosed in Jan 09 with pseudotumor (at 20 weeks pregnant).  I was hospitalized, did MRI's and spinal taps to get the extreme pressure down.  The pressure had caused damage to my optic nerve so my neurologist has had me on generic diamox since Jan 09.  They say this is totally pregnancy related.  The headaches have stayed away, but the vision problems are still there. I take a 500 mg pill twice a day (morning and night) and have had to add a potassium pill supplement.  The tingling feet, hands, and cheeks are annoying.  I am extremely tired and have to go to the restroom every 1-2 hours. All of these things are probably intensified by the pregnancy, but it makes me pretty miserable. I am thirsty all the time and can't drink enough fluids.  
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/12/2009 2:38:37 PM	This caused extreme tingling of the teeth, mouth, face,head and neck. The pharmacist recommended I discontinue use as did the Physician, but neither could explain my symptoms/reaction to this medication. I'm not sure if it would have worked for my condition but I am disappointed that I had the reactions as I looked forward to having some relief from my cerebral fluid issue.

Pseudotumor Cerebri	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	3/4/2009 11:17:01 AM	I've been on the meds for a little over a year. I started with a single 500mg dose and I'm now up to 500mg 3 times a day. My headaches and neck pain are now managed rather well; they are down to a dull ache as opposed to the migraine/extreme pressure that I had experienced before. The side effects are minimal now; only bowel issues and circulation, but those can be treated.
Pseudotumor Cerebri	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	2/26/2009 9:04:35 PM	I was diagnosed with Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension on Jan 09.  It is basically Psudotumor Cerebri. I had a spinal tap done and started taking Diamox early Feb.  I have not noticed any difference in my symptoms. The only side effects that I get is tingling in the hands and feet sometimes.  I have not been sick or dizzy.  It did cut my appepitite for about two weeks.  I still cant eat as much as usual.  Thats a good thing. I plan on calling my Dr to let him know that my symptoms are still there.  I take 500mg once a day. 
Pseudotumor Cerebri	Katie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	2	Female	25-34	2/16/2009 9:52:12 AM	I have been taking 500 mg of generic Diamox for about 3 weeks since being diagnosed with IIH. I was extremely dizzy and nauseous for the first week on the medicine. After that, I started to feel better, but I still have really annoying side effects. I am constantly tired (even after 12 hours of sleep), I'm sometimes short of breath, and the tingling in my feet and hands drives me crazy. I have only had one headache since my spinal tap 3 weeks ago and since being on Diamox, but I don't think my vision has improved. I plan to talk to my neurologist this week about other treatment options. I don't think Diamox is going to work for me long term, especially since I want to get pregnant. Has anyone else dealt with the pregnancy issue while dealing with IIH?
Pseudotumor Cerebri	SindyVegas, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	2/4/2009 12:53:57 PM	I have only been taking this drug for a day and a half and the side effects are terrible. I will try to hang in there though. I had pseudotumor cerebri 20 years ago and they think it may be back. They treated my condition much more aggressively back then with better results. They relied on spinal taps daily for a week to get the pressure under control and also steriods and a different diaretic. I will have to wait and see if it helps my vision.

Pseudotumor Cerebri	katie, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	2	1	2	Female	19-24	1/5/2009 7:23:16 AM	I started this med. about a month ago. I can deal with side effects but it hasn't seemed to help my pain.

My doctor says it is doing its job but I feel no change. I still have major migraines everyday, my neck is constantly stiff and my back hurts off and on. I have experienced side effects similar to those of most people on it; extreme tingling in feet and hands, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, dry mouth, and weight loss. Overall I hate taking this medecine and can't wait to be taken off of it.

I've noticed a significant pressure reduction from my head/neck region and try to drink alot of water to avoid dehydration and eat high potassium foods to help avoid the minor side effect of tingling in extremities (circulation) while on this med. (Due to my experience:  DO NOT TRY TO STOP THIS PILL SUDDENLY WITHOUT CONSULTING A PHYSICIAN-it can mess up your PH Balance and cause dizziness, especially if you have a low potassium level due to taking this med)

When thinking this was the light at the end of the tunnel and in fact was just another set back.  2000mg/day plus potass. still no changes.  The side effects are still there and chronic headaches with no relief as well.  Will it ever end?
Pseudotumor Cerebri	Claire, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	35-44	12/10/2008 6:58:14 PM	I was diagnosed with IIH in September and since then have increased my dosage to 1000mgs per day.  I had my 2nd lumbar puncture yesterday and my CSF pressure was down from over 40 to 32.  I have also had no episodes of vision loss for over a fortnight.  My headaches have reduced slightly, but that may be due to the Topamax that I take daily for migraine.The initial side effects aren't pleasant, but do fade, and if the alternative is permanent damage to your vision, it's got to be worth persisting, right?  If the side effects are really that bad for you, ask your Dr about the modified release capsules as they tend to be easier to tolerate.  Overall, glad I stuck with it.
Wide-Angle Glaucoma	bobotcr, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	65-74	11/20/2008 3:17:48 PM	In a pretty critical high pressure situation after cataract surgery, this drug brought it totally in line.  Side effects for me were mild though annoying.  Of all of the side effects, a spacey feeling for about 10 minutes the first two time.  And mostly tingling fingers and toes.  Turns out if you put pressure on an area for about 10 minutes, like holding the phone, sanding, crossing your legs, the symptoms attack that area, like when your hand is cold and the circulation resumes.  It takes about 20 minutes for it to go away.  All in all worth it for short term treatment.

I was so sick the whole 3 months missed alot of work, I would be so confused I would forget myw ay home from work... a way I go everyday... kinda scary when u have to call someone to tell u how to get home when u take that route everyday. The tingling in the hands and feet were horrible, the metallic taste made me throw up at least 2 times a day, I seriously thought I was dying. I took this medicine for 3 months prior to my surgery, my dr attempted to put me back on the medicine after I had my surgery and I absolutely refused to take the medicine and he wouldn't take no for an answer so I got the prescription filled but never took the medicine!!! I will NEVER take this medicine again due to all the side effects I had and the fact that it didn't even help w/ my symptoms just made it worse in my opinion. This medicine is VERY effective for some people and for others not so well... Dont take what everyone else says about the medicine just take it yourself and see how your body reacts to it but I couldn't take the medicine! 
Pseudotumor Cerebri	svan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/18/2008 6:46:12 AM	I had been taking 2 - 250 mg tables three times a days mg twice a day for 5 yrs. Now I have been able to reduce to 2 - 250 mgs to twice a day over the past 4 yrs. for Pseudotumor Cerebri.  I went from have sever headaches and blackouts to only having break through headaches about 4 times a year. Incresing the Diamox with my Dr.'s permission for two to three days will get the headache back under control. This medicine was a life saver to me. I almost had to apply for disability until I switched Dr.'s and he diag. it right away. No more feeling that my head is going to explode.  The side of effects of tingling, numbness, tiredness will get better with time.  The metalic taste seemed to go away once I stopped drinking pop. Still to this day drinking pop will increase the metalic taste and increase the headaches so I stay away from pop. I just wanted to encourage you that this worked for me but it does take time.  I was very fortunate and noticed a huge difference in my explosive headaches and blackouts within a week of taking this medicine.  This is one medicine I refuse to stop taking.  I have tried in the past to reduce the amount but the systems would return within 3 days.  I hope this will be an encouragement to you.
Pseudotumor Cerebri	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	10/6/2008 1:36:36 PM	Was started on this medication at 1000 mg 4 days ago.  In that period I have already begun experiencing the following symptoms:  horrible pins and needles in my feet and joints, tingling in my face, hands shaking, headaches, dizziness, fatigue, severe mental confusion.  I have just called my doctor and my dosage has been reduced to only 500 mg per day.  We'll see what happens with lower dose.  I want to give this an honest try to save my sight, but I think I will lose my job and enjoyment of my life if I continue to experience these side effects.

I am up to 1500mg daily. I have found that the sequels work so much better than the tablets. While I was on the tablets I had to have 3 lumbar punctures and on the sequels I have only had 1 in the last 2 years. If you can figure out a way to deal with the side effects it is well worth it! I still have some headaches but nothing like before. I figure i would rather have side effects than not being able to see my children grow up!!! Just hang in there it is worth it.

Pseudotumor Cerebri	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	45-54	7/7/2008 3:56:22 PM	I have been on the medication since August 2006 and have increased dosage to 3000 mg. Side affects have been numbness in hands &amp; feet, ringing in ears and metallic taste. Have had two lumbar puntures during same time with a third coming soon. My vision seems to have stabilized but If I have to increase dosage again then a shunt may be next coarse of action. The medication is expensive and insurance fights me every time dosage is increased.

My dr's believed that I had a build up or couldnt release it as quickly as i produced it and this is all a result of a virus. SO far been on the medication (500mg BID) for three weeks and just recently increased to (750mg BID). First few weeks headaches seemed less severe, now they're still about the same even after the dosage increase.

I have the horrible tingles in my heels, sometimes hands and lip. I've only been sick 1 time and the funny one (I think so) is that I get confused. My headaches are reduced, maybe by half. I will get a spinal tap soon and hopefully that will help more.

When I finally went and the doctor told me about the swelling I saw 3 more doctors that same day. I srarted losing my vision at work, driving ,and I also had bad headaches. I have since had 1 spinal tap (awful) to remove 10 cc's of brain fluid since I have done well I am just at the doctor every3 mths.I have been on this medication for almost 2 yrs.The main side effect I have is with the tingling and numbness in my legs,feet,lips,hands and even my tounge. But I will take anything to keep my vision and be able to keep doing the things I love.

The medication worked well in preventing issues with altitude sickness.  Strong side effects to be expected were increased urination and tingling in the fingers.  Some of the team also experienced tingling in the face and jaw.  Most of the team took 250mg twice per day and that was effective.

This medication in the brand name worked awesome but in the generic it didn't work at all. I have taken this medicine ona nd off for 20 years and it has saved my vision a number of times. I jad gastric bypass surgery 4 years ago to help stop the flare ups and it has worked incredibely. I haven't had to take the diamox since then. Learn to live with the side effects so tht you will not go blind.

I was able to avoid the symptoms for altitude sickness but I did have some of the side effects that are mentioned here. Tingling in the finger tips, taste problems and diarrhea were common for the entire duration while on this medication. On the last day of my stay in the mountains I stopped taking the drug. By that afternoon the tingling stopped and the taste problems went away. The diarrhea is still sticking around though. The next time I head to the mountains, I will look into another alternative to diamox.

This drug seeks out every drop of moisture in your body and within what seems like minutes, sends you to the bathroom for some geyser action. It makes sense to drink alot of water in an effort to replace all that you're losing. It did relieve the pressure around my eyes, allowing me for the first time in weeks to roll them at my husband.

This drug has helped delay surgery by a whole year. The side effects are really bad in the begining but over time most will fade. Drink lots of orange juice, it will help stop the tingling.

The first 60 days were very effective. On the other hand it has not been helping. Still dealing with bouts of blurred vision ,lots of headaches and become very tired with headaches when taking walks longer than 20 mins. Lots of tingling in legs, finger tips and lips at times. So my opinion is that its helpful for short term but long term is questionable. Will continue to take it until further direction from physician.

It helped relieve the pressure on optic nerves/discs.

Inherited Periodic Paralysis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/21/2007 8:36:45 PM	Using this medication made me very sick. I believe the dose prescribed was too much. After the first dose I began to feel sick and couldn't eat. Then when I did try to eat i vomited everything up. Nothing was able to stay in my stomach while I was taking the diamox.It took a while for doctors to be convinced I should stop taking this so after approx. 1 week I stopped taking it and was after losing quite a bit of weight.It obviously wasn't a good experience, my suggestion is to start with a small dose and work up. Not start with a large dose as I was forced to do.
