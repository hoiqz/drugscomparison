Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/18/2012 4:13:32 AM	After reading the reviews of others, I was apprehensive about using this product although I had used it several years ago without any problems. I must be fortunate, as I had none of the issues mentioned. I have sensitivity issues &quot;down there&quot; and have to be very careful with soaps, detergents, etc, but had nothing but positive results with this product... Thank heavens!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	BurningVagina, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	11/5/2011 10:23:09 AM	I had a yeast infection and felt like maybe the over the counter stuff could work. The cream kinda work for me but every time I apply it it would burn like a fire was on my vagina. I wish i would had read the reviews before I brought this product. Now about to make an hospital run. Hopefully I can get out before it's time for work!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	6/28/2011 9:37:35 PM	okay, i knew going in that not everything works for every person. So i waited a day till i felt like i couldn't take the itch anymore then tried it after a hot shower, which i do recommend. I also knew from friends that some people use it when they don't need to or forget to use the external creme or use the external creme inside, so i was cautious. Worked great! I got an infection that was crazy itchy from taking amoxicillian. So if you get random infections during the year like i do just from taking any meds, this is the way to go when it gets bad. Also, you should consult your doctor...i consulted a nurse friend.

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Taya, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	8/26/2010 10:00:06 PM	3 weeks ago I purchased the Monistat 1 Day due for symptoms of a yeast infection. I inserted the medicine and used the external cream and decided to take a nap. When I woke up, my insides were on fire. I couldnt close my legs; there was an intense burning sensation when I urinated. It was very difficult to wash; mild soap and water caused my genitals to burn. I made an emergency called my physician for immediate attention. My gentles were a purplish-red color and fully inflamed. There was nothing I could do to get relief and the systems lasted for 2 weeks. Today, my gentles are still discolored and intercourse is very uncomfortable. Im a newlywed and I cant believe how miserable I am from this produce. I followed the exact instructions and should not have experience such pain and discomfort.

Boy did that backfire.  I felt intense burning shortly after inserting the suppository in the evening, and was in severe pain the next day and only slightly less severe pain the day after.  At the end of that first day my vulva was so swollen that I couldn't wipe after urinating.  It was huge.  If it didn't hurt so much, it would have been kind of cool.  Ice brought down the swelling, and I spent the night of the first day and all of the second day with icepacks between my legs.  On the third day, I felt a lot better-much like I had when the yeast infection first came on, that is itchy, but not burning and able to walk.  She noted that the yeast was still there and prescribed a Diflucan.  I am sure not everyone has such a terrible experience, else they would not have been able to get this stuff approved, but it's clear that enough people do that one should tread carefully.  Get a Diflucan or do the 3 day treatment.  In trying to guarantee myself a fun weekend, I totally ruined it with this stuff.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	1/19/2010 1:07:55 AM	I read all these horribly reviews after I had already used this product and was terrified. So, for those of you out there thinking about using this product just keep in mind that most people only review products if they are unhappy with them. My experience with this product was great. For about 1 hr after administering the ovule I was slightly painful (more of an irritating stinging), but since I used Vagisil cream as well as the cream that comes in the Monistat pack, it helped with my discomfort.I took this at 8:30pm and by  7:30 am the next morning I felt soo relieved. I still have a small visible infection, but I've been using the Monistat cream with the Vagisil and feel significantly better.

I almost went to the emergency room because the burning got so bad.  It was the worst about 3-4 hours after use. I ended up getting in the shower to try and get the remainder out. I cried for almost an hour wondering what to do with the pain. Do not use! Call your doctor for a Diflucan if at all possible!

Decided that the last time the OTC drug seemed to work. I decided to try the ovule. Within minutes I was burning worse than I was before. The cream offers little to no relief to the itching and burning. Now 4 days later I'm still no further ahead and $20 behind. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone..and I suggest that Monistat pull the product off the shelf. I wish I would have read these reviews before I bought the product.

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	10/4/2008 3:23:24 PM	I took this medication before I went to bed. I woke up the next day and my insides were on fire. I could barely walk from the pain. I went to the doctor the following day and the ovule burnt my cervix. No wonder why I felt like I was burning from the inside out, because I WAS!!Evidently this drug is &quot;too strong&quot; for OTC use and after some research many doctors concur that Monistat 1 Day needs to be removed from the shelves. My cervix and I can attest.

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva		1	4	1			4/10/2008 1:36:34 PM	Did not work. My Dr said, if your going to use an over the counter med for this, go with the 7 day. I opted for the oral medication.
