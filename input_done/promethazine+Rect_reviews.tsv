Nausea and Vomiting	Denise, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	7/23/2011 4:32:34 PM	Used many times over last year for nausea due to digestive disorder. Got rid of nausea, but made me very lethargic for 24 hrs and ruined appetite even after reducing dosage. Also became aggitated and could not sleep even though extremely tired. Would not use again.
Nausea and Vomiting	jaioga, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		5/14/2011 5:39:08 PM	I am a diabetic type 1 and on the insulin pump. I get nausated very easy. This medication has helped me so much. I have to take it almost always just before eating a meal. It has been a lifesaver for me. Thank you!

Nausea and Vomiting	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	10/31/2010 10:03:20 AM	I had been nausea for a little over a week so my doctor gave me this medation. I feel great for the first hours after taking it but for the next 2 or more hours I had real bad chest pain but the rest I started to take it was over. I would not take it if I could go a whole day without having to take it. I hate taking medations at all so this medation is eitehr too strong for me or my body cannot take it.
Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	MCMcD, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	7/27/2010 7:47:16 PM	I suffer from extreme morning sickness, to the point of hospitalization. Other anti-nausea medications had little to no discernable effect.  My doctor switched me to these suppositories, and I had IMMEDIATE relief. Vomiting decreased from ~12x daily to ~2x weekly, with only 1 or 2 doses daily. For me, side effects included a marked increase in fatigue and some dizziness.  Well worth it!

Throwing Up	WaWa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	12/10/2009 12:38:54 AM	Told I possibly have a Hiatal Hernia by Dr, before upper GI is performed, this taken with Reglan &amp; Gaviscon are to help alleviate constant vomiting from anything ingested.  Works appx 30% of time.  Don't like the extreme drowsiness, dry nose, ringing in ears, etc (1/2 of side effects), however, it beats spending all my time hanging over the toilet and inability to eat.  Catch 22!!

Nausea and Vomiting	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/6/2009 2:28:13 AM	While pregnant I found it very hard to eat due to being nauseated, so my doctor prescribed me this drug. At first I hated it, because I combined it with vicodin (due to galstones) but once I started using this drug by itself, It relieved my nausea and I felt 100% great. I love this stuff!   
Nausea and Vomiting	hmt8ss, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	2/20/2009 7:37:01 AM	I used this drug in suppository form after a stent was put in place subsequent to a lazer procedure for kidney stones. The absorbtion rate was rapid but it took two applications to notice some relief from the nausea I experienced. I did have some side effects such as impaired night vision and slight dizzyness. This drug was fairly effective and provided a good level of relief.

Other	Jenn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/26/2007 11:52:13 PM	The only problem I have with it is it makes me so overly tired that I have to take a nap when I take it.  Therefore, I have to wait until after work to take it and sometimes that is hard.
