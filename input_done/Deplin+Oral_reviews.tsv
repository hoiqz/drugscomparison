Other	gladtobealive, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/6/2012 8:37:50 PM	I suffer from major depression and have had symptoms from a very young age but managed with counseling therapy off/on.  However, my conditioned worsened over time and I started taking medications for depression and suicidal thoughts for several years.  They helped but did not resolve the severe low depressive episodes until Deplin!  It started working a few weeks after taking it but I didn't realize it at first.  But then I noticed that my mood was more consistent and I did not have the severe lows. I am no longer fearful of the lows that I cannot overcome.  Deplin helps me!  The major symptom (?side effect)that I have noticed is that: 1. my parasympathetic system occasionally overeacts; headaches becomes very painful (rarely had them except for minor ones via sinus reactions)  2. on a couple of occasions I have had &quot;hot flashes&quot; (I am very post-menopausal and I never had hot flashes when I was going through the change) including perspiring profusely. 3. I often need to use a fan to circulate more fresh air.

I have been taking Deplin for 2 years and it really helps - especially with anxiety and depression.  Have been diagnosed with Bipolar II and am afraid to take the mood stablizers due to dangerous side effects so I am happy the Deplin works.

(l-methylfolate 15 - or 7.5)I have been fighting depression and anxiety with no long term success for many years. I ran across a brochure for Deplin in my psychiatrist's office one day and started taking it that night. Within days I felt better.

I had to increase the dosage on the Cymbalta to get it to work for depression and I still wasn't getting help with my fibromyalgia.  I read about Deplin and asked my Dr to review it and prescribe 7.5 mg for me. I have been on it for 6 months and it has certainly helped the depression and I am finally getting relief from the fibromyalgia.  Its is not usually covered by insurance but if you check the Deplin website you will get links to companies that can Mail Order the Rx for about $45 per month- 7.5 mg.  Kind of a miracle drug.

My Doctors have tried just about everything, and my body seems to be resistant to many drugs. They added Deplin to the mix of other drugs I am taking 6 months ago in hopes it would help me. I honestly cannot tell any difference. With all the glowing reports here I was really hoping that wouldn't be the case. It doesn't seem to be hurting though, meaning no bad side effects, other than my insurance doesn't cover it, making it quite expensive! Back to the drawing board I guess.

Everything makes my heart palpitate and I get every horrible side effect and then some on the chart.My doctor started me on 15mg deplin 6 weeks ago and in the beginning I wasn't really sure what was happening.I felt something that felt sort of like panic but then after about 1 1/2 hours I could feel the calm kick in.Even .25 xanax gives me a panic attack during the first hour its in my system.Anyway, I have tried so many antidepressants,mood stabilzers and atypicals that I could start my own pharmacy and always had falure.I thought that I would have to take this with an antidepressant but it seems to be doing ok own its own.Dr. told me to add another 7mg daily.I have also added 250mg l-carnitine (an amino acid)for energy.Doing well I think and was able to go on a job interview yesterday and actually get hired.Just three weeks ago I was weepy and depressed and its great not having the panicky feeling from antidepressants as I already have major anxiety and depressive disorder which also presents itself as extreme irritability.I don't feel the deplin&quot;kicking in&quot; now its just a smooth transition.I think I was so low in the beginning that I felt every little change in my brain as a big change.I may have had a mild headache or two in the beginning but with all the pollen now its hard to say for sure.I hope this helps others like me that struggle so hard with medications and depression/anxiety.

Other	TigerLily, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/30/2010 3:00:12 AM	I think it is safe to say that Deplin prevented me from being hospitalized again and probably saved my life. It was effective within 3 days instead of the 4-6 weeks of most other medications. I've had no side effects.I have suffered from treatment resistant/refractive depression, anxiety/OCD, PMS, fibromyalgia, myofascial pain syndrome PTSD and diabetes for many years. Initial treatment with Prozac for depression 21 years ago was extremely effective for about three years. Then it stopped working. For the past 18 years or so nothing has worked.I've been on antidepressants, Abilify, gabapentin, Lyrica (more for the fibro.). The cocktails were endless. The latest was trying Prozac again. Nothing, even with increasing the dose. Over the past year symptoms have increased and there is the possibility of perimenopause. My psychiatrist left the area when I was extremely unstable - extreme depression, rages, severe PMS, and suicidal because I'd given up hope anything would help. I was close to breaking up a 7 year marriage. I was basically dumped on my family doctor, who was unable to find assistance in treating me. Gotta love rural life. He gave me samples of 7.5 mg Deplin and within a couple days I was feeling better. After a couple weeks we bumped it up to 15 mg. I still can't believe how much better I feel. No PMS, no mood swings (not attributed to food). I still can't quite believe it. HOPE!!! I gave the information to my parents when I visited over Christmas. My dad is so miserable to be around. I hope he follows through and this helps. My mother has dopamine issues so maybe it would help.Cost is going to be a major factor for me and my parents. The insurance companies aren't wanting to pay. They'll pay for medications with nasty side effects, though. I don't understand. Even with Pamlab's assistance program the cost is still high.If you can get samples or your insurance will cover it, please give it a try. It might just save your life and relationships.

Finally Deplin has helped me in Lexapro at the smallest dosage, with no negative side effects. I have found that my usual PMS symptoms are only present for one day prior to my cycle rather then a week leading up to it. I couldn't be happier.

Have begun taking it with my Cymbalta for mild but chronic depression and neurapathy.  My daughter has extreme and prolonged difficult mental problems, all dominated by depression, fear, and lack of concentration.  It would be good for her, but she has stopped it because on the permeating odor she feelsit gives her.  I have noticed the same problem  especially in my panties,  but will continue using it.  Does anyone else have the feeling that this high dose (7.5mgs) is the cause.  How can we cope with this?

I suffer from ADD, Bi-Polar 1, GAD, Mood Disorder secondary to Hypothyroidism, PTSD, Fibromyalgia, and major depression.  I also take Welbutrin, Celexa, Neurontin, Trazadone, Relafen, Tramadol, Lamictal, and Ativan.  Suppliments I take are a Multi Vit., Vit. B Complex, Fish Oil, Lentra, Phosphatidyl Serine, and Melatonin.  When I added Deplin to my daily regimin, I noticed that my depression and well being lifted to a higher level without throwing me into an all out mania.  With my meds the way they are now, I feel better than I have in at least 10 years.  I highly reccomend adding Deplin to a Medication and Suppliment Cocktail.

LIFE CHANGING VITAMIN!... to say the least.  I am one of very few Treatment Resistant Depression patients who received an implanted Vagus Nerve Stimulator for Depression in 2005.  I remained on my conjunctive therapy cocktail of anti-depressants until 2007 when I started on Deplin.  With Deplin, I was able to eliminate the Anti-Depressant drugs.  YAY!  Never been happier - thank God for the gift of doctors and researchers who continue to develope medicine to include such options as Deplin.

I actually took the generic L-Methylfolate made by Solgar Vitamins which is cheaper than Deplin and doesn't need a prescription. For the first 2 weeks I felt my depression lifting after 3 years. Unfortunantely, after 2 weeks, I noticed by energy levels dissapear and the depression return. I've heared that this usually happens when the dosage is too high and to discontinue it and restart at half the dosage. Based on my research, I would recommend this supplement as a first line augmentation treatment for depression. 
Anemia From Inadequate Folic Acid	believer13, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5		45-54	1/3/2010 1:58:45 PM	I only started taking this medication 3 days ago and I am already feeling better. I know that sounds corney since it hasn't been that long, but I got out of bed the next day with a feeling of elation. I felt as if I could do anything I wanted to. Kind of like a mental engery but of course my body can't keep up yet. There hasn't been an antidepressant on the market that I can take for over ten years. I am happy that there is something with dopamine. I think that's the key. I am so happy so far!!!! I feel great!!

THIS IS THE FIRST TIME EVERYTHING IS WORKING AND I FEEL NORMAL. MY DR RECOMMENDS DEPLIN AT ITS HIGHEST RX LEVEL WHICH IS &quot;7&quot; FOR IT TO WORK AT ITS BEST. I HAVE NO SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL FROM THIS. THIS HUGE AMOUNT OF FOLIC ACID HAS RAISED MY ENERGY LEVEL, RID ME OF DEPRESSION AND BIPOLAR EPISODES. SLEEPING HAS IMPROVED AS WELL I AM NO LONGER TERRIBLY AGITAATED AND IMPATINET. CONSULT WITH YOUR PSYCHIATRIST (NOT FAMILY DR, WHO MAY NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE HIGH LEVELS) AND ASKE ABOUT DEPLIN AT 7000 MG. A DAY. IF YOU ARE MEDICATION RESISTANT, YOU WILL BE SO GLAD YOU DID. 
Other	Anonymous, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male	35-44	11/4/2009 10:44:06 AM	Been on it for a couple weeks now. Do feel differences for the better, but I am really having a hard time sleeping now. I'm taking Wellbutrin, which can also have that side effect, so I am wondering if it can be enhancing that. Also, I think I am gaining weight (though on the flip side I am less interested in an afternoon snack). Also more headaches and dryness in sinuses/throat. Time of year is probably not helping that, but the time of year doesn't explain why I feel so thirsty. Someone else claimed that since it's just a vitamin it cannot have side effects but if that were true why do we need a prescription to get it? And you can have too/take too much of some vitamins. And of course people can react to the inactive ingredients. Also, how SSRIs and other anti-depressants work are not well known/understood, and some of those can cause weight gain, etc. So why couldn't an increase in l-methylfolate cause similar symptoms? Maybe these side effects are a result of my body behaving the way it was supposed to be versus how it behaved with a chemical imbalance. I am seeing benefits from this, so I may continue to take it. Just feels like I found yet another drug that helps but I may have to stop takign it due to side effects.

I take Zoloft 50 mg/day for anxiety/depression. I told my MD that I was just tired of being so tired!  She gave me a 30 day sample of Deplin, she said she had not prescribed it yet for anyone else, so I was her guinea pig.  I noticed a difference within the first week.  I didn't need a 2-3 hour nap in the afternoon and my energy level has increased enough to where I can take my dog on a 20-30 minute walk 4-5 days/week.  Hoping this can help me lose some weight. Also have started to taper off my zoloft, 50mg every other day alternating with 25 mg.  I just hope the effects of Deplin continue to help me improve.

My motivation, memory, attention and concentration have improved. I am disabled by depression. I am hoping that this medication will allow me to go back to work. It is know to be ineffective in people who have no difficulty in processing folic acid from usual diet. 7 out of 10 depressed people have a problem making use of folic acid. I must be one of those people.  It is definatly worth trying.

Should she still be taking the xanax and the lexipro with the deplin. I have read so many good things about delpin, but not sure if she should still be taking the other medications. She is talking about going into the hospital for help and its the last thing that I want. Her sister was also severely depressed and was in and out of hospitals.

Other	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	13-18	3/29/2008 12:40:41 PM	I have been taking this medication for major depression and it really hasn't made any difference at all...I'm on Lexapro and Melatonin as well, so maybe it has something to do with the combination, but it really hasn't made even the tiniest bit of a difference.
