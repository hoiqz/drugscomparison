Cough	Caring Mom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	2/15/2010 5:58:02 PM	Made coughing worse for the first two hours. Then did little to improve it. I agree with the previous post.
Cough	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	1/5/2010 10:26:25 PM	This was prescribed to my four year old for treatment of bronchitis symptoms.  After three days, she still has not improved.  I have taken her off it, in response to her aggravated behavior since taking it.  She has become unable to controll her impulses, is very easily aggitated, and has become aggressive and violent to her sister. 
Cold Symptoms	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	11/12/2009 1:49:47 PM	I was perscribed this medication follwing a severe cold for coughing. It was $25.00 and I was thinking that for that cost, it will beat the pants off any over the counter cough med. I continued to cough through out the night, and I even went to the extent to double check with my doc to be sure the dosage was correct, 2 teaspoons every 4 hrs. It was. Would NOT recommend this med; ask for something else.
Cold Symptoms	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	11/9/2009 8:31:23 PM	I was prescribed this for an Upper Respiratory Infection. It worked a little bit, but I don't think it's worth it though, I had horrible side effects: Drowsiness, Dizziness, and It made me anxious. I would not recommend it.

I have been taking for the past few days with a combination of Robitussin for cough and congestion.  This medicine is not good.  I went to read the pharmacies info on the medication and there were none.  So I am clueless to what this should be used for.  I continued to cough and still have a little congestion.  I hear Mucinex is the best...NEXT TIME I WILL KNOW!!!
Cough	tedwards, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	35-44	11/12/2008 10:22:43 PM	Worthless for coughing. Did not relieve symptoms at all, and in fact may have made cough worse.  Would not recommend to anyone, and would like to tell Dr. to not recommend to other patients.
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	7/27/2008 1:08:04 AM	The taste was horrible. Even if i took with food, the medicine gave me a stomach, made me dizzy, and was ineffictive with my cough, mucus in my lungs, or my stuffy nose. i stopped taking it after three doses- it did not help me in the least
Other	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	1	1	Female		2/11/2008 8:18:25 AM	This stuff is like water and tastes horrible and I still have all my sinus infection symptoms.  I have had a sinus infection for several months and this stuff is a waste of time
