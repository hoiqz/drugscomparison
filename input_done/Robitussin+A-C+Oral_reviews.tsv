Cough	piscesdeb1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	2/27/2012 6:30:17 PM	This medicine is wonderful for helping me. It mellows the cough just enough to allow me to sleep. the only problem I have is with the prescribed dosage. 2tsp every 4 hours is NOT enough. So I find myself &quot;over&quot; dosing myself to get the effect I need. I would assume that it is because any time a bug comes into my house it turns into bronchitis for me and has for years. (since I was a child) Back to the task at hand, this medication does the job and does it well.

You have to shake this new stuff, it doesn't last as long, it doesn't ease the congestion in the chest like it used to, and it doesn't taste as well as the ole stuff. Shame on you.

The alcohol taste was VERY strong when taking, that was the only downside of the med. Will suffer through it though as the results outway the initial bad taste in your mouth!
