Other	TRUESOUL, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Male	45-54	11/18/2008 1:52:17 PM	I am a spastic diplegia affected (mild) person aged 45. First time in my life, a drug has given immense results. The trick: This time i was advised to take it 3 times a day. UNBELIEVABLE: The very first dose has given me recognisable and excellent control of circumductory gait which usually i get to achieve with a lot of physiotherapy. It was effective even after i have not used it for 10 days after a continuous use of 5 months. It is helping me to undergo my physio regularly with ease to my doctor. I am relieved of spastic condition with paining muscles. It has supplemented with vitamin B12 which i believe has the magic influence in keeping me active. THANKS TO THE DOC.
