It works great in this capacity.  Does little else for me.  I have to tell you though it does make me see things.  I thought I was crazy.

I could never really tell it did anything,maybe a little relaxed. does help me sleep a lot better, was waking up about 8x a night until I started this drug,pain and to go to bathroom. If I take 1 before bed I usually dont wake up, that is so nice. does make my eyes burn and dry mouth and crazy weird dreams. I only take now once in awhile for good sleep because I never noticed really much pain relief.

The restless leg syndrome is completely gone, however the muscle spasms are still bothering me.  I take 4 mg. at night.  Dr. stated that I should go to bed upon taking med.  It sure helps me to get to sleep, however, within 2-4 hours my foot spasms are horrendous.  Going to talk to doctor about dosage.  At first it didn't work for me, but I started taking clonazepam a couple of hours prior and that helped to relax me and then tizanidine worked fast and I went to sleep easier than I have in years.  Just wondering if I need a larger dosage for the spasms.  As for other symptoms... I find that I am having regular bowel movements now so I believe it is helping my IBS.  The only side effect I have had is that you do get sleepy and dizzy if you do not follow drs. instructions of going to bed immediately.

It works okay but not the best.  At least I can go to work and function if i take a small dose.  It is better than suffering.  At night, I'll take a larger dose with a pain reliever and it helps my body relax so I can relax.  Never had a problem like some of the other reviewers.  I guess it just depends on the person; we all react differently.

Yesteray woke up with horrendouos spasms. My doctor is really excellent he switched me from flexoril which was so-so for me to tizaniniine. Got as shot of toraol which helped and then went and ate dinner. WITHIN 15 minutes I felt drunk as could be I couldn't walk without assistance. I fell in the garage (thank god I wasn't driving) on the way into the house and i thought it was just me until I got on here but I swear I was hallucinating. I could not even hold my head up sitting up my neck muscles didn't seem to work. FYI I am 6'1 195 and took oly one (and the last one) 4mg tablet. I went to sleep withinn the hour but woke up 3 times an here it is midight and I am awake and my back still hurts. Oh and my mouth was like the Sahara dessert I had to get up to get a glass of water and nearly fell on my face. I've tried alot of medications over the 14yrs since the accident but this one is THE worst. We all react differently but this one an my body did NOT mix well.

Within 30 min of taking it I experienced extreme haulicinations, terrible ringing in my ears and I was so dizzy and paranoid. This drug made me so scared, I was so out of it for the first hour afyer taking it. Dr. had me try this instead of my normal flexeril which I have taken for years- I'm going back to the flexeril for my muscle spasm relief and most importantly I dont want to feel like I am loosing my mind. More severe pain I can handle serious meds such as codine, percocets without any issues or side effects...but this medicine is CRAZY. Do not take it!!

But, I only take the pm dosage. I have had migraines for several years now. I'm a 51 yo menopausal female. I have been taking this med along with other meds to control my migraines. I have been on this new med. for about 6wks now.  I makes me sleep for about 2hrs, but after that I toss and turn and have a hard time going back to sleep.  I noticed I was having nightmares and &quot;seeing things&quot;.  I thought it might be this med.  Now, that I have heard from others, I'm sure it is.  But, it has really helped with my migraines.  Knock-on-wood...I haven't had one this month.  I see my neurologist next month, so I will talk with him about side effects versus the benefits.  Good luck with your treatments.

It gives me diarrhea and nausea. I would not recommend taking this med because of the serious side effects it can cause such as stroke, heart attack, etc. I've already started weaning myself off of them because I'm also taking Celebrex which as the same  serious side effects as Tizanidine. So I'm getting a double wammy. But I've had some excruating pain for about 6 months. I suggest the Caudal ESI. It has taken away about 50% of my pain.

It is very painful. I have tried many narcotics and nerve pain relievers with poor results. When I combine tizanidine with narcotics the results are excellent. This medication has changed my life. I've found that I get severe constipation at times but it is worth it. This particular muscle relaxer is the only one that seems to work on me. I thank God and my doctors for stumbling upon this drug! Beware of withdrawal syptoms if you run out! They are as agonizing as narcotic withdrawal symptoms!

I take 1/4 every 8 hours, then 2-3 tabs at bedtime. They will make you groggy if taken with other meds, so must be careful...pain specialist will adjust other meds in one month.  Has helped with shakiness...I like this drug but if not regulated/adjusted to each individual...it could be negative for them...I say keep adjusting, it is a miracle drug! If active and driving, take lowest dosage...or none, since it reacts differently to different people. Had one hallucination but none since...just be careful of interactions with other meds.  I think it is good for me once I get to know how to adjust to my body!

I have been taking NSAID Exedrin aspirin reduce my headache pain. I went to see Neurologist doctor. He said the Exedrin aspirin isn't good because it gave me a rebound headaches! I decided to quit Exedrin which it wasn't easy! I only can take Tylenol if I get bad headaches. He prescribed me Tizanidine pills. I decided to take 2 Tizanidine pills 4mg at bedtime. It didn't give me any bad side effects. It helped me to sleep through the night. Few months later, my daily headaches were tapered little by little! Now, I no longer have chronic headaches! I adviced you all, pls do not take NSAID Exedrin aspirin. It can cause daily and rebound headaches. It's best to take Tylenol. It's safe.

What I did like was it did not give me a racing heart rate like all the other muscle relaxers did. I felt some relief this morning and will take 1/2 a pill tonight. I do feel a little tired today but, thats nothing new for me since my car accident.I think I finally found a medication that is going to work on these terrible muscle spasms I have been dealing with for over a year.I really had given up on something that will work and just figured this is how Im gonna feel.If you had bad experiences with muscle relaxers,its worth a try just start off slow.The pills are scored so you can break them in to a smaller dose.

I took this medication for migraines which was caused spasms in my neck and shoulders which is the only part of my back that is not fused and it did wonders for the spasms which took the migrains away. I do not like the vivid dreams or the dizziness but will suffice to say that over all I am not impressed but relieved that I can get a nights sleep without having spasms wake me up and keep me awake for hours and hours. I take 4 mg and it seems to work very well.

Instructions say take 4 mg tablet 3 times a day. NO WAY! I would experiment with it. I took it on a recent trip to Italy, and fainted, quite literally going down like a rock for approximately 5 minutes, according to my husband. It also caused me to hallucinate and have extremely scary dreams. Be VERY careful with this drug. I also experienced the sleep walking. I have now determined that 1/2 of a pill a little bit before bedtime and I sleep fairly well.

The only issue i have is that it does make me tired. I found that if i take it at night, I sleep great and wake up without the spasms pretty much all day. Also, I noticed that it is hard for me to get out of bed the next day. Once I'm up though, I do great with little to no spasms.

I take it for diabetic neuropathy and it is the best medicine for this very painful condition. It works better than strong narcotics. It has changed my quality of life! You will get used to it after about a month and the daytime drowsiness will decrease.The benefits definitely outweigh the side effects.I recommend it for any type of nerve damage.

She would also start falling asleep in the middle of doing something like a task. Taking 4 mg every eight hours.  After a good night sleep she has come out of this side effect.  She has taken 4 mg today.  We will see how she is doing.  Is this a narcotic?

The spasms worsen over night unless I take a tizanidine at bedtime.  If the spasms are very bad (they often lead to migraines) or if they have not been adequately controlled for several nights with one pill, I take two at bedtime.  It's been effective for minimizing them.  Tizanidine helps the spasms I have in the day, too, but usally makes me sleepy and my body too loose, so I only take one during the day if I have a lot of pain.  I have had a lot of weird reactions to other medications, but this is one of the few that has not caused scary side effects.

I have 2 herniated disc, 1 bulging disc in my lower back and degenerative disc disease. I have been on countless meds. I've had epidurals, injections, and have even had one Dr. suggest surgery. Too many &quot;war&quot; stories for me to take that into consideration, but I am going to a pain clinic, I am on pain medication, Zanaflex(tizanidine) and even recently fitted for a TENS unit and I have my life back. Not nearly all of it, I'm still in the process of filing for disability because I was a paramedic and that line of work in most definately out of the question. But just to say, to anyone of you out there that has to go through issues like I have, try to be patient, not all meds work the same way it does for others. The right combination is out there, just be sure to pick out a doctor that listens to you and has an open-mind. Good Luck and God Bless.

The 1st time I took it (4mg tablet), I got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and passed out.  I yelled out for my husband as soon as I felt the blood draining from my head.  We called the Doctor the next morning and he said, this is not the type of med you take to function, including walking,:-), at least not in the beginning.   I can take &#188; of a tablet and it puts me out, if you want to be unconscious, then this is the medication.  However, my 35-year-old son took it and he was a little dazed, but was fine.  For me, I could not even function the next day.  Therefore, it depends on the person.  I have been taking this med off and on for several years.  I have ruptured discs in my back and neck, diagnosed with Lupus 2 years ago and recently diagnosed with MS, but I am allergic to many medications, including Ibuprofen, Advil, etc., so when I find something I can take  then I go for it.  Right now, I have a script for the ZanaFlex (Tizanidine) that expired January 2008  I can take &#189; a tablet at night, sleep pretty well and not have the drugged out effect the next morning.  My Pharmacist said the med was fine; it has just weakened.  That is the only way I can take it.  So, this is a medication you have to start off slowly with, but you may find that it will really help with muscle spasms and pain. So, I say break them &amp; only take a portion, until your body adjusts.  It really does work great with muscle and bone pain.

My dosage at first was spose to be one and a half but I found that to be way, way too much, so, I took a half and that worked a heck of alot better, overall satisfied it does its job but I wouldn't take during the day!

Taken at night it helps with the muscle pain and enables me to sleep.  I am worried about addiction, but the alternative is to live in pain.

While on this medication I was unable to focus, experienced anxiety, and was overly emotional. These symptoms were experienced to the point of interfering with daily activities. I wouldn't recommend taking this drug unless it is your only option, especially while caring for children, operating a vehicle, or participating in activities which require intense concentration.

The headaches are less severe now, but I still have alot of tension in my shoulders and neck.  It does make you drowsy so its best to take at nighttime.So for mild tension it works, but for really stiff muscles, a good massage feels much better :)

Also don't drive or work after taking the pills.  It will KNOCK you out cold for four hours.  Take it only at night or if you need a nap. I notice I drool more in my sleep when I take it.  This medication is addictive, but it helps you sleep at night. Just don't take it if you have hypertension or HPB.

Muscle Spasm	mimi25yca7, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female		9/24/2008 2:15:33 PM	Both hips and low back pain kept me from finding a position to sleep in.  Also, when I would get out of bed in the morning I could hardly walk until I was up on my feet an hour or so.    I took the medication for a week with success but noted I had dizziness when I turned in bed and getting up.  Therefore, I stopped taking the medication and that solved the dizzines.   I seemed to be sleeping quite well again, and without the pain.  I also experienced severe night mares with this drug.  It worked well as far as the pain and walking is concerned.

The pain is so bad I cant get relief at all, pain to sit, walk or laydown. I only take it for three days every 8 hours along with a pain pill.  I have had so many spinal blocks I begged the dr. for a med to try. I needed something to hold me until I cound get an appt. When it flared up I started the 3 day routine and thank god it worked.  I do not take it more than 3 days, and if I start asap the drug knocks it out in about 2 days.

I did not have as many severe/migraine headaches, but I did have many severe/less common side-effects, the most severe was a loss of sense of identity. I explained it as waking up with amnesia but the only person I did not recognize was myself. I had hair loss, vision difficulties, difficulty speaking, mood swings, etc. It was a very harrowing experience and I will NEVER take this medication again!

I think it worked pretty well to begin with, but seemed to become less effective as timed passed.  I was concerned when I began to feel like my eardrums were congested or something.  I don't know if that's related or not.  But what really worried me, is when I started losing a LOT of hair over an extended period of time.  So when I checked the side effects &amp; saw that hair loss was listed, I stopped taking this medication right away.  I just don't want to take any more chances.  :(    (And it can affect your hearing also)

I just had a tumor removed from my spinal cord and didn't have the meds while I was in the hospital and I really had problems with the spasms in the legs.
