Ketamine is the only drug that has helped decrease the pain, swelling and burning associated with the rsd. I had very little side effects and the results last about 4 to 6 months. Most insurance plans will not pay for the procedure and it is expensive, but worth every cent.

That night I had nightmares, vivid hallucinations, headaches, and general distress.I called my nurse and he informed me that while this reaction is &quot;rare&quot;, it does occur in certain types of people--people that are sensitive to medication.Always discuss this with your doctor pre-procedure. I was not given the information until afterward.

General Anesthesia	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Male	45-54	7/31/2008 6:53:58 PM	I was given Ketamine as a general during reconstructive surgery after skin cancer removal.  It put me out, but I had vivid, unpleasant hallucinations for about 3 hours and then had a difficult recovery for the next few days, just feeling out of it.I was told I had to be given a relatively large dose. I am about 210 lbs and in good weight training and cardio shape.I will ask not to be treated with Ketamine in the future.
