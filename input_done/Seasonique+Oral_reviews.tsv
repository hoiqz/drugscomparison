Birth Control	A, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2		19-24	7/24/2012 2:59:11 PM	My periods have ALWAYS been late while on this pill. My period is just starting by the time I am ready to take the hormone again. I am always panicking when I know I am responsible an remember to take the pill. Totally unneeded. Thinking about switching back.  It's not worth the worry to only have four periods a year. 
Birth Control	Unhappy Drie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	6/23/2012 11:44:07 AM	At the end of this month I will make a year of being on Seasonique. This is my third birth control choice in 31 years of my life. My first choice of levlan was the smoothest. I tried ortho tri cyclen for a few pills. It made me nauseated. I was tempted after the first three months to give this pill up but my Doctor suggested I let my body get acclimated to it for a year. My third-six months was smooth sailing. I was like yeah this could work. I'm not pregnant but that would take having sex. Ha ha Anyway, now I'm definitely giving it up after I finish the placebo pills. I lost a pill one day at work last month. Nothing I can do about it. The next night I take a pill for that day and have been ever since. I've been bleeding for a month. Aggravating!! I had an appointment for another reason the day after I missed my pill my doctor assured me I did the right thing &amp; I'll be okay. What do they know? Adios Seasonique &amp; birth control except for condoms. :-)
Endometriosis	zoeygrace, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	13-18	6/21/2012 7:38:04 PM	I have polycystic ovarian syndrome and endometriosis, which in turn, create very painful periods. I've only been on seasonique for a week, and so far I have experienced mild nausea and a stomach ache for most of the days. The morning is the worst. I have had off and on diarrhea, as well. Despite my &quot;tummy issues&quot; with the pill, the good side effects have included an unusually happy mood...I haven't felt this &quot;cheery&quot; since before my periods began. I'm loving the pill because of my change in mood s, but the nausea isn't pleasant. 
Birth Control	LiveInFaith, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	6/15/2012 10:36:10 PM	I've been on Seasonique and Seasonique Lo for over 3 years, and recently my periods have been starting later and later into the placebo pill week. It seems for every period the starting time is getting worse, now I'm up to starting on a Saturday and starting a whole new pack the next Sunday. When I first started Seasonique I would start on a Thursday, now after 3 years its on a Saturday. Also over the past 2 years the pills have been making me dry during intercourse. I talk to my OB/GYN about all this and she just says its a symptom, I find it to be a abnormal side-effect. Anyone having similar issues?
Birth Control	cm, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	6/11/2012 10:25:12 PM	Was on this med for 5 years and loved it up until recently.  Pros:  No spotting or breakthrough bleeding.  Only 4 periods a year, lasting about 6 days and relatively light. Prevented pregnancy.  Cons: Slight weight gain.  Cramping the first 2 days of period.  Decreased sex drive and vaginal dryness.  Spotting after intercourse. Some acne- but cleared up with topicals.  Hair loss.  Switched to another med recently, but honestly I am about done with hormonal birth control all together.
Painful Periods	Nikki, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	6/11/2012 4:10:37 PM	Hate, hate, HATE this pill! I started taking this at the beginning of May, and the first 3 weeks were okay. I had a little spotting but nothing that a small pantyliner couldn't handle. However, I am on about week 5 right now, and I have had continuous light bleeding for about 10 days now along with mild cramping. It's not debilitating or anything but it's VERY annoying and disruptive in my daily life! I have bad breakouts around my chin and jaw area, and I feel bloated and just miserable all the time. I was advised by my doctor to finish out the 3 months and see if my body adjusts to the second pack better, but I am NEVER going on this pill again. I am starting a new job next week as well, and it sucks because I know I will feel like crap for most of the day. Do not go on this pill! One crappy period a month is better than dealing with a 24/7 one!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	6/8/2012 10:17:49 AM	I started this due to extreme flows, cramps, and mood swings. I started spotting 2 weeks after starting the pill and have not stopped. I am now having cramps every single day. To say my lebido dropped would be incorrect. It disappeared. It did control my mood swings. 
Birth Control	Nwri, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	6/7/2012 11:27:44 PM	I bleed all the time!! I started noticing the depression about 1 month after beginning this medicine! It has become worse! After feeling crazy for 6 months I tried to think of what I had changed in my life and why I was feeling this way! It hit me t started not long after I began this medicine!It has been a nightmare!
Birth Control	mshoney6, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/29/2012 5:49:45 PM	First time on the actual brand of Seasonique but have been prescribed birth where I took it like seasonique. First two weeks were awesome, then the middle of the 2nd week I started to get spotting which I knew were normal and I was expecting my period around that time. Then the spotting turned into bleeding and has been bleeding now for 16 days and counting. Advice to all the women on this pill READ THE WARNING PACKAGING! I should have read it sooner but it clearly states if spotting/bleeding continues for more than 7 days contact your doctor! I hate this birth NEVER have I experience this long of bleeding before while on birth control, and the mood swings are ridiculous. Definitely switching tomorrow I can't take the bleeding when the whole point was to have fewer periods.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	5/22/2012 11:10:16 PM	I have PMDD as well as endometriosis and ovarian cysts, you can assume my periods are a nightmare. Sometimes I would bleed for weeks others for just a day. My hormones were so out of whack, that my moods were high one minute and low the next. With this pill I can feel normal. I don't have any spotting and my periods are regular lasting 1-3 days. Though you should know it took my body 3-6 months to fully fill the effects of the drug but completely worth it for me. I could not function without it. I have been on it since the drug was released and will be on it for the rest of my life
Endometriosis	STACBA, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	25-34	5/22/2012 2:16:22 PM	I have been on Seasonique for about a year now and would NOT recommend this to anyone not looking to gain at least 10 to 20 pounds.  I started out at 122 and now am 142, this is the heaviest i've been my whole life.  The pills work great for me no spotting but i do have a period 2 weeks before the pill pack is finished. I am switching pills because i'm afraid of gaining even more weight!!!  Oh yeah and the sex drive thing you hear about this pill is totally true.  NONE AT ALL....
Birth Control	Cupcake, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	5/6/2012 4:58:24 PM	I am 24 &amp; I just started taking it today, but after reading the reviews I am really scared! My period is usually 3 days but I am really considering stopping after reading. So far I have experienced mood swings. I have seen several post about break through periods for 3-4wks that scares me can someone please help me? I only considered this for birth control &amp; the idea of 4 periods a yr :( 
Birth Control	Seasonale User, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	4/23/2012 9:53:50 PM	Great birth control! I only experienced mood swings, acne, and abdominal pain the first two weeks. Once my body adapted, I have not had any issues with this birth control. I only experience spotting when I took a pill four hours late. Other than that, if you are on top of taking the pill at the same time its a great birth control! After the first two weeks, I've experienced no weight gain, no mood swings, no breakouts, breast increased a cup size, and almost no spotting. I recommend seasonale!
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	19-24	4/12/2012 5:42:29 PM	I got switched to seasonique due to have very painful periods. After taking it for a few months I noticed that I gained weight, my face broke out more than ever and I was having the worst pains in the middle of the night. The pains is what bothered me the most.  I would wake up at 2am in so much pain I wanted to go to the hospital. I only took it for 9 months. I just couldnt deal with the pain any longer. I know everyones body reacts differently but id rather have a few days of pain throughout the day once a month then random nights every month and at 2am in the morning.  I hope people had a better experience than me.

The first cycle of 3 months was awesome, no spotting. Now I'm in the 3rd month of my 2nd cycle of pills and have been bleeding for about 3 weeks- not heavy but enough to make a mess. Also, I have gained 15 pounds in the past 8 months of starting it. I'm definitely switching due to the constant bleeding.
Endometriosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/15/2012 5:04:58 PM	At first the side effects were terrible but two years later I love it.  The side effects are gone and I have my life back.

Birth Control	mel l, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	2/9/2012 10:38:48 AM	Only 4 periods a year, yeah right! I had a 2 week period in the second month, with terrible cramps. My face broke out, and no libido. I am switching once I finish the complete 3 month pack!
Birth Control	BabyDreams, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/5/2012 6:53:20 PM	I took Seonique for 3 years. No problems at all.  Periods every 3 months with light menstration lasting 2 days.  Only very mild cramping.  However, after stopping this medication I am finding it difficult to concieve.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	1	Female	19-24	1/28/2012 7:37:50 PM	Seasonique works very well but the hormones that are in the pill make me crazy. I am so moody, spotting all the time, crying for no reason,and irritable with everything. I've been on seasonique for almost 2 yrs and I am so sick of the way it makes me feel. I will be switching birth control soon.
Birth Control	ESTX, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	1/24/2012 3:49:52 PM	I was switched to Seasonique Lo from Ortho Tri Cyclin LO (which I'd been on for several years). I have had nothing but spotting since starting Seasonique which has put a damper on things when the thought was to get away from having so many periods! I had just started my third pill pack and a couple weeks in am was spotting for 10 days and counting when I called my doctor up and finally said &quot;no more!&quot; The thought is to try LoEstrin 120 (1/20) this time and see how that goes. I've never had spotting before on a pill before this. I'm excellent about taking on-time. I've not had any acne, decreased sex drive, depression (although I am on an anitdepressant), or weight gain on the Seasonique LO. It's just what feels like a continuous period complete with crampy feeling! Ugh!
Birth Control	delawaregirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	19-24	1/13/2012 2:55:10 PM	This made me crazy. At first, I gained a few pounds, but they weren't stubborn to lose with exercise and diet. After about three months though, the crazy really came into play. I've never been a particularly emotional girl, but I began feeling depressed and insensibly angry and cried all of the time. For about a month I was a monster. I switched to LoSeasonique (a lower hormone dose version of Seasonique) and feel much better. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	1/9/2012 11:42:29 PM	I've always struggled with hormone problems, which included abnormally long-(almost 3 month long!)periods. I started using seasonique during one of my cycles and the bleeding stopped the next day. I had no cramps and it cleared up my acne completely within a week. This has been an absolute life saver for me.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Miss Molly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	12/29/2011 5:08:49 PM	I noticed a trend during the first 5 reviews under most recent; females ages 25-35 are experiencing bad results but females ages 18-24 report good results. My first quarter of Seasonique was ok accompanied by light pain near my vaginal region when I would stand, light spotting. My  sex drive is normal. I use proactiv so no unusual blemishes. My cycle came on as scheduled but lasted 7 days with bad cramps. The second quarter of Seasonique the 1st pack was the same as the 1st qtr. The frustration began with the 2nd pack in the 2nd qtr. I was in severe pain &amp; bleed the entire pack until I went to my ob/gyn office &amp; began meds for a bacterial infection. Once I compleyed the rx I still bleed but wasn't in as much pain. Thr last pack of the qtr I continued to bleed until my period. My period is on now &amp; I have had cramps everyday. I'm use to cramps the 1st &amp; maybe 2nd day of my 5 day period. So far no babies! I hope by the 3rd qtr these symptoms minimize &amp; I can enjoy the benefits of Seasonique. The Dr told me to hang in thrre your body has to get use to birth control. I wanted to switch to Morena but she said my body would go through the same process all over again. Plus this is affordable, $12 for 3 packs. Yeah!

The acne was huge and painful -on face and chest. First batch of pills was horrible had spotting for almost 2mths. I had problems with cramping also, and no sex drive. Think very careful when taking this. 
Endometriosis	Kennedy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	12/27/2011 9:46:29 AM	I am on my second month of the pills and I have learned that YOU HAVE TO TAKE THEM THE SAME TIME EVERY DAY or you will experience vomiting, morning sickness, lots of spotting and/or bleeding, cramping, headaches, acne, being tired all the time and breast tenderness. When I started taking them everyday at or around the same time everyday, the symptoms subsided and I felt fine. But you also have to take them on a full stomache or at best, at night. I missed only one day and was late by a couple hours the next day on taking my pills due to being distracted by the holidays and I experienced all these symptoms again. You have to be consitent for the drug to work properly. I was not told this as I was on other types of bc pills and they were not quite so nim-picky. Just take them as suggested and they will work fine.
Birth Control	dijoboo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	12/27/2011 9:19:27 AM	I thought I was going crazy with all these side affects, I really thought it was me. The first month was good, but the 2nd and 3rd have been constant spotting. It is INSANE! I definitely have the &quot;I don't care&quot; attitude. I didn't get acne at all.  There is no way I could get pregnant because I didn't have a sex drive. And I felt so disqusting from the spotting that I didnt want to have sex. I am 39 with a 15 year old daughter and I dont want anymore kids. So I found a personal fix next year Im getting my tubes tied and taking the kid to the beach.lol.  I would not recommend this particular birth control but everyone's body is different.  But good luck if you do take it.
Birth Control	maf426, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	12/20/2011 11:14:13 PM	Like many others, I have had continual bleeding for 2 months. I considered starting my second 3 month pack (I was told it could last up to 6 months) but I don't want to risk and deal with the continued bleeding, the mood swings, and the low libido any longer. The lure of a few periods a year is nice, I was on depo for years and didn't have a period (gained a lot of weight though and once I went off it, had some minor health issues), but as with seasonique, I'd rather deal with my monthly cycle on a regular, short term basis, than continual bleeding and related inconveniences. 
Painful Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	12/9/2011 6:57:41 PM	It was terrible at first but I am so glad that I stuck with it. The third month I had a period that lasted nearly a month, but after that my periods have been short, consistent, light, and painless. I haven't gained any weight or had problems with acne, but my hair did go from curly to straight which has been strange.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/7/2011 1:18:22 PM	Great overall birth control, I was using for e yrs no problems.. 4 periods a year was awesome! Each only lasted four days :) I would recommend!!

Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	None, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	11/17/2011 8:06:13 PM	I was on Seasonique for over two years. It seemed ok at first, but then as an avid marathon runner and super healthy eater I slowly gained 7 pounds on a 5 4' frame. No matter what I did, I just couldn't drop the extra weight. On the second pack I always started feeling like I had little hope in anything, and my breasts hurt, and my sex drive was barely present. I just recently figured all of this out and got off this drug. I DROPPED THE WEIGHT IMMEDIATELY. I also have a sex drive again, and my blood sugar stays more stable. It's freaky, but getting off this drug changed my life. 
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	13-18	11/7/2011 6:48:25 PM	At first the sound of only having 4 periods a year sound great but however within maybe a month or two I began to realize I have become a bit more moody. A little after that I started to realized my periods were starting to get really heavy and I was having severe menstrual cramps. Now I have migranes that last for about 2 days. The reason I was even on the birth control was because I get cyst on my ovaries and even that pain is coming back. Im going to go to my doctor about this. I would NOT recommend this drug at all! 
Birth Control	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female		11/5/2011 1:04:45 PM	I &quot;second&quot; all those who experienced a libido crash. The topper was when my period started a week early, and coming up on its third week still a heavy flow, to boot!! Not pleased at ALL. The allure of 4 periods a year is absolutely not worth it when your period lasts three+ weeks. Lesson learned ... 
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	11/5/2011 11:09:08 AM	It seems like many of the reviewers have gone off of this pill very quickly, but I have stayed on it for well over two years now and can say that it does get better in the sense that your bleeding will regulate (I very rarely get mild spotting and it's more mildly annoying than it is painful or upsetting). That, however, is pretty much the only good thing about it. I began taking Seasonique simply because I was already on the Pill for my out of whack hormones and wanted to have a period every three months instead of each one. Ladies, it is NOT worth it. My hair used to be very thick and wavy but it's thinned drastically and lost its wave almost completely. Even my eyebrows have thinned! They used to be very dark and prominent (a thing I liked about them) but now they're so much lighter. Seasonique has also made me fatigued and (sorry if this is TMI) gives you crazy bad vaginal discharge. Gross. I've been off of it for three days now and can't wait for it to be out of my system. Here's hoping my hair and eyebrows will grow back.
Birth Control	83MrsCampbell94, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	11/3/2011 8:20:22 PM	This birth control was literally, the worst thing I have ever been through.  The first 3 months, I was into my last month and I bled the whole month and it was the worst pain ever.  I got the second pack hoping it wouldnt happen again but, it did again plus blood clots. I bled for another month.  It didnt work for me at all I switched back to my original birth control. 
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	womensstudies, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	25-34	10/20/2011 7:08:57 PM	I have been on Seasonique for about 3 years now. After my body settled down from the initial issues of pack 1, my doctor suggested that I just make it a 2 month period because of how bloated I felt and how much my breasts hurt when I tried to go through month 3. This worked o.k. so I kept on it for 3 years. Now I am depressed, with mood swings and no history of depression. Look, I don't mind larger breasts, but I do mind the soreness, the problems if you miss a single pill or miss it by just a few hours. I just recently realized that my anxiety, night sweats, skin problems, sadness/anger, and that 7 pounds that I suddenly COULD NOT get off (even when I run 10-20 miles a week and do pilates) all started around when I started this pill. Thank you everyone for sharing. I am going to get off this pill today and hope to return to the hopeful even-keeled person that I used to be. I hope this helped someone else who has been on this pill for over a year.
Birth Control	lulu, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	10/17/2011 8:16:37 PM	I started this pill about 2 months ago on the account that I have severe migranines. The first two weeks were great but as soon as I hit the 2 weeks mark my weight jumped up 7lbs and my face broke-out horribly. I am an advent cyclist. I cycle over 30 miles a day 4 to 5 times a week and have a very healthy diet... so I know it's not lack of exercise nor an unhealthy diet! The worse part, I started not spotting as they say but a mild period soon after and it has not stopped since (for 3 weeks now). I just recently started noticing sever mood swings, hair loss and very dry eyes. I contacted my doctor and explained to her the situation and she told me it's normal to experience these symptoms up to 6 months! I'm sorry but it's just not worth becoming a fat, bald, mood killing partner! The spotting alone is enough to turn you off let alone your partner! I feel bad for my guy!! I'm getting off this pill ASAP!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	9/18/2011 1:25:02 AM	I feel so nauseous that I want to puke sometimes.  I have gained sooooo much weight and am very upset about it.  I am on a calorie restrictive diet and exercise 5 times a week, yet all I do is continue to gain weight.  How is this even scientifically possible?  I used to have clear skin, but now have gross pimples forming everywhere (even on my neck).  I am a tyrant now and my husband is begging me to go off this pill due to my sudden mood swings.  He says I'm not myself.  Worst part is I have NO SEX DRIVE whatsoever now, I used to be a real vixson in the bedroom.  Nothing good to say about this pill.  Only good thing is I haven't had any spotting at all.  May be losing my hair though, but I've always had thin hair, so not sure if it's actually getting worse but seems like it is.  Oh, and yes, I too am experiencing dryness down below.
Birth Control	Anonymous, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	9/17/2011 1:56:02 AM	I have been taking Seasonique for almost two months now. The first month only gave me mild problems. Some severe cramping, a couple days of breakthrough bleeding and sweating, but nothing more. However, once I got into the second month I started having major problems. I have been bleeding for almost a month straight. In addition to having a medium-flow period, I've been having light to moderate spotting, with no end in sight. In the past week or so I've also experienced vaginal irritation (probably from the relentless bleeding.) My libido disappeared for the first month and a half. It's back now, not that it matters, because if I tried to have sex right now it'd be incredibly painful. If you think that having only four periods per year sounds good, well, it does... Unfortunately, just this month I've had enough &quot;periods&quot; to last me five months. If you value your sanity, do not take this pill.

I have tried this pill two different times. Both times....the first month is great, then the depression kicks in. You get this &quot;I don't care about anything feeling&quot;. The spotting is terrible and I take my pill every night at the same time. I gave it a fair try because of the great idea of 4 periods a year....never again!!!
Birth Control	loveandgrace8, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	9/13/2011 6:19:16 PM	I got on seasonique 3 months ago. Since I got on it I have experienced bleeding every single day, to the point that it seemed alarming. Although my doctor said breakthrough bleeding was normal for the first few months I decided to switch off. Bleeding for months kind of obviously killed the mood with my boyfriend. This pill is ridiculous. I would not reccomend it to anyone
Birth Control	KynLovieBoopie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	9/13/2011 6:04:57 PM	I took this pill for a little over a year... Im 22. I exercise, eat healthy, and I have a 2yr old child. With this pill I experienced: random spotting, random headaches that would last a day and a half minimum, breast tenderness/soreness, chest pains, legs/arms felt funny at times, mood swings, and did I mention SPOTTING! I did not get pregnant, that was a plus, and I did not bleed as much as I did with the shot the year that I took it, but still the spotting was random, and frequent, and the random cramps were annoying. I would also have random bloating. No weight gain, but it did cause acne at certain times of the month. I stopped taking the pill for about a week last month to see if I would notice any changes, and I did. All of the symptoms listed above went away and then returned upon my taking of the pill again. I have switched to BEYAZ and will be trying it for the first time tonight, hopefully I will like it better.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	13-18	9/8/2011 10:28:35 AM	It seems like others have had this problem..but this pill gave me full periods for months at a time. The first pack went fine. On the second pack, around the second month, I got my period. It lasted for over a month. I went to the doctor: he said it was from stress (I had just graduated high school) and to take the sugar pills for a week, then start a new pack. Kind of like restarting a computer. So, I did that, and everything was good till I got to the second month again. I started a period, but I thought it was from the stress of going to college. I've been in college for a month now, and have had my period for almost 6 weeks. I have also had mood swings, which I originally thought may have been from moving out of my home, but reading the reviews, I am beginning to think otherwise. Needless to say, I'm going back to a regular pill. Hope this helps. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	haley, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	13-18	9/2/2011 10:03:56 AM	I've been on this pill for 5 days and I can't stand to take another pill. I'm a happy person all the time but ever since I've been on seasonique I cry all the time &amp; if I'm not I feel as if I'm about to. I'm finding any reason to get mad and have a fit. Basically I'm an emotional wreck because of this pill. Its not worth it I'm going to find another birth control
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/27/2011 12:42:01 PM	I have been on seasonique for almost two years.  Its been a great experience for me.  I have had one real period that last two days.  I did have about a 6 week issue with spotting once but haven't since then. That was during my 2nd pill pack.  I am not the best at taking it at the same time everyday but do make sure I take in a general time frame. No weight gain, acne didn't improve or get worse.  the main problem I have with this birth control is the price.  Even with insurance its over $100.00.  
Birth Control	Washu, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/17/2011 1:40:38 AM	I loved this pill. Was on it for nearly 2 years. The only problem I had was sometimes I'd spot for 2-3 weeks. But I feel that was more my fault than the pill's since it would happen when I missed a dose throughout the three months. I'd recommenced it.
Birth Control	kkmswt4l, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	8/16/2011 12:52:18 AM	The number one thing is that i cannot keep up with taking this pill at the same time everyday, I dont really have a stable schedule and i forget sometimes. But with that said, the symptoms are horrible and not even worth the 4 periods a year. I'm in month two,(month one wasn't so bad), but i've noticed an increased mood swing where i'm depressed and just wanting to cry about everything. The worst part is the spotting. I can't even have sex because of how disgusting it would be. Yeah, i haven't gotten prgnant, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO HAVE SEX:) I would get really dizzy outta no where and have these weird cramps. I would not recommend this drug to anyone cause it seems to be too unpredictable to anyone who takes it. 
Birth Control	Cheer.Bear, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	7/20/2011 5:46:15 PM	Did this work as a birth control? Yes; I had frequent, unprotected sex with my boyfriend and didn't get pregnant. However, after the first month of my first pack, my period started and nearly two months later is still going. This is not breakthrough bleeding or spotting, this is a moderate period. I'm an active, 21 year old and this absolutely didn't do what it said it would. Plus, of all the birth controls I've been on (Nuva, Ortho tri cyclin), this has been the worst for acne. Contrary to the advertisements for this birth control, this work better for older women. 
Birth Control	ginandtonic, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	7/15/2011 5:45:04 PM	This is the 3rd birth control pill I have tried and I hated it more than the last. I was alright for the first month; besides breast tenderness and a small bit of acne, I didn't really have side effects. The second month rolled around and thats when The extreme fatigue, weakness, and insomnia showed up. I began feeling depressed and not like myself. My face broke out like crazy. The scariest side effect I had was the slight tingling and numbing sensations in my legs and arms. I stopped taking my pills 4 days ago. The first pill of week 10 was my last. I have yet to start my period and am beginning to freak out because I NEVER missed a pill and on the last birth control it always came the 2nd day. I am seriously hoping the pill just messed up the timing of my period and I am not pregnant. I am switching to the patch, and if that doesn't work I am forever giving up on hormonal birth control because all I've had is problems!

I have experienced almost no side effects.  I do seem to be a little more moody just before I start my third month doses, but not every time.  I can even remember the last time I had a period.  I only keep panty-liners on hand just in case I need it when it does come.  I think that I remember having a few normal ones in the year but were very light. I absolutely love it but because I just lost my insurance I will need to give it up.  I'm a little freaked out about having to choose another one. LOVE!!!!   
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	19-24	7/10/2011 10:43:54 PM	The first month my breast were sore but once my body got used to the medication its has been nothing but great. the first 3 months i spotted but havnt since then. ive been on it for over a year and havnt had any really any problems.
Painful Periods	BJ5, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	7/5/2011 12:19:40 PM	I was prescribed Seasonique to cut down on my periods, which are painful, and at 49 yrs. old I am sick of having them! I took the pill for 7 weeks without any problems, other than nausea and bloating, gained 3 lbs. Then, I began spotting, then bleeding like a regular period for 2 wks. now. I discontinued use of this medication. It's not worth it to me. 
Painful Periods	HMC, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	7/4/2011 3:16:16 PM	This is my first week on Seasonique and by day two I was having fogginess, blurred vision, nausea, and a weird over all feeling. This can't be right and I'am not sure if I will continue this medication. I may seak out another alternatives with my pracitioner. The purpose was to stop my cycle altogether thereby eliminating the severe pain, crampimng and nausea I have along with my cycle post Novasure. If after day two is any clue as to how my body is going to react then this is not for me. I am totally lost but not to the point of more surgery.  Any advice?
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	7/2/2011 8:13:58 AM	The first month was great....I'm into my second pack I got my period and its on its seventh day. Have now experienced sickness and leg cramps. Going back to dr. On Wednesday to see what the deal is. The plus is I have lost a few lbs. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	6/20/2011 11:47:26 PM	Only take this pill if you want to become fat and irrationally miserable.  Oh, and it worked totally backwards for me.  It advertises that you'll only have your period once every three months.  Well for me, I had it EVERY DAY for three months straight.  The only reason I didn't get pregnant is because I was too fat and miserable for any man to bother with.As soon as I switched to a different pill, I lost 4 pounds in the first week without changing my diet or exercise routine.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	6/16/2011 11:15:07 PM	Hated it.  I spotted nearly every week after the first month of pills.  My sex drive took a nose dive and when I did have sex I was nervous about more spotting. I tried it for a whole year to try to get my.body used to it but recently switched back to my old pill (Yasmin).
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	6/3/2011 12:12:17 AM	I started this medication about 6months ago. started out great, loved only having my period Q3months, but now that I am noticing trends about myself and my cycles, I am seeing that this drug is horrible.  In the third month of every pack, I feel manic depressive and almost suicidal (to the point where i have jeopardized a great relationship and great job). I constantly have a nasty greyish yellow discharge that sometimes smells, sometimes doesnt, but will not go away! I am disgusted... I have never had painful periods, but I swear, my last period, i felt like each tampon was going to burst my cervix (ouch!). I have had no spotting or acne, but I am normally a very fit person and I have been having trouble maintaining my tone. Bottom line, I miss my regular period and cant wait to get off this drug.

Before this I was on Seasonale and I used that for years. I absolutely love this birth control because of how short the periods are and I have absolutely NO cramps! 
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	Brandy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	5/9/2011 7:13:55 PM	I have been on this pill for 7 months now. at first I loved it, but the longer I took it the more side effects showed up.  Moodiness, fatigue, and then my hair began to fall out!!  ALOT! I'm stopping this pill IMMEDIATELY and praying my hair will stop falling out once the medicine gets out of my system.  This med will seriously throw your hormones out of balance. I have hormonal migraines and those too have started to increase since taking this bc. I have decided to stop all synthetic bc and try naturally getting my body straightened out.  I have ovarian cysts and was told the only way to treat these was by bc pills.  but when I started researching the cause of the cysts I found those to be hormonal related too.  I feel for 11 years I have been treated with cover-up's and quick fixes and not really getting to my real problem!  I just want to cry!  If any of you ladies have any of the same problems look into natural ways to get your body's hormones back in balance.  I'm going to give it a shot.. I'm so sick of meds that cover it up or make it worse!  MY HAIR IS FALLING OUT!!  Again I pray from the hormone imbalance.  Take at your own risk and I hope my post will help someone else.

I'm 30 years old and just found out my estrogen was coming back at menopausal levels. I've been so sick for the past few months and no one could figure out why. Hot flashes, headaches and severe fatigue. After being passed off by doctor after doctor my OB-GYN finally figured it out. Seasonique had made my estrogen drop and she assured me it's not actually menopause. They changed my pill and finally relief! Other than that it was extremely convenient to only have 4 periods a year. 
Birth Control	JMaddox, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	4/28/2011 9:35:00 PM	I started taking seasonique almost 6 months ago. I am on the last month of my 2nd pack. The doctor recommended this birth control because I have terrible migraines and the fact of having 4 periods a year was very appealing to me. I did great for the first 2 weeks but since then I have been bleeding or spotting every day. Again.. this has been almost 6 months. When I do have a 'scheduled' period it is excessively heavy, which it never was before. The doctor said to hang in there until my body gets used to it but I am about to give up. 6 months of bleeding is a little much. I will say the pill has been the only thing to work in getting rid of my migraines which is the only reason I have hung in as long as I have. Honestly if there are other options out there I suggest giving them a try. Other than the headaches I have been very unsatisfied with this birth control.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	_jennababy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/25/2011 1:02:20 AM	I have been on this pill for one month and so far it has worked wonders. Before I continue, keep in mind, all of our bodies and hormones are different. I'm 20, have been on various pills since the age of 12, including the depo shot, due to menorrhagia. (Excessive bleeding) I was taking yasmin for a year and I was a complete psycho. I switched to zovia, and bled for 3 months straight (hence the menorrhagia). Since taking seasonique the last month, I haven't had any break throughs which is an excellent sign so far. I haven't noticed weight gain, or fatigue any more than I normally suffer from. Over all, it is effective with decreasing my menstrual cycles. Just keep in mind each of us are different. (:

I thought something was seriously wrong. I have been on my period for three weeks now, tampons don't even work. Huge clots!! Awful mood swings!! Crying for no apparent reason!! I have all these exams scheduled for nothing after reading these reviews, I now know what the problem is. I am furious of the amount of people that had to experience these terrible side effects. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG. 
Other	tawb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	4/13/2011 6:20:52 PM	I took this medication because I had severe migraines during my menstrual cycle.  I am NOT taking it for birth control as my husband had a vasectomy.  I have not had any spotting in between, no bleeding - a slight headache during what would have been my period last month. So far it has worked for me very well - side effects not really noted - all medication works differently for different people but this has worked very well for what i was trying to do, which is stop migraines.

I had a tubligation in '05 BUT I need the pills to help control my PMDD and it does with MUCH success!  I was spotting a bit during the 1st pack but it has trailed off to not spotting at all and my acne has completely cleared up. I can't say whether or not I had mood swings bc I'm emotional to begin with but anything is better than the mood swings with PMDD. I still get slight cravings whem my period is supposed to start, breast tenderness, and a bit tiresome but overall I'm very happy. 
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	4/11/2011 11:59:09 PM	I absolutely love Seasonique. I've been taking it for about a month now, and I've had no spotting, no mood swings...basically no negative side effects whatsoever! It's regulated my period and it has even caused my breasts to grow a cup size, which I'm very happy about (I was just a B before). Overall, I highly recommend Seasonique.

He then switched me over to Seasonique. I've been taking it for two weeks now and I plan to stop it today. I've been extremely dizzy and moody since I started. I hoped the symptoms would pass but its become unbearable. I'm going to have to try something else.

Almost immediately, my mood shifted, I couldn't stop crying (something I rarely do) and I experienced strange numbness in my left foot from time to time. The doctor didn't think it was related, but I finally stopped taking the drug 6 months later and I felt like my old self again - happy and no numbness in my foot. I was 45 at the time. A girlfriend told me she had a similar experience with serious mood swings, went off it, and was back to normal. I've been back on the low dose monthly pill and feeling great.

Ive had lapo surgery a little over a year ago. I still have severe pain when I have my period.I have been on the shot and HATED it, my doc gave me 2 optoins either get pregnant or stop my periods. I absoulty want kids but cant afford to have them yet so chose to be on this pill and it does have its side effects but I am afaid to let my endo get worse. So i just deal. I know it also effects my husband cause i have no sex drive what so ever to the point i dont even want to be touched. My breast have gotten grossly huge and i work out almost every day and cant lose any weight. I have gained about 15 lbs during all of this.

Since being on seasonique, I lost a little weight, and I had an increased libido, which I'm satisfied with, but one thing I'm not happy with, is my face broke out horribly for the first time in my life. I've always had naturally clear skin, but since being on this I break out badly. I had no spotting inbetween the first 3 months, but a week before I started the yellow pills i had horrible cramps, and since starting my period I've had. Crippling cramps, and A LOT of bleeding. Midol doesn't really help with the cramps due to how severe they are. This birth control isn't worth it and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, I'm switching back.

My first round was great with no spotting, but the second round came with a couple of weeks of spotting due to not taking it at the same time everyday. I went to the seasonique website and signed up for pill reminders sent to my phone! I now get a text message every morning reminding me to take my pill at the same time! I haven't had any other side effects and would rcommend this to everyone!!!

The 2nd packaged I started everything back to normal. No spotting and I only got my period during the last row of pills.  Periods are light.  A little weight gain but for me it's in all the right places.

I am 46 and premenapasal.  First month was great. Second month started light bleeding. I am still bleeding and am supposed to have a period soon. Called doctor and he is changing me to Seasonique(I am on LoSeasonique) to see if it will stop the breakthrough bleeding.  I will give it one more 3 month pack. The hair loss stopped and migraines are better. Hate thebleeding. I think it is making me feel tired
Birth Control	michelle, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	12/28/2010 6:29:20 PM	Beginning with week 5 I started heavy spotting that lasted until the end of the third month when my prescribed cycle was set to begin.  The spotting was initially very heavy (for three weeks, then gradually reduced to just light spots).  I noticed marked improvement when I set my alarm clock to take the pill at exactly the same time each day.  I did notice mild mood swings that first month, but those dissipated over time.  Breasts were also swollen and tender during this time.  I felt slightly anemic, had lowered energy levels and increased fatique due to the continued bleeding. Once I started my second pill package, all sysmptoms stopped and I have been very happy with this pill.
Birth Control	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	11/9/2010 10:36:16 PM	I love this pill.  I've had a little spotting on toilet paper when I wipe.  Pretty much nothing else.  It hasn't lasted days or even one day.  My headaches have lessoned and I hope with only four periods a year they will go completely away.  I have set my alarm to take my pill at the exact time every day.  Maybe I won't spot then, but I don't know.  I've been on BC pills for a while now and I have spotted before.  I really like this pill.  I've read some comments here. I haven't gained any weight. I'm not moody.  As a matter of fact I think I'm happier.  I only have two days of real menstrual bleeding now.  I used to have six or seven.

I just started my 3rd week of month 2 &amp; have had spotting for the past 2 weeks! It's not alot but is still very annoying and frustrating. I've also been nauseated about every day for the past 3 weeks, I'm thinking it's time yet again to switch birth controls.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	19-24	10/13/2010 10:38:55 AM	This is my first birth control pill. Trying to give it a chance but I've never been so moody in my life. I have also broke down to tears over nothing more than 5 times in a month. Its a little scary how out of control I am with emotions and sadness. I am normally a super happy person too. This is rough. I'm getting off of the pill this week.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	mommyof1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	10/12/2010 12:14:03 AM	After I stopped nursing my son I decided to get back on the pill due to my periods were irregular and lasted 9-10 days. I asked my dr about Seasonique and he gave me a prescription saying it was pretty much like every other pill.  I liked the idea of only having 4 periods a year so I started taking it.  The first two weeks had some minor spotting, then it gradually became enough that I had to start wearing a tampon. By the fifth week the spotting turned into bleeding like a period.  I was moody, emotional, tired, nauseous the whole time I was on it.  I've been off it now for 8 days and the bleeding still hasn't stopped.  I'm calling my dr tomorrow to see how to get this to stop.  I never would have tried this pill if I had read these reviews first. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  I would rather have one period a month then bleed endlessly.  This is SO not worth it.  
Birth Control	reviewbot, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	9/20/2010 4:53:57 PM	I was having some spotting issues with my old tri-phasic pill, probably because of my age, and I was interested in the whole skipping periods thing so my doctor had me try Seasonique. Things started out fine, I only had a day of very minor spotting each of the first 2 months during when I would have normally gotten my period. Starting month 3 though, the spotting became more frequent. I gained a few pounds and felt bloated as well. Then every few days I would have abdominal pain that would last a couple of days. It hurt to walk, to sit, even hurt to go to the bathroom. Owww. I figured things would sort out as soon as I had a period since obviously I had just skipped 2 months. The period came, but was painful and lasted longer than the advertised 3 days. After that, there was no more pain, but the frequent spotting persisted, I would say 7-8 days out of 10. It wasn't profuse, but certainly very annoying. I hung with it for another cycle and now beginning month 6, that awful pain has started again. Went to the doctor today and said, okay, that's enough. Something else to consider: this is an expensive medication and insurance would not cover it but luckily my doctor gave me samples. Another minus, the pack it comes in is big and bulky. It is labeled for a Sunday start only as well, so if you like to start your pill on a different day you may have to do your own labels. I feel I gave it a fair chance but wasn't happy. Your mileage may vary of course, everybody is different.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/14/2010 7:39:56 PM	I had taken two other types of birth control pills before I was put on this one. The other two were horrible and the side effects were crazy and made me feel like pills were not an option for me. But after about a month on seasonique I knew it was the pill that would work for me. I had no side effects what so-ever and my acne cleared up in about two months and I have not had a break out since. I did have a period for the first two months and on the second month I had two, but after that I have not had one until I was on the yellow pills. I like the fact that when I do have a period it is very light and lasts about three days at the most. I do have a little trouble remembering to take the pill everyday, but I put a reminder on my phone that went off during the day and that helped. I love this pill and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to try it. I do know that every pill will not work for everyone, so sometimes you just have to be patient and find the one that is right for you and your body. 
Birth Control	Seriously Disappointed, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	9/9/2010 3:03:07 AM	I have been on seasonique for 6 weeks. On the first day, my period came on again for 5 more days then when I began my second pack it came on again. As of 9.9.10, I have been on my period for 11 days now. My breasts have been sore and my weight loss has cease since being on pill. I will discontinue this drug after reading additional posts and my experiences. Outside of birth control, my initial attraction to the pill was the 1 period a quarter. I've already had 2 periods while on the second pack only and they've cumalatively lasted 15 days and counting so far. I will not recommend this pill to anyone.

My sex drive vanished. It just wasn't worth the adjustment time - assuming things would have gotten better. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	8/25/2010 10:11:21 AM	I've always had major issues with severe cramps and ovarian cysts related to my period, so I would take birth control that would extend my period (Seasonale, Yasmin, Seasonique, trying Zovia next week). This started out fine, then severe spotting for a few weeks during the second tray, then everything was fine during the third tray. Everything went smoothly during the second pack. The third pack was back to spotting during the first tray, fine during the second, severe spotting during the third. Next pack was fine. While I am susceptible to depression (thanks, Mom!), I feel like this medication made my emotions really wild and uncontrollable at times. Everyone's different though. I didn't get acne or gain weight, which was a benefit. Hopefully other people have a better experience than I did! But the endless spotting, which started as a nuisance, got ridiculous and started to interfere with my life. The increased libido was pretty nice though, except when I was spotting like crazy!

Endometriosis	DPAGE22, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	7/21/2010 9:28:05 PM	STROKE!!! I was using birth control for 10yrs because endometriosis...28yrs old when I had the stroke 11-11-2009. The pill i was on did nothing...I changed because my Dr. said it was time for a change. So then 2 months later i was taken Seasonique, and WhAM, I had a stroke. I was paralyzed on the right side from my head to the toes. Now with Speech, Physical Therapy, Occupation Therapy, it's hard. Now i can speak a little, i am walking with a limp. I feel lucky because it affects my communications ability in my left side of the brain. i just wanted everyone to know that it can and will happen to you.I pray everyday that this Seasonique gets to the point of not making it no more. For 10YEARS I was on Ogestrel, NO side effects, BUT 2MONTHS on Seasonique equals a STROKE. I do not want a another female to be fine and STROKE. i am lucky, I am 29years old, I got through the Birthday wish, now I fighting everyday to win this battle.
Birth Control	jkf, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	7/19/2010 10:29:26 PM	I have been on birth control since i was 15. I am now 35. I have been on Orthotri for a long time, but i have lupus and my periods just make me sick. I figured maybe just having less periods would be better. i've only been on the seasonique for 3 weeks now, but i notice a difference in my mood. I am also sweating like crazy! I cannot stop sweating. I'm constantly hot. I don't know if anyone else experienced this but i don't know if i can stay on this pill. its too bad. i really wanted less periods but on othrotricyclen i felt like i wasn't on anything. this pill i feel like i am medicated.

The first month great then the second month came along and spotting(not really more like a regular period)it lasted for a month.I contacted my doctor made an appt.He said it was normal and to stick with it!I took his professional advice and completed the 3month cycle.HOWEVER I never stopped bleeding. I stopped taking it!

But this past period has lasted 10 days, which I have NEVER had since I was 12.  I've called my doctor and have an appt. in the morning.  I'm switching off this pill.
Painful Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	7/11/2010 11:41:09 AM	I took Seasonique for one month and the side effects were have been so debilitating I had to stop.  My side effects: weight gain of 6+ lbs in one month, breast tenderness, constipation accompanied by gas and bloating, lethargy spanning from feeling &quot;run-down&quot; to complete exhaustion where I slept for 19 hours, extremely painful cramping with diarrhea.  When I started bleeding the cramps were worse than ever before (part of the reason I began taking Seasonique was to lessen the pain and cramping associated with my cycle).  The cramping has been debilitating for 4 days now and is only mildly relieved with Pamprin.  My intention was to ride out the adjustment period but I couldn't and stopped taking the medication 2 days ago. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Database Diva, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	6/26/2010 9:44:29 AM	July 2009 was when I noticed that my menstral cycle was freaking out and there was no more 28 days in between. I was lucky to get 18 days. Also, they were lasting longer - instead of 5-7 days, they were 7-10 days and heavy cramping, bleeding, and pain. Now - I am 40 years old. I am expecting things to go a little out of control but this was severely impacting my life. In February 2010, I went to my doctor because I was anemic and exhausted from the constant battle with this issue. My doctor prescribed progestrone to hopefully stop the cycles and help me to get back on track. This made things worse and my anemia was very bad. I was ghostly white, no energy, and missing work because of pain. I was prescribed a new drug named Seasonique. Seasonique stops mentral cycles for 3 months at a time which was what I needed to fix the anemia and low energy. It worked. I had energy, was hitting the gym 4-5 times a week and I felt great. With my long awaited vacation coming up where I had 5 days at home and a 4 day hiking trip planned, I needed this. One month later, my doctor noticed some superficial blood clots in my lower left leg. No big deal. An aspirin a day would take it away. Another 20 days later, I get a doppler, an ultrasound of the veins, which informs me that I have some very big and bad blood clots that were very serious in my left leg. Immediately, I was pulled off the Seasonique and on April 28th, I was given Lovenox shots to inject myself with and Coumadin. April 30th, I was placed on bedrest for the weekend as my doctor suspected something more but couldn't get me into the specialist until Monday, May 3rd. May 3rd, I go to the doctor and was immediately hospitalized with a CT of the chest within hours of admission. They found several blood clots in both of my lungs. I was in bad shape whereas the week before I had felt great. I have a long road to recovery. Six months of Coumadin, getting blood tested every Monday, seeing a specia
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	6/20/2010 1:48:26 AM	I was fine for the first 3 weeks of taking this, then I started spotting, and now, 4 weeks later, I am still bleeding, and not just spotting - more like a regular period. I stopped taking it 3 days ago and have not noticed a change. I suppose the upside is that I do not appear to be pregnant. I am 28, sexually active, non-smoker who has never had children. I have also experienced the increased appetite that others have reported. I am abstaining from sex and have an appointment to switch to a different pill in a few days. With side effects that are supposed to be rare actually seeming pretty common, it makes me worry how effective this pill really can be at doing its intended job.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	atthompson27, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	6/14/2010 1:09:12 AM	Seasonique definitely gave me shorter, lighter periods and no cramping; however, this medication gives me chronic yeast infections! I have been having them for the 3 years I've been taking the pills. I long suspected that it might be the pills causing them, but I didn't stop because of the aforementioned benefits &amp; I thought the onset of the yeast infections could have just been coincidental. Recently I went off the pill for 3 months &amp; went from 2 infection a month to 0 in 3 months. I got back on the pill Wednesday &amp; I already have a yeast infection (It's Sunday). No other pill has done this &amp; I'm taking the low estrogen this time. Oh well, I'd rather suffer from the heavy periods than the infections :(

I had a tubal 9 yrs ago so not needed for b/c. I swelled up like a blow fish on Seasonique. My legs and feet especially. And I bled from day one for more than 3 weeks. It was worse than why I started using them in the first place. I stop taking these and am back as I was before. Not sure now what's the best way to stop these heavy periods other than a hysterectomy.

I started using it for ovarian cyst prevention and to ease my extremely heavy, painful periods. At first I developed a rash, which subsided once my body got used to the drug. I had spotting around the end of the second month, so after about a year of this pattern, I switched to a two month cycle instead of three. It works great for me, no spotting and easier periods! 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/12/2010 12:54:41 PM	There are many negative reviews of this product but I have not suffered any of this negative side effects. Everybody is different. I love not having a period every month. I still have a very active libido and I have not had any spotting. I make sure to take the pill every day at the same time. I assume if you miss a pill it increases your chances of having some break through bleeding.

I spotted for 3 days in the second month and that's all the bleeding I had and absolutely no symptoms.  I chose to lay off the birth control for a while and began a new cycle this year and I am at the end of the second month.  The first month I had two weeks of bleeding and intense mood swings...I am eating healthy and dieting but seem to have hit a plateau in my weight loss.  WHAT IS GOING ON....this product was amazing once before...why can't it be amazing again :(

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	4/14/2010 3:08:09 PM	I have been on this pill for 11months now.  In the beginning I experienced very heavy cramps and clots, which I have never had before.  I have gained 10 lbs and had my first leg cramp that Ive ever had in my lifetime of many sports.  I do get bad gas and my sex drive has decreased.  I started taking it for migraines.  On the bright side, the migraines are lessened during the two months of no period, but on the period month, I get major headaches;almost liked it combined the last two months together.  Also, I was very moody and now I find Im not as extreme with my moods.  I think I will switch back to Tri-phasil as I dont like the weight gain. Even with working out and watching what I eat, I cant lose the weight and have actually gained two pounds.

I've barely slept since they day I began taking it. For the first few days I felt a little bit nauseous after taking the pill and figured that it wasn't that bad and it would eventually go away. Its been five days now and I feel nauseous almost all of the time. I usually have a pretty big apetite but lately I've had to force myself to eat. I've gone from 135 pounds to 130 pounds in the past week. Everyone reacts differently to medications, but this one isn't for me.

I have no side effects, but I make sue I take my pill at the same time every day--bedtime.  There are several 'bad' reviews on here and I would bet it's because they are not taking the pill according to directions amd/or people tend to be negative....there are reasons they say take on time and don't miss a dose.

The first month was great. No period. Then the first week of my second month I started bleeding and I haven't stopped. It's been two weeks already. After reading the reviews - it sounds like this could last another month and half. Nightmare. Plus back acne and non-stop craving for food. Haven't weighed myself but could have gained weight as well. If you haven't started this drug. DON'T!

The only good thing about it is that I'm not pregnant. But I am on an emotional roller coaster from he-double-L! Normally I am an extremely easy going, fun loving and sarcastic person but since starting this birth control I have been crying every other day for what seems like no reason at all. I'm unbelievably sad all the time... you might even call it depressed... I'm overly sensitive to everything and I have lost all motivation for everything (I have no history is depression or emotional problems) and on top of all that I have gained a large amount of weight... and have not stopped bleeding (more then just spotting) since day one (I wanted no periods that's why I choose this birth control and now I'm having a month long period.) My breasts have doubled in size (but I'm not really complaining about that haha) other then they hurt uncontrollably all day. I would not recommend this to anyone.

It did help w/the migraines, but I had cramps on nearly a daily basis, horrible acne (I was never this bad as a teenager even) , irritability, and difficulty sleeping sometimes. I just switched to Lybrel and am about to start it soon. Let's hope this works better for my endo and migraines.

I gained 8 lbs and caused me to have severe eye problems. I saw 3 eye doctors and finally the last one said that this medication had a history of causing eye issues. I switched off of it and lost the weight and haven't had any problems with my eyes since. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	2/17/2010 12:09:39 PM	I've been taking this for about 5 months now to deal w/my menstrual migraines &amp; painful cramps. I haven't had any spotting issues, just mild cramps nearly every day, occas. difficulty sleeping (like I normally do before my period) and a definite increase in my acne. The migraines are definitely fewer between since I'm having fewer periods but my acne has never been worse. No weight gain for me or breast tenderness/discharge, etc. Overall, I'd rate it ok. It is expensive though, so I'll probably be switching to the generic sister of Seasonale (Jolessa or Quasense)

Well this birth control has been awful for me. My hair has been falling out in clumps, I have bad acne, and NOO sex drive. Also I have had a 3 week period, and then a period that lasted a month and now spotting almost every day. This birth control didnt work for me but I everyones bodys are different so maybe it will work for you! Good luck!

I'm 35 and have 2 children.  I have been using different bc pills since I was 16.  I love this pill.  I love not having my period.  I take it one step further (with doc permission) and don't have the 3 periods at all, I just skip to the next pack.  I have not had any breakthrough bleeding since the first month.  No abnormal weight gain other than me pigging out on my own.  I have also lost weight on diet &amp; exercise on this pill.  I have not had any problems.  
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	2/14/2010 11:34:54 PM	I get migraine headaches, especially around my period. This pill has helped with my migraines at least around the time I start my period. Yaz worked too but I wasn't having my period with that pill. My breasts are tender some of the time, I occasionally get a bad time where I break out on my face, and I do get bloating around my pelvic area. But overall, this pill has worked very well especially since I get migraines on a regular basis.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/14/2010 7:13:04 PM	I started this birth control after being on Mircette, a similar dose pill with monthly periods, for over ten years. Overall, I am pleased. My first period on Seasonique was painful (cramping, headaches, etc) like a non-pill period would be for me. After that first period, the periods have been easy and last about 3 days. I occasionally have spotting in the second month of the pack, but it does not last long and is not heavy.

I have just finished my first pack of seasonique. I did have some breakthrough bleeding, but nothing horrendous. I wish it wasnt as expensive though.  I love this pill because I had been taking yazmin before and I would literally feel sick a week before my period.  I would have all over body cramps and feel completely exhausted.  I feel great with seasonique. My husband likes it too.  More sex and less mood swings. YAY!
Other	Carolyn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	2/4/2010 4:14:02 PM	I am a 44-year-old woman, and was having anxiety/panic attacks around my period.  Was given Seasonique to control this problem.  I had so many other side effects that came along with this (sick to my stomach, cramping, indigestion, pain in lower back), that I stopped using after 6 weeks.  I would recommend an alternative to Seasonique for anyone - this is not a good thing.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	2/3/2010 11:33:03 PM	I am on week 13 of this pill. I had mild nausea in the first few weeks, and then all was well until the last pack. Week 11. I started spotting/moderately bleeding. I take my pill every day on time, and have never missed one. Now I'm on the period pills and i'm just gushing blood. I filled a Kotex super plus tampon in 2 hours. I've never had issues like this. I'm going to give it until the end of next week to get better, or I'm seeing my dr. to be put on another birth control.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	2/3/2010 9:10:50 AM	After about 4 months of use I started getting Breast tenderness, discharging, and pain during intercourse. These lasted for a few months after I stopped taking the medication. The symptoms are finally subsiding. 
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	1/27/2010 4:26:19 PM	I just started the second pack of my first cycle. I am terrified that I am pregnant. I have had absolutely no bleeding or spotting. My acne is a little worse than normal, but that could also be a pregnancy symptom. I am sick, my breasts hurt, tired, cramping every day, some increased urination. As long as I am not pregnant I am thrilled with this pill. No bleeding and no pms, I'd rather feel pregnant (as long as I'm not) than spend days in bed and a week bleeding once a month. I guess it is just wait and see.

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	funkycat681, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	1/22/2010 12:14:53 PM	My doctor encouraged this pill because it's supposed to give you fewer periods.  I don't think so - I didn't have a period for a month and have now been bleeding non-stop for over a month!  I thought there was something seriously wrong but my doctor assured me that seasonique has low estogen levels that don't agree with women's bodies and excessive bleeding is common on thi pill.  i'm getting off seasonique in a couple of weeks.  DON'T try it unless you want to feel gross for an undetermined amount of time!
Birth Control	Bearcazy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	19-24	1/19/2010 11:11:34 PM	I have only been on seasonquie for almost to months I really love the idea of 4 periods a year but I am pretty much been on my period for 27 days and it's still going idk what to do i want this to work but I am worried and so is my husband about this period that won't end help any advice would be appericated.
Birth Control	njVWgirl82, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/11/2010 4:55:42 PM	I was turned onto this by my sister, and I was a little scared at first after reading some of the reviews. But I have had no issues except for standard nausea I expect with any pill. No weight gain, no spotting or bleeding, no nothing. And i certainly like the distance between periods! I definitely recommend.
Birth Control	not having fun, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	1/10/2010 2:06:00 PM	I started this drug in November. I have been having side effects since December. Wt. gain, headaches, moodiness and spotting....everything I had a week before my period and now I have it for 3 months continuous!!!  I would rather be miserable for a week rather than 4 months. I have read the inserts and so I am giving it a chance, but how long do I wait for it to stop. I had no problems the first 4 weeks I started it, but now there is now fun in it. I will be stopping this and going back to condoms!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	rainey, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	1/5/2010 6:29:50 PM	I have a special needs daughter who has CP and is moderate mentally retarded so she does not need to deal with all the issues of having a period every month. She has not had any issues with this, it is small so she can swallow. We did the depo shots but there was weight gain &amp; can effect bone growth and doctor did not want her to use it more than 2 yrs. This is a great solution. She was having a period 3 wks out of 4. Now during the one week it is just a couple days and not heavy at that. She can talk so if she had a headache or anything she'd let me know and has not said anything, plus she doesn't complain about her stomach hurting anymore-cramps. It straightened her periods out the first month of taking them. She has no spotting or anything in between.

I have noticed a week before my second pack ends, my mood swings are up and down like crazy. When i first started this medicine i had breakthrough bleeding, but it eventually stopped! I really like having less periods, although i have gained about 10 pounds.

Birth Control	TaylorJean, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	4	Female	19-24	12/22/2009 10:32:15 PM	I have been taking Seasonique for 2 1/2 months and i love it. I do have a dew headaches on this which is not uncommon for me. I have not had any spotting or bleeding which is amazing because my period is a BIG inconvienance. So overall i am very happy with this birth controle. Oh and for the headaches i am going to switch to Lo Seasonique. To see if it slows them down. 2 a month for me. 
Painful Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	12/20/2009 1:30:54 AM	I started taking this almost four years ago,and at first it really didn't seem to help much. I bled heavily all seven days and sometimes up to fourteen days. I gained a little weight, but haven't really had any problems with my skin except a little eczema that cleared up after changing face washes. I started taking the pill to help my cramps and if that's what you're looking for in this, then look somewhere else because it hasn't helped at all! But after being on this pill for so long, my periods are much shorter and I cheat and skip every other one which gives me three periods a year. It's heaven and worth it. 
Endometriosis	snoopy68, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	12/15/2009 4:10:21 PM	My Dr. prescribed seasonique for me to control endometriosis, I ended up with painful varicose and spider veins as a result and it did not stop menstrual cramps. Now I have to treat the veins at my own expense, as they are not covered by insurance.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	amyk0213, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	12/5/2009 12:02:48 PM	I have been on Seasonique for a year now. When I got to the end of the first pack I had light bleeding the week before my period, somewhat heavy the week of and light again the week after. When I got to the end of my second pack this did not happen again as it states in the information provided with the birth control. I admit I have increased acne but this was easily remedied by seeing the dermatologist and getting acne cream. Other than these minor issues I have not had any problems and I love only having my period 4 times a year. This birth control has also decreased the occurrence of my migraines. Everyone's body is different, with birth control it is a trial and run basis. Also, always read the information provided with new medication. It addresses the break through bleeding in the informational packet for this birth control.
Painful Periods	purple_andrea, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/5/2009 2:26:35 AM	I just started my third pack of this birth control and I am in LOVE. I have not had any of the side effects I have read about; and especially no weight gain. Last &quot;quarter&quot;, as I call them now  since the pills are packaged in 3-month supplies, I had two days were I had some light discharge, but I wear a pantiliner every day, so I was covered. The discharge was so light that if I hadnt looked down I wouldnt have noticed, I had no pain.My unnerving cramps, migraines, and moodiness, have all gone away. It's cost effective for me, $30 a pack though my prescription mail order. Website offers a lot of great information and is a good place to go when you have questions. On Seasoninque, my cycle starts on Thursday during the yellow pills and is over by the start of the new pack on Sunday. Occasionally I have a slight 'twinge' of cramping pain, which can be alleviated with naproxen or an under the clothes, one-use, menstrual heating pad, that I can wear all day unnoticed.  Playtex and ThermaCare make these heating pads and they are great, last 8 hours and are worn under your clothing. I'm saving on pads and tampons, as well, too bad I buy them in bulk at Sams Club !! And a 4 day period for me is great, I'm used to 14 days of bleeding.My OB/GYN and I are so happy, since I've tried Levora, Ortho Tri Cyclen, Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo, Yasmin, and Yaz with good results for 3-4 months and then terrible side effects.Seasonique has by far exceeded my expectations. I don't schedule my life around my period now :-) I used to spend Thanksgiving and Christmas (the only time I see my family) in tears, pain, and loaded on Naproxen Sodium, Lortab, and Cataflam and generally feeling miserable. Last year I opened presents in the bed, I am excited that this Christmas season, I will be free from my period, the heating pad, and the pain !!!Over all, I say do your research, ask your doctor for a sample, and try it. GOOD LUCK !!!

Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	anubislady, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	12/4/2009 7:26:03 PM	I am on week four of seasonique and it just doesn't seem to be worth it.  I started taking it two days after my period stopped and two weeks later I started my period again.  This was not breakthrough bleeding, this is a period, one that as of today is day number 14.  I have had cramping, heavy bleeding, and enormous clots (bigger than a half dollar), and acne that I have not had like this since I was 15.  When I go back to my doctor, I am asking for something else.  I don't recommend this drug to anyone.  
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	11/24/2009 6:27:07 PM	I've been on Seasonique for at least 2 years now - until recently had been pretty satisfied with it.  It seems to have a few issues, but nothing that I was willing to go back to a period every month over.  Now I'm in almost my 2nd week of the heaviest period I've ever had and it won't stop - I'm switching the next opportunity I can.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	11/17/2009 4:20:37 PM	Everything was fine until month 3 of my first pack of pills. Suddenly I am constantly bleeding, cramping, and bloated. My normally clear skin (at age 37) is now broken out and I am feeling very hormonal. Will not be continuing this pill.
Painful Periods	Captive, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	11/10/2009 8:41:42 PM	I started bleeding 2 and a half weeks after starting this BC, call my doctor and the nurse told me to continue with it my body needs to get use to it..It has been 4 weeks since I have been spotting and bleeding with cramps and clot occasionaly. I finally decided to stop taking this BC 4 days ago and I am still bleeding...When is this going to stop. This reaction is the opposite of the reason why I wanted to take Seasonique in the first place. I guess you suppose to bleed for 8 weeks straight initial to make up for the times that you not going to get your cycle...I almost for got to mention the breakouts and thinning of the hair...This BC is the worst...Stay away ladies.

Birth Control	kjohnson9853, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1		25-34	11/8/2009 2:04:18 AM	The only reason why I gave the effectiveness of this 2 stars is because there was no way I could've gotten pregnant when I couldn't even have sex since I basically had my period for a month!  In addition I had the pleasure of getting severe cystic acne that I haven't been able to get under control for 3 months.  The cramps that accompanied what was actually my period were so unbelievably painful it would force me to tears.  I actually paid $100 for another 3 month pack that I will not be taking.  I'd rather throw away $100 than deal with the terrible side effects of this pill.  I'm going back on loestrin24.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	10/26/2009 9:42:51 PM	I have been on this med for 5 1/2 years. It has worked great up until 3 months ago. I have had continuous break through bleeding. I have had to take extra estrogen to control it and as soon as i come off i start to bleed. right now i am using an estrogen patch to counter act the pill. i'm bleeding b/c i have no uterus left. i'm giving it 3 more weeks if it doesn't clear up i'm switching and will just manipulate my periods with whatever i take. until august i was really happy with this pill..

I have not a problem since the beginning. 
Birth Control	msjena, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	10/26/2009 4:42:37 PM	I have been taking seasonique for 3 months and a week and I love it! I haven't had any of the side effects I am seeing. No spotting, no acne, no moodiness. I went on this pill because YAZ was getting way to expensive and I wanted one period a season. Who wouldn't? All I can say is give it a whirl. Unfortunately, I have been getting persistent yeast infections from being on seasonique. My third so far. Apparenly this doesn't seem to be a common side effect because I cant find n e complaints about it. Other than that, the pack is too bulky to carry in a small purse. I've learned today that loseasoniqe is much cheaper, and is the same as seasonique. it just comes in monthly perscriptions... I wish I would have known b4 but maybe i can help save some of you money on this.

Birth Control	kates, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/5/2009 3:50:11 PM	I've not had any of the problems other reviewers have had. When I first started I had slight break through bleeding the week I would normally have my period. Other than that I've had no problems other than about a 5 pound weigt gain. I feel so much better, my debilitating cramps are gone along with the hormonal headaches. I've tried the generic and the delivery method made me nauseated. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/4/2009 8:53:39 PM	I started this medicine 5 1/2 years ago and never had any problems with the drug. No breakthrough bleeding or anything until 2 months ago. I started having no stop bleeding. I finally went to the dr and had an ultrasound done. I virtually have no lining in my uterus left ( I guess that means it's doing its job of birth conrol). So my dr gave me estrogen to take for 3 weeks. I have been on it for one week and the bleeding has stopped. Just give it a chance, it is a good drug and does work. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	9/27/2009 11:27:57 PM	I have been on this pill for 5 years. No problems at all until about a month ago. I have had breakthrough bleeding for an entire month. This is supposed to happen when you first take it, not 5 years later. I guess now we are just learning the long term effects. I absolutely loved this pill until last month. I am going to the dr in the morning to see if it really is the pill and if so I am switching.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	9/23/2009 12:49:45 PM	While I managed to dodge the in between bleeding and headaches that I see many of you reviewing, I have gained 15 pounds, and am severely depressed.  I liked the idea of only 4 periods a year...it's not worth the weight gain and depression.  Hopefully I'll have better luck with whatever I try next...and hopefully this extra weight will go a way.  I'm getting married in two weeks, and for the past month have been exercising trying to get rid of this 1.5&quot; extra around my middle...so far I've hat no luck at all.

Had a migraine this am , and this pill is not for me!

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	9/17/2009 4:51:06 PM	I am taking LoSeasonique to prevent my migraines.  The first month was great, but on my seventh week the breakthough bleeding started.  Nine days later, I am still bleeding (heavier than my normal cycle).  I had really bad cramps two days into the bleeding and passed a bigger clot than after I had my daughter.  I haven't had a migraine, but my periods are worse than before.  I haven't bled this much since after childbirth.  I think the bleeding and cramping are worse than my headaches ever were.  I think I can manage the headaches with different medication or not at all.  I don't need it for birth control and I don't have bad menstrual cycles.  The benefit does not outweigh the side effects.

I started with Seasonale, then I switched to seasonique because it had a lower dose of hormones. I love it. I actually skip the inert/ placebo pills at the end and start on a new pack. I did have break through bleeding a few times (within the first 6 months of skipping the inert/placebo pills) once I started the pill, but it was typically light and lasted only a few days. By the way I had no breakthrough bleeding when I was taking the drug correctly. Honestly it is great and I would recommend it to anyone. I plan to continue using the drug until something better comes out.

I have been bleeding now for almost 2 months straight. I have had horrible mood swings and I have acne all over my upper legs. This is a horrible birth control. I just quit taking it yesterday and I hope soon I will stop bleeding and start feeling better!

I am in Iraq and thought not having a period every month would make my life easier. WRONG!!I had perfect periods before. Every 29 days like a clockwork and they lasted 4 or 5 days. I have now been bleeding for 6 weeks. Some days are heavy and others just spotting. Today I finally gave up and put all of it in the trash. My life has been hell for the last 6 weeks. Now I am just worried if I will ever stop bleeding &amp; freaked out about how long it will take to get my cycle back in check. HELP!! Don't take this...it isn't worth the bleeding ALL the time.

Heavy break-trough bleeding the first month or two, and my mood swings were horrible; I was breaking down into tears randomly and often times I felt very hopeless. It did keep me from getting pregnant though.

Since taking the pill for the past three weeks, I have had heavy bleeding for the last 8 days -- my normal periods were no longer than 4 days.  I have cramps, am irritable, tired, dizzy, and seem to have blurred vision to the point where my glasses are ineffective.  This pill is more problems than it's worth, and I will stop taking it immediately.
Acne	DM, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	7/25/2009 5:27:44 PM	I started taking this like everyone else to reduce the number of periods I have as well as basic BC. I took it for almost 2 months, and then just went off cold turkey. I didn't want to finish the full 3 months after reading some of the posts and experiencing the same side effects. I constantly felt bloated on it, felt very unmotivated at work, over emotional and I got acrne around my chin and neck line as well. I seemed to get one big cyst like zit after another. Although I have a small frame anyway, I still was wanting to drop a few pounds. No matter how healthy and how little I ate, the scale would not budge. I have never had that problem before. Also, I had read posts complaining about hair loss. I thought (or hoped) that it was just my imagination that I was losing more than the normal amount of hair every day. Especially around my frontal hairline it looks like it is thinning! Well, like I said, I took myself off and have had full blown bleeding for the last 4 days (1 day after I went off). I am planning to try the Mirena IUD.  ANYTHING has to be better than this!
Other	NoThanks, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	7/22/2009 3:43:38 PM	Was prescribed Seasonique to help regulate periods and ease PMS.  I am 41 and although my periods are timely they are still irregular in nature.  And, of course, I liked the idea of having 4 periods a year.  My tubes are tied, so taking this has nothing to do with birth control.  I started getting headaches within a couple days of taking this medication - headaches that would last for days on end.  I thought that I was feeling a little &quot;off&quot; but disregarded it.  My libido dropped a bit and the big &quot;O&quot; was a bit elusive.  Around day 25 of the first pack I started cramping, the next day I started spotting and the day after that I started bleeding, all the while with the cramps.  I haven't bled or cramped like this since I was a teenager.  I talked to my doctor last night (day 31 of the pills) and explained the situation to her.  She told me to stop them, so I'm done with them.  I'm still bleeding, but I expected that.  I just hope it stops soon.  Seems that the bleeding is a big complaint.  No wonder it's effective birth control - people are bleeding too much to have sex!  Having what they refer to as &quot;breakthrough bleeding&quot; in between your four periods a year, would be called your regular periods and they try to tell you that it's normal.  So, what's the point then?I told my doctor that before my son was born I took Ovral for birth control.  I took Ovral for years with no problems at all.  I took it after my son was born for two years until my tubes were tied.  I asked her to put me back on that.  I will start the generic version (Ogestrel) on Sunday.  I wish I had something positive to say about Seasonique, because it's a great theory, but I don't.  It didn't do anything that I expected it to do.  I haven't felt this bad in years.
Birth Control	apinkal, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	7/9/2009 6:41:53 PM	Started taking about two months ago. I loved the idea of only 4 periods a year. Plus, married and don't want but the one child I have. I can't have any more surgeries, and hubby has to go in when he can. So BCP seemed great, especially this one.  WRONG! I started bleeding after 1st month, and I've been off and on from spotting to full on period, for about 3 weeks now.  I'm 33 with acne like a 15 year old, even with acne creams I was using before.  Headaches (I never get them!), moodiness, even with anti-depressants I've been on for years! I've turned into super-bitch!  Tired! Dizziness! Loss of appetite and still gained 7 pounds since starting! Eyes get all goofy, like I'm having a hard time seeing, even when I wear my glasses (which I only usually have to wear while reading or using computer), and now have to wear all the time.  I hate this pill! Going off, especiallly since I read other reviews and it's just not me getting sick or just gaining weight.  I've been walking 2-3 miles a day since starting pill and still gained the 7 pounds I mentioned! Changed diet to better one too! Cut sweets totally, eating more fruit &amp; veggies, less red meat, less breads, etc.  And sex drive totally gone!!I will go back to using condoms with my husband of 14 years until he can get in to get fixed.  I want my old life back before this pill!
Birth Control	rudolphthered, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	7/6/2009 2:38:47 PM	This pill was suggested to me by my doctor because he thought it would reduce the frequency of my migraines.  I just finished my first three-month pill pack and am not sure whether I will continue the drug.  I bled (some spotting but mostly consistent bleeding) for two out of the three months I was on the pill.  I also had the worst acne I've had since I was a teenager.  I fought off migraines for about 4 days in the middle of the last month (never got a full blown migraine, but had to take plenty of drugs to keep them from coming on stronger).  Overall, I'm not impressed with this pill, but sadly, it still might be my best option for preventing pregnancy and keeping the 2-3 day long monthly migraines away.
Birth Control	Kat, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	6/27/2009 12:07:45 PM	Help, I am running out of blood!  Bled weeks 2-7 on the drug, it stopped for about 10 days, now have severe cramping, passing huge clots, and stood up this morning and a quarter cup of blood literally poured out of me (caught blood in cup to see how much it was).  How much blood can I lose on this pill before it's dangerous?  Have also lost over 10 pounds, had some breakouts.

Endometriosis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	6/15/2009 12:21:38 PM	In the first month that I was on Seasonique, I was so happy that there were no side effects and that I had absolutely no bleeding or my period. Once I got into the 2nd month, everything began to change. I took it consistently every night at almost the same exact time, but I still started getting hit with the side effects. I'm 2 weeks from being at the end of the 3 month pack and I'm so miserable with it, that I&quot;m going today to get off of it. I've bled every single day for the past 2 months, a couple of the weeks were so bad that I think they were my actual periods. During being on this pill, I had decided to lose weight.. with going to the gym 5-6 times a week and eating very healthy, after 2 months of it, I finally gave up since I hadn't gotten any skinnier or lost any weight. I believe the pill was keeping from losing weight and if I wouldn't have been staying very active, I probably would've gained alot of weight! Also recently, sex has become very painful. The desire of wanting it is still there, but it's been keeping me from doing it just because I don't want to put myself through the agony. I'm so excited to be getting off this pill already!
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	6/14/2009 10:25:41 PM	I went on this pill 2 years ago after trying many, many treatments. I did gain some weight and my skin is broken out more than usual. However, this is the first pill that has made my migraines nearly disappear.  I feel better on this pill than I have in years. I will put up with the others because I feel so much better. I have not been moody at all and PMS has disappeared. I had no spotting and my periods are so light, I rarely use more than pantyliners.
Birth Control	Sleepy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	6/12/2009 12:32:07 PM	I am on the last month of my initial pack. I am dealing with the breakthrough bleeding as the BC has illuminated the severe breast tenderness I was experiencing before and I believe it has helped with the PMDD. I decided to take the pill before bed to avoid any nausea symptoms and have a consistent pill time. Basically since I started I have been waking up 1-2 hours into. Sometimes 2x a night. Anyone have the same reaction?
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	6/11/2009 1:22:56 PM	 just finished my first 3 month cycle on this pill and I must say I am impressed. I had no spotting or breakthrough bleeding at all. I take the pill at the same time each day. This period has been much lighter and shorter than my &quot;old&quot; ones. I did have some cramping, but that's usual for me. I am looking forward to continuing this pill. Don't see any reason I would switch back to monthly periods after what I have experience on this pill. Ask your doctor for samples, my doctor loads me up, so I have yet to actually fill a prescription. I encourage women with painful periods, PMS, generally period moodiness to try this pill. It works. Since the age of 16, I've been on just about every pill on the market and finally one works. If cost is an issue, visit the manufacturer's website and download the many coupons. I suggest taking this pill at the same time every day, I'm convinced that's why I havent' had any negative side effects. Its worth a shot, its working for me.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	6/3/2009 1:29:44 PM	I took Seasonal a few years ago and loved it.  I am now in month three of Seasonique and have a few issues that I never experienced before.  I've gained about 7 lbs.  I am pretty active, running 10-15 miles a week.  I've had a few acne issues, not huge breakouts just a big pimple here or there.  Most annoying has been the breakthrough bleeding that only seems to be getting worse....  I am two and a half weeks out from my period and have had bleeding pretty consistently, to the point of needing a tampon one day.  Since I already have my re-fill I will give it a shot on my second pack, but if any spotting is occuring at that point, I think I'll be calling it quits...

Birth Control		5	5	5			5/18/2009 7:11:42 PM	I only started taking Seasonique because my dermatologist required that I be on the pill due to the category X pregnancy rate on my acne medication. I've been on Seasonique for 10 months now and I have been completely satisfied. I did have some bleeding during the first couple of months, but that decreased each month. I no longer have to take my acne medication (it was a 6 month treatment), but I chose to stay on Seasonique because no part of me wants to go back to a monthly period and monthly PMS!!!!!!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/17/2009 6:16:08 PM	My new GYN suggested I try Seasonique because I've always experienced long, heavy, painful periods. So less periods is a Godsend for me. This is my 5th month, so 2nd pack. I did experience some breakthrough bleeding (about 7 days) during the first 3 month cycle. But, my doc forwarned me up front, so I was fine with it. When I did get my period, it only lasted 3 days!!!!! Yes, completely a Godsend!!!!

I had some intial spotting and breakthrough bleeding which was to be expected. HOWEVER, I gained weight and I lost about 50% of my hair...fat and bald?  Yeah that's effective birth control.  HA! Switching back to my old pills at my next annual. (Lo-Ovral)
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	5/5/2009 11:41:31 AM	I have not stopped bleeding since about 3 weeks after starting the birth control.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	4/29/2009 12:51:51 AM	I was given a free 6 month sample from my gyno to try.  I've been taking hormonal BC constantly for 8 years.  In the last 4 years I have switched meds several times because I ALWAYS get breakthough bleeding during my last week of pills before the &quot;period&quot; week.  Other than tender breasts, I've never had any other negative side effects from BC pills.The Good:-Increased sex drive!-Clear skin-The boyfriend loved it.  -Periods weren't so bad.  Even with the spotting.The Bad:-Breakthrough bleeding.  Mine was constant through the 2nd and 3rd month. Didn't improve after the first 3 months.  Two plus': it was light to very light, so it didn't interfere with our sex life, and it was cured with a pantyliner.The Ugly:-weight gain.  I took this during graduate school.  I've never eaten less food and got more exercise... but I seemed to gain about 3lbs per month. (Up until this point I had only gained 10lbs in 8 years)

It did take a couple rounds of this medication before I settled into it fully working and no spotting.  I've noticed if you keep on taking it, despite the spotting, the spotting will stop.  I've dealt with this for 2-3 cycles when beginning.  Now that I have used it for a couple of years, it works great, eases symptoms during that week and makes life much, much more simple.  Great product, what a God-send!

I have had breakthrough bleed between every 3month cycle. I have been so moody, sensitive, and have bouts of depression. My boyfriend gets worried about me and so do I. My acne also have increased since using it and I feel that I am bloated a lot. I hate this pill and I do not recommend it at all.

I do still get headaches, but not severe full blown migrains all the time. I've had no problems with it at all.

I haven't gained any weight or had any more breakouts than normal. I haven't had any spotting between periods and my periods have actually been lighter. I'm not pregnant and I take my pill right before I go to bed so it is really simple and effective.
Other	libby, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/1/2009 7:46:03 PM	I originally began using the drug to help with breast tenderness and pain.  I will agree it has totally taken care of the pain!  I am in week 4 - have had no breakthrough bleeding like the others, but have cramping, SEVERE nausea, dizziness, vision changes and TOTAL TOTAL body fatigue and overall weakness.  I am constantly tired - no matter how much sleep I get or how many naps!!  I would say the worst is the dizziness, fatigue and body aches!  I have gained 6 pounds this month!!!! And exercise 3 times/week!!! Nothing else has changed!!!  I'm giving it one more week and I am OFF!!!  I can't function this tired and dizzy....almost feels as though I have low blood sugar and low blood pressure ALL THE TIME!!!  - loss of appetite as well!!!

I no longer get the severe pains or the spotting between periods. It really helps to control the endometriosis. If only I didn't gain so much weight!

Birth Control	cocoxo@aim.com, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	2/22/2009 2:52:56 PM	I am 16 years old and i decided to go on this birth control because i have been with my boyfriend for almost a year and a half and i dont trust condoms. none of my friends were ever on this birth control so i knew nothing about it. i saw the commerical and 4 periods a year sounded good to me so i asked my doctor if i could go on it and she said yes. it was the day before i was going to go on the birth control and i was nervous so i decided to look online to see what people said about the pill. i came to this website and everyone was saying how terrible it was and i was terrified to start it but my mom had already paid for it so i did. i've been on it for almost a month now. before i went on this i weighed 135 lbs and i still do... i never really had break outs before and i still dont.. no cramping .. nothing really. my boyfriend said i've been moodier since i went on it but i know thats not true. i have had spotting throughout the day but only a little bit and its not enough for a tampon. its like i'm on the last day of my period so its thats weird color and its only a tiny bit. everything else is fine and i set an alarm every day on my phone so i remember to take it. i've been pretty pleased so far with seasonique. i know it doesn't go into effect until after a month so i can't say anything about pregnancy yet but i just wanted to write this for the girls who are afraid to take it because of all the bad things ppl are saying about it.
Birth Control	MonicaDesmarais, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	2/17/2009 1:27:27 PM	This pill is supposed to stop periods, and in the first three months I bled 10 out of 12 weeks.  Not breakthrough bleeding like they claim, tampon-worthy bleeding.  When I called Barr Pharmaceuticals, they said that it was a symptom of the drug so they would not offer a refund on the prescription that I paid $119 for.  It is still in the bag and package, unused.  Walmart won't take it back either.

I hyaven't left the house in two days. Horrible cramping not even hydrocodone eased. Then, bleeding started with large, dark, fibrous clots.  I hope this doesn't go on as long as it has for some reviewers.  I took Ovcon for over 20 years with no problems, but my Dr suggested this for fewer periods.  I'm giving it one more pack (which I already paid $180 for) before possibly switching back.  Who wants to stay in bed and in pain for 2-3 days?

Untill this week I hadn't had any breakthrough bleeding.  It was really light and only lasted in the mornings. I called my gyno and he said to take otc advil and it made the bleeding stop.  And best of all no babies.  I would recommend this drug to people.

I've been on some form of bc for 15 years now and made the switch to this pill because I get menstrual migraines so we figured fewer periods, fewer migraines.  Due to a med change, I had to skip my period and start a fresh pack so I had breakthrough bleeding which was preceeded by the worst pms I've ever experienced in my life.  I thought the end of the world was coming and my depression was horrible!  Please, for your own sake if you can help it, don't skip a period.  Otherwise, I've been pleased.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/30/2008 4:42:20 PM	I have never had a single issue with this medication. My dr. couldn't believe that I have never had ANY spotting ever!  It's the best thing ever invented IMHO. Hoping that my new ins will still cover me tho--they want me to use the generic.  I only spend $20 for a 3 mo supply, hardly ever by tampons and my dr always give me 2-3 pill packs for free cuz she's the best!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	12/27/2008 12:22:06 PM	I've been on this medication for 1 year and prior to being prescribed Seasonique, I had normal pap smears.  This year, I had an abnormal pap which resulted in having a colposcopy, and subsequent biopsy of cervical tissue. Still waiting for results. Also, the uncertainty of when the bleeding will begin can be really annoying.  More than once it has occurred during intimate moments with my boyfriend and lasts a really long time.  I thought I was supposed to have periods quarterly. I was told to take the first pack, and then it would stop, but it still happens, even a full year later.  I am going to stop taking this medication immediately. Just read the patient information on the Seasonique website.

Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	spartangirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	11/18/2008 11:37:34 PM	I have been on Seasonique for almost two years and have not experienced any break through bleeding.  I've been on BCPs since I was 15 (I am now 22) because of ovarian cysts and endometriosis.  After being on a certain med for a at least a year it seems to stop working for me.  I was on Mircete and loved it, but after two years I had issues with ovarian cysts rupturing and was prescibed other pills.  I was on Yaz before Seasonique and hated it!  It made me an emotional wreck!  I was always sad and angry and had terrible mood swings.  I was really pleased once I started taking Seasonique.  I never had break through bleeding and I liked the idea of only having four periods a year.  However, I have AWFUL cramps again while on my period.  It reminds me of before I was on BCPs and had terrible cramps that would incapacitate me for days.  The only plus side is my period lasts about four days, and while the bleeding is general heavy, I only have to experience this four times a year.  This pill has made me break out a lot on my face, neck and back.  And it is huge painful pimples that last days/weeks.  It has also caused me to bloat/game weight... between 5-10 pounds.  It had made me tried and recently started to effect my attitude.  I find myself very tired, and uninterested in practically everything.  Also, I have been having TERRIBLE pain on my right side which I know is caused by ovarian cysts.  I liked this pill when I first started taking it but it's no longer doing its job.  I'm getting bad ovarian cysts and now am getting a CAT scan when I'm home over winter break (I'm in college) when I'm home because of the pain.  I am hoping my OB/GYN will put me on a new pill because this is no longer working for me and I am no longer satisfied with the results.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/17/2008 2:41:16 PM	I had no spotting or breakthough bleeding.  My period was very light and I had no cramping.  Only complaint would be that I gained weight (about 5 pounds)
Birth Control	L.A., 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	11/7/2008 1:19:31 PM	I am nearing the end of my first three months of pills and have had no side effects - aside from a slight acne break-out that is now going away with no new acne.  I was on the ring before and had horrible side effects (bloating, weight gain, breast tenderness, vaginal infections, major cramping, horrible mood swings, nausea and heavier and heavier periods), so I'm extremely happy with this pill.  I've never had a problem with remembering to take it, so that's not an issue for me.  I've had no break-through bleeding so far, although I know that's a possibility.  My only real complaint about this pill so far is the price - much more expensive per month than any other pill/ring that I was using previously. 
Endometriosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	11/3/2008 4:47:13 PM	Started July of 08, Breakthrough bleeding more often than not, to the point I have become anemic. This did help the pain I was experiencing, but I also may have IBS or endometriosis on my bowel (have not had laparoscopy yet)and the breakthrough bleeding makes the bowel symptoms worse, so I am constanly still batteling diarrhea-but the pain is better
Birth Control	wrennie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	11/3/2008 4:24:48 PM	Well, I haven't gotten pregnant.  But this pill has given me the worse mood swings ever and i've been extra aggravated and tense since on it.  Started 1st week of Sept. '08 and began bleeding 4 weeks after.  Some days are light spotting to full period.  It's been 3 weeks now.  Cramps are every-other day.  Oh, and constant breast tenderness....

I am not happy with that. I started it because cysts coming up in my breasts ever couple of months.
Endometriosis	leaf, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	10/6/2008 11:40:15 PM	Yeah, this sucks.  I was on Loestrin Fe prior which stopped all bleeding but still caused pelvic pain during the end of the cycle (everything else was good)...  So Dr. switched me to this instead.  I HATE it.  My Pain is SOOO much worse, I have mood Swings and general pissiness all the time,  Zero Sex life, I have weight gain, I am very sensitive to touch and my whole body feels like it hurts.  It feels like everything between my hips and between my pubic and Tail bones is very, very bruised and tender. I am visiting the Dr. tomorrow as it's been just over a month and I'm worse off than before I had laproscopic surgery last year for my Endometriosis. Would 100% NOT recommend...
Birth Control	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	10/3/2008 5:39:01 PM	I have been taking Seasonique now for almost four months. Everything was perfect for the 1st 3 months. Now 3 weeks before I'm to start my period I began heavy spotting then bleeding to the point I had to use a tampons daily for 3 weeks now. I have switched back to my old brand. I was very disappointed with the results of Seasonique
Birth Control	Jenna, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	9/29/2008 10:28:57 AM	I have experiences some pretty heavy nausea and an increase of discharge while taking this.  My doctor suggested to take it at night to help with the nausea and it has, but the increased discharge it horrible.  I have to wear a panty liner everyday.  I haven't had any spotting or bleeding whatsoever.  I have been on it for 2 months and the other day I forgot to take it at night and took it in the morning and still had some mild nausea.  My side effects haven't been severe, but I know I have been on something where I had no side effects, so I will be switching back.  My doctor is encouraging me to finish the pack, and I will.  Maybe my body will adjust and I will stay on it, but I don't think so.

Birth Control	gglover, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	9/20/2008 9:52:45 AM	I have been taking Seasonique now for almost three months. Everything was perfect, now two weeks before I am to start my period I began lightly spotting then bleeding to the point I had to use a tampon.  I also had low grade cramps for the majority of the three months. I also recently shed my uterine lining. It was severe and huge. I actually thought it was part of my tampon, but it wasn't. I'm not sure if all these minor symptoms are worth it. I was on YAZ before and think I'll go back. I didn't have this many zits before either.

IT'S HEAVY AT TIMES AND OTHERS LIGHT. I WAS ON THE RING B4 THIS AND HAD A BAD ALLERGIC REACTION TO IT. I LIKED THE IDEA OF 4 PERIODS A YEAR BUT I DON'T THINK I CAN TAKE ANY MORE BLOOD!
Birth Control	ALEZIE1013, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	19-24	9/9/2008 5:36:14 PM	I have been taking this pill for just over three months now. My wedding is in a few weeks and I thought this would be perfect to make sure I don't end up with my period the day of the wedding. Instead my skin is breaking out like i junior high school student and I have had my period for 2 full weeks now with no signs of an end. My thoughts were simple; no period for 3 months how great too bad you get your period for 2 full weeks to boot. I would not reccomend this medication.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods		1	4	1			8/28/2008 11:01:38 AM	I am 38 and have had 3 children. I started this medication in order to reduce the frequency and duration of my periods. Since beginning this medication 6 weeks ago I have put on 6 pounds, even though I started an exercise program.  I am retaining water like crazy, can't button my pants, and am beginning the third week of a full blown period.  I did not have cramps before, but have them every day now! I am also having trouble with low blood sugar and dizziness.  Yuck.  I don't think this is worth it.
Birth Control	rab1986, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	8/25/2008 11:49:45 AM	After talking to friends who had already had bad experiences with Seasonique, I thought I would be different and wanted to try it for myself!  I have been on seasonique for about 6 weeks.  Since starting it, I have gained around 11 pounds, my skin looks terrible and I have bled every day for the last 3 weeks.  The worst, however, is the fatigue/tiredness.  I think that may be why I have gained the weight, I have not felt like doing ANYTHING!  I have tried several birth control pills in the past, and the thought of only having 4 periods a year sounded very good.  I have already called my doctor to have my previous birth control restarted.  DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL!!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/14/2008 1:34:20 AM	I have been on this and only this and it's sister BCP, seasonale, for about 5yrs! I have never had spotting or any other troubles with it. The reason that I got on it was because I was having a full period every other week. It was worth the change and the only thing I have to say is it does take over half the week to have my period. But by that point the period is only 3 or 4 days long, which is also nice. Just dont like having to play a similar standby waiting game when the week comes.
Birth Control	margaret, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/9/2008 10:57:44 AM	Been on Seasonale/Seasonique for past 2 years after having a baby and for a year before.  No problems on it, no problems going off of it to try to conceive.  Got pregnant just a few weeks after taking my last pill.  Great experience so far!
Painful Periods	out of patience, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	8/4/2008 10:32:04 PM	I started on Seasonique because of the 4 periods a year. I'm on week 7 and have had some spotting or bleeding for 4 of 7 weeks. I have had stomach ache,diarrhea, and a lack of sex drive. I've given this pill a chance, but I don't think it's worth taking. 
Birth Control		4	4	1			8/3/2008 6:29:12 PM	Once I started taking this I became extremely moody.  I have had no sex drive since i began taking the pill. 
Other	Miss S., 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	7/29/2008 3:35:16 PM	I started taking Seasonique on April 27, 2008 to get rid of my 5 to 7 migraines each month.  I'm 47 and do not need birth control, but at first the Seasonique worked really well controlling migraines.  I thought it was a miracle drug until I started bleeding on June 7th.  I spotted for 5 days, then it turned into a full period that NEVER STOPPED.  Here it is July 29th and I'm still bleeding.  I called and spoke with someone at Barr Pharmaceuticals and she said that even in the 4th packet of pills, 10% of women bled 20 days or more!!!  NOT WORTH IT!My doctor switched me to Yaz on July 23rd, but my bleeding got heavier until I ended up in the ER last Sunday because I have never bled so much in my life.  I'm done with birth control for migraines.  Although my new OB/Gyn suggested Nuvaring.  Sigh.  Will give myself time to get back to &quot;normal&quot; without any additional hormones for a while before even thinking about Nuvaring.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods		5	5	5			7/26/2008 9:41:01 PM	I just started taking this after being on Yaz for 3 years. So far the only side effects have been moodiness. I had the same thing when I started on Yaz. It took about 2-3 weeks for me to adjust. So far so good. Definately think the benefits outway the side effects so far...... 
Birth Control	nikkinicole, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	7/14/2008 2:41:11 AM	i have been taking seasonique for about 8 or 9 months and at first i had to have a period after the first month bc i felt like my body just needed to let it all out.after that my body slowly adjusted and whenever i spotted in the begining,i just took a week off from taking the pills and had a period, then it would stop.i can tell my body is adjusting bc around the time of the month when im supposed to get my period,i feel some pms symptoms but they eventually pass after a week.theyre not too bad.the only bad things i would say after using this is that my face isnt as easy to keep clear as before and my pms has gone crazy.one minuet im yelling and the next im crying.the first six months i used this pill i really didnt like it but with time,its getting a lot better and i hope it keeps getting better.i like this pill but im planning to switch to regular birth control pills and manipulate my period with them bc the hormone level is to much for me and i feel safer having the option to have my period every month for assurance.with this pill im paranoid about being pregnant and not knowing til a month or two later.overall this pill is ok but very hard to get used to.
Birth Control	QueenT, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	1	1	Female	19-24	7/11/2008 2:01:59 PM	Okay, so I am new to BCPs and I chose Seasonique because I like the ideaof having only 4 periods a year (for me it was a convience issue). I am 24, not sexually active, I don't have any pre-existing conditions, I normally have very light periods lasting 3 days, I don't have acne, and my cramps are managable with a heafty dose of Aleve. I work out on a regular basis. After reading all these reviews I am TERRIFIED to start taking this. I have until Sunday to make up my mind. Is there anyone with a similar situation to mine that can shed some light on the effects they experienced with Seasonique. I need a true/honest opinion/feedback on what I should do, beacause once I start I am committed for the first pack...HELP PLEASE
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/8/2008 10:36:49 AM	Started taking this because I loved the idea of only four periods a year. When I had my period every month I could literally only sleep for 30-45 minutes at a time before I was running to the bathroom and I would experience cramps in my legs, lower back, and abdomen. Since taking Seasonique I sleep better at night when I have my period and my migraines are only a dull throb that I can live with.I do have blood clots but those only last a day and are likely genetic since my mom and grandma had them too. 
Birth Control	BrandyF, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	7/6/2008 11:16:43 PM	i was put on this type of birh control because i have horrible periods. I am entering my 3rd month, so no period yet. But I am getting acne, not the normal pimple here and there, but on my kneck/face line. And it won't clear up. errrg. Same pimple for 2 weeks! yuck. Also its made me gassy. GasX is my new best friend. Love no period for 3 months...but thinking of going back to the ring.
Birth Control	MigraneWeight, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	7/1/2008 11:39:43 PM	My doctor recommended that I take this not only for birth control but because of my severe migranes. I was previously on Yasmin. I am very happy with the fact that I only get a migrane 4 times a year instead of every month. I have noticed more pimples but I thought that might have been stress (just got married).  Now that I read the other articles, I can honestly say it is because of the pills. The one thing that effects me the most is the weight gain! I eat right &amp; exercise and I've gained about 10 pounds in just 5 months...very depressing! I might just have to learn to deal with the migranes again.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	6/23/2008 6:10:09 PM	I had been on Seasonale for several years when my doctor switched me to Seasonique, claiming it was &quot;new and improved&quot;.  Since I switched to Seasonique on June 1, 2008, I have had a period EVERY DAY SINCE JUNE 5th.  (At the time of this posting, it was June 23rd).  My doctor &quot;claims&quot; that this is normal; however, I have been on several different BCP's in my adult life and I have NEVER encountered anything like this.  I've been told this is an &quot;inconvenience&quot; and will eventually (eventually!) go away.  I feel that the switch was not in my best interest.  At this point, having a third child might be preferable to having a summer-long period.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/23/2008 1:39:03 PM	I started using Seasonique in June of 2007, the reason was for heavy periods. It saved my life because I have anemia and cannot afford to lose a lot of blood. The only side effect in the beginning was dry mouth, so drink lots of liquids!
Other	PMS, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	6/12/2008 9:39:23 PM	I have severe PMS and after trying antidepressants, which work as long as I continue to up the dose as my sex drive goes down.  My doctor has suggested BC pills from the start but have been uncomfortable with all the side effects.  After 3 years I finally gave in.  NOw, 2 wks into these, I feel okay, so far, but my body has swelled up 2 sizes.  By breasts are huge and painful, and my vision is really acting up.  It's almost like I cannot turn to look at somehting too fast otherwise I feel like I'll pass out.  Is this just me or what?!  HELP!  I recently moved and am in the process of finding a new doctor, so I can't even go back to the prescribing doc for help.  Any suggestions are welcomed.

I have not had one period.. not once. I have had some spotting here and there. The one thing I have noticed is ACNE!!! I have always had nice clear skin, and since being on this pill, I get pimples on my face and back....its disgusting! I have also gained about 15 lbs since starting this. I am gonna talk to my new OB Dr. and see if there is anything else he can put me on.

Birth Control		1	1	1			6/4/2008 1:16:54 PM	I have been on Seasonique for 12 weeks and the bleeding started at week 3 and never stopped. I bleed heavy every day and feel very bloated. I was on Kariva before and loved it. My periods would only last 3 days. This should never have been approved and physicians should educate their patients on the heavy bleeding that last for months. It's not spotting by any means. I can't wait to get off it!

Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	13-18	5/26/2008 12:40:52 AM	I hated this medication.  I was bleeding 3-4 weeks at a time and only getting a break from the bleeding ever week or so.  I was on it for a year and I decided that was time enough to give it a chance for the break through bleeding to end.  I would not recommend this for anyone who had irregular periods before taking this medication.
Other		4	4	1			5/18/2008 12:01:09 PM	I started taking this medication because of migraines related to the hormonal changes because of my period. I loved the idea of having only 4 periods a year with less migraines. I have had few migraines and never spotted so in those instances it's been great! But it has caused acne worse than I have ever had. I never had acne before, before birth control and on Yasmin. Now I have it worse than ever and when this cycle ends, I'm going back to Yasmin. I would rather have migraines and more periods than the disgusting skin this gives me! No matter what prescription acne medication used, nothing works!
Endometriosis	mark6rlz, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/6/2008 10:14:21 AM	I started taking this in Jan. 08 after being on Lupron. I broke through on my 11th week. I was told it was normal &amp; would only happen on this 1st cycle. Well, on week 6 on the 2nd cycle I started spotting. Dr. told me I would not experience any symptoms because of the Lupron. He was wrong. The first month was great, but once I got my period on week 11, it was back to square one. My abdominal pain has been constant since that day and it's only intensifying. My period was like clockwork before I got on anything. I can't wait to get off this pill.
Birth Control	chickie1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	4/29/2008 5:34:58 PM	I've been taking Seasonique for 4 months now.  I haven't had any breakthrough bleeding whatsoever.  I do feel a little bloated, and have probably gained a few pounds, which I don't like at all.  Also, I suddenly started haveing Acne breakouts (which I never had even when I was a teenager!).  That's the biggest bummer!  I'm 47 years old and am going to give this acne thing 2 more months, as my doctor asked, to see if it goes away.  Funny how these medications affect everybody so differently!
Birth Control	Michelle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	4/24/2008 11:30:00 PM	I recently started taking Seasonique after having been on loestrin for a number of years.  The first 4 weeks were great - no symptoms at all.  Then in my fifth week, I began spotting.  Then the spotting got heavier.  Then I started bleeding like a regular period and I have now been bleeding for the past 4 weeks straight.  The last 2 weeks have been the worst.  The bleeding is extremely heavy with huge clots.  Sometimes the clots fill the entire base of the toilet bowls.  Usually I get a sharp pain in the uterus before the clot and by the time I get to the bathroom everything comes gushing out.  It's almost like the afterbirth when you've had a baby.  On top of it all, I have had severe stomach cramps, headaches, and bouts of depression.  I also have zero sex drive.  This pill is absolutely horrible; I can't wait to get off of it.

I have been phyically exhausted, can't sleep, have bled for four of the last six weeks, am still bleeding two weeks after stopping taking the pills, have problems with dizziness and lightheadness, nearly fell down a flight of concrete stairs it was so bad, no energy, bad mood swings, zero sex drive, and my husband says I have worse &quot;pms&quot; than I ever did before, not to mention even more migraines than I've ever had on any birth control! This is no wonder drug! It's horrid! How long does it take to get this mess out of my system?!!
Birth Control	bluesbabe7, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	4/17/2008 5:52:33 PM	I have been on this BCP for 6 wks. I bled for the first two &amp; 1/2 wks straight, now am bleeding again. Have no interest in sex whatsoever. Still having terrible migraines. Extreme tiredness, irritability, mood swings, dizziness. This is worse than any birth control method I have ever tried. Now I am afraid I am pregnant, why else would I be feeling this way? Yeah, probably the stupid pills. The hell with this med!!!
Painful Periods	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	35-44	4/6/2008 9:56:20 AM	Only 4 periods a year-great! But my periods were still very heavy and painful, with breakthrough bleeding.  Caused gallbladder disease and had to have emergency surgery for removal.  Was on less than 1 year.  Will have partial hysterectomy.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/4/2008 2:57:09 AM	I've been taking this medication for a little over a year, and I absolutely love, love, love it!  The first 3 months I had A LOT of spotting, but once I made it to the second pack I stopped spotting completely.  This was the only birth control I've ever taken that completely cured my acne.  I've taken a lot of different brands, but this one made my skin beautiful, my periods lighter, and my PMS more tolerable.  If you're taking it and you're getting frustrated with the spotting, HANG IN THERE!  It's worth it once your body acclimates!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	3/19/2008 10:43:44 PM	I have been using this for about a year and a half and have not experienced anything different from a regular birth control pill. I've even noticed that my periods only last about 4 days and are very light. I also rarely have spotting, and it is usually due to stress when I do. I love only having 4 periods a year!
Birth Control		1	3	1			3/19/2008 10:27:42 AM	I started taking this medication after my last period and I haven't stopped bleeding since, going on 52 days and counting.  This sucks!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	5	1	Female	19-24	2/24/2008 6:23:51 PM	I started taking it because I had severe migraines related to my menstrual cycle.  On this pill, my migraines were not less frequent, but were less intense and more manageable.  I decided to stop taking the pill half way through the third month because I had been spotting for about 3 weeks, severe breast tenderness, mood swings, and i was nauseous and was vomiting several times a week.  I feel that this pill was too strong and the side effects out-weighed the benefits of taking it.
Endometriosis	ccrating, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	2/20/2008 5:47:37 PM	I took this birth control for 6 months and it was the longest 6 months of my life.  I started having periods at least 2 times a month along with the worst menstural cramping and bloating I have ever experiened.  This pill made my endo symptoms even worse then before.  
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	larz, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	2/15/2008 9:20:06 PM	I have really bad periods and have an issue with my ovaries where they hold the eggs in my ovaries instead of spitting one out once a month.  I am taking this to balance out my hormones.  I was on the birth control Yaz, and it made me so sick.  I have not been sick on this at all.  This is very safe for teenagers even to use. 
Birth Control	Jessica, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	2/2/2008 8:18:45 PM	Please do your homework before starting! Guess what? Break through bleeding for  12 months! Now, after trying 3 other types of pills since then to try to get regulated, i haven't been able to have a normal period since starting the seasonique almost TWO YEARS ago.
Other	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/31/2008 4:24:38 PM	I had never experienced cramping, flooding, or breakthrough spotting or bleeding before. My experience with BCP had never been unpleasant before now. I cannot be more unhappy with myself for even trying the medication.  I started bleeding 6 weeks after starting my very first pack.  3 days after the bleeding started I had to stay in bed for the day, never done this before in my life.  Two days later I experienced a neurocardiosyncopal episode related to the discomfort.  It is now nearing 4 weeks, and guess what I am still bleeding.  Get the facts all the facts before changing what you are doing.  If what you are taking now is working for you don't fall for the &quot;4 periods a year sell&quot;.  It is not worth it!!!Needless to say I am no longer taking the medication.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	1/21/2008 12:04:11 AM	I've really enjoyed the use of seasonique because it helped regulate my hypothyroidism and proved to be very reliable in protection,however I did not enjoy the random spotting.I really liked not having my period for 3months and some days I would be fine and others it would be horrible spotting for a few days in a row. I've also noticed, that if I accidently take it even an hour later than normal I end up with spotting. Im into my 2nd pack and I'm hoping it gets better. Otherwise I might be looking for a different pill.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	1/16/2008 9:27:00 PM	I'm into my third month and have experienced light to heavy spotting every day.  At times, I experience severe uterine cramping and headaches.

I've been taking it for 6 months, ever since my doctor slid me some free samples.  I told him I didn't need them because I was taking generic Seasonale (Jolessa), but he told me to try them anyway.Wow, what a difference!  No breakthrough bleeding at all!  This stuff really works.

I started taking this to help decrease the pain during my periods, make them lighter, and shorter. I have used the medication for over a year now.  I have no interest in sex my younger sexy spouse. I have bleed for more than half of my treatment time.  The only good point is that my period pain was bearable.  It is a great birth control method because I have not had sex in months... I also gained 10 pounds.. I am very active and strictly watch what me and my family intake.
Endometriosis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	1/6/2008 9:47:46 PM	Although I have not had any spotting whatsoever on this pill, the way it messes with my moods, is not worth it for me. Not only do I have crazy mood swings, but I have had a loss of appetite and my sex life has not been so great while on this pill.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	1/2/2008 1:06:50 PM	The first cycle I experienced some nausea. I have been spotting in the second cycle which is likely to occur according to the side effects. I am not happy with the spotting but I hope it will eventually improve as I take this pill.   
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	Kimmer, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/13/2007 9:29:36 PM	My bad cholesterol was 128 in April of this year.  I've lost weight (25 lbs) and started excercising over the summer/fall months.  I started taking Seasonique in Sept.  I had my cholesterol checked last week (early December) and my bad cholesterol was 179.  I couldn't believe it.  Could there be a link because of the estrogen production?  Has anyone else had this happen to them?
Endometriosis	flygirl711, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	13-18	12/8/2007 4:18:26 AM	I began to take this medication after I had my laproscopic surgery for my endometriosis. 1st month went by amazingly other than being a little drained and sore when my period should have been I was fine. Month 2 came along... and omg... I can handle the breakthrough bleeding. But the hair... I have had black hairs come up on my face and in between my breasts and I shave off my &quot;happy trail&quot;  around mid way through the month the hairs instead of growing out grew in... I had 26 ingrown hairs below my belly button and above the pubic bone. I am kinda pissed. It could be a drug interaction since I am on Phentermine, a weightloss drug, and many a vitamin and supplements. But both both my OBGYN and general Dr. both know that. This is the only med that I am taking that has hair growth as a side effect. And It is embarrassing.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/14/2007 4:13:48 PM	It takes your body a bit of getting used to with the breakthrough bleeding.  My doctor said usually about one cycle (3 months).  I have been on this now for over a year and my periods have gone from 5 days to 1 1/2 at the max and very light at that.  I highly recommend it to everyone.

After about a month, I began bleeding which took some time to stop after I stopped taking the pill. I also had severe diziness, and had broken out in a rash on my legs which was when I decided to stop taking it.

Other	Barbie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	9/22/2007 10:35:47 PM	I am 48 and was taking Seasonique in order to control my menstral cycles, which occured every 2 1/2 weeks.  After about one month of taking the pill, my uterus enlarged, I had pain and discomfort in my vaginal area, I experienced frequency in urination, and I gained 5 pounds. Another odd side effect was that the inner lining of my vaginal area protruded through the opening when I experienced a bowel movement.  Once I stopped taking the pill, within 48 hours, I experienced a 80 percent reduction in my symptoms.  However, when my period began again, the pain was worst than ever, and then I started hemoraging and ended up in the emergency room at the hospital.
