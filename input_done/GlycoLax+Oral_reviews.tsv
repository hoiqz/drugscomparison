My doctor told me it was ok to be on the medicine this long. It just goes through your system and won't make you dependent on it. It doesn't give me any side effects and it's effective.

I would love for someone to comment on the safety of this product.

She has had constipation since birth. We just got back from week stay at children's Hospital in DC because of constipation. I now give a bottle cap full (not measure cap) 2xs a day in 1/2 apple juice 1/2 water- Seeming to work better than just in morning. Stools seem normal size now and normal consistency for a 4 yr old, they were overly large and hard, sometimes pebble like. She has been gassy on this.  She eats excellent, not a fast food child - eats veggies and fruits with no problems...but still has constipation! I was very leary of having her on this for so long, but if you don't find the right balance in doses it just gets worse, too loose or opposite! She ended up in ER due to belly enlarging and no BM or urine output. The week prior she had a high fever 103.6 due to virus - They think since she wasn't eating or drinking properly(during Virus)motility shut down. After ruling out several other potential issues she was flushed out, several fleets, eating and drinking better she stooled again on her own. Warning...She had soiled her pants at school and at home week prior - look up constipation -we thought she had loose stools but it was due to hard stool blocking the way and leakage around it - uncontrollable to her. I wish I had known it was a warning sign!!!

I have increased dosage without any help. I was just told by our health food store that this is derived from plastic???Does anyone know if this is true??It is in the name.

My doctor recommended I take it every day, for long term. I no longer suffer from chronic constipation, when I take the prescription every day as directed.

It works, but it took over two weeks before it did anything. He has a severe case of constipation and must take this medication for 7 months, daily. The cap they gave me with it didn't go as low as I needed so I had to get instructions on how much to give him. I don't know how to measure grams.

I am getting a colonoscopy in 2 weeks and was also prescribed glycolax daily and starting taking the powder once a day from Sunday thru Wednesday. I have had so much bloating, gas, and abdominal pain, which made my day miserable at work. I stopped taking Thurs and Fri and have none of these symptoms. I am going to check with my Dr. to see if I can take less often than &quot;every day&quot; because I cannot handle the side effects from this powder, although I did have a daily bile movement, I don't think its worth putting up with the other symptoms.
