Atrial Fibrillation	michael, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Male	45-54	5/15/2011 9:59:04 PM	I have been taking Pacedrone for nearly two years. My heart's annirythmia (sic), had all but dissappeared, but it  brought my heartbeat down to an extremely low level (mid-40's), with the result being extreme fatigue, periodic mental lapses, and occasional swelling on the bottom of my feet. I was on two 200-mg. tablets a day. I decided to reduce my dosage to one, with the result of boosted energy levels &amp; better mental alertness, and my heartbeat remains about the same. This, I must emphasize, were MY results. all &amp; all, I still give pacedrone a thumbs-up.

Atrial Fibrillation	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	12/21/2010 11:30:11 PM	I had continual A-Fib for over 20 yrs, and other medicines didn't help. I have been using pacerone for over a yr, and it has eliminated the irregular heartbeat. I have noticed a large decrease in my enery level, and want to sleep alot. I also have a slight cough I didn't have before. I however, am willing to put up with those two issues, as opposed to having to deal with an irregular heartbeat. My only major concern, is that I was told I would continue to have A-Fib attacks while on the meds, but would probably be unaware they were happening. If so how much damage will that cause?

Changed meds and 9 months later I still have the flashes  Also suffer from some numbess in the arms and legs for short period of times.  This medication does not leave your body after stopping.  Thank goodness my Dr had the good sense to get me off this drug and quickly.

He constantly had blood pressure issues, blood pressure going too low and passing out for long periods of time, numbness of feet, constant fatigue and constant adjusting of thyroid meds, Uroxatral Tabs for urine output issues which lead to renal failure 3 years after treatment, Lipator Tabs for cholesterol which damaged his liver and kidneys, excessive bleeding from simply bumping hand or bruising becoming excessive ... the list goes on.He informed his cardilogist, oncology doctor (for Non Hodgkins Lymphoma), urologist and any physician he saw.  The information was scattered-stop taking Vitamin D; this could be causing the numbness.  Stop taking a multi vitamin; too much Vitamin D in it; taking Ecotrin 325 mg. for heart instead of 81 gr. aspirin to prevent bleeding issues.All these physicians presumable spoke to each other and decided on the proper care for him.He came to visit us in mid December; had a nice holiday.  December 29, 2009 we found him in bed cold and unresponsive.  He had died in his sleep around 2 AM.  We were thankful he was with those who loved him, but still cannot figure out how these MD's get away with such shoddy health care.  He is in a much better place, but I urge anyone thinking of taking this drug to do lots of research before you begin.  It was my dad's time to go, but if these &quot;professionals&quot; can do this to a relatively healthy man in 6 years, what are they doing to the rest of us that we are unaware of?  Just ask lots of questions and do your homework - your life will depend on it.

Rapid Ventricular Heartbeat	Mercedes, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	8/7/2008 12:36:49 AM	This medicaion is a poison! Do not take it. It has the potential to kill. DO NOT TAKE IT IF YOU HAVE ANY LUNG OR BREATHING PROBLEMS. My friend is currently being sent home from the hospital to die at home with his family by his side. He was on the medication for 3 months. The side effects he had are feeling cold, changes in vision and difficulty breathing. He is a 70 year old man who plays the piano at my church. Right now he is in urgent need of a lung transplant because of pacerone. Unfortunately the cut off age of transplants is 69. Very sad! The cardiologist who prescribed the medication basically told him the side effects he was experiencing were no big deal and to continue the medicine. Now my friend's lungs have basically turned into concrete and he cannot breathe even on 100 percent oxygen. He is turning a bluish gray. His condition of a fast heartrate was not life threatening. There was no reason for him to be on such a dangerous medication. Sometimes I wonder if these doctors are getting some kind of kickback from the pharmacetical companies for prescribing a drug like this that is known to cause death. Obviously the medication killed animals or people in its trial runs if the warning is stated on the pharmacy informaton sheet. Well it is such a shame this had to happen to such a wonderful person. He is so loved and respected at our church. I just feel the need to warn others of the potential danger of this medication. I definately think elderly people should stay away from it. I am 34 and I would not take it either. Be careful and God bless.

Additionally, I have suffered sun damage to my face and arms, in the form of large brown blotches (even with the use of sunscreen daily).  I have had severe headaches, stomach pain, and joint pain.  I have developed tingling and itching on my arms and legs,sometimes feeling like pins are sticking me all over.  I have a metalic taste in my mouth.  I have developed a cough.  I have stopped taking Pacerone.  I am still having many of the side effects.
