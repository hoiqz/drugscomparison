High Blood Pressure	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male	25-34	9/4/2012 6:28:54 AM	I've been taking 25MG of Atenolol for the past 2 years for hypertension and tachycardia. It does wonders for my heart rate, it used to be 100-120/BPM and now it's usually down in the 60-75 range. The only drawback is that sometimes my heart rate goes into the 50s and in response my blood pressure actually rises. Also, it has made my asthma symptoms a little bit worse. Overall, the side effects aren't too bad when compared to the effectiveness of the drug

My heart was doing flips I have never felt it so low so I would only take it a few days before my doctors visit thnking my doctor is a doctor for a reason and it must be good for me. Then for the first time I needed surgery my uterus prolapsed and I had to go to a cardio doc before operation my primary doc told me I had a very bad ticker. It just ended up I was not a candidate for a beta blocker. Talk about scary I don't understand how you are a canidate for a beta blocker when your taking lisinopril. I am glad it is over.

It causes like this tight band around my shoulders and rib cage that hurts, especially when I'm in bed tring to sleep. Also, a lot of pain in my hands and stiffness that wasn't there before. Have tried many different BP meds, most have worse side effects than this one!

Not having headaches day after day have been wonderful. Plus I used to get migraines for about a week straight and now there was only one minor headache. The intensity was mild - a lot easier to handle. I do get a little dizzy once in awhile, but nothing to make my life uncomforable. I feel much better without the migraines and headaches daily.

When I next saw Dr. P he told me he had 5 or more patients who he prescribrd Atenolol and it helped them all.It also helped a friend of mine last year who had a phobia. I nave been on this medication for 35 years and take 50 MG daily at night. I only double up for a day or 2 if I have a cold. I most strongly recommec this medicine for anyone with a phobia. Other names for this med are Tolfronil and Imipimine.
High Blood Pressure	junefarmgirl, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female		5/17/2012 6:26:42 PM	I was taking this drug for eleven years. My new cardiovascular doctor took me off it and said I should never have been on it in the first place--didn't say why.  But I was having afib with it a lot, and felt like passing out many, many times.  I read on another medical site on the web that it should not be taken with a calcium channel blocker, which I was also on (Norvasc).  I have read many reviews about this, and I am getting a second opinion about the fact that my new doctor said I needed a pacemaker.  I think the combination of these two drugs could easily be the cause.  If you are taking a beta blocker with a calcium channel blocker, be sure to read all you can about it. I believe it is very dangerous.

No major side effects and was well controlled until last check-up and BP was high, also labs indicated &quot;leaky&quot; or higher protein levels in kidney.  So Doc's prescribed lisinoprol 20mg to take, that might help w/both and possibly reduce or replace atenolol?  Anyone else have similar experiences?   No history of Heart Attacks..

High Blood Pressure	cebar, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	55-64	3/21/2012 5:45:29 AM	The effectiveness of many medications is such a trade off between the obvious effect (the good thing) and the side effects or negative stuff, which can be many. The cold hands and feet in the beginning of treatment with atenolol or tenormin as I new it 30 years ago tells us what? That something is just not completely correct here but your body is amazing and it adjusts, your body can adjust to many things that might not be totally good for you. I am not belittling atenolol because I believe the overall good for me as far as blood pressure is concerned  is a good thing. I do believe that it has contributed to ED and fatigue, but whats the trade off? again...Life is never perfect and my wife who has heart issues and POTS and other things has been prescribed medicine time and time again but ends up never taking anything. My take on it is she skips the effects and goes right to the side effects. Its quite a phenomena. For me I would like to try a new blood pressure medicine but after so much time, don't know if its worth it. Although.....I believe that sex and love and the ability to perform is life and without it, well, it has a psychological effect on you.. In the end a beta blocker and an aspirin will probably save my life one day only to linger on for another day... HaH! I am being melodramatic, what can I say , I guess thats just me.....:)

It helped as far as keeping my blood pressure and heart rate down, but not long after taking it I started having some major problems with Acid Reflux. I also had severe Esophageal Spasms almost the entire time I was taking this medicine, and thought it was heart related. It felt like a painful fluttering in the left side of my chest. The whole time I was on this medicine I went between my PCP, an ENT Specialist with Reflux problems, as well as a trip to the ER when the Esophageal Spasms got very bad one night and I thought I was having a heart attack. The ER actually increased my dosage of Atenolol! None of the doctors I saw ever realized the problem I was having was a side effect of Atenolol. I finally stopped taking this medicine on my own after doing a lot of research and reading that the problems I was having with Reflux &quot;could be&quot; a side effect of it. A few weeks after being off of it my Reflux started to improve and the Esophageal Spasms went away entirely. I know this medicine was the cause, because a week ago my heart started racing again and my BP was elevated, so I gave in and tried to go back on the Atenolol. After only 2 doses I had painful Esophageal Spasms again. I will be scheduling a follow up with my doctor ASAP to see what else I might try to take in place of the Atenolol.

Within a few weeks, I was dizzy, nauseous, suffering from dry eyes, and losing my hair. I called my cardiologist, and she said that only males have side effects from this drug!!!  I called my pharmacist, and was told that this was NOT true!  I sought a second opinion, thank God, who said my heart beats were not that bad to require this medication, so he weaned me off of it.I took  1 25 mg tab for a weeks, then 1/2 a tab for a week, then 1/2 tab every other day for a week.  I feel so much better now.My first cardiologist said that if I stopped taking this medication, I would end up in the ER with a heart attack.  My second cardiologist said that was nonsense, and told me to get off the drug if I wanted to.  I did.  I HATE this drug and think that it should be taken off the market.  It made my life a living hell for no reason.  My first cardiologist did not believe me.  All I can say is if you have similar side effects, GET A SECOND OPINION! The funny thing is, I think that this medication gave me anxiety and made my irregular heart beats worse.  I am an attorney, and don't like to be treated like an idiot by a doctor(my first cardiologist)  It's been 2 weeks since I totally went off this drug.  No dizziness or nausea. My eyes are not dry so I can have my lasik surgery.  I think my hair has almost stopped falling out.  I hope it grows back!

We will see what happen. yes I too thought I was on the miracle drug that really had my BP under control but Lord behold the studpid hacking cough got me and didn't let go until Physician took me off it.

High Blood Pressure	cofm, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	35-44	9/5/2011 10:07:50 PM	I stopped taking this drug after 3 months on (then went to bystolic for 3 months) and then returned to this drug for another 3 months. I can tell you beta blockers are not for me. I felt extremely depressed an tired a lot of the time I was on it. It took a while being on the drug for symptoms to start occurring (while I was on Bystolic it really got bad). I have been off the drug for a little over a month and the symptoms are still there but not as intense. I pray the symptoms will all go away over a longer time period. I wish there was a way for people to really talk to each other over this website to get better feed back. I just hope my contribution helps. After reading several of the other reviews I thought I would give my feedback. I would recommend that if you are on this drug and have had any of the symptoms in mine or other post talk to your doctor. Don't let them tell you to just take more and the symptoms will go away (chances are they will just get worse). Don't let them change you to another beta blocker as well. Hope this helps if it does please hit the help button it will let me know you read it. Others I know that have taken it do really well so this is only for those who are having ill side effects.

June 28th of this year was my last time taking it due to lightheadedness, occasional vertigo, coughing spasms, feeling tired, depressed, and achy. Monitor my BP daily, it isn't high, within normal range for my age group. I have improved all around since discontinuing, on my own advice. Dr. never addressed my concern for coughing and lightheadedness, only prescribed a nausea med and prescribed Celexa for depression. I also took myself off of Celexa at the end of May this year, am feeling great! I know my body better than anyone else and how I feel, so that's why I have discontinued certain medications. Having that stroke threw everything out of whack, but things are great now.

Started out taking 25 mg, and in last few years up to 50 mg. because bp was too high. I occasionally get dizzy and will have shortness of breath.  I take medication in the morning and I can recall when I first started taking it, I would feel very tired during the middle of the day.  That feeling did not last very long. I do not have trouble falling asleep at night, but do wake up alot.  Whether or not that has anything to do with the medication, I do not know.  My bp compared to others that have commented here, is great. I had alot of palpatations and problems prior to taking this medication.  It has helped me tremendously.

Felt foggy with suppressed energy, but that would have been acceptable had I not also experienced severe insomnia (I'm talking no sleep some nights, and 2-3 hours at best). Also got rewarded during these waking hours with intense anxiety which required me to be constantly moving about throughout the night in an attempt to regulate apparent breathing and heart beat issues. Terrible. Was off it cold turkey after two weeks use following my doctors instructions, and maybe on to another drug..but not sure about that after this experience. Also did little to control my high blood pressure during the time I used it.

I took it for several years and it did stop the P.A.T. from occurring....however,I started having dizzy spells....up to 50 or so a day. I got dizzy while driving and was afraid I would pass out and then one day I did pass out.  I ended up on the bathroom floor.  At that point I quit the drug and have never had a problem since.  I told the doctor about it and he said to go back on it.  I wrote him a nasty letter and never went back to him.  Then I started reading about different drugs and I'm never taking any more prescription drugs for BP, Chlorestral or bones.  I've never felt better. Blood pressure goes up and down for a REASON.  Don't mess with it. Don't let these clueless doctors talk you into it...especially older people as blood pressure tends to rise as you age.

The side effects of Lisinopril are gone, thank goodness! Atenolol is much better regarding side effects because it does not pass into the central nervous system. I agree that its better to take it a night. I started that and then my Dr. said to take it in the morning. I am tired and lazy all day long now. Heck with that... I am going back to taking it at night again. I do not exerience the tiredness in the daytime, that way.

Other	Bob, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	3	2	Male	65-74	4/15/2011 12:41:32 PM	I am a 71 year old male and have taken atenolol or tenor man, the brand name for atenolol since bypass surgery in 1996. Surgery was for clogged coronaries not heart attack. I have always been at a healthy weight and am active in warm weather. Since taking the drug I have experienced the following: developed dry cough; diagnosed with asthma; diagnosed as non insulin dependent pre-type II diabetic; very good bp control except for one incident when dosage was increased from 50 to 100 mg / day; and finally when I went to an allergist to get help with sinus/ asthma symptoms was told allergy tests could NOT be performed because if I had a reaction to a skin test that progressed to antifalactic shock the beta blocker would Block the effect of an adrenalin shot to your heart and you cannot be saved. Therefore, my allergist can only treat my allergic symptoms and not find out what I am allergic to. What a shock to find out anyone who takes atenolol cannot be saved in they experience antifalatic shock.

Was put on Atenolol. Had a thyroid scan..nothing is wrong with my thyroid. My doctor said I have acquired a virus that went to my thyroid, after I had an URI that wouldn't go away..very scary symptoms: high fever, chills, hand trembling, racing heart rate, severe fatigue &amp; weakness..could barely get out of bed...lost 25 lbs in 3 weeks. Thank God I have a caring and diligent physician, who is getting to the bottom of it!

Has worked well to control my A-fib till the past year. I've noticed my hair thinning, my blood sugars going up and my weight has been increasing even with exercise and diet control over the past year. I found out that I have to go off this med gradually, so that is what I'm doing now. Hopefully I can find something else to control my A-fib without all these side effects!!

High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	3/10/2011 11:02:16 AM	I take 50mg of Atenolol and 25mg of a diuretic. It seems like every time I'm on a BP medicine for 3+ months it stops working, or in this case with what I'm on now my BP feels extremely low. I'm dizzy, have headaches, extremely fatigued, moody, and figure I have to head back to my doctor once again. The cycle never ends...I'm 33, weigh 115lbs &amp; have had high BP for a long time, but only been on meds for about 2 years. This so called &quot;silent killer&quot; isn't very silent to me.

I was having almost non-stop migraine headaches and regular headaches when I didn't have a migraine. Now I rarely have a normal headache. It took a couple of weeks to get into my system and I have only had one migraine since then. Even though I got one I only took one Imitrex and it was gone. That never happened before. I will still get pains up the back of my neck as if I am about to get the migraine but it will not actually start at all.It has also lowered my blood pressure to a normal rate (along with Diovan).

Since taking this med, I have very few if any episodes with this condition.  I have learned to sense or feel when I may have one of these episodes and I can ward-off almost all of these episodes.  My doctor has given me very strict orders in how I take this med.  It can make one very tired depending on the dose..

I am now weaning myself off because it did drop my heart rate into the low 50's but my blood pressure actually went up considerably and I was having trouble breathing.  My 40 yr. old neighbor takes Atenolol for anxiety and it does reduce anxiety probably because it drops your heart rate.  Not a good drug for me!

The palpatations, tachycardia, anxiety, diarrhea, tremors, are all gone.  The only problem is I was getting really dizzy so I have been cutting them in half...still works, just a little light headed at times, and my BP is always low to begin with, this drug makes it lower.  Also, my feet are always cold now, and really white...I need to get off this med and get the radiation to my thyroid soon, but in teh mean time, it has helped alot!

I have to find something else that doesn't have so many side effects for me.  I have tried 11 others...all I cannot take.  The best one has been the Catapres patch but it irritated my skin so badly, I had to quit using it.  I'm going back to it tonight, however.  Don't know what to take...any suggestions??

I'm currently taking 50mg once daily, which may increase because I'm still getting migraines at the same rate, except they're less severe. At first, I had extremely low blood pressure (blue fingertips, difficulty breathing, diarrhea); but after the first two weeks, all those side effects went away, and I'm even starting to lose the weight I gained from propranolol.

He lost 30 lbs. which I find unusual because it states weight gain as a side effect.  He gets freezing cold feet.  Haven't been back to the doc to see if it's actually helping in preventing an aortic aneurysm.

Will try to get on another medication as soon as possible, and if necessary see a good cardialogist to perhaps have a pacemaker installed, which I understand has no drug side effects..Would appreciate some feedback from any of you out there who has had a pacemaker installed..Thanks!!

At first i complained it made me dizzy, so he lowered the dose, but kept me on it.  I HATE THIS DRUG.  For so many years, i had terrible dizzy spells, just about every time i stood up, near fainting.  I had to adjust my daily life because of it, had to make sure i parked somwhere near where i could sit down or lean on somthing, actually had to sit on the floor or sidewalk.  Anyhow, i changed DR's, and my new one asked me why i was on it, and i said i really dont know. After reading the review on this site, I told the DR i wanted to quit it.  He agreed, and I immediately felt SO much better, now a year later, my BP is perfect, and i have no more dizzy spells and weakness.  A lot of people are &quot;allergic&quot; to this drug.  If you are feeling these side effects, ask your DR to take you off it.  I am ticked i gave so many good years to this BAD DRUG!

Dr. does not believe this drug can give high gluose,put me on Metformin....did work a little bit to lower  blood sugar. Found out about side effect of Atenolol and stopped taking ALL medication to see which med is the culprit of my high glucose.....after 4 days my glucose is practically  a normal range again. This medication has been ban in Great Britain, since 2006, for people who had heart attack due to provocation of Diabetes Type 2.

Before taking this I was unable to work out.  Working out would cause me to have skipped beats (pvc) and often go into svt.  I can now be active with very rarely having problems. I still occasionally get skipped beats or go into svt but not anywhere as often as before.  It does sometimes cause me to have a slow heart rate and have felt lightheaded when standing up.  But overall the side effects are worth being able to live a normal active life without having to worry about my heart racing.
Other	ireagn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	10/1/2010 12:06:04 AM	I started taking it about 1 yr. ago for irregular heartbeat (PVC).since talking it I started getting very tired and fatigued, my hair started falling out, having some memory proplems, muscle weakness and muscle soreness and some muscle cramps, nauseau and had trouble sleeping and bloodpressure.  I was told I had fibromyalgia.   I had been praying for healing and asking God to give me wisdom what to do. I did some reaearch and found these are all side effects  of atenenol. Also, I thyroid medicine and atenenol counteracts thyroid replacement.  I was in a fix. I told my physician and he  took me off of it and put me on Norvasc, I feel so much better . It's been a week and the soreness and weakness is almost gone. My energy is coming back,  I am so thankful my dr. listened to me. wasn't fibromyalgia just reaqlly bad side effects. My thyroid med had been increased 2 times in less than a year because it was being cancelled out.I you're having side effects investigate on your own and talk to your doctor.

Started out with one pill a day. Didn't really keep my BP where it should be especially the top number. Dr then changed me to 2 times a day. Top # sometimes gets high (160-171). Have not had any side affects. No weight gain, no fatigue (I do love an afternoon nap) etc. If I feel calm.. I know my BP is OK... if I feel I can conquer the world...then it is high. Always feel better if it is high.

Don't come off this drug suddenly it can speed your heart up and cause a stroke or heart attack. Talk to your doctor before stop taking it. I take this with Lisinopril and Norvasc.

It was very effective but as I lost weight I became dissatisfied with side effects. I stopped taking it because it contributed greatly to ejaculatory dysfunction and it reduced the cardio benefits of aerobic exercise. I still take one occasionally if my BP gets too high.

I do experience occassional chest pain and mild arythmias from time to time. I notice that it does cause me some distraction trying to sleep because of my pounding heart beat due to it lowering my heart rate but tolerable. Much better then the Flecainide which had severe side effects. After doing the research, Atenolol is probably the most low risk blocker I can find. I am currently taking Atenolol - 25mg- after having an SVT Ablation on June 18, 2010. Working well... hope this helps.

I have been on atenolol for 5 years, and although my feet don't get as cold as they first did, I often have to wear socks to bed. Also, after a couple of years, I had to increase the dosage from 50 to 100 mg. Then I had to add another drug (benazapril) with it to be effective. I started with atenelol to regulate my heart rate, which it did. I am also glad that it is a very inexpensive drug(insurance doesn't cover it).

Although I am also taking three other blood pressure medicines. For a least a year now I have been very dizzy, short of breath, and weak. I have seen many doctors within the year and they haven't done anything. The other day I was trying to do my laundry and my arms felt limp and weak. My blood pressure was dropping to 75/60 and I felt the room spinning. I called the nurse and she made an appointment for me the following Monday. It turns out that I was on too much of the medicine.  Glad to be coming off of this drug.

It's taken care of my HBP but I am concerned about some hair loss, 20lbs weight gained in just over 2 months after getting out of the hospital and swollen feet and hands. Like I said, it took care of the HBP issue but I'm very worried about these side effects and hope to get off of this med soon!

My cardiologist perscribed this medication for me because I had a rapid pulse with no cause.  My heart would race when I was either stressed or exerted myself.  Even walking fast would cause my pulse to race and I'd get light headed.  My resting heart rate was around 115-120!  The day I started taking atenolol, my resting heart rate slowed to the 70's and now if I exercise, my heart rate only raises to a safe level.  I take this medication right before I go to bed and I have never had any side effects whatsoever.  This medication has done wonders for me.  I have a much more improved quality of life.  And - this medication is very inexpensive - only about $4 every three months!  I have no qualms about taking this medication for as long as my cardiologist suggests.

It worked ok,but I started taking only 1/2 a pill because w/ the hydrochlorathiazide, I was so thirsty. I changed RX recently to Lisinopril ( which I had to stop taking due to constant coughing, but I noticed my leg joints don't ache as much. Hmmm! Also, recent blood tests showed elevated glucose, &amp; I am not diabetic. Other than that, my blood pressure was kept in check.

Instead of upping my dose of this drug, doc wants to switch me to Lisinopril. Have heard horror stories about Lisinopril's side effects. I have never had any side effects from Atenolol except for occasional tiredness. I'm hoping to stay on it and use diet and exercise techniques to lower BP further.

In 2000 my 60% regurgatation was gone and in 2006 No more Mitral Valve Prolapse. I still have occasional Irregular Rapid Heartbeat (Flutters) but not nearly as bad as I used to have (between 40-120x @ day). Side affects: Gained 40 Lbs in the last 10 yrs. Very Cold hands &amp; feet in winter and get foot &amp; Calf cramps. Had to retire due to being always tired and dizzy. I HAVE TO HAVE A NAP IN THE AFTERNOON for at least 2 hrs a day to be able to function the rest of the day. No Energy to do anything &amp; NO SEX DRIVE WHAT SO EVER!! Tried taking medication at different time of day so I can sleep at night,..doesn't make a bit of difference.  I go to bed at 10:30 pm and Still take at least 2 hrs to get to sleep at night and then up at 4am. I've tried to talk to all sorts of doctors and they all want me to stay on this medication, so I guess I'm stuck. I guess it beats the alternative,....&quot;Kicking up Daisies&quot; I hope this information is helpfull to others.

While is calms down my PVCs from my mitral valve prolapse, I also had to modify my diet to exclude caffeine and certain meds that cause your heart to beat faster.  Since I feel every single PVC (very annoying) that can cause more anxiety, this med is a blessing. Definitely do not hesitate trying this med if you are diagnosed with MVP.

It causes me to feel spacey or vague (which can be depressing), lessens my sex drive, and I have cold hands and feet.  However, it is very effective in slowing my heart rate.

High Blood Pressure	Crash, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	4/27/2010 7:45:03 PM	I went to the hospital because I was having a hard pounding in my chest every five minutes or so. They asked me how long I had high blood pressure, and I said I didn't know I had it. They gave me the medication and said I was having heart pulputions or something like that. Well, I thought it was a panic attack for losing a $2000.00 check that I never lost. (Later found it at home)Well, they don't tell you once you start taking it that you can't just stop taking it or it can damage your heart. So, I took it for like 2 years and was experiencing soreness in my legs to where I couldn't walk and felt ill all the time, so, my doctor made me take a higher dose, and the symptoms got worse. I told her about the soreness in my muscles and she said it was from working too hard. Then she left her place of work and got her own practice but didn't take all of her patients that she was treating I guess. Anyway I went and got a three months supply and started taking 3 quarters of it for like 6 weeks then went to half for 6 weeks then to a quater for six weeks and then stopped. It's been almosts 2 years now and haven't had any problems with the muscle in my legs and check my bllod pressure regulary and it's been normal. Just wanted to sharethat little story for those who might be experiencing the same things. Get check out by a good doctor, not one who just wants the paycheck and one who care about thier patient.

I'm only 41, but on my mom's side it starts pretty early. This med has greatly improved it and relieved the headaches as well. Luckily I only take one med so far but I definitely like it.

I've been to the doctor two times and he says it's Reynaud's syndrome, but in researching don't see tingling and numbness associated with Reynaud's.  I never associated it with Atenolol until reading other peoples reviews on this site.  I am definately going to mention this to the doctor.

My doc gave ti to me to prevent chest pain, but i did not have any.  ANyway, i have had no sex drive at all, gained weight, have terrible leg and foot cramps, extreme dizziness and near fainting episodes, swollen feet and hands occasionally.  I mentioned these things to my doc and he said they were not related to my meds.  I changed docs, and the new one asked why i ws on 2 of these meds, and i did not know, and as he did not have my records at that time, he didnt either.  Had my records transferred, and now he is gone, too.  WTH.  If i had seen these reviews before i would have never started this drug.  Someone stated they felt like they had been poisoned, i think that sums it up.

High Blood Pressure	55-64 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	55-64	2/26/2010 5:33:16 PM	I started taking Atenolol 2005; It did a very good job at lowering my blood pressure.After taking Atenolol (10mg) daily for approximately three years the side affects started.I was unable to function at all three or four days a week.The doctors where unable to determined what was causing my severe dizziness and lightheadedness.This was after numerous X-Rays, Cat Scans and MRIsAfter almost two years of suffering, I decided to quit all of my Vitamins and supplemental; I take about twenty a day.As a last resort I found another Doctor and had him find another blood pressure medication.Im now taking Amlodipine (10mg) daily.It seems to be working somewhat, my BP is still much high.After coming off the Atenolol over a thirty day period about 80% of the side affects are gone, thank the Lord for small favors.Be very careful with all of the so called FDA approved blood pressure drugs.I only wish a few more Medical Doctors would read some of reviews that real people write.

Two years ago I also had 5 stents inserted. I exercise in the gym at least 5 days a week for 60 to 90 minutes. There are however times I feel very light headed and at times quite dizzy (I do not feel light headed or dizzy when I am exercising). I very much enjoy the exercises and I do feel good. I am however rather concerned with the light headedness and giddiness. Could this be due to the atenolol. I am also on trandolapril 3 mg. daily. Any advice will be appreciated.

I am taking a few different meds. so reading these reviews helped me to find the problem.  Atenolol works well for me I take it 3x a day @25mg, along with Rythmol sr 225mg also 3x a day.  Even though it works I can not be having my hair fall out.  I will call the Doc. today and get something different.  I just hope it grows back.

I was diagnosed with P.A.T. and given a prescription for Atenol even though my BP was low.  It worked for the P.A.T. so I continued taking it.  Last summer I started getting dizzy spells several times a day.  Then one day I woke up on the bathroom floor.  I had fainted.  I stopped taking the drug and the dizziness went away.  I went back to the doctor that had prescribed the Atenol and told him the story.  He told me to NOT go off the meds...said to go home and take one right away.  I did and I again passed out.  I'm never going to take another one and I'm not going back to that heart doctor that wanted me to stay on this dangerous drug.  It was scary especially when I was driving.  I could just as easily passed out in my car.

When I received the medication from CVS, they did not have a warning that if you had Psorisis, you should not take the medication.  I became so sick using it.  I finally Googled the medication and that is when I learned I shouldn't be using it.  I missed work, was full of pain, I couldn't even hardly make it from the couch to the bathroom I was so sick.  Be careful of this medication if you have Psorisis!

First started taking this med in Jan of 07 for HBP.  It was 25mg twice daily.  My blood pressure stayed high so the dose was upped to 50mg twice daily.  At first my breathing was effected but that soon went away.  I like to exercise, so in the beginning I took one and went to the gym and I couldn't do anything without getting real tired and I realized it was the medicine.  The doctor told me to exercise, so what I do now is that I don't take the med before exercising but take it after, I take green tea pills for energy before exercising.  I get the occasional bad dreams and the numbness in toes, blood pressure still kind of high but that's because I need to change my eating habits, but overall it's been effective for me.

Stopped both and back pain went away. Didn't know about the hair loss but maybe that is why my hair is getting so thin.  I thought it was aging that was causing it.  Back to the Dr. although they get upset when I say I won't continue to take a drug becasue of the side effects.  Anyone know of a drug that won't make you cough, cause lower back pain or hair loss, won't make you dizzy or cause you to gain weight?  And, it lowers your blood pressure.  I've been on several and they all have too many side effects.

The dr. told me I can continue if I want since I've been on it for so long. I do have blurry vision (not too bad) and that may be due to also taking Ativan for anxiety. Atenolol is a great drug and it's cheap and very effective.

I, for one, suffered this after a few years of use.  It was my doctor who reasearched and suggested this may be the cause.  Once off the medication my symptoms completely disappeared.

High Blood Pressure	maggiemae, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	55-64	11/11/2009 8:00:29 PM	25 mg. Atenolol was prescribed for my somewhat high blood pressure (130's/80's), and because I was having PVC's (Premature Ventricular Contractions) as well as some anxiety in my life.  I took medications for about 3 weeks and stopped yesterday.  I was still having some PVC's (not as many as before), but it did not lower my blood pressure, and I became very tired.  My blood pressure was actually higher than before I took drug (150's/90's), and I was starting to develop cough.  Since I've been off it, my pressure is back to where it was before.  The PVC's don't seem to be as frequent right now.  Hopefully exercising and eating better will help these problems.

I've been taking the same dose now for over 18 years, and it keeps my BP down to 115/75 routinely.Minimal side effects (muscle weakness)when I first started using it, but that went away and my life returned to a normal one. I would agree that if your doctor suggests this for you, that you give it a try.

I'll report back after a period of time and comment on it's effectiveness.

Blood pressure is reduced, I feel calmer, no headaches (including migraines) at all.  The only bad thing I've experienced so far is a dull, tired achiness in my legs.  I've only been on this med for about three weeks and it started a week ago.  My legs don't ache when I get up in the morning but start aching within a few hours.  Going back to the doctor in a week and will talk to him about it.  I'm hoping this will ease up after my body has more time to adjust to this medication.

High Blood Pressure	Deb B , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	8/19/2009 3:04:17 AM	After being on it coupled with Tenoretic for a couple of years it helped my high blood pressure well enough but this last march and april started having problems with my asthma. My doctor took me off of it but failed to wean me off of it. With-in a week I ended up in the ER with chest pains and ended up staying overnight. A couple of weeks later ended up back in ER with a irregular and rapid heart rate at time of 190+ beats per minute. That doctor placed me back on the atenolol at twice the dosage I was taking before but I am still having problems with fluttering in my chest/lower throat and am having problems with my lungs feeling raw when I am walking in cooler temps (it appears to be getting worse/more frequent even in warmer temps). would really like to get off of it but am afraid of possibly having a heart attack. Never had these problems before I started taking it. Would never have started taking it I had known about the danger of stopping it.

Can I tell everyone to have a home blood pressure monitor, use it 2x a day and take results w/you to the MD.  Get blood tests 4x yr in 1st year.  Phone in any side effects/BD changes to MD. SPEAK UP FOR YOURSELF!  MD is busy but they have med. techs who can help you.  If the MD ignores you find another MD and tell the first one why you leaving and march in and demand all your records for your new MD.  See if they have a Web site and perhaps you can enter a complaint. Actually, I have found that as age my MD finds my &quot;take charge of yourself&quot; mindset refreshing.  She does not have to keep &quot;fishing around&quot; for the info she needs!  Come prepared, write down all your concerns/questions, if you are very ill, try to keep a daily log or do the best you can to provide all possible information when you get to see your Doctor.

When I started again my skin became extremely irritated, rashes, etc... and painful to the touch, but all the other symptoms started going away again, and I feel all around much better while taking it regularly. My bp is still high, but it the lowest it's been in years and it,s considered low or norm for me. At least it's now a consistant average.

It is a little scary.  I told them not to bury me until they prove I'm really dead because of this problem.

My entire family has a history of high blood pressure and heart disease, so my doc put me on this and it has worked great. I started at 25 mgs, and after a while I was up to 75mgs. Recently I started having fainting spells, so it was reduced to 50 mgs. Everything is just great now.

I ended up being in the er twice two days apart because of atenenol. The only pill I took was on a Fri early afternoon. I woke up about 12 hrs later sick. The first visit to the er was on Sat evening. The 2nd. was on Mon. evening where I had IV'S in me for 5 hrs. The RN on duty told me Mon. that if I had not been brought in that evening (mon) that I would have been  911'd out Tues almost dead, that is how bad I reacted to it. NEVER again will I take Atenenol.

Both worked fine as far as my BP, but Atenolol has given me far worse side effects - swelling, horrible joint pain, low pulse, nausea, sore throat, 15 lb. weight gain in 3 months, irritability.  When I run, I can't get my pulse up, yet I sweat profusely, which is very unusual for me.  I called my doctor this morning. I want off this medicine NOW.

At that time my doctor prescribed 5 Mg of Norvasc in addition to the 50 Mg of Atenolol.  My blood presure while sporadic at times dropped down to below 120/80 for the first time ever.  The combination of the two drugs seems to work well.  However, about 4 months ago I was hammered with joint pain.  While I had been diagnosed with osteo arthritis 5 years ago I never had this kind of excruciating pain. My left big toe, my wrists, my rotator cuffs, knees.  It continues to rotate to different joints, but has not stopped since.  Could one or both blood pressure drugs be exacerbating my arthritis?

High Blood Pressure	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	19-24	7/10/2009 11:18:39 PM	Atenolol lowered my blood pressure fairly well, but also lowered my heart rate significantly.  At one point my pulse was around 40 bpm while at rest.  It took away some of my energy as well, and I had to stop taking it.  I tried several other medications for hypertension with some success, and ended up back on Atenolol.  I now take both Atenolol and Lisinopril, and together they are working wonderfully.  I've had high blood pressure since I was 16, and Atenolol was the first medicine I was prescribed.  When I was 16, it caused too bad of side effects for me to continue.  I am now at a lower dose of Atenolol and a fairly low dose of Lisinopril, and together they have lowered my blood pressure without any bad side effects.

Also my heart rate gets low - one time it got down to 44.  It does an &quot;ok&quot; job of lowering BP.  Sometimes it's close to normal and other times it's high.

I beieve my numbness and tingling in my arms and legs are from this medication.  My doctor does not agree--at least he has not changed this medication to an alternate one.  He actualy increased it to twice a day to get better control of my hypertension.  The numbness and tingling is periodic, not related to time of day, but rather to position of a body part such as resting an arm on the arm rest of a chair.

I was prescribed this medication for palpitations.  It seems to work overall, although as I have been reading other people's posts about this drug, some of them have the same tingling and numbness in hands and arms and the back of my head.  Also, I feel my nerves shaking when I'm falling asleep at night.  This happens every night.  Maybe I'll wean off it.  I have been taking it for 6 months.
Other	cats369, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	6/23/2009 4:36:30 PM	I started taking Atenolol several years ago after 2 episodes of benign rapid heartbeat and also have a slight arrythmia. I found it keeps the rapid heartbeat under control, but have put on some weight, feel fatigued often, memory and concentration problems, elevated blood sugar readings (the cardiologist told me this could happen), and it didn't seem to help the basic arrythmia flutterings a lot. I saw my Dr. today and he said he wanted to get me off Atenolol and have me try Coreg because in the past year they've found that Atelolol has some major side effect problems.

I recently went to my doctor because of feeling very tired all the time.  I also felt as though my sex drive had decreased.  This has been going on for years, but I never told my doctor because I didn't think it was my meds.  I was also a little embarrased about telling him about my sex drive.  I am glad that I finally talked with him.  He told me to cut down to 50mg then we will recheck my bp.  I have been taking 50mg for 5 days now.  I feel as though I have more energy and I am feeling my sex drive getting stronger.  I would have never thought the medication would do this to me.  I have gained at least 20 lbs too.  I am looking forward to increased energy.

I have a lot of trouble concentrating, can't seem to say what I am thinking at times, hair loss, very cold hands and feet, itchy red rash above ankles, decreased sex drive, difficulty swollowing, and I have gained a large amount of weight. I did not know all of these side effects could be from this med until I read other reviews. I am going to talk with my doctor about changing to another med. Thanks everyone!

I hate the dizziness and excessive sweating with taking it.  I notice after a few hours I feel very tired, but then after about an hour it goes away.  It has lowered my bp to 90/58 from 90/78 so I'm a bit concerned about that.

High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	4/15/2009 5:27:12 PM	I started taking this medication because of HBP and heart palpitations.  Side effects  were many, including chest pain, shortness of breath,aching joints and weight gain.  I changed my diet and started using magnesium lotion as perscribed by a holistic doctor.  I was skeptical at first but it has worked for me thankfully.  Look up the benefits of magnesium lotion online for yourself you will be surprised.  It will take about 3 weeks of using the lotion to get it built up in your system.  But I would recommend for some people to see a holistic or homapathy type of physican in addition to your regular MD.  They may be able to offer you natural alternatives to your health issues.  God Bless!

Other	grandgrouse8@yahoo, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	55-64	4/3/2009 10:57:30 AM	I crushed my left hand in machinery in 1978, and have a later injury to my neck and shoulders. My left hand is always uncomfortable to downright excruciating. My neck and shoulders ache too,but not always at the same time.I recently lost 27 lbs. I've been depressed since 1960 when my only brother died, they didn't believe in counseling then and my family was disfunctional because of this. I take antidepressants, and of course I'm menopausal. I'm a retired RN and recently widowed and my children have their own children and issues so I have animals. My ankles are weak but has been since my teens, I bruise at the least little bump. I'm sure my condition is real but my life and incidences that have occured are not addressed, and the lack for consistent care by a physician and money issues has made things so much worse. Yes I've had a traumatic life but it has had meaning and I endure by God's grace. Anyone out there who knows how I can be comforted and functional too please respond. I also didn't mention I've had breast cancer and a survivor, and a benign brain tumor that makes my thought process slow or complete lack there of.

A month ago added a new water pill, Spironolactone, due to swelled ankles. Water pill takes care of swelling but have developed a lower backache. Not sure if it is from the water pill or osteoporosis. I am concerned it is kidney related. Dr. says to keep taking water pill. Has anyone else had lower back pain from that water pill?

Also, during a 'run' more time to get warmed up. Hopefully pros out weigh the cons.

For the past 2 years I've been experiencing short-term memory loss and my fingers and toes get cold quicker than before. Loss of sexual drive comes and goes. My new side effect is tingling and numbness in my fingers but still unsure if Atenolol is the cause. Overall, this drug has been effective for me and my side effects are still minor.

High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	3/10/2009 9:59:53 AM	I am a healthy 36 yr old female.  My Dr. put me on this drug for slightly high bp as well as migraine prevention.  I have to say it has helped w/the bp.  Not so much w/the migraines.  I have slight dizziness and fatigue But I am still able to do 45 min of cardio and I have no problems doing it.  I have had palpitations in the past and haven't noticed any while on this med.  but I do think it is messing w/my vision a bit.  and I have tingling in my upper back &amp; scalp.  I'm not sure if this is due to this drug or not.  I'm not sure if I will continue taking it since this tingling is starting to drive me crazy as it seems to be increasing.  perhaps a lower dose will do the trick.

Prevention of Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation	GOTPIPS, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	3/8/2009 8:29:56 PM	I was prescribed Atenolol (25mg)after experiencing a sudden onset of palpitation, which I've never had in my life! I was rushed to ER and was later diagnosed as having SupreVentricular Tachycardia (SVT),and was admitted for overnight observation. The treadmill stress test, echocardiogram, EKG, blood tests were all normal. The Atenolol (25mg)did not stop my palpitations. In fact, I had a total of 10 episodes that was captured while wearing the &quot;King Of Hearts&quot; monitor. So, my cardiologist increased the dosage to 50mg. I was then referred to another specialist; a cardio physiologist who specializes in heart rhythm and I was given two options: life of medications or catheter ablation. I chose the latter in January 2009, but my heart would not palpate even with three different induced palpitations drugs. Although, it was unsuccessful, the good thing is that the cardiologist did verify that my heart is healthy--disease free. I was put on Flecaininde (100mg)twice daily; once in the morning, and again in the evening. All was well until most recently when I started experiencing very cold hands and feet, lightheadedness having dizzy spells when I stood up. But, what concerned me was my low heart rate and blood pressure. So, I was told to stop the Atenolol for two days, which I did. However, the second day my heart went into palpitations that lasted for about 25 minutes. I had my neighbor rush me to ER and my BP was reading at 189/90 plus, but heart rate was within the norm (89). Everytime, I have this episode, it cannot be duplicated at the ER, which is crazy. In addition, I completely stopped taking Gemfibrozil, Simvastatin, and Lovaza because of it tore up my gut, caused severe burning pain in my lower back that eventually traversed into my chest area. I discovered that I cannot take Omega-3 fish oil whether liquid or tablets, as it caused me to have gas pockets in my throat; a feeling of food stuck in my throat, which sent me to ER also. I hate taking drugs!

I was an active 112 pound woman with extremely high blood pressure. I have been taking the same dose for the past 9 years and I only notice a difference if I miss a dose, otherwise there hasn't been any side effects. It is important to treat your blood pressure early, eat well and exercise. I have never had to raise my dose;I am still on the lowest and it works well. My twin sister who didn't take blood pressure meds till recently has had heart problems and a procedure. Early detection and treatment has given me a higher quality of life. My Mom died at 59 from complications of open heart surgery; this is a preventable disease even if predisposed.

The only problem I found is that when exercising, my heart rate does not get up to the target zone for my age.  So I have to use other measures to know I'm in the zone (breathing rate, sweating, perceived effort).  Be careful when going off atenolol -- it can be dangerous to stop it suddenly.

Except I've put on 50lbs and I'm working out five days a week and really watching what I eat and I can't seem to lose any weight and I've always been very active and never had a weight problem. I'm always fatigued which makes working out a real chore, and I am also urinating all the time day and night as well as suffering from occasional erectile disfunction. I also can't sleep and it's made me more depressed. I am also on Effexor for depression and my psychiatrist pointed out to me that for every 100mgs of Effexor you take that will also raise your blood pressure. So now I'm between a rock and a hard place because I've had to raise my intake of Effexor to 250mgs a day so I don't go into a funk. Thank god I go in for my yearly physical in two weeks. I also have not had any other side effects.

I took it for several years, with hydralazine, but I also never felt quite right while taking it. My mind felt kind of foggy all the time. (The hydralazine eventually gave me Drug-induced Lupus, with swollen painful joints, so watch out for that one!)I'm now taking Toprolol and Clonidine, hopefully those will be a better combination for me.

After three weeks, he always complained of feeling &quot;pukey&quot; and &quot;fainty.&quot; Then he suddenly had no energy, was increasingly agitated, and depressed. It was sad and alarming to see such a young, spirited childhood tell me that he was always &quot;sad&quot; and when he expressed he wanted to hurt himself, his pediatrician immediately took him off it. He is only 70 lbs and was on a low dose (25 mg), but as it built up in his system, he got worse and worse. I'm trying to learn more--he is no longer sad, but said he is unhappy and anxious (four days off the drug). I hope he continues to improve. Very scary.

This mMed makes me very tired but has helped the palpitations and resultant hbp. I am now experiencing weight gain, fluid retention and shortness of breath. I am 57 year old and feel like 80 when I have to rest after 1 flight of stairs. My bp is still rising with exercise and I am becoming very discouraged that the weight will not come off. I also have an underactive thyroid which compounds the problem. I am calling my doctor to see if I can stop taking this medication.

My husband has been on it for 25 years and it's worked for him.I don't think I will ever try another Beta Blocker.My B/p has been low but just recently it has spiked so now I've been on Bebecar for three weeks,so far,no problems,except the usual,ringing in ears,headache now and then.But no anxiety thank goodness.I do know atenolol is not for me ever again.

Other	turnag4, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	11/9/2008 8:31:56 PM	I was diagnosed in July 2007 with a rare anamalous coronary artery. My cardiologist had never seen one quite like mine.  My LAD artery originates on the wrong side of my heart and passes between 2 large arteries on top.  The only way to fix this is bypass surgery.  I am 51 years old and have been active in sports, etc. all of my life, but had been having slight tightness in my chest.  Due to a family history of heart disease, I decided to get checked out.  After all the necessary tests (heart cath, etc) he put me on 50 mg of atenolol to relax my heart and hopefully keep the stray artery from getting compressed.  My blood pressure is good, and pulse runs in the 50s when resting, sometimes in the high 40s. I do feel tired sometimes and have cold hands.  I have also experienced some sexual dysfunction, but not severe - everything still works. Overall, I am active and doing great.  The slight side effects I have are better than surgery!  I hope the atenolol continues to work for me.  I also take 10 mg of lipitor and lovaza (omega 3) for triglycerides.

I have no energy and no sex drive.  I feel like a robot going through my day.  I use to have energy and feel more emotional.  Does this drug cause depression?  I also use to enjoy running and exercising with free weights.  I now feel weak and listless.  After taking this drug for a year, I just want to lay around.  I am taking a 50mg dose as the smaller dose wasn't stopping my headaches.

After recent filling, severe leg neuropathy set in.  Notified drug maker TEVA - they said I was not the first complaint.  They had me send some of my meds to them for testing.  They are taking my claim seriously and acting responsibly.  If you take atenonol, made by TEVA, and have noticed leg pain (like needles sticking all over) it might be your meds.

I'm on the road to recovery at last, atenolol helped alot. However, I think it should be noted that I experienced a 50lb. weight gain during that time. So while the medication worked for me, and was very easy to take. I'm having a terrible time taking off 50lbs.I can't take anything to boost my metabolism  because I still have a slightly elevated sympathetic nervous system. I'm a 50 y/o female and this couldn't of come at a worse time in my life. So people should know many beta blockers can cause weight gain!.

However, last year the dosage was increased 'in case angina comes back' and this week he suddenly became unconscious whilst driving - the consultant believes it was due to the effect of this drug which sent his heartbeat(40 beats per minute) and blood pressure so low- the result being that we were both nearly killed in a car crash because of this. The drug was immediately stopped although this is worrying in itself. I must say however, that my husband has lost all his tiredness and appears much better.

When my GP wanted to stop Atenolol, my cardiologist &quot;flipped&quot; and threatened dire consequences, i.e. my death! None of my other specialists (internist, nephrologist, endocrinologist) have questioned the prescription. Since I'm a type 2 diabetic with kidney damage, I am concerned about continuing to take this drug.

Tremendous swelling of ankles and fatigue.  Took myself off this medication.  Saw PCP today - he agreed this is not proper med for me and that palpitations I'm currently having may have been caused by this medication.  Now, I have to see cardiologist as a result of taking this medication.

Have also found in using it that it also has a calming effect and aids in better concentration and focus; which has led me to research further uses for this drug.  Have heard it is also used for anxiety attacks or as an anti-anxiety medication along with an anti-depressant.  Would like any feedback regarding this info - want to talk to my dr. also as I take only 1 50mg. tablet per day and would like to see if I could add another, taking 1 in am and 1 in pm. Helps with insomnia, too.  Thanks!

The smaller pill is much more effective than the larger one.  The sizes change from month to month.  Sometimes they are the small ones, sometimes the large ones.  I was told the smaller size was the newer version of the old drug.  I question if the shelf life of the larger pill has expired and if so that is the reason the smaller pill seems to work better and the blood pressure is lower.

High Blood Pressure	Deanna, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	8/14/2008 8:28:53 AM	i was put on Atenolo after having an Anaphylactic  reaction to Lisinopril... i had never had high blood pressure before my normal rate was  around 105/65 so on the low side of normal even about a month and a half ago my BP raised to around being consistently around 150/99 they had no cause for it i am a 25 yr old female with many health probs they began looking and running many tests. but also began me on meds to control it after the allergic reaction to the lisinopril my bp hit all time highs of 218/169 and showed no signs of lowering no matter what i did, the began me on Atenolo and the first day my BP dropped to mild hypertension  levels but my the next day were in high high levels again and didn't begin to lower again till about a week into treatment so it tool a while to actually begin to work correctly, and was hard to get a on a schedule to remember to take daily and where many terrifying moments where i was unsure if the med was helping other than that i am very satisfied i know i will be around to raise my 3 little boys at least until they find the cause for my original raise in BP... SO i would recommend this med to those who cant take other meds bc of allergies and such.. and i feel sorry for everyone who has to deal with high BP esp at a young age when they know nothing about it...its so scary!

I have always been physically active and worked full-time. Had tiredness at first, but started taking it at night before bedtime to avoid being tired during the day. No other side effects. It helps with the panic attacks and that's how I was diagnosed 8 years ago with MVP. My DR can not raise the mg due to the fact it lowers my blood pressure and I do not suffer from high blood pressure, is there another drug that works just as well?

Lowered my BP from 150-170's/80-90's, to 110-130's/60-70's.  Also lowered my resting heart rate from 90-110's to 60-70's.  I also had irregular/rapid heart rate on occasion and this seems to occur much less sense I've been on this med.  I'm a prostate cancer survivor, so it's hard to say about the side effects of this med, because some of the side effects are the same as the ones I've had because of my cancer and treatment for that (surgery).  But most noticeable have been diarrhea, fatigue, dizziness when getting up to fast, frequent urination and ED.  All but the dizziness I had before with the prostate cancer, this drug just made them worse.  But it has worked as advertised and I'm willing to put up with the side effects to get my BP and heart rate lower.

Felt like my insides were racing but I was standing still.  Always Short of breath.  The effect was almost immediate. My insides are calmer, my sob is greatly diminished, and I am sleeping better. Was diagnosed with COPD a number of years ago, but now my beathing is fine, and can hold my breath, which I was not able to do before.  Maybe that DX was wrong and they did not pick up on my rapid heart beat.

Before taking this I have NEVER had any symptoms other than &quot;above normal&quot; blood pressure. This pill has caused shortness of breath, unbearable pain in my shoulders and arm, dizziness,always feeling cold. I have stopped this cold and will wait at least a week before the Doc puts me on the &quot;Next&quot; wonder pill. I wouldn't wish these side affects on anyone

Atenolol does help reduce my SVT's but only moderately. We have tried adjusting the dose but I can not function on 100 mg and I am now on 50mg. It has increased my fatigue a great deal and has also made my depression worse. I was on cardizem for several years before this switch without the depression and fatigue side effects. I plan to talk to my doctor about changing back to cardizem or another drug because the atenolol side effects do not seem to be worth the small amount of good it is doing for me.
High Blood Pressure	stuwag@aol.com, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male		3/8/2008 12:22:46 AM	I am also taking Diovan and Sular. My BP was still running high until I started taking 25mg Atenolol. It now runs on the low side (109/60) I dropped from 40mg.Sular to 30mg.Sular. This helped balance things. I have however recently developed horseness (like my voice is changing), at times. Droopy eyelids, occasional numbness in fingers and toes. My thinking has been confusing. I normally multi-task but can't do it now. I am a 76 yr. old male otherwise healthy and play tennis 4 days a week. My tennis game is dramatically off. I recently developed a bad stiff neck for which today, I had an MRI (Not yet read). My doctor said, I am taking the lowest dose of Atenolol (25mg) and perhaps I should try taking it every OTHER day.  Could any of my symptons be attributable to Atenolol? The other night I passed out for the first time in my life at a cocktail party. (Only had 1 drink) No nausea or dizzyness, just light headed. 911 came and everything was normal. Is it possible any of these symptoms can be due to Atenolol.Please advise

High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/6/2008 2:09:13 AM	I have taken Atenolol for about 10 years with great results.  Recently though, I have had to add Diovan to my daily medication as the Atenolol didn't seem to be &quot;enough&quot; to keep my BP at a safe level, and I was already taking the maximum dosage of 100mg.  In all fairness, I am also the heaviest and least active I've ever been.  I am starting an exercise and healthier eating program and believe I can remove the Diovan soon, once my lifestyle changes hopefully have a positive effect on my BP.  I have never had any side effects from Atenolol.  It was about the 6th or 7th medication my doctor and I tried years ago and the first one that both WORKED but did NOT give me any adverse side effects.  I highly recommend it.

Since starting, I have experienced extreme fatigue, and frequent urination, almost as if it were a diuretic. I don't have high blood pressure at all, but was given it after several years of pretty severe SVT's. I'm hoping that my tiredness goes away. I just don't seem to have the energy that I once did.

High Blood Pressure	veebee, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	65-74	2/7/2008 1:11:06 PM	Although it has been some time since I was prescribed this medication, I felt, after reading other people's reviews, that someone may benefit from my experience. Started 50 mg in early October 06 and knew that I was experiencing extreme fatique. By December - when I usually scurry through holiday shopping with my grandchildren - I had to lean on cars as I struggled through the parking lot, and push (hang on to) shopping carts to spend even half hour in stores with frequent sitting. Now that I'm off that med, I always want to ask people who move like I did then, if they take Atenolol. It is wonderful that most of the reviews say it helped hearts. Wish I could have been included. Hope if anyone is experiencing such crippling effects, they will find other meds.  I did.

I have learned to live with it.  However, you cannot exercise or exert yourself, your heartbeat is not able to increase.  You must do things low and slow and rest a lot.  But it keeps my heart happy and out of the doctor's office!

High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	1/7/2008 10:20:45 PM	Began taking atenolol postpartum for pregnancy induced hypertension.  It worked for a couple weeks and then I was taken off the drug b/c my pressure stabilized.  A couple wks. later my BP went back up and was put back on atenolol, but it didn't work this time (100 mg).  My doctor then kept me on the atenolol and also put me on methyldopa (aldomet), 250 mg, 3 times a day.  The combination of the two drugs lowered my blood pressure.

They did and EKG and sent me home that night saying that everything was normal. I went to my doctor the next day and she said the same thing,everything seemed fine but she was going to set me up with cardiologist just to be safe. He did and ecocardiogram and that was fine. So they decided to put me on Atenelol so it wouldn't bother me and so far its worked. Its only been recently that it just seems to not work for as long as it has in the past. But I'm told that its because your body gets so used to it that it needs that little extra dosage. So I now take it twice a day to equal a 50mg dosage. And it seems to be working.

I feel dizzy and nautious at times- almost everyday.  Compared to the pain I endured before, this medicine is heroic.  I am only on the lowest dossage though because they still don't know my cause.  It gives a good feeling when I feel it lowering my BP, though.

While my PVC's did not decrease the atenolol made them not as intense.  I did get dizzy a good bit and the sexual effects where bad (made getting an erection difficult). I also could not climb stairs without feeling like I was about to be sick and out of breath or like I had run a marathon.  This med also made me feel cold all the time.  I do jog 4-5 miles a day three to four days a week, but could not climb stairs on this med. Now I have been told that I have a weakend heart and he has changed my med. to Coreg.

High Blood Pressure	rsealy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/1/2007 1:45:57 AM	I take this drug for high BP and mitral valve prolapse syndrome. I started taking the medication when I was 26. I am now 41 and it still works great. I take the medication at the same time everyday and if there is a day that I am only an hour behind, my heart lets me know. I took this med when I was pregnant with my 2nd child at the age of 30. I had no side effects and the baby was fine. The only downside was breastfeeding. I couldn't breast feed her because the medication made her heart rate drop. I found this out before I left the hospital. Everytime I would breast feed her and the hospital staff would take her vitals her heart rate would be abnormally low. This didn't happen when she was given formula.

Atenolol quiets my heart and that helps a lot. However, when I first started taking atenolol I became listless. Doctor cut dosage in half and listlessness went away and med was still effective in preventing runaway heart during anxiety reactions.

It has been mostly effective with the exception of a year and a half when it stopped working, but going back on it it has controlled my heart rate effectively for the past 3 years with no issues whatsoever. It has a LOT less side effects than other beta blockers. It does cause me to be very very tired, cold hands and feet, dizziness, and nausea but none of them are particularly severe enough to stop making me take it. The benefits outweigh the side effects.

My high pulse rate was believed to have been stress/caffeine related, but it came back to me within a week. My doctor then put me on half of 25mg. It has been doing well. I do need to take another half at times. I only get sleepy when I end up taking a whole pill, but that is not often. I do get the coldness in the hands and feet, but I do have poor circulation as well. I like the medicine and am glad it's helping me.

The angina stopped only when I was put on Atenolol 9yrs ago.  I didn't have any further serious episodes for 8 year.  It does tend to lower my heart rate and I did have several times when my heart rate went too low, so I was told to skip the dose until my heart rate returned to normal.

High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/1/2007 8:43:13 PM	This is the only med out of a half dozen I have been on, that has brought BP down and kept it in check.  Migraines also nearly disappeared once I went on Atenolol.I have experienced no significant side effect except a 30 pound weight gain over the 15 years I have been on it.  Initially there was some loss of libido but that stabilized and reversed.

High Blood Pressure	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	65-74	9/30/2007 9:42:30 AM	Although it does aid in bringing down blood pressure it must be used with another medication such as nifedipine....a real old drug (but it works).  After use of 6 mos, it definitly also helps bring down other things such as libido, and helps bring on E/D.
