Fungal Disease of the Nails	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	8/22/2012 12:08:58 PM	I used Penlac a few yrs ago when I should signs of fungus on the 3 toes. Very slight case of it but I tired this med for a fee months following the instructions and all nails treat were clear and are still clear to this day. I would recommend it to anyone before trying harsh oral meds for treatment. It was encouraging to hear the review of someone who had it bad for 50 yrs and still saw results.

My previous doctor put me on lamisil twice, worked GREAT! I noticed a few months ago that i had a small hallow looking spot starting to develop at the end of my nail bed (tip of nail). My current dic put me on penlac and said she was unable to prescribe me lamisil as i would need regular blood tests. None the less ( $150 later thank g-d for benefits! and a referal to a dermatologist) i am now using the penlac. The hollow spot has not got any bigger, but my nail has grown out a bit since and i see no improvement. Hopefully the dermatologist will put me back on lamisil. 
Fungal Disease of the Nails	Dr. Don W, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		5/13/2011 2:12:50 PM	I have had a very severe big toe(both)nail fungus infection for over 50 years. I have never had any satisfactory results in the past.. I began a generic ciclopirox nail lacquer treatment November 9, 2010. As of May 13, 2011, I now have completely clear toe nails on both big toes(82% of both nails has covered both nail beds)I did not remove the nails, but I debrided my nails very thoroughly when I removed the old laquer every Monday. It is very very critical that the directions be followed without exceptions.

Fungal Disease of the Nails	Leslie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	7/14/2010 3:58:25 PM	I used Penlac several years ago as the oral medicine (lamasil) wasn't an option for me. It did take quite a long time, but I had very good results. Several years later, I'm using it again and hoping for the same good results. The first time I used it, I was seeing a podiatrist monthly who used his &quot;dremel&quot; drill to thin out the thick nail and I believe that really helped. This time I'm using a really stiff emery board to try and thin the thick nail myself. Have patience... this is a great treatment. 
Fungal Disease of the Nails	david, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	45-54	8/17/2009 1:45:06 PM	I used this topical solution for about one and a half years.  Each time the nails started to show signs of improvement, an in-grown toe nail would develop  on each big toe that would require removal by the podiatrist.  The ingrown nails became so painful, I could barely walk--even to go to the podiatrist.  No one informed me of potential, temporary, debilitating side effects of this topical medication.  I had to stop using it. The total cost for using it and the subsequent podiatrist in-office surgeries for in-grown nail removals exceeded $1500.  I will never use this product again.  I still have the fungus and don't know what else to do. Recently, I heard about a Laser Treatment for toe nail fungus but can't seem to find any info. on-line.  Hopefully, Penlac will be more effective for someone else; it was a night-mare for me.

My nail looks very distorted; like a horse-shoe shape with skin up the middle. Purple got over nail bed and red around cuticle.  Penlac did nothing to help. Lamisil Pills worked.  After 3 months my prescription ran out - then it came back again.... on Itraconazole pills now.  We'll see.  I'm very embarrassed and it's been 10 mos.  My doctor just took a biopsy.  I guess I'll miss wearing sandals again this year.  My doctor says you cannot get it again from your own clippers.  Articles I had read say differently.  I think this happened when during a pedicure they nicked my cuticle.  I had severe nail pain and it was red and not around the cuticle and it all started.

I've used it - as directed - religiously and asfor the past year and it has failed to clear up the fungus. I'm very disappointed in the product and am now switching to the generic version and looking for an alternative treatment.
