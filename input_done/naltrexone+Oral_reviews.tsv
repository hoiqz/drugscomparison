Overall, this medication has had little effect. My excess drinking has been curbed, but I believe that I could have quit without this medication. If anything, it has become a psychological crutch foe me.
Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	belivin4today, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/23/2012 7:33:30 PM	I have been receiving the monthly naltrexone injections for about 9 months.  Other than injection site bruising and temporary swelling, I have had no other side effects.   In conjunction with other recovery regimes (AA, CBT)it has been very effective.  I am an alcoholic who would relapse, detox, maintain a few months sober and relapse again.  This medication, in conjunction with a solid recovery program, has removed all my cravings, obsessions and compulsions to drink despite the fact that  I have plenty of wreckage from my last drinking episode to make me want to crawl back into the bottle. My only question is how long does someone take this?  Is this something that people like me take for the rest of my life?

It has been prescribed for for me in combination with a few drugs. In each case I am left with nausea, vomiting, heartburn, headache and severe dizziness. I either have an allergic reaction to this drug or simply cannot tolerate it. It has been prescribed in pill form in combination with morphine and two other C2 pain medications. I've not had a good exiperience with this drug.

I have no desire to drink, getting drunk, or drinking and driving.  It has made me more aware of how alcohol had controlled my life for about 30years. I am also taking it to help supress my compulsive gambling.  Taking this helps, but attending Gamblers Anonymous also helps.  Its works great to supress alcohol.

Appears to be working good as I have no cravings for pills (opiates).  And the med. has not caused any issues,  I think it's going to work and I was clearly ready to stop the madness too.
Prevention of Opiate Drug Abuse		5	5	5			10/30/2011 8:21:20 AM	I stopped abusing narcotic painkillers cold turkey with Naltrexone. I went from 14-15 pills a day to ZERO! The only side effect for me: I get a little anxious right after taking it and that lasts for about 30 minutes. I don't know if you can truly understand how amazing it is to go from 14-15 pills a day to ZERO without withdrawal, unless you experience the hurt of addiction. The only precaution that my doctor didn't tell me about is that if you take it within 7-10 days of taking narcotics it will INSTANTLY cause amplified withdrawal for about the first few hours or so. Stop taking whatever you're taking and as you get closer to needing a fix, take Naltrexone instead and you should be fine. This medication makes me indifferent to narcotics. I have been offered pills since I started treatment and they don't even appeal to me. I literally cannot even remember or feel the allure, attraction or reason behind my drug abuse. I don't even think about it anymore. It's always a good idea to seek treatment, counseling or 12 -Step Recovery. Don't just stop your substance abuse but seek to recognize underlying issues that drive you to chemicals in the first place.

I started on 12/27/10 with 25mg for 3 days and then went to 50mg.  I have had absolutely no side effects.  I haven't wanted to drink since that day.  I'm able to go to bars with other people drinking and it doesn't bother me.  It's like a miracle to me.....why didn't I get this sooner?  I know I'm very lucky, as I've heard from many people that it has not worked for them.  From research I've found it appears to help women more than men, although they don't know exactly why.  There is also a &quot;gene&quot; factor involved in why this drug works for some people and not others.  But I think everyone should at least try this medication.  You may be one of the ones it works for.  I wish it worked for everyone like it does for me.  I definately know the pain of alcoholism.  I have a whole new life ahead of me.

Although detoxed, the cravings still occured.  Definately in my head.  This drug does something with the dopamene levels of the brain; and I have never felt better in my life!  The first day I was real tired, the next few days I just felt strange, by the fifth day my body adjusted and this is nothing short of a miracle drug for me.  It's not a drug for those still drinking or drinking occassionally!  Stop and use this, along with counseling, etc. this could be very effective for those that can tolerate it.  
Other	trich, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	4/1/2010 9:17:13 PM	My daughter has been diagnosed with trichotilomania (hair pulling) and there have been a few staudies that naltrexone may be helpful b/c it blocks the pleasure center. It is however generally used for drug and alcohol intervention. She took the lowest dose (25mg) and found some improvement at first but then no greater improvement. Our psychiatrist upped the meds to 50 and then finally 75 over a period of a couple of months to no more success. We have stopped taking it and are trying N-Aceyl-Cysteine (NAC) supplement instead.

Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/5/2010 4:02:11 PM	I am a 34yr old working mother, and had a problem with alcohol for the past 2 years. I did not grow up with alcohol and didn't drink until I was 30yrs old. I drank due to stress in my life. After trying to quit dozens of times wrecking my car and almost loosing my husband, I went to a non-traditional rehab program that used Naltrexone. I received the Vivitrol inj. and am also using campral and Zofran. The results are amazing. My craving for alcohol went down to almost nothing, it helped with my anxiety and just put me on an even playing ground to be able to resist temptation. I did have some nausea and a headache as side effect, but I consider that minor for getting my life back. I've been sober 52 days!!!!

I haven't NOT drank AT LEAST a bottle of wine or champagne (and usually more) for years.  I had some dizziness and a little &quot;buzz&quot; with this drug today.  That started an hour after I took my 1st 1/2 pill, and lasted for about 3.5 hours.  BUT I had to small glasses of wine with dinner (probably 6 ounces total) and corked the bottle!  I didn't know you didn't HAVE TO FINISH IT!  The wine was good, but more for accompanying dinner (brie, chocolate) instead of getting hammered.  So far, so good.  I'll post later too. 
Other	Carol, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	65-74	1/15/2010 10:52:35 PM	I have only been on it about a week (1-6-10 = first doese). The first day I experienced nausea badly enough I felt I was going to throw up.  I went off it a day, then back on.  I had persistent low-grade nausea but not bad enough I ceased to take it.  I felt the end justified the means - I needed it badly enough to treat my cancer that I could put up with some nausea.  In only about a week the excurciating pain associated with the cancer in my pelvis is almost gone.  The pain was to the point I was almost immobile. It had been growing progressively intense since about March.  It is now more like an irritation.  I also had a sore about the size of a lima bean (a little thicker) on my hand. The area was red, scabbed. Touching it caused pain throughout my body. It bled easily.  That sore had been growing on my hand for about a month. Now, the sore is almost gone. There is one minor red spot, and one minor scab. The area is no longer sore to the touch. It does not bleed. I believe the same thing is going on inside my body to the cancer in my pelvis.

The first couple of days I felt nauseous and very tired but I tool it at night and it went away pretty quickly. I was perscribed this for cutting and I haven't had the urge yet. I have also noticed it helps me cut back on my drinking which was becoming a problem as well. I did learn that it was once used as a weight loss drug which I thought was a nice side effect. I would highly recommend it to anyone if you don't mind the dizzyness and nausea you feel at first but it is well worth it. I dont' crave cutting or drinking but I can have drinks if I choose and it doesn't make me sick like antabuse would.

I stopped at number 6 and poured it out,(small miracle!!) no buzz whatsoever. Feeling very unpleasant this morning, however, nausous and dizzy, kind of like a hangover. I have great hopes for this med, as nothing else (AA, Avrt, angry wife) has worked at all. I will post again in a few weeks, hopefully to report that this med saved me and minimal side effects!!

I haven't been able to abstain on my own for more than a few days, so after some research, I asked a physician for a prescription.  It is only day one for me on 50mg so time will tell.  But I did not drink nor crave a drink today.  I took the pill at noon and noticed mild nausea (almost immediately), and also have been more tired than usual.  I am hoping this drug will give me the boost needed to better my life.  Good luck to all who are trying to quit or cut back.

Fortunately, after about 10 days, the nausea went away.  I think using naltrexone has probably helped my recovery, but it's hard to say how much.  I've also been doing cognitive behavior therapy, which I highly recommend.ag

Was drinking a pack a night during the week and more on the weekends. I've been on this med for 4 days and it is amazing!!! I have no urge to drink and zero side effects. I actually had a beer with lunch the day after I started taking it. It didn't taste as good as usual and I had no desire to have more than one (usually would have had 3-4 and wanted more). I already feel so much better about myself and my life. Improved mood and motivation. Would definitely recommend to anybody struggling with alcohol.

I had this medication prescribed to me out of detox and I stopped using it after seven days, thinking I still had alcohol in my system. Two weeks later, I tried 25mg and had the same side effects. I am not sure if it has any reactions to Campral or Antabuse, but both the Dr. and the pharmacist did not say anything.

(BTW... Chantix is great to quit smoking, Naltrexone is just as effective for drinking, minus the &quot;high - definition&quot; dreams.)

I didn't lose weight. I did not crave alcohol for a while but after about three months the cravings returned, only now with Naltrexone, much greater amounts of alcohol must be consumed for the effect of relaxation, etc.I think I will stop taking it.

I have found it to be very effective.  It has reduced cravings for opiates.  However, this drug is not a miracle drug.  It needs to be used along with support and other methods.  I also think that it takes some time for it to work.  I was actually doing well, and after taking it for five years, i began to forget to take it and stopped getting it refilled.  This was not intentional; it just wasn't a concern.  About 3 weeks after, I had very strong cravings and could actually taste drugs in my throat as if I had done them.  Follow your doctors instructions, and continue to take it even if you are doing well until your doctor tells you otherwise.  Also, question your doctor if you are told to take this while still using.  As said in the information on this drug, this can cause intense withdraw symptoms.  For those of you who just started taking it, give it a chance.  When I began with it, I was given it in an implant form, put into my body below my stomach.  This gave me no choice but to take it, and I am grateful.  I was also told by my doctor that intentially not taking it in order to get the full effect of opiates is dangerous because it has changed your bod, and puts people at an increased risk for overdose.  Of all those I know that use opiates, I am the only one taking naltrexone, and also the only one that is still clean.

My neurologist hopes to reduce my need for i.v. solumedrol as I've been receiving that for 11 years (and prednisone/deltasone 7 years before that) -- definately bad for my bones!  I plan on giving this drug a fair trial, and I hope it works, but yesterday I took it long before bedtime, and I ended up dizzy and staggering around the house with stomach cramps until I eventually threw up.  So in the future I will ALWAYS take this medication before I fall asleep!  I've also noticed easier bruising, and I've been having some vivid dreams, and twice my husband had trouble waking me where I am usually an incredibly light sleeper.

I'm very satified with the outcome and finding myself taking it less often than the beginning of my treatment.  However, I did have a few side effects such as feeling like I had been drinking the night before because I would take the medication prior to going to bed.  As a recovering alcoholic, it is my choice to lessen my intake of this medication in efforts not to become dependant.

If I pop one of these 50mg tablets prior to a night I plan to drink, I drink much less and the desire to more is non existent. This seems to work amazingly for me and has allowed me not to fret or spend time worrying that I'm an alcoholic destined to meetings and whatnot.

As with any detox program the long term benefits out whiegh the short. The beginning sucks though.

It halts the progress &amp; symptom lessening or disappearance is a bonus.  I have gotten by balance back almost 100% &amp; my vision is improving.  I have been on it for 3 wks.  Starting at 1.5mg for 1 wk then upped to 3mg.
