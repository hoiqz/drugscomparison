It did the trick. That was 15 years ago and i've been taking it ever since although I now take it only twice a day. I also suffer from anxiety and it helps immensely with that also. Only side effect is it can make me sleepy.

We I got to the ER, I told the nurse that I am a recovering drug addict from opiates, she said that she would right down that I dont want any type of medicine that will make me feel funny, sleepy, or drowsy. Once brought back to a room, the Doctor came in and looked me over, I told her loud and clear, that I do not want any medicines that will make me sleepy, drowsy, high feeling, or drunk/funny feeling. She said a nurse will be in shortly. Ten minutes later, the nurse came in a gave me 50mg of Atarax Oral, and then sent me home, which she knew I had drove myself there. So here I am driving my car stoned and very sleepy at 3:30am. Once I got home, thankfully, I could not function and today I barely remember what I did last night, I slept for 15 hours straight. I had told all the nurses and the Doctor, that I had a 9am meeting that was very important, since the Alarax they gave me, knocked me out, I completly missed this meeting and wasted a whole day, sleeping! I am still itchy and full of Hives. This medication is not one you should give to a recovering addict. I took Atarax at 3am in the ER, it's now 6pm the next day and I still feel funny/drunk!
Anxious	justsue, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/12/2010 12:17:17 AM	I was given this medicine for anxiety on an as needed basis. I did not want to be prescribed an ssri because of side effects. Atarax has worked great. The first time I took it my doctor warned me not to drive because it could make me drowsy, so I took a half of a 25mg. and felt great. Was able to grocery shop and then go to dinner with friends. A very big deal, since I was becoming housebound. The side effects are minimal compared to the ssri and other drugs prescribed to me before finding this one. Every person is different. What works for one, may not work for the other. I am happy Atarax works for me.

Itching	Reellori, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/7/2010 12:44:23 PM	This was prescribed to me for itching (primarily on my forearms and back of hands) which resulted from anxiety. I would scratch my arms to the point of huge blood blisters and bruising.  Many times, I was not even aware that I was scratching until I noticed the blood or bruising or it started to hurt! This was quite unsitely and attention-getting to the extent that even strangers would inquire - very embarrassing.  Atarax has worked great! Occasionally, I experience a little itching but that results from a missed dose at least 98% of the time! I recommend Atarax (generic is hydroxyzine) and plan to ask my neurologist if there is a time-released version. I had tried topical ointments such as Benedryl, hydrocortisone ointment and clear caladryl to no avail. I hope this review helps!

Atarax works to keep hives from appearing- but only if I take it every 6 hours religiously. It does not last very long but at at least it does not make me that drowsy anymore. You eventually build up a bit of a tolerance to the drowsiness. I take 25-50 mg every 6 hours but if I skip a dose I see some hives appearing or my feet swell. Also I need to take more if I'm going to exercise or eat high histamine foods (esp. shellfish). I tried doxepin and though it lasted 24 hours it had tons of side effects. Atarax is not powerful but side effects are minimal- dry mouth, skin, and scalp and drowsiness at beginning of treatment. 
Anxious	meg, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	8/29/2010 1:48:44 PM	I was given this medication when I suddenly started having panic attacks. I had never had one before but something set me off and it was hard to leave my house even to check the mail. I didn't like the effect the narcotic anxiety medications had on me, I had small children and needed to be able to focus. I took this pill on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis. It didn't make me drowsy or loopy, just a bit calmer. Within a week I was feeling like myself again, went back to work, and could say &quot;hi&quot; to people I met while out running errands. I haven't had any anxiety problems since but still have the rest of the pills I didn't use in back of the medicine cabinet just in case.

It was working but ended up in the emergency room with high blood pressure, rapid heart beat, dizziness, nausea, a feeling of heaviness in my upper body, chills, seizure like movements.  Thought I was having a heart attack.  It appears that 400 mg for a 120 pound woman is way too much.

I have been diagnosed with mctd, an overlap disease of lupus, and after 8 weeks of nonstop itching the dr finally gave me 25 mg of atarax. It will totally knock out the itch but you will be exhausted beyond words! I am going to call and ask for the 10 mg maybe a lower dose will still do the trick. I tried everything from benedryl to prednisone to topical creams and nothing worked. I took this and in 2 days the itch is gone!!! Thank god for this drug.

I was able to sleep through the bad part and didn't have to feel any of that stuff, thank God. They work GREAT for withdrawals.

Its helped a great deal when I get in itching fits. I don't need to take it for very long, maybe about week. After that I'm usually itch free or its not very bothersome. I highly recommend this medication. Yes, it will make you extremely sleepy, but it will knock out any itching you have.

Welt from Pressure on Skin	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/23/2009 8:50:11 PM	I have been on this medication (generic form) for 2 years. I originally was on 10 mg of Zyrtec as soon as it came on the market. My symptoms were SEVERE itching anywhere there was contact on my skin. My pant waistband, bra, watch, underwear. ANYTHING that put pressure on my skin. Picking up a box that touched my arms, I would have a welt. IT WAS HORRIBLE!! I went to 4 different dermatologist. All diagnosing me with eczema. I got NO relief from their medications. I finally found a doctor that knew my condition, He had only seen 3 cases in 25 yrs. and mine was by far the worst (great). He had me lift my shirt and he took 3 fingers and rubbed down my back. He waited a few minutes and came back into the room and looked. OBG...his comment scared me, but at least he knew what I had. I had 3 long welts where he had touched my back. I'm sorry I don't remember the name of this condition. It is a very long name that starts with a C_ _  If it hasn't cleared up in 4 yrs, you will always have it. Well...........I've been on Zyrtec for 12 yrs and changed to Atarax 25 mg. 2yrs years ago. It is much cheaper and works better than the Zyrtec. One pill at bedtime.  It has been a MIRACLE for me. I can find no side effects, but If I miss more than one pill, the symptoms return.

Itching	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	1/28/2009 11:29:32 AM	After months of topicals including: hydrocortisone creams and prescription steroid cr&#232;mes, from Aveeno lotions and ani-itch creams to gold bond  nothing worked to relieve the painful and unsatisfied itching that the rash on my hands caused me. After getting to a point where I would rather smash my fingers with a hammer to feel something else I had the rash biopsied. It determined to be a symptom of my lupus, but even an addition to my Lupus meds did nothing to help. I finally broke down and took one of the Atavax tablets that I had received as an option from my family practitioner almost a year before. I slept like a baby and then some. The down side was that it took me almost seventeen hours to recover from the 1 tablet. I had cotton mouth most of the day and my body and mind were at war with each other in their lack of cooperation  much like being completing wasted drunk. When the drunken stupor finally went away  the itching came back full force. I decided on a half of tablet to see what happened. I still get the cotton mouth, but at least now I am only slightly buzzed versus drunk and I was able to get out of bed. I am hoping to resolve my issue with something a little less intoxicating  but I can honestly say that this little drug has saved my hands and my mind from a pretty extreme desperation. 1 tablet every four hours  yeah right, I dont want to spend the rest of my life sleeping. For now a half will do and I take that once at night and when it starts to wear of during the day.Thank you Atavax!

And I think that was only because it was my first good nights sleep since the onset of my symptoms. I'm calling the doctor now to see if I might be able to double up on the dose or possibly get something a bit stronger---this itching is driving me crazy! Not to mention what I must look like itching every part of my body!

He has allergies so bad that every time the wind changes he itches so bad that he will eat spots of hair off his body.  I think he's a little nutty too, so the sedation/calming side effect has been great.  So...if you're experiencing the same thing with your dog, ask your vet about this one.  It's been great for us!  Plus we're all sleeping better thanks to this med.

Itching	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/6/2008 10:38:45 PM	I have used Atarax for over 17 years. My prescription calls for taking orally every 8 to 12 hrs. as needed. However, I use it only as needed when I am itching and that only after I cant take the itching any longer, this maybe once or twice a month. I then use only one half of a 10mg pill, this is very effective for me, and literally lasts until the very next time I have an itching attack. When taken, I only take atarax at night as I am preparing for relaxing, or sleep. Usually I can function normally during the course of the following day. It really works!
Hives		5	5	4			3/1/2008 6:38:21 PM	This was prescribed when I had a tremendous allergic reaction to ???.  I had very itchy hives, swelling and breathing problems.  It handled the itchiness very well. It does make one very drowsy, and I would not recommend driving when taking it.
Welt from Pressure on Skin	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	2/26/2008 4:20:07 PM	I was prescribed this medication 4 months ago for SEVERE itching of my hands and feet. It has helped me tremendously and I am not about to go crazy anymore! It also helps me sleep which is a bonus and I have no stress at work!!  However, this was supposed to be a short term treatment and if I stop taking the meds I start itching all over again. 
Itching	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	19-24	2/22/2008 9:18:39 PM	I just have to warn others that this medication will make you extremely drowsy/sleepy!  I took one 25mg pill and barely could keep my eyes open.  I toook it for an allergic reaction I had and it was suppossed to soothe the itching.  Well it did, but that was because it made me go to sleep!  Do  NOT drive when you take this medication!
Other	dataa2, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	2/11/2008 4:33:19 PM	I chose other because i use if for a varity of simptoms  ,I have used this drug for many things, I have bad allergies  it works really well for this before bed  so I can breath through the night  and as a positive side effect it helps me sleep ,   I also use it for anxiety  if you take it during your normal day you will feel a bit drowsy but I sure helps to calm you down  without the bad effects like other drugs iv taken ,  I would recommend this to anyone with allergies  &quot;not as daily therapy but for moderate to bad attacks&quot; and for anyone with anxiety    just have a cup of coffee when you start to feel groggy A++
Anxious	anony, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	2/4/2008 11:40:20 PM	I've been having severe anxiety related issues, and have been on SSRI therapy escitalopram (lexapro) and clonazepam (Klonopin) I am afraid of the addiction potential of the clonazepam, as I've suffered from withdrawl from a benzodiazepine before. (Lorazepam (ativan))Dr assured me I wouldn't get addicted. I HIGHLY reccomend this drug as an alternative to benzo therapy, as there is really no abuse or physical addiction potential.Atarax and Lexapro seem to be the perfect &quot;cocktail&quot; for me at least for the time being.Dosage of atarax is 25 mg up to three times daily, usually only two.

I guess that's the way it relieves anxiety? It was perfect for a flight from Thailand but I could not see taking this during the day and being able to function. I recommend Xanax or Ativan.

Worked great for me I was back to normal in about two days then I hooked up with her best friend  and got back at her. Great Pill!!!
Anxious	Busymommy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/29/2007 3:56:36 AM	This medication was given to my 4 yr old daughter who has had had &quot;anxiety&quot; problems for the last 3 years. It started with her pulling her hair out, then she began to bite her fingernails and the surrounding skin untill she had infections in her little fingers. The last straw was when she began to pick at the skin on her lips... and pull it off untill her lips were bleeding and she was crying bc between the two- her fingers and her lips- she was hurting. The pediatrician finally said lets try this... and AMEN! How I wish she would have listened to me sooner!

It helped at times but did not help me fall asleep as fast or effectively as I had hoped. Overall, it did calm me down and helped reduce the amount of time I spent awake in bed before falling asleep.
