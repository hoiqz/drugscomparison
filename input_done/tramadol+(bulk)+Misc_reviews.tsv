One at the end of that day and one the next morning gets me to be able to function fairly easily. I am of the mentallity that if I had no pain, I would deffinitely over do it. This takes most pain away with little to no side affects.

Directions from the doctor states it should be taken by mouth every 6 hours as needed.  Over the counter medications have done just as well.

I can only take this drug at night because it makes me very sleepy.  It does help with my back pain and gives me a restful night but, as mentioned earlier, I can ONLY take it at night.

I started feeling like I was getting panic attacks and shakes.  I cut the dose way back and the panic attacks have stopped. But now I am left with a high amount of pain for my back condition. 
Other	Menchaca, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/3/2011 11:14:26 PM	It worked on my nerves before I had pain relief, redirects my brain, but I did have on and off dizzy spells and quick thoughts racings faster than I could speak. Do not drive and make sure you eat well. tends too decrease appetite, and increase thirst with some imbalance.  Yet, very alert. takes at least and hour and one-half for pain to start to minimize. Muscles will relax suddenly to where you may walk and talk as if you are drunk at this point you must  have bed rest to avoid any injury. no other medication is needed and be sure to have any other medication out of your system before starting.

I was on Percocet and wanted to change to a non-narcotic. So far I am not really happy as it isn't doing much to help the pain.

I had been on oxycodone before that.  The oxycodone worked fine but the doctor didn't want me to stay on that.  Thanks to that because the Tramadol was superior.  The Tramadol relieved almost all the pain and still let me maintain function.

While placed on a regimine of 2 50mg tablets three times a day, I have been relatively pain free. I was unable to take any medications with Tylenol and this pain reliever worked great. I am very satisfied with its effectiveness.
Other	19-24 Female 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	1/31/2008 12:53:57 PM	I took this during a migraine to help reduce the pain. The only thing it helped was to make me fall asleep. Later I woke up with a rash over my entire body and severe itching that continued for over 24 hours.
