Additional Local Anesthesia	Carnation, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	65-74	3/13/2012 4:41:42 PM	Wow, it caused my heart to race and really scared me. It took some time for me to calm down. My Dentist said I should eat more when coming for an appointment that will require anesthesia. That would help the effect of the medication. I was not told this at my consultation appt.

Additional Local Anesthesia	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	8/31/2009 7:07:31 PM	Dentist used an injected local anesthetic for routine dental work.  The epinephrine in the anesthetic caused an electric shock and pain to shoot down my left arm, and caused my lips to numb.  Unknown to dentist or myself, my heart had CAD (coronary artery disease) and small vessel disease which is why the shot caused the bad reaction.  Three days later, I had heart attack symptoms which led to my diagnosis and open heart surgery.  The routine dental anesthetic injection may have jump started my heart symptoms and oddly enough may have saved me from a fatal heart attack as my heart was in really bad shape.

Reaction due to an Allergy		5	5	5			6/24/2008 1:16:34 PM	I had a severe allergic reaction to cleaning fish (I knew I couldn't eat them, but thought I was safe).  Hives appeared on one arm, then my throat suddenly swelled completely shut.  Couldn't breathe at all.  My gf injected an epi-pen into my thigh.  Within 30 seconds, I could breathe fine.  Although my heart was racing, I was very jittery for a day, and I couldn't sleep.  VERY effective product...
