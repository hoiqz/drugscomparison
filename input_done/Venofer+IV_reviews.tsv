Anemia from Inadequate Iron	kitty, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	45-54	3/27/2012 9:20:05 AM	I have a bleeding disorder, factor XI deffciancy, usually only a problem with surgery. Now I hane low levels in all my blood counts. Bone marrow biopsy showed no iron stores. I have had 2 infusions, a week apart. I feel sick, nausea, headache, loose stools for 5 days, start to feel ok and then infused again. Still need 2 more scheduled infusions and go from there. do know the side effects seemed worse the second time. Just have to wait and see, as far as cost, the hospital is working with me, no price on good health.

Now side effects. I felt much within two days. I had more energy. Before treatment i was experiencing headaches dizziness and extreme fatigue. This is a wonderful drug!!! It's so strange to see that some people have had negative experience with venofer. I consider myself very fortunate. I am lookiing forward to my continued treatment!!!!!!

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	ChuSSa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	12/9/2011 1:40:54 AM	I've been suffering from anemia since more than 2 yrs ago. Been consulting it with more than 10 doctors. Uptill now none of the doctors could figure out what cause it. I've taken oral medication for more than 1 year. But still wouldn't increase the ferritin level. The lowest Hgb is 7 and the lowest ferritin level in 4. I've decided using venofer IV since 8 months ago. But it only keep my ferritin level above the minimum until 2-3 months then it drops again. I've had my 4th Venofer IV 6 days ago. The 1st one work out OK that I didn't experience any side effects. 8 hrs after the 2nd one, I got a colic. It was quite painful. Because of that, for the 3rd infuse, my doctor decreased the concentration of the venofer. And fortunately, I only felt constipation and nausea after the 3rd infuse. But then after the 4th one, I had diarhea, vomit, nausea, dizziness and low blood pressure. All the side effects stop after I took Benadryl. Perhaps I should always take Benadryl on my next infuse.Had no problem at all with my vein. Of course I still feel pain when they put on the IV. All the side effects and the pain for having the IV needle are not much compare to the fatigue, decreased energy level, vertigo, hair lost, etc, that I felt as the symptoms of low ferritin level.

First, let me tell about a powerful negative side effect. One IV treatment of 100mg/5mg solution (qty of 0300, whatever that means)cost $792.  She had two treatments so combined with $700 in charges for two IV &quot;procedures,&quot; the total cost was $2,300.  An obcene amount of money when it is out of pocket.  She had to stop the second treatment early because of discomfort.

At first ti was very difficult because my veins are too small to access. I now have a port and it has made all the difference. I feel lousy the first few days after an infusion but much better when it starts to take effect. It has been great for me and my cronic anemia.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	Lisa, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	35-44	3/23/2011 8:17:34 PM	I have just started my third series of venofer infusions (I get 5 infusions over 3 weeks)in about 3.5 years.  This time it had been about 18 months since the last series.  I get them because of low iron saturations and decreased ferratin and hgb related to Gastric bypass 8 years ago.  The side effects seem mild including headache, fatigue, vertigo, and palpitations.  I tolerate the side effects because the medication is highly effective for me.  Prior to the infusions I have extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, restless legs, ice craving, palpitations, and headaches.  It usually takes about a week after the last infusion and I start to feel energetic again. My only complaint is the cost.....my insurance covers most of it....but even the copay is expensive.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	25-34	1/10/2011 3:33:12 PM	I had HgB of 8.2 and ferritin of 2 so I had about 9 venofer injections.  The first few time it was fine, but then I experienced hives so with IV Benedryl we've been able to control the hives, but the IV is very time consuming now.  Worked great to get my HgB and ferritin up, but 3 months later I've already lost enough iron that it's back to the IVs
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	MomofKate, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	45-54	9/17/2010 8:20:24 AM	I have had three bags of Venofer-administered IV at the hospital. The hardest part for me has been starting the IV and keeping a good vein. A fews days ago it took the nurse 3 times to run the bag.  She stopped and started twice, the IV would start and she said the vein was going to blow. Unhook, poke me again, start over. This third bag was the first time I had other side effects. I have severe stomach cramps, lower right hand side, about 8 hours after the infusion, and they lasted about 6 hours. I had to take Perocet to get to sleep. I woke up 2 days later with a sever back ache and shortness of breath-my lungs hurt.  It felt as if someone punched me in the back.  Today-1 day later-it's totally gone. I don't feel more energy yet, but I know I will soon. People say it may take a few bags to feel a difference.  I do know I CRAVED ice like a banjee-and I haven't chewed ice since the day after I got the first treatment!  So-it is working!! My anemia is from gastric bypass surgery 4 years ago.  Feel good friends :)
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/18/2010 9:43:24 PM	I've been receiving Venofer treatmebts for two years. The first time was last year where I received a syrnge worth of the drug 2-3 times a weeks over the course of 5 months. I had no iron stores when I began. The only side effect I experienced was nausea occurring 1-2 hours after treatment and decreased appetite. I was amazed at how much better I felt. This year my anemia symptoms returned - palpatations, chewing ice, heavy leaden feeling in limbs and muscular pain. I feel much beter usually by the 3rd or 4th treatment. I get sore and bruised at the IV injection site but the nausea abated after the 3rd treatment. I've never taken benedryl for side effects, just compezene(spelling?). To this date the cause of my lack of iron stores is undetermined. I had been anemic my whole life and only when I took Venofer last year was I ever NOT anemic. I never fully grasped how sick I was until I wasn't. Simple tasks like walking up a flight of stairs could make me faint. Now I run up them (but don't tell the doc!)
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	55-64	7/27/2010 3:10:36 AM	Due to a malabsorption problem, I have been going to the hospital every 2 years, beginning in 2004. I have had anywhere from 4-10 treatments each time. Before Venofer was used, I did much better and felt better. Since Venofer has become the preferred drug, I have had numerous side effects, including having the &quot;crash cart&quot; team come in to save me. I am pretreated each time and generally spend the next few days recovering-until the next one. Overall, it has helped me, but I dread it when I start craving ice again because I know it's time. It also amazes me that so few general practitioners know very much about this process. I'm almost done for this time around. Yay!
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	pegtsly, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	4/6/2010 2:20:46 PM	I have lost my taste and it has been approximately l0 days now.  I am due for Venofer again 4-8 should I take it or talk with my physician.  I understand this is a side effect of Venofer.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	John, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	2	2	Male	45-54	3/13/2010 9:42:13 AM	I'm in stage 3 CKD.  So, my doctor put me on Venofer - which helped by takes a long time to administer. So I read about a drug called Feraheme (sp?) and my doctor was first hesitant, but decided to give it a try.  After ONLY 2 treatments (yes - only 2 doctor visits - instead of 8-10) I was able to get my iron levels up and I feel better and don't have to go to the docotor as often.  Would highly recommend that you talk to your doctor about it.  
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	2/7/2010 3:31:54 PM	I felt great the day of the fusion.  The next day is when I began to have abdominal cramps, leg cramps, vomiting, headache, and felt very tired.  I was hospitalized and given benadryl to stop the reaction, zofram for vomiting and toradol for pain.  I won't go through another treatment again!

So, i really cant say just yet how its going to be.No problems as of yet. a slight headache. but they said that might happen the next day.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	shinein09, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	55-64	12/28/2009 2:36:24 PM	I have been receiving Venofer for almost 3 years now and in the past year I receive it once per week which has worked out much better for me since it keeps my iron levels such that I can have a better quality of life.  Getting a smaller dose rather than the 8-hr bag is very helpful.  I still get fatigued but my hemoglobin level stays around 10.  This has worked fine for me but my veins seem to be hiding these days so it is harder for them to infuse.  
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	35-44	12/3/2009 9:43:44 PM	Venofer has been great for me. I have had no side effects. Don't like having an IV started every time but otherwise it is great!!! I had my stomach removed about 13 years ago due to bleeding and my body was not absorbing oral iron.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	mickeyjo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	25-34	10/23/2009 1:44:32 AM	Well I had two treatments and both times I had an allergic reaction.  My throat and tongue began to itch and then swell.  I was treated with benadryl before both times and on the second treatment I also got a steroid before the venofer.  My energy levels are up but I am unable to finish treatment because of the reaction.  On the second treatment my bp shot up to 154/110 and I ended up in the er with breathing problems.  Wish I could finish because it is helping.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	LiZiNa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	4	2	3	Female	35-44	8/5/2009 10:39:06 AM	My 1st treatment was in Aug.2008 and it was horrible, I had it bad with the side effects. I had vomiting,nausea,muscle ache all over,felt tired,sleepy, and swelling in my legs. The Doctor gave me benadryl with all my other treatments. So far I'm doing somewhat better, my body still hurt, I don't feel that energetic, I still have swelling in my leg, and I'm always tired. It takes about 1 1/2, your arm hurt for a week, if you get it with benadryl or solumedrol that will help with some of the side effects. I do recommend it because it does help, not as much as I would like, but it's enough to get me up and going ^;^
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/25/2009 12:14:57 PM	I just had my 2nd treatment today.  I have had zero side effects and actually have noticed more energy already.  After being on oral iron medication for 1 year this has been easy.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	4	Female	35-44	3/17/2009 10:04:08 PM	I just started my treatments, the first of eight. I was scared to death because I had read some real horror stories on internet about it. But I came thru with flying colors, No sickness, maybe some mild soreness in my joints but nothing bad. The whole treatment took about 15 minutes. Like I said it was my first treatment so I dont feel any different than yesterday but it wasn't half as bad as some people said. But I did notice I'm not craving my crushed Ice I ate ALL the time. Dont know if it has anything to do with it or not.

The first time the only adverse effect it had was severe itching. There was no visible rash.  This time I will be pre-medicated with solumedrol and possibly Benadryl.  Looking forward to having more energy and just feeling better overall.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	LCS, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	65-74	10/30/2008 12:34:55 PM	I was going into Kidney failure due to a greatly enlarged prostate.  After beginning to use a catheter, the kidneys have begun to recover.  In the mean time my nephrologist got the Venofer treatments (3 total, 1 week apart) approved.  I had no noticeable side effects after the first treatment.  It was done at a local hospital in the cancer clinic where all types of IV treatments are carried out.  I ate breakfast, then reported to the hospital at 7:30 a.m..  I was done before noon, including a lunch served about 11 a.m.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	kwesson, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	9/21/2008 9:38:09 PM	I have very low ferritin levels.  I have to take a total of 4 treatments of Venofer.  I took my first one two days ago.  The side effects were horrible!  They gave me Bendaryl in my IV and I started to feel better.  I was about to faint.  My chest was crushing in.  Next time, I'll get Benadryl before the treatment and hope that helps.  It's just strange how I felt fine during the whole treatment and got VERY sick after I started walking around.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	Mizzy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	4	Female	35-44	9/7/2008 9:06:47 PM	I cannot take oral iron and have so far had two treatments with Venofer.The side effects were horrible the first time. Back pain, vomiting and nausea, drop in BP, extensive hives. But the send treatment was much better, since we were able to take care of the side effects. I find it more convenient and certainly less painful that getting iron IM. I have done my tests and will see my Hematologist next week. Hopefully I have improved. Hopefully I will only need a few more treatments.

It has been relatively easy, takes about 1hour or  so. I have 3 more treatments, then go get another blood test and see the hematologist. I'm hoping that this does the trick as I was allergic to InFed, and am unable to absorb oral iron. I have had a lot of symptoms previously, which have disappeared due to a blood transfusion I had about 4wks ago. I am anxious to see if this treatment continues to make symptoms dissapear, i was bothered by RLS, leg cramps, shortness of breath, palpitations, sore/sensitive tongue, cracks in lips, etc.. I am so glad to get a break from all that and am encouraged so far.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	RITA, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	12/19/2007 12:28:26 AM	SO FAR, SO GREAT!  VENOFER IS WORKING EXCELLENT!  I CAN'T TAKE ORAL IRON.  I TAKE 2 INFUSIONS TWICE A WEEK AS MY RED BLOOD ARE EXTREMELY!!! LOW.  I HAVE NO ENERGYWHAT SO EVER, HAVE A TERRIBLE TIME BREATHING, SITTING DOWN IS OK, BUT WHEN I STAND UP I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE HAS PUT A BAG OVER MY HEAD.  SO FAR I HAVE HAD 3 TREATMENTS AND THINGS SEEM TO BE IMPROVING.  I AM SCHEDULED FOR 6 MORE!!  I WOULD RECOMEND THIS TREATMENT TO ANYONE THAT CAN'T TAKE ORAL IRON.  MINE IS INJECTED INTO THE VEIN AT A BLOOD DISORDER CLINIC AND TAKES ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF!   NO COMPLAINTS SO FAR!
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	jackiesuern, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	35-44	12/6/2007 9:17:31 PM	I have been dx with severe iron deficiency anemia that has not responded to oral iron preparations. Over the past two years I have had six rounds (1 dose weekly for four weeks). Twenty-four iv's later I have finally gotten my ferritin levels in the low normals. My hgb levels and quality of rbc's is also rising. At the same time I was dx with an auto-immune disease (undifferentiated connective tissue disease). Between the two I have experienced severe fatigue. The venofer has helped alliviate some of the fatigue. It has also helped with the restless leg symptoms that often accompany severe iron deficiencies. venofer is not without side effects but if it helps my body make quality rbc's it is worth it.
