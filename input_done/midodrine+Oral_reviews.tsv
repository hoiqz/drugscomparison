There are times the pressure is still low several hours after taking it (in the 70 over 40+ range.

Cardiologist prescribed 5mg t.i.d.  Minor improvement in BP but symptoms still limit me to mostly chairborne life.  Dizzy, vision problems, fainting within 2-3 minutes of standing.  Side effects limited to urinary problems, minor chills.

Other	otowngrl77, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	8/7/2011 3:29:06 AM	I have orthostatic hypotension, but mine causes arrhythmia and vein pain in lieu of fainting (I did faint on the tilt table test). My doctor prescribed this medication to me because he thought my arrhythmia and pain were related to poor blood perfusion due to my hypotension. While Midodrine made my vein pain in my arms go away and my arrhythmia to stop, I developed other symptoms. My legs became numb and the veins in my legs ached on and off. I felt very nauseated and had a headache. As soon as the medication wore off, my original symptoms would return (my legs getting better) with a vengeance and I would have palpitations and my hands turn blue. For me, this medication is NOT the solution to my problem.

Cardiologist upped dose to 10 mg t.i.d. but still no improvement. Last visit, he said midodrine doesn't come in stronger doses &amp; he didn't know what else to do, as he rarely sees orthostatic hypotension in his practice. I am searching for a new cardiologist. Itchy scalp is tolerable, but my eyebrows have mostly disappeared since starting midodrine.

I take my med. 10mg 4 x a day on scheduled &amp; 30 minutes before I eat. I join a walking group which I can only walk 20 to 30 minutes before needing to sit down. Before I could not walk or go shopping at all without fainting. I practice deep breathing and yoga exercising. Stress makes my neuropathy condition worst. Drink plenty of water,take B12 and remove Caffine, sugar and msg from your diet. Good Luck! God Bless

The only side effect that I have noticed is the scalp tingles and a dry mouth.  These seem like no big deal to me compared to fainting and being dizzy every day.  So far I am happy.

I don't drive because my vision is so blurred. The head itching drives me nuts, but I put up with it.I'm now on 15mg of Midrodrine three times a day. I don't seem to be as dizzy or lightheaded as I was, but if I do something like take a shower, cook dinner, vacuum my pressure drops and I always faint or get dizzy enough to lose my balance. I hope over time the meds will help with everyday life. Wishful thinking?

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	45-54	4/6/2010 10:25:21 AM	I have been taking this medication for a couple of months now, 4xday, for neurocardiogenic syncope. I hate the scalp itchiness and the cold &amp; clammy feeling off-and-on all day after each dose. It has worked somewhat to reduce the passing out episodes, but in combination with all of the meds I take for other conditions (fibromyalgia, herniated disks, RLS, arthritis), I feel terrible most of the time. During the Tilt Table Test, I passed out and dr. could not find a pulse.... so I take this medication despite the side effects. I go to Cleveland Clinic later this month to a specialist, to see what else can be done.  In the meantime, due to all of the health issues, I am on long-term disability ~ how I miss being productive and I miss the daily interaction with my friends and co-workers, but no way I can work -- after 28 years, I am now a liability because I never know when or where I may pass out on the job. So now I am dealing with depression, too.

Without it I could barely stand/walk long enough to go to the bathroom. Like other reviewers, the itchy scalp drives me crazy. I also wear wigs due to hair loss during chemo, so it can be embarrassing, violently scratching my head in public. The chills are another inconvience-always cold and have to wear a coat to the doctor, movie or shopping. Don't forget the dry mouth. Makes choosing a dinner out a real chore. 
Other	scruffy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	25-34	10/16/2009 1:15:47 PM	I take this medication for vasovagal syncope. Before taking this drug I failed 4 tilt tests within the first 2 minutes (needle stick from the IV triggered the reflex). After taking this drug for three weeks and passing a tilt test, the doctor cleared me to drive again. It's been two years now and I am starting to notice symptoms again, so I expect my doctor will raise the dosage at my next appointment. While I haven't had any side effects, it is a pain to take medication 3 times a day when you are so young. But it beats passing out everytime you have blood drawn (or having a pacemaker)!

It is so bad it is hard to focus. My doctor took me off for a bit because of these side affects but i started passing out and getting hurt again so it is too dangerous for me to be off the pill. Also, when laying down, my heart slows down to a dangerous rate and my hearing goes out with each beat of my heart.

My blood pressure was so dangerously low that I had to be placed in the hospital and monitored 24 hours a day because my pressure was so low.  Now my pressure is staying in a better range and I can stay at home and care for myself instead of being in the CCU at the hospital.  They have had to raise my level of the medicine from 2.5 mgs. twice a day to 5 mgs. three times a day but if that is what we have to do to stabalize my blood pressure so that I feel better I am more than willing to take the three pills a day for that stability.
