Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	25-34	3/25/2012 2:54:07 PM	I am 26 years old,  5'11, 186 pounds and I have been taking this product for a week now along with triple green tea fat burner. It has not improved anything sexually, and the other night my heart started racing so fast I thought I was gonna pass out. I was so dizzy I had to sit for and hour and drink a lot of water till it stopped. I would not recomend this product to anyone. Be careful! 
Other	25-34 Male 	4	5	2	Male	25-34	9/6/2011 8:56:54 PM	My wife has a higher drive than I do.  I looked this stuff up, learned what it did, and 'borrowed' some from my dad.  It was amazing! Lil soldier was right back at it after busting a huge one.  Then again later on, just as hard as if nothing had happened all day.  She didn't know what hit her! So I bought some for myself. Big mistake. 1000mg is waaaaaay to much. Stomach cramps, severe headache, trouble sleeping, irritability, dizziness.  It takes too long to kick in an way too long to wear off. It works, but I don't think its worth the side effects.
Other	lilTULER, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	19-24	5/11/2011 7:02:50 AM	First off, Let me start by saying I am a 21 year old male and did not use this for sexual gain.  This product was recommended by bodybuilding.com for help with fat loss. I am 5'9&quot; and 171 lbs. I took this product once before lifting weights and it made my heart race and made me feel stronger. It is a vasodilator which allows more blood flow to the muscles.  It worked.  However, I also work third shift. After taking this product at 8am, I lifted and proceeded to go home and try to get some sleep. I DID NOT SLEEP ONE BIT! My mind was racing. I went to work at Midnight (still not tired after being up more than 24 hours) and felt sweaty.  I work at a hospital so I took my blood pressure which is normally 110/60 for my entire life.  My blood pressure was 172/98.  WAYYY TO HIGH for my age and fitness level. I never took it again. I fell asleep when I got home and slept all day. I can get better fat burning stimulant from caffinated gum and/or black coffee. Do not take if you have high blood pressure or heart problems!!!!

Like others, i took it and developed flu-like symtoms ie: fever, chills and loss of sleep. It had no sexual effect what so ever. return it or flush it down the toilet.
Other	not happy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	3/3/2011 7:09:09 AM	Within an hour of taking this drug I had the following reactions. Chills/goosebumps over my entire body, sweating, rapid and irregular heartbeat and felt very uneasy. I took this medication at around 5pm and was up until well after midnight. Got a horrible night sleep. Don't take it, I'm returning it today.
Other	hate2baging, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Male	55-64	1/17/2011 6:16:40 PM	Within one hour of taking I experienced headache, tremors, excessive sweating, nervousness, accelerated heartbeat, and could not sit in a meeting, having to stand and figit nervously.  Fortunately I am in shape for an old guy, having run two marathons in the last five years.  Can only imagine what other attendees thought.
Other	45-54 Male  (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	45-54	12/2/2010 11:58:23 PM	Near seizure. Incredible, whole body tremors.  Required EMS transport to ER. Really felt like I was going to die.  DO NOT TAKE THIS PRODUCT.
Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	7/8/2010 2:35:29 PM	Better to use in a complex with other herbal supplements for erectile dysfunction. Like tongkat ali, l-arginine and horny goat weed.
Other	jack, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	45-54	8/4/2009 11:07:12 PM	One hour after taking the first and only pill, I started having cloudy vision, burping, chills, sweats, vomiting, stomach cramps, confusion, tremers, Ringing in my ears, axiety,...  Do not take this drug.  Two hours later, it got worse.  I got mine from GNC, 450 mg with 9mg Yohimbe.  It's 5 hours after I took it and still having some tremers, sweats, ringing in ears and chills.  I had to get on here and try to warn anyone about this drug.  I have no idea why this drug is sold over the counter.  It sux big time.  I hope I get over this soon.

Other	alantrow, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	6/24/2009 6:48:11 PM	Effective but beware out there. Standard (GNC)9mg can be too much. Best start withno more than half a tablet. More can cause anxiety, insomnia, high BP/rapid heartbeat etc.... 9mg is too much for me...and I'm good shape 240lbs+ former college football.Great energy boost, aphrodesiac, weight loss (careful). Mind carefully dosage and timing.

Other	bigfarm, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	35-44	12/26/2008 11:13:48 AM	worked some for mood. reverse effect on sex and shivers, high BP, and weird flushing. Might do again in lower dose for mood, but not likely. the sex thing was just an experiment and no way on that--will just keep it natural!!
Other	amby, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	7/22/2008 11:33:51 PM	I took this in controlled-dose, prescription form, so I knew I was getting the correct dose.  However, it didn't help with my problem and I had several terrible side-effects, such as very high anxiety, several gastric pains and problems, as well as terrible insomnia.I tried this when I fell into the (U.S.) Medicare Part D &quot;donut hole&quot;, at which point the AndroGel that I had been taking (which worked quite well) was suddenly $437 per month for the required dosage!  Since I could not afford the AngroGel, my doctor prescribed this instead.It's a truly awful medicine that doesn't work and creates seriously unpleasant side-effects.

Other		5	4	5			5/16/2008 6:12:49 PM	I take the GNC product standardized to 9mg yohimbine per capsule.  One capsule, 500mg tribulus (not sure if this is required), plus one-half cup of tea (lipton black tea bag) 1-2 hours before a 7pm dinner and I'm good past midnight.  And, for some reason, for me, the tea/caffeine is very important, but if I drink the whole cup, I have trouble sleeping.  To note, though, I don't have a severe case of ED, but just trying to keep it more than just a little firm.

I have a bladder problem right now, I am 53 years old. I have high blood preasure but did not have a lot of problems with that.
