Major Depressive Disorder	fdeavis@cox.net, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/29/2011 6:14:06 PM	Of all the medications that I have taken since my depression (40 years of depression) this medicine (Remeron)has been the best that ever happen to me. I don't really feel depressed anymore but I still need this med. to be able to sleep and eat. I have lost my appetite entirely and I believe forever and with Remeron I feel hungry. Right now I'm only taking 15mgs. and I cut the pill in half (7.5 mgs). The dose doesn't come lower.

Anyone that has taken this drug less than this amount of time should not be rating it.This medication works very well for me and helps me sleep well. Research has shown that it treats depression effectively without adversly effecting sleep the ways that SSRI's (Lexapro, paxil, prozac, celexa etc) do.

It definitely helps sleep and the depression lifted after adding the latest 7.5mg. I have watched my calorie intake carefully and have not gained weight.  No sexual side effects.  I would rate it A+.

Depression	msmac1, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/8/2010 10:10:24 PM	I had a very restful sleep while taking this medication. The only side effect of taking this med is that I was groggy for a while after waking up, but very relaxed the rest of the day.  
Depression	Barb, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	55-64	4/10/2010 3:01:33 PM	I have been taking it for several years.  It definitely helps me sleep, but I take several other antidepressants, so am not sure how well it helps the depression.I have gained about 20 pounds on the medicine.  I am not at all happy about that, but it is better than not sleeping.
Depression	MA, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	45-54	3/12/2010 4:38:55 PM	I have been using this medication for about 10 months. While it has somewhat helped my depression symptoms, I find the 10+ pounds I have gained to be a big drawback. Also, the drowsy feelings that helped me sleep are no longer working like they used to. I will be switching meds.

Depression	kizz, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	10/8/2008 5:10:53 PM	I have only been taking Remeron for 4 weeks now for treatment of major depression.  I have found that my anxiety has lessened but I still feel depressed most of the time.  I do sleep very well though. I'm hoping that the anti-depressant effect will kick in soon.
Other	Malka 1926, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female		11/27/2007 1:40:51 AM	I've been taking this drug for 3 years,15 mg. at night after bedtime primarly for easier sleep. I've been waking with headaches periodically and wonder if they're associated with long usage of Remeron.
