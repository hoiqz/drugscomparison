I take it each month, and its the only thing I can stomch during my cycle. It doesn't cause nausea like other pain meds I've taken and there aren't any other nasty side effects. I take 3-5 each day depending on how severe the pain is, and it starts working almost instantly. Im thankful because before I was going through other meds unsuccesfully before finding one that I didn't throw up almost immediately after taking it.

I went through the withdrawl symptoms when I still had methadone just in case I couldnt handle it. It was over in a week but took about a year to feel normal again.

I have MS and and as I get older I am seeing more and more flarups takeing plce so I start taking stearoids and dear God those things are very bad for my body but my doctor say's that is  the only thing I can take for my flairups, so I take them and try to think positive as I go num on my left side or loose my eye sight and just pray to God that the symptoms will go away, what a long road this has been for myself and my family.Tommorrow ias a new day and I pray that my symptons will go away.I will not let this disease take my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If the pain is severe then take it, because it can become additive.

CURRENTLY ON 325MG TYLENOL INSTEAD OF THE 500 PRESCRIBED BEFORE. I HAVE BEEN ON IT FOR SEVERAL YEARS WITH VARIED HELP, HAD SURGERY, PAIN PUMP, TENS AND MENS UNITS BUT AFTER A WHILE EFFECTIVENESS GOES DOWN. I'M OVER 60 NOW AND HAVE SEVERAL MEDICAL CONDITIONS CAUSING PAIN AS WELL AS TERMINAL LUNG DISEASE, IPF. STRENGTH REALLY MATTERS A LOT SO THESE REVIEWS DON'T HELP MUCH WITHOUT COMPLETE INFO INCLUDED.

I have tried Percocet 10mg to Lortab 5mg. Lortab 5mg works the best, it relieves the pain and doesnt make me sick. Anything stronger makes me stoned quite literally. Lortab is the only thing I have found that works for the nerve pain!!

The surgery was a huge success (lost 250 lbs) but with rapid weight loss also came some muscle and sketelal loss. I lost all the &quot;fatty&quot; padding in my feet and suffered structural damamge to my feet, left knee and ankle. After visiting about 11 teen different specialists and Pediatrists, no one could offer any relief to the pain i was having. My family Dr. (awesome) did a lot of testing and researching and found the problem. Basically i am screwed but the Lortab 10/500 mg medicine gets me through so i can still manage to play/coach my kids in sports and work productively. in my opinion, it is a great drug but very easy to build up a tolerance to. I am now up to 5 per day but wouldnt change medicines for nothing. Hope my comments help someone out there.

Pain	constantOuch, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	11/27/2010 3:00:42 AM	I have ovarian cysts that I would take percocet for, those worked wonders. Now since they've come back a few months later, I was prescribed Lortab...in short, they suck. They just make me very tired and have no effect on my moderate pain even after 10/1000 of it. I could see Lortab/Vicodin releaving the pain of a typical headache because it's like asprin just with narcotics :/ It also upsets my tummy A LOT.

They are the best combination of hydro/apap.  I have been on norco 10/325 and Vicodin 7.5/750 and vicoprofen 7.5/200 (the vicoprofen worked well also with the ibuprofen)  I also was taking 15mg MS contin 3x per day for two  years and i feel the lortab are better.

Too bad it is also very addictive.  My doctor has taken me off this and has tried to substitute Ibuprophen tabs. 800 mg.  unfortunantly, the Ibuprophen does nothing to help with the pain.  I have a trach tube in my neck and it is very painful to move my head or cough.  I have another appointment with my MD this afternoon to try to get him to put me back on this med.

I go back to the Doctor on Oct. 18th for a final diagnosis and am going to talk to him about possibly uping the dosage.

Its been helping a lot, and I dont take as many as the other painkiller I was on before. I'm not sure how it will work long-term but I'm pain free and happy with it.

Both of them are in their late fifties and have been on this drug for over 10 years. They are in complete denial. Please take note of this as both of them cannot function without this drug. He is an accountant and she is a social worker with children.

Side effects are so so with a little nausea sometimes and a headache ocassionally but for the pain relief it provides is worth it. The only problem i have with this medication is having to fight consistently to keep a prescription due to the douchebags that sell it ilegally, has made it very hard on people that actually need it. Have two ruptured discs and an unsuccessful decompression, passed on a 2 level fusion.

I am bipolor 1 mixed and take Adderall XR (60 mg) a day, this dosn't work for me anymore, I take a Lortab and my energy level goes sky high.  Why?

I have told the doctor this and my husband but they did not believe me. I just seen on here that H/P was one of the rare side effects. I am just a rare because I keep it controlled until I take one .

It was hydroco/apa 5-500.  I took one after only a half hour, I begin to get very red in the face, my lips got parched and I just felt very sick. A short while later my ears got so full of pressure and my jaw almost locked up and my blood presure rose to 146/110.  I called my doctor and she said to try and get calm and call her back in 45 minutes.  I put cold compresses on my neck and drank alot of water.  My BP did come down and I did take another lortab to try and sleep, but a short time after this the same thing started to happen.  This is how I finally realized that it was the generic pill for lortab that was doing this.  The only reason the second episode was not as bad, is because I had taken my zrytec almost at the same time and I believe this made it not get so bad.  Anyway, is the generic for lortab made with different materials?

Pain	Hall, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	55-64	11/23/2009 7:48:51 AM	I've been taking Lortab 5-500 for a few months for chronic back pain. Sometimes it's somewhat effective, but most of the time it's not very effective at all.I've often wondered if I've been prescribed a placebo but I know that's not the case. I've had no real side effects at all except perhaps some mild constipation. Other than that I can hardly tell I've taken anything at all.

Was curious since Dr scribed these 5-500 tablets to my 18 yr old son when he was diagnosed with Influenza, not the H1N1 variety.  He had a fever and body aches and never took any of the pills, but this doesn't seem like the right drug for the flu.  As with anything, OTC, alcohol, illegal drugs, when you find relief from pain, it can become addicting.

This medicine has helped a great deal. I've had multiple shoulder surgeries, bulging discs with ddd and arthritis. allergies to NSAIDS that caused 3 stomach repairs to be needed. This medicine can be used without being abused. If you're using it for everyday aches and pains, that's why it's not working when something is going wrong. That was the biggest lesson I have learned with this. This medicine is much better then taking oxy's or percocets. If it makes you sick, your dr can give you ideals on how and when to take it. As I said, I've had 3 stomach repairs, if my stomach is acting up, ginger ale helps a great deal calming my stomach. Then I deal with the pain from my shoulders and back. That way no more is needed. To the person that asked about grapefruit. Yes, it will affect how MANY medicines work. It will also mess your stomach up. If you follow your dr's orders and stay with a physical plan, this medicine and physical activiy will work. If you stay with this medicine and NO ACTIVITY. phlebitis will probably kick in and you won't realize it. My best advice is to ask, research, know and ask again. A good Dr and pharmacist will give you the best knowledge to know if you can handle this medicine. Used correctly, it does give you the ability to have your life back. Don't take it for granted though. Good luck to anyone that is just starting this medicine. If you can keep from going to anything stronger, you've halfway won your battle

I hope abusers don't mess things up for something that works for my leg and testicle pain due to a ruptured disc.  I have tried many others pain killers, because I would rather not take a narcotic.  Lortab has the least side effects.  NSAIDS also worked pretty good until they messed up my stomache and subsequently my esophogus.

Pain	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	7/28/2009 6:59:59 PM	I took this med for over a year and it without a doubt relieved my chronic lower back pain with few to no side effects.  The big problem is that causes dependence. If I could give anyone advise take this medication as perscribed and never take more than that. Your Dr. knows best because the lower the dose the easier on you it will be to stop taking it.  I stepped down over a month and then stopped completely.  If you are stepping down currently just remember that most of the feelings you are going through are due to not taking the med and believe me it may take a while but the withdrawls will go away and you will feel a lot better physically and mentally.  Just like any other meds each one has its benefits and ultimatly its draw backs.  It is a great med for pain and works wonders however if you are perscribed this understand that when you are done taking it you will go through some pretty rough withdrawls!  Let me specify that I took the med for over a year not for a short time.

Howver this is the most addicted pain medicine I have ever taken.  Used as labeled it wasn't long before I found I needed more to get the same results.  Before I knew it I was completely HOOKED on this med.  I HAD TO HAVE IT MORE FREQUENTLY as the time went on.  I started with 5mg, then 7.5mg and then 10mg.  I knew what was happening but I couldn't control it.  I had to get off this pill.  The withdrawal sysptoms were horrible.  I see now why some people have to be detoxed.  I couldn't afford the luxury of this so I did it myself.  Three days of HELL.  Anxiety like you wouldn't believe it, cramps, shortness of breath, not able to eat anything, deprtession, and just no will to go on.  I prayed about it and with the help of the Lord I made it through.  But, I tell everyone.....BE CAREFUL, THIS IS A VERY EASY MEDICINE TO GET ADDICTED TO.  IT HITS YOU ALL AT ONCE. I wouldn't want anyone else to go through this.!!!!

It works well to mask the pain up until the last hour before I can take it again...it will then usually take a good 30 minutes after I take another dose to stop the pain.

Then dr kept giving me refills next thing you know ur addicted and taking alot because you built tolerance. Then your having withdrawals 3 hrs later if you dont take the next one. The withdrawals from Lortab are worse than alot of drugs because you get a mental and pyshical addiction to them.

It was a blessing that it really helped my walking. However, I'm at the strongest dose and 6 pills a day and still having very significant pain. I'm unable to tolerate most other pain killers, so I don't know what I'm going to do.  I'm probably addicted and now it's not helping the pain enough. I'm so screwed. LOL

Sometimes itchy.As I cut back as pain allows often have sweats, and sllepless nights. This medicine is very addictive for long term use. Itake 7-500 mgs every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. It makes you feel very godd and energetic. Its easy too want this medicine after working and being tired and sore. It does work for pain but dont take if you dont have a strong will power not too take more then needed. I have had different doctors prescribe it for different pains. Very easy, too easy  too get enough too become addicted.
Pain	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/24/2008 10:25:44 AM	I have taken this medication intermittently for migraine pain, and have been on it regularly for the past year for severe arm/shoulder pain that did not respond to physical therapy. I take the 10/325 tablets as they are easier to swallow than the others. This is a reliable pain medication. Suffering extreme pain makes me fearful that it will happen again, so having a prescription for Lortab gives me comfort, knowing I have a medicine that will work well against very painful conditions. I have been on 20 mg./day for about 1 year now, and have had no trouble stopping or going off it when I needed to.

It doesn't always do the trick, but mostly especially at night, does.

Pain	Willowwren, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	5/18/2008 5:01:25 PM	I am currently taking the Lortab 75/500, following hysterectomy surgery. This is the only thing that DOES help with the pain. It never makes me sick to my stomach because I take it with food...even if it's just a piece of bread. The only drawback is, it doesn't last very long. I have to take it every 4 hours and before the 4 hours is up, the pain has returned. Other than that, it works great for my pain.
Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	35-44	5/8/2008 10:44:22 AM	Was prescribed five days' worth of Lortab for pain following oral surgery.  Doctor assured me that although codeine bothered my stomach, since I had taken Percocet with no problems I could certainly take Lortab.  He was mistaken.  Although I've been careful to take it with food, as recommended to reduce the risk of nausea, I feel shaky and very nauseated.  It does seem to work well on my pain, but I will be interspersing the doses with Advil and stopping use as soon as I can manage pain without the Lortab.

But after I stopped taking it and it wore off it was helping more than I thought.  But still not enough. (I broke some ribs) I can't take this medicine.

WARNING!!!- Although this drug was very effective, I cut my dosage in half of what the dentist recommended. I found myself confused, my sleep was weird (I felt awake, I knew everything that was going on around me, I could recall conversations other people had with themselves while I was sleeping. I felt like I was awake and conscious the whole time, but when I was awoken, it was like I woke out of a deep sleep). The medicine made me feel &quot;high&quot;. I made sure someone was always with me while I was on it (less than a week) because I could see myself doing some crazy things. I felt shaky, lightheaded, but also happy. This is truly a narcotic drug. It does its' job which is what I wanted. I was 100% satisfied with it but wish more caution would be given to people taking it. I had difficulty understanding things while I was on it (including movies, games, reading reports, writing emails, etc.) Although, I felt that I did a good job dealing with the issues and protecting myself (which should be a serious concern to whomever takes this). I stopped at the soonest possible point that I no longer needed the pain medication. I can not stress enough, BE AWARE that this drug can become addictive. It is a drug. You WILL get &quot;high&quot; and only take it if you can handle this in a mature matter. I would NOT take this medication if you have chronic pain, you WILL become addicted to it. Be mature and responsible and this drug will be the best thing you have ever taken (that is how I feel about it), if you abuse it, it will ruin your life. I hope this is helpful to everyone, I wish the doctor had warned me about this before I took it.

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	4/6/2008 12:06:42 AM	This medication could easily be OVER used!  It seems to wear off very quickly and I would find myself needing to take more,and when I would it would upset my stomach.  Overall it did help with the pain, but I have taken other pain meds. in the past and they have been more effective, last longer, not make me itch, or feel dizzy.
Pain	Jordy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	45-54	3/31/2008 4:33:53 PM	I did not like it.  It did not take away my chronic pain plus it made me feel strange.

It really works well for pain. But like all medicine I think that if you take it long enough it starts not to help you like it had been.....I had back surgery and thats why Ive taken it so long. I think that I should switch to something else for awhile though. But if Lortab is all you need ....It will absolutely do wonders for your pain.

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/5/2008 5:50:55 PM	A sufferer of Fibromyalgia this has always been what they prescribed. For me it has been a part of my daily medication regime. It does have a short span though. After time my doses need to be adjusted, lowered &amp; raised again. But I never asked for the stronger dose (my dose is the 5/500mg) although it was offered, I tried a higher dose the 10/660mg but that made my stomach upset. So I stay with the 5/500mg dose.Overall this medication has worked for me &amp; my condition. Its effectiveness on my pain has been managed well, the side effects are minimal for me especially with my inability to take anything with aspirin or NSAIDs.

I was in unimaginable pain when my anesthesia wore off.  Once I took Lortab I was able to get out of bed and walk a little. My only complaint is that it wore off after about five hours, but I was instructed to take it every 6 hours.

Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/18/2008 11:55:36 AM	Chronic back pain.  Injury - broken/cracked vertebraes as a teenager 35+ yrs ago.  Functioned throughout life with pain as I believe I have a high tolerance for pain.  Of course, with any narcotic you have to be careful and have the wherewithall NOT to become addicted.  Could not function on a daily basis without somekind of pain control.  Personal decision not to have surgery as I work in the health care field.

Pain	RonP, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	35-44	1/1/2008 2:44:50 AM	WARNING!!!!This has got to be the worst pain medicine someone with cronic pain could ever use. If you take loratab more than a few months you will become addicted. They are too easy to over take. You'll find yourself taking 3 per day the 4 then 5 and so on. I almost lost everything (wife, family &amp; job) to this medicine. Good drug for minor pain if used for a short time. Cronic pain suffers need to avoid at all costs.

Also works great for depression, and I've also noticed I never get sick when I'm on the medicine, not even a cold. And if I did get a cold I wouldn't even care because the medicine makes me very happy and a way more productive member or society
