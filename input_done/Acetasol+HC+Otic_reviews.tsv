The company Activas has since boosted the price to $270.  Outrageous.  Called the doctor who said try vinegar and hydrocortisone.  This is complete abuse of the regulatory system.  Ask your doctor for another solution.  Don't support this predatory behavior by Activas.

Paying over $25 for this drop is ridiculous and charges are between $180 and $260!  Don't be an idiot and use this drug

(first bottle was $5). &quot;It is no longer formulary&quot; they said.  W.T.H!  Is there ANY chance it costs Actavis anywhere near that much to make Acetic Acid?!?  And Hydrocortisone is dirt cheap.
