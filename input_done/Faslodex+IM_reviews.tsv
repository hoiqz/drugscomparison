Had a R masectomy; and went thru 6 treatments of TAC; 6 weeks (15 mins. M-F) of radiation and then Arimadex.  In 1/2012 Pap smear showed positive cancer cells.  Went thru 6 more weeks of Radiation to harden womb and cervix, but no operation. Started Faslodex treatment 2 shots (250mg each syringe) in buttocks every 4 weeks.  We are now 8 months into treatment and Oncologist not happy with tumor markings.  Next visit will try a combo of drugs to bring numbers down.

Took Faslodex (clinical trial for dosage) which worked for 3.3 years with no side effects. Great stuff! I'm almost 72, now on chemo (5 1/2 years after second diagnosis - cancer characterized as &quot;indolent&quot; - but it's stubborn!) and still hanging in there.

Metastatic Breast Cancer Progression Post-Antiestrogen Therapy	spkezzy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	65-74	8/2/2012 5:03:04 PM	Diagnosed with estrogen-positive breast cancer in 2005.  Had a double mastectomy, chemo, and radiation after surgery.  Took Arimidex to remove estrogen from my system.  Was cancer free for four years before it reoccured with small spots in my liver and sternum.  Again I had chemo and my anti-estrogen treatment was changed from Arimidex to Faslodex.  Few side-effects for me although I may be attributing bone aches and feet problems to aging rather than the meds.  Yes, the Faslodex shots are a &quot;pain.&quot;  Yes, the nurse can help by gently warming the shots to almost human temp.  BUT the painful knots that sometimes occur along with feeling bruised in the back hip area are still often there.  Try this:  At any store that carries pads that heat up when exposed to air (ThermaCare or Tylenol Precision) and put them onto the shot area IMMEDIATELY after the shot.  Yes, take them with you to the office when you get your shots.  Replace as needed for 24 to 36 hours and you'll find the shots and the aftereffects much more comfortable.  Stay positive and stay well.  Let's all survive and laugh in cancer's face!

Cancer returned in 2008, same breast, same location. Had Mastectomy in March 2012, with complications; returned for surgery 3 weeks later.  Started Faslodex one week ago with bad reactions: Strong body odor-toxic smell, belching, nausea, headaches, swelling and bruising on left hand.  Must do soul searching to see if I should continue this treatment -- may need to research other alternatives.  Between 2008-2012 was taking Arimidex, it worked for a while but cancer markers started increasing in late 2011. God bless all cancer suffers; stay strong.  
Metastatic Breast Cancer Progression Post-Antiestrogen Therapy	Golden Girl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	55-64	3/20/2012 8:47:16 AM	I was DX with metastatic breast cancer to 3 lymph nodes in 12/11 after being cancer free for 4 1/2 years.  I started my first dose of Faslodex, 500 mg with no side effects except soreness at the injection site for a couple of days.  The nurse that administered the drug warmed the drug and I only felt a prick, not the deep injection.  The second dose was 2 weeks later and  I again felt only a prick with soreness later.  But I started having severe diarrhea with stomach cramps; my oncologist prescribed an anti-diarrhea which controlled that problem.  Then I had my next injection two weeks later with the cancer blood markers showing a HUGE drop in the cancer markers, down to the normal level.  It was such good news and gave us a lot of hope.  My diarrhea is gone; I don't have to take the anti-diarrhea anymore.  I now am on a monthly dosing schedule which I think is what has helped with those symptoms plus my buttocks appreciate the monthly schedule!  To relieve the pain from the injection I take Aleve plus I apply a heated pad alternating with an ice pack during the day of the injection.  I have also bought a infra red pad to alleviate the pain, but not sure how much it is helping.  I send positive thoughts to all undergoing treatments and I wish you the very best as you fight this hideous disease.

I have gained a lot of weight.  I have high blood pressure and taking 4 different blood pressure meds, and I have developd Type II diabetes. I take Metformin for this new disease. I don't want to take this shot anymore.  Now my oncologist want to give me Aromasin.

However, my markers are still up.  I have noticed some SE: joint pain, some fatigue and sore, tender feet.  I have found that walking helps a lot.  When I walk in good shoes with gel insoles.  When I hurt, I want to not move, but not moving makes everything much worse.

After lumpectomy etc, unable to tolerate aromatase inhibitors, but for 4 yrs all was well.  Then May 2011 I developed a massive pleural effusion and pneumonia, which put me in the hospital.  After several rounds of testing and draining fluid, finally found this to be the result of metastatic bc - microscopic cells in the pleural lining - so far as we know.  After much reading and research, I began faslodex in October 2011 - the results were virtually immediate.  The fluid around my lungs is nearly gone now, I can breathe again, tumor marker #s are down to below normal.  Yes, there is an odd skin sensation/sensitivity/pain in one hip/leg, but otherwise feel SOOO much better now.  I am wildly pleased with this treatment.  I am snowshoeing again at 10,000 ft altitude.  My family and I are VERY pleased at how well I can tolerate this treatment.

A cancerous lymphnode appeared in my neck area in 2011, went through 6 weeks radiation, now on faslodex for the past 4 months, but hate the shots (one in each cheek, once a month). Also, have experienced pain in the hips and legs 1 or 2 weeks after injection. Begged oncologist for oral treatment and she has me on aromasin starting next month. Gosh, I hope it works well for me.

Mastectomey and Arimidex until Metastatic tumor on L4 spine April 2010. Started on zometa and fasladex after radiation in May 2010. One shot per month and now receiving 2 per month. Not really experiencing any side effects. I may have pain at injection site, depending on skill of nurse. Warming the drug to room temperature helps and the injection should be done slowly. Scans are good so far. I am blessed!!
Other	kshirk1, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	65-74	10/21/2011 10:43:23 AM	I have had the first 2 injections. My doctor said I only get 2 injections the first month and then start once a month. Your website says I should be getting 2 injections 3 times, not two before starting the monthly program. I have matastatic liver cancer, one 3.5cm, plus 6 other smaller tumors. I had no problem with the 1st set of injections, but should I be getting 3 sets before monthly or 2 sets as my cancer doctor has directed. Thank you.

Sleep better due to decrease in bone and muscle pain, doing well to control metastases--except for the one on my esophagus which has grown. First diag was in 2007, still fighting.

Will be seeing my Dr this week. I have tried Femara, Zometa, and now this. Quality of life is severely affected and not worth it. I need help getting up out of a chair, my thighs and calves hurt all the time and after being up for a few hours my feet hurt too.

Other	nursecbc, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	35-44	11/16/2010 10:12:50 PM	I have had a double dose of Falsodex 3 times, that's 4 IM injections in the buttocks each month.  I bruise and it is really sore for about a week. I also experience my urine having a strong odor for the first week. I have a bad taste in my mouth too. I also have diarrhea during the first couple of weeks after injections. I feel like the tin man needing an oil can each time I get up after sitting or laying down for 30 minutes. After I get to moving around, I ususally feel better. I am most concerned about the fact that my arms, hands, legs, and feet keep falling asleep on me.  I am also getting Zometa infusion once a month too so I don't know which is causing more pain. I have had some headaches and nausea. I take Vitamin E 400IU BID for the hot flashes. I'm pretty sure that it helps because when I forget it, I notice flashes are much worse. 
Metastatic Breast Cancer Progression Post-Antiestrogen Therapy	Diane  B., 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	55-64	11/7/2010 11:26:05 AM	Breast cancer ER/PR+ diagnozed Oct 2000.Four Neo-adjuvant chemos before lumpectomy, 4 more infusions post lumpectomy. Six weeks radiation then tamoxifen, arimidex and disease free till March 2007, when metastatic breast cancer moved to ovaries. Full hysterectomy, doing fine till July 2009. Recurrence of breast cancer on small intestine. Re-section of intestine to stomach and clinical trial for one year with Nab-paclitaxcel and Avastin (Bevazumizab) infusions 3 times per month for 1 year. Finished chemo Aug 22, 2010.Feeling ok, hair coming back in again and neuropathy on fingers and feet slowly getting better. Loss of 55 lbs during past 12 months. After capsule endoscopy was notified of small cyst resurgence next to re-section site. Feeling good, went on vacation to Galapagos for 2 weeks. To slow/stop progression, Faslodex was suggested. First injection not pleasant but no major pain. A bit of a rash and itching on stomach. No other adverse reaction to speak of. After the last injection 14 days ago, I have a moderate rash on stomach, buttocks, back and upper arms and shins. Test also showed higher liver enzymes for the very first time. However the itching is absolutely insane. I do not function very well or sleep due to constant scratching. Do not think I can continue with this unless there is a pre-medication solution. To relieve itching/rash have been prescribed predinizone (steroid) and Atarax. Combination works for a while but after six hours, starting to need another dose of Atarax. Hive not going away, but instead moves to ears or head or arms and other parts of body. Am wondering if it will take full 30 days to get out of my body which is the time span Faslodex works through. All in all am a 10 year fighter and look forward to more time here. Just need another alternative to Faslodex that is also an ER/PR inhibitor with a tract record. I am lucky, turned 55, great supporting hubby and friends and great doctor and team.

I have some trouble walking, and I think one foot is swollen.  I see my doctor tomorrow.  Time for something else.

Cancer found in lymph nodes and also appeared on skin.  So, chemo started again, and after 5 months of different regimens that were not improving the breast cancer on my skin, started faslodex which seems to have totally turned the skin involvement around- it has retreated and has now almost completely disappeared.  My Dr. is amazed - wished we had tried it sooner.  Did not work well with Abraxane so now taking xeloda, and lymph nodes are clear once again, and skin still looks good - looks like we made the perfect match, finally (have gone through several drug combinations in the last 11 months).  The shots are miserable despite using yoga breath, especially now that I get two every month.  Other side effects tolerable so far - rec'd 11 doses.  Does massage really help?  I've tried ice packs.  Had some bad days lately - I think I'm worn out from the fight, but I'm hanging in there.  Markers are down - hoping for 2 clear PETs in a row - would be nice for a change though it probably won't change anything about my treatment.  Hope it never stops working.
