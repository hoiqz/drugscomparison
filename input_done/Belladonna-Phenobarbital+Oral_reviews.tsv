I have lost all memory of the 2.5 weeks I was on the medication and continue to have problems processing events in a chronological order. Very very dangerous stuff!

I was losing weight rapidly, and throwing up just about every time I eat.  Had Gall Bladder removed - but problems persisted.  Other medications did not work.  Have stomach problems, nausea, vomiting, cramping.  Take compazine for nausea - very good.  Still had severe cramping until I was put on Belladonna w/Pb.  Works very well, very effective .......

It didn't mix with the other medicines he is on. If we didn't live next door to a hospital he would now be dead and that was what the doctor in emergency told us.

Other	Jaidlin, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/1/2008 2:04:48 PM	It worried me when they told me it could affect my liver long term. Now they are putting a warning lable on it for breathing issues.  It works for me.  If it isn't working for you, talk to your doctor.  I had to take it 3x daily mixed with .5 mg of clonopin to take care of my problems.  I couldn't keep weight on and everything I ate came right back out and in severe pain (passed out, rushed to the hospital). When I tried to stop, I spasm so badly food either backs up now or I am back to not being able to walk with out losing everything I drink and eat.  It beat having to go for surgery. I just hope the long term affects aren't going to cause other more serious issues.

I was wired tons of energy and could not sit still, my heart was racing all night I did not sleep at all. Be sure to take on a full stomach, it also made me nauseous. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/4/2007 2:57:06 PM	I have been taking this drug for over 1 year now, usually 3 times per week total or depending on my symptoms. I usually take the belladonna for stomach cramps. I would highly recommend it.
