Painful Periods		4	4	5			8/15/2012 3:43:00 PM	I am so happy with this birth control. Ive tried several other birth controls which have made my mood terrible and completely decereased my sex drive. But ive been on this one for 3 months now and i have nothing but good things to say about it. The first month it made me a little dizzy but once my body got used to it that side effect completely went away and im as happy as ever with this birth control now!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	19-24	1/10/2012 8:22:07 PM	This medication gave me horrible PMS, I had a tiny bit spotting and no period. I didn't have this before on my other medication and I know I am not pregnant.
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	19-24	1/9/2012 9:08:10 PM	My normal birth control got back ordered and I was put on this for a month since it was almost the same thing. My only major complaint about this medicine was that I had stomach problems after taking it even after eating a good meal. Later while talking to my pharmacist we think it might have been the coating. Other wise it seemed to work like my normal birth control from what I could tell. 
Birth Control	jenn, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/1/2011 5:30:03 AM	After a first month of irregular bleeding, my periods went from back breakingly painful, nausea inducing cramps that lasted 7-9 days andwere heavy to 3 days of light period with little to no cramps. I also had acne at 23 years old and it stopped it where nothing else ever had. I get a little headache at the beginning of each new week when the hormones change and a little moody, I also put on 5 or 10 pounds Im not happy about. Otherwise this pill did everything my previous pill did but more and better. I recommend this to anyone with heavy painful periods and acne.

Painful Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	6/3/2011 1:15:43 PM	i have been using this for about a year and a half and have had no problems with it. i did have severe acne when i started as well as painful periods. when i started taking this, acne vanished and i had lighter, shorter periods. i love this birth control, although the acne has progressively gotten worse, it's better than not taking a contraceptive at all.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	dolly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/5/2011 10:52:49 AM	I was first put on a different birth control to help with my Dysmenorrhea, but it was making me even more irritable so they switched me to this and I have been much easier to get along with my family says! It has shortened my periods and I no longer cramp and hurt from them, my acne has cleared up. The only bad thing is when the sugar pills start I get a horrible headache for about 3 days. I am extremely happier on this and will stay on it.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	6/3/2010 7:50:09 PM	This is by far one of the worse B.C. pills that I have been on... I was placed on the pill because of heavy bleeding and painful cramps. I was on Yaz prior but switched because of all of the controversy--My doctor placed me on Nortrel and I have had nothing but problems--really fine acne (never had it before), painful cramps, bloating, water retention, and I have put on between 5-10 pounds.  My doctor is placing me on something new.  I know that everyone responds to things differently but I would NOT recommend this to anyone.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	5/20/2010 12:25:45 AM	Effective as a birth control. I never had any acne problems so I can't tell about that. It caused severe headaches and made me nauseous and light sensitive.  The symptoms lasted longer than the period itself (3-4 days). Caused mood swings and sleeplessnessI. Good I am still a student with these symptoms each months every company would let me go.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/10/2009 1:55:04 PM	This birth control has helped with my acne as well as making my periods shorter.  They typically last 3 days while I've been on this medication.  It really has not helped with my PMS as much as I had hoped.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	13-18	12/22/2008 1:46:33 AM	I used this for a week before I had to quit taking it. It caused nausea and vomitting every day. But I also have a very sensitive digestive system and anxiety problems which may have something to do with it.In the time I was using it, it did help my acne too though.
