I don't get them as often as I use to but it does relieve the terrible pain and the nausea that goes with the migraine headache.  When I had my first severe migraine, I thought I had a virus because I was so sick I couldn't eat and was so nauteated that I was gagging even though I had nothing on my stomach. After a week of this, I went to my doctor and told him of my symptoms and he gave me the shot form, after informing me that I had a migrain.  I couldn't believe my what he had told me until the shot he gave me started to work. I was getting better within minutes. I was amazed that was all that was wrong with me.  I do not take this medication on a regular basis and mostly, a month's supply lasts me a year.  Sometimes I might have to take it two doses before I get relief from a bout with a migraine. I have tried othe forms of medications that are supposed to help ward the migraine off but had nothing worked for me.  Thank God, I don't need it often and also that I haven't made it habit forming. Some people probably would get addicted to it, I'm told. I have seen many drug abusers and do not like what I have seen.  Their lives are ruined and they don't care as long as they can get high and stay that way. That is no way to live so anyone out there that reads this, take my advice and just take it if it is the last and only way to get over your migraine and nausea.

I can take it and go to work with no nausea or sleepiness.  It works well to combat the headache and not put me in bed for the rest of the day.

Pain	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	19-24	5/9/2008 9:42:58 PM	I have chronic back pain due to a herniated disc. I have been on Loratabs for a few years now and just recently got switched to Meprozine. It helps with the pain, but not as good as the loratabs. Also its not a drug that I can take throughout the day because it makes me too tired. The feel I got from the Meprozine was like I couldn't think clearly but still had the narcotizing effect. Thats why for me Loratabs are far better. I have to be able to function all day long.

It didn't anything for my pain but it put me right to sleep. Since then, if I need to sleep and can't, I pop 2 meprozine, and I go right to sleep. It's a good sleeping pill for me, but does nothing for pain.

It relieved the pain quite well but produced some highly undesireable side effects. I had frequent hallucinations I was resistant against my husband's attempts to help me in any way. I was very shaky and disoriented. My husband had to take me to the ER because he was afraid of what was happening. The next day (and still now) I have very little recollection of any of the events that occurred while I was on the drug. It is as if it wiped my memory out completely.This is a combination drug containing Demerol and Phenergan. I have taken Phenergan many times in the past with no ill effects so I feel that it was the Demerol that I had the sensitivity too.Needless to say, I will not be taking it EVER again!
