Other	manda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	8/29/2012 10:28:22 PM	In Feb 2012, i developed plantar faciitis.  In April i finally decided to go to the doctor as the pain had become unbearable with every step.  X-rays showed i also had heel spurs.  The doctor suggested starting with an anti-inflammatory and prescribed meloxicam 15mg once a day.  The medication DID provide relief, but the side effects were so difficult to live with that i decided to stop taking it.  i was experiencing painful stomach cramping and gastrointestinal upset, but i would not classify them as 'severe'. over the next months, i tried various treatments that did not work.  i had become very depressed and had gained weight.  i could not carry on my normal active lifestyle and i was sad.  i did not feel like myself.  after exhausting every other treatment option besides surgery -not to mention spending $$$$$ on appt's-i decided to try meloxicam again in Aug.  after TWO DAYS of taking this drug, i can walk pain free.  i have decided that stomach pain is worth the ability to walk again.  i have also noticed some water retention, but i think i can stay on top of that if i drink more water and i am able to finally add in some exercise.  i have only had a few moments of stomach cramping.  im taking it in the morning this time, with food and plenty of water.

However, after 6+ months, my hair has started to fall out.  Two doctors told me meloxicam does not cause this but I have read the reviews and will go back to over the counter remedies to see if this slows.  I also relate to the caregiver who has decreased patience.

No dermatologist could figure out what's wrong with me and the itching is unbarable. My entire body is covered with red itchy scabs and now I have major scaring on my body. So sad. I advise people never to use this drug. I wish I hadn't. (I'm scratching myself as I write this).

My response to my healthcare provider is always the same: if this medicine is suppose to &quot;help&quot; relieve joint pain, I'd hate to know what it feels like WITHOUT it.  Of course, this is coming from someone who is soon to have the first of two TKR.  For someone who has minimal joint pain - -this medicine would most likely help.

Aspirin was my n-said of choice as the others were ineffective, but caused negative side effects. However, during the past 15 years my DJD worsened while aspirin's effectiveness diminished. Today, I'm off high doses of aspirin and have diminished pain from 7 or 8 to a more comfortable 4 or 5 on a daily basis. All things considered, I think that 15 mg per day of meloxicam has transformed my daily grind pain to bearable levels and, as a bonus I don't have to listen to any more hysteric medical professional's advice concerning the evil aspirin doses I once took.

I have not noticed any pain relief at all and actually made me feel kind of ill.  I would keep trying it at least until the bottle I paid for is gone except most of the super scary side effects I suffer from already because of my injury so I don't think it's worth the risk when ibuprofen seems to work better and I already know how that affects me.

Then my neck pain increased incredibly and I noticed I was extremly tired. I spent 3 straight days in and out of sleep -going from the bed to couch. I was in relentless pain. I Couldn't work, couldn't get energy to do anything. As a result, I didn't take the meds for 3 days and amazingly, I started feeling so much better!  I haven't taken the med in 4 days and I don't want to try it again.  Thanks to all the others who also reviewed this medicine and showed me I wasn't alone in having increased pain and lethargy.

By Jan. 2011, I couldn't even walk two blocks without swelling, enough to make it difficult to go up and down stairs (because it was limiting my range of motion). I was taking naproxene sodium at the time.My doctor prescribed Meloxicam. I began benifiting from the treatments almost immediately. By April, I was able to play tennis again, being able to play longer than I had for years.About nine months later, I found that I no longer needed to take Meloxicam.

I never noticed any drop in arthritis pain. My question is; Is there a source causing an ineffective action of the med? Such as: a particular food that I eat, or a drink that I like, (ice tea, ginger ale, decaf coffee). I ask these questions every time I'm paying a doctor.Two weeks ago I had a C T Scan for severe abdominal pain. Last week I had a stress test. I never get any positive results from tests and still retain the pain  My frustration is maxed. And I don't know what to do.

This drug in itself, according to WEBMD has a mile long list of side effects, most notably for us was the swelling of throat, rash/hives, headaches, upset stomach.  Had E.R. visit and it took Benadryl injection and a steroid to calm the side effects. Direction from Dr. was Benadry 25 mg every 4 hours for 24 hours. Even 10 hours later, still having side effect symptoms.  Cannot find how long this drug stays in a persons system. This all began on 2nd dosage vice 1st dosage. Dr says that its usually the 2nd dosages that will show the after effects if it was to appear.  Recommend that WebMd publish the length a drug is in system if the drug has as many severe effects as this one does.

On another take, my career requires repedative use of my fingers and elbows and those joint pains have all but deminished!  Have taken 7.5 twice a day for only two days and already I can FEEL a huge significant relief to my severe back pain!  It's so important to reduce inflamation because when in accute episodes of pain, inflamation is a variable that directly cause more pain than neccessary.

I usually take at nightime only .5 mg. as I weigh about 90 lbs but sometimes take twice a day when painful back spasms occur.  I'm a diabetic and also have extreme damage to my neck/shoulders from arthritis and this has helped so much.  I'm checked every three months for any internal damage.  Everything is always perfect.  Taking after a meal plus drinking a full glass of water or more, will help the stomach/kidney absorb this medication reducing the possibility of damage.  I also drink lots of cranberry juice to flush the kidneys.  It has worked for me.

Also, I had a similar pain that occurred, out of the blue, in the left shoulder two years ago... stayed around for 6 months while working with it -exercising- and it slowly went away. So, this time I used a friends meloxicam and it seems to be working relieving the pain. Why spend 2-300.00 for a hospital or MD 15 minute call.  Go meloxicam.

I am amazed at how much more I can do. I can actually sit/stand still instead of fidgeting around to attempt to be comfortable. I did gain weight and stopped taking it. I then realized how well this drug controled my pain because much pain came back after I stopped taking it. Not sure if this caused weight gain since I take 2 other drugs. I miss it. Amazing results for my pain from fibromyalgia. Highly recomend this drug.

Joint Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	Chris, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	55-64	1/2/2011 6:44:31 PM	After taking this medication for about two years I began to have too many unexplained symptoms occur: 1) edema despite taking a diuretic, 2) heavy legs feeling, 3) a deep clenching (cramping)pain in random areas of my legs mostly thighs, groin or hips.  I sought out several different specialists for answers, who ruled out many possibilities &amp;/or gave diagnoses which led to more questions.  Finally some symptoms have been helped, but the discovery that my creatinine level was too high caused my primary care doctor to suspect the meloxicam as the problem.  I haven't taken it for at least 5 months with very slight decrease in creatinine levels (suspect kidney damage).  Please let me know if there is any similarity in symptoms with other responders.  Is there anything I can do to reverse damage?

Besides that it seems to be helping relieve some pain so I don't have to take pain medication as much.

I had pain in both knees and both shoulders and it went from hurting to really painful during the day. The Meloxicam took all of the stiffness and pain away, but I get a skin rash about once every 2 weeks which requires treatment at home, and I have experienced vertigo and dizziness a lot. Also, I was unaware that loss of balance was part of the side effects that others have when taking the medicine. I have fallen down approx 8 times in the last 6 months. If I lose my balance at all, I'm headed for the ground. Even today I didn't notice a single step down which most of us would stumble a little and catch our balance. I didn't even have a chance to stumble, I went straight to the ground and jammed my hadn and hurt my knee. I have an excellent tolerance for pain, yet the falls have been so dramatic that I went to the Emergency room. If this is truly a side effect, then I must stop taking it immediately. I have always been athletic and well coordinated and the falling is not only embarrasing but it really hurts and I'm heading toward a serious head or shoulder injury. Like the medicine, can't take the rash and balance issues

The balance issues I started having disappeared a few days after I stopped taking it. So now I'm thinking to only take it as needed, and I'll be careful to watch for symptons like the balance issues. Sneaky, also begin to feel numbness in my left hand, but that went away after a few days after I stopped taking it. Just a fluke that I needed to stop taking it, but noticed those weird symptoms disappear.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	PAT, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	8/16/2010 11:34:20 AM	I had been experiencing extreme joint pain in my hands, wrists and shoulders for about a year. My hands would swell up like powder puffs and I was unable to lift my shoulders. Had to cut down on golf and normal activities. I've been taking 15M Meloxicam for five days and all the pain and swelling is gone. I was even able to golf without pain. The only concern is my appetite is ravenous and have a sudden weight gain(8lbs in five days), but I am hoping this will level off, because the drug works so well. The trade off may be worth it(I feel great!). I am trying to eat meals until I am full and snack on pretzels to see if it helps diminish further gain. Although a colleague at work told me that her girl friend has gone from 170lbs to over 300lb since taking Meloxicam for extreme joint pain.

Doctor prescribed 15mg of meloxicam (1 a day) with 20mg baclofen (3 a day) one week ago. Can't believe the difference. I couldn't sleep, turning over would wake me. I know there are risks but so far I think the benefits out weigh them. Keeping my fingers crossed that it continues to work.

Previously, I had been on a narcotic type medication; my doctor took me off without reason. I would later find out it was because she was 30 narcotic scripts over quota or she would lose her medical license and had to pull thirty off. I was gave three reasons, none that made medical sense (training as RN). So this medication, does nothing for me but make me extremely sick to to my stomach (stomach/colon ulcers). My pain is still there in full force, due to not being on the right medication.

When I wake up, I have pain. Within a reasonable length of time after taking the meds (7.5mg) I am pain free. I do have side effects of extreme fatigue and drowsiness which starts in the early afternoon and lasts until bedtime. Driving after about 2pm is out. I also have minor nose bleeding and infection in one nostril. Seeing as I couldn't easily walk with the damage, the side effects are a minor inconvenience.

The Meloxicam is working wonderfully.  I've been on it for almost two months. No side effects at all, and it helps to relieve my fibro and menstrual pain. It does work on and off, as a lot of pain meds do for me, but I haven't had anything to make me stop taking this drug anytime soon. Just make sure to eat something with it - I made that mistake the first day and it made me extremely nauseous, but just simply taking it with a glass of milk helped tremendously. =)

Take it at the same time every day. I have had 2 back surgerys (microdiskectomy) and it seems to keep the inflamation down and allow for therapy activities. Do not expect instant relief, it takes time for this med to work. You should understand the side effects of this med and any other med.

I was also taking an antibiotic that I blamed for the tiredness, til I finished it.  Now I realize the sleepiness and headachy feeling are from the Meloxicam. I am going to take the rest of this month's, and then stop to see.  Had severe swelling and pain in right hand. Swelling goes down some on this, but pain never does.  Taking Darvocet helps more than this - but both give me stomach problems.Waiting for referal - still have several months to go to get in tho.

I took it for 2 months and had wonderful relief. I just started 3rd month. The last 3 weeks, I have felt so tired all I wanted to do was sleep. Then my husband a had hip replaced so I thought that was the reason for feeling so tired, all the extra work... but then I started to feel depressed and resentful of caring for him, which is not like me at all. Yesterday I read your reviews and got some good ideas. I didn't take a pill yesterday, but will begin taking it now at bedtime instead of after breakfast. Hopefully that will help with the tired feeling. And keep the arthritis pain away too. I live in west central Florida and have lots of weather variations which always affects how I hurt or not.

I was not sure that it was making much of a difference after a week so I stopped taking it and I realized how much it was really helping.  Granted it does not relive all of my pain but it does make a big difference.  I could not take it in the morning and function throughout the day because of the side effects but taking it at night seems to work fine for me.

He prescribed Meloxicam, 1 a day 15mg. I took about 7 tabs,  one a day with not much effect. I quit taking them and that was in Oct 08.   suffered with pain for several more months. Got a shot of cortozone on 1/29/09.  Pain gone.  Started physical therapy on 2/3/09.  Pain came somewhat back. Refilled perscription for Meloxicam and by accident took  one every 12 hours. (was supposed to take on a day. (15mg). after 15 days I ran a 15K and got some pain in left arm and got light headed. Stopped and then slowed my pace. finished at 1:43:18 which is about only 2 minutes of my average. I don't know if this was because of Meloxicam or not.  3 days eariler I ran 8 miles with no effects. Just read about pain in left arm is a warning to stop taking. 15k run was 4 days ago. I ran 2miles today and I feel fine. Have not had pain in arm since 15k run and I have stopped taking drug. However the pain in my left rotator cuff has very much subsided and I feel like it is just about 90% healed.

I've taken Meloxicam for a little over a month. It took about a week for me to get any relief, but the doctor and the pharmacist had told me this would be the case. I take it in the morning with food. The relief was fairly good at first, then improved, then fell off to about 50%. In the past couple of weeks I have had a slight headache, very sporadic, and not severe. At first I thought it was a slight migraine, but my migraine attacks have never involved pain and were self-limiting. I intend to contact my doctor for advice, and have skipped my dose today. Slight as it is, the headache bothers me more than the physical pain that led to my taking Meloxicam.

Remembering to take it at the same time each day has been a bit difficult because of my changing daily schedule.  Otherwise, it has kept the inflamation at bay.  I will continue taking it, until something better comes along, since I had allergic reations to two other NSAIDs.

As a 62 yr. old carpenter it made working pretty difficult at times. After taking the first pill the pain decreased by at least 90%. I was prescribed 1 15mg dose daily ,but found that if I only take one when needed, usually only every 2nd or 3rd day, I feel like a I did when I was 50. Back to my 40 hour week.  
Joint Inflammatory Disease in Children and Young Adults		1	5	1			7/27/2008 2:48:12 AM	After just one pill I experienced severe swelling of legs and ankles.  I stopped it immediately but two weeks later I am still experiencing the swelling and discomfort so a little less severe than initially.  I thank God I had sufficient medical knowledge to discontinue it after one pill.  I hate to think what the results would have been if I had continued it for a few days.

These conditions all vanished bt about 3 pm. The inflamation was reduced,but if I could take the pill at night,I would,I will have to consult my doctor.

I am not a huge fan of taking any drugs on a refular basis-you can end up with a cabinet full if you don't watch out.  This one is good so far though.

It has been close to 5 years since I have transversed stairs like I do now. It isn't yet 100%, but awfully close to. I had asked for a Disability tag, so Doctor put me on Mobic - what an unbelieveable difference! Mobic does what it is supposed to do - it addresses the Inflamation and Swelling and pain! Only one week and already a 100% happy  camper - will keep you updated. I'm also a Type II Diabetic Insulin dependant. Mobic helps people with RA. It rocks!

Highly effective after 2 weeks. No side effects in 2 years. Unexpected benefits: Also helped painful knee, back, shoulder significantly. I used to take Advil 4-6 times per week for headache; have had about 4 headaches total since starting this drug. Started with 15-mg tablet once daily, cut back to 7.5 mg once daily with permission of MD after one year, still effective.
Other	hyphenate, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	1/5/2008 11:08:24 PM	For fibromyalgia and arthritis, as well as other muscular type illness:  having taken ibuprofen, naproxen and other such medicines in prescription strength, found no relief.  Mobic/meloxicam helps a great deal.  I still have neuropathic pain, mostly in my legs, but I don't expect Mobic to be as effective in that category of pain.  The dissatisfaction comes from the stomach problems that get worse--I already have had GERD for many years and stomach ulcers, so I am on medicine for that, but if I don't take that, the Mobic tends to make my stomach worse.  Overall, though, I don't think I could live without the Mobic because it does help out quite a bit to deal with chronic pain.
