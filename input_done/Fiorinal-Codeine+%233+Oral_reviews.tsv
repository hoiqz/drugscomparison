I have inflammation/damaged nerves in my neck due to a fall, and it presents like a cluster headache. It is intolerable pain. This medicine is the only one that allows me to function.  My only problem now is tolerance due to the length of time I've been on it. I've been on it daily for the last 1 1/2 years as the pain presents EVERY DAY. This medicine is different because it's effect last longer.  Even though I take it every day, I am NOT addicted...I know this because a month ago I had SEVERE HIVES, and was on Predisone for 4 days (1st time in my life I had ever taken Predisone), and Predisone KILLED my pain. I had no urge to take the Fiornal #3. Unfortunately for me, I can't take Predisone for the pain.

Other	sunniehawaii, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/14/2011 8:23:08 PM	I have Addison's Disease and I take 30mg of Adderall in the morning and 10 mg at noon and if I need it, 10mg in the evening. I have alot of anxiety because I don't produce the Hormone Cortisol. This is one of the things your Adrenal Gland gives to you automatically for stress. So I get anxious. I took my Fiorinal w/Codeine for a headach one day and realized that it gave me a sense of Calm Energy. That is the only way I can describe it. It was wonderful. It enhanced the Adderall enough for me to have more energy and not to feel anxious at all. I talked to my doctor about it and now she lets me take one in the morning and one in the afternoon. It's like I have been searching for something to help and just stumbled onto this.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	7/19/2011 11:16:39 PM	I have chronic pain from failed c5-c6 fusion and also still have pinched nerves and herniated disks in my neck. I also have moderate stenosis with encroachment on my spinal cord in my Thoracic that adds to my pain. I was given these when extra nerves in my neck got pinched. I am usually on Norco 10mg-325 which at least holds the pain at bay. When I take the Fiorinal, it works about as good as the ton of Tylenol I also take. The only upside to these are they can at least make you sleepy enough to try to fall asleep and get at least 2 hours sleep. It could be the 10mg of Valium I was also prescribed that's making me sleepy. Unless you have migraines, don't bother with these. But of course, you present with pain, you just HAVE to be faking.

Runs in my family, my mother, her father and her sister, and now, my daughter.  I am RH negative and when my first child was born he was RH positive so I had the rhogam(sp) shot. Five years later my daughter was born RH negative - and BAM - total hormonal change.Was a guinea pig for a large pharmaceutical company that paid for my neurologist-their finding &quot;you have migraines and there is no cure&quot;.  I have tried all of the preventative meds and none work.  Fiorinal w/codeine is the only thing that helps me function.  Doctors fight me all the way when trying to get refills - but nothing else works!  I don't know about addicting - sometimes I have to go weeks before getting a new prescription and I never have symptoms of withdrawal - only headaches and nothing to take  It is very stressful not knowing if you can get the only thing that works.  Can only get generic through my insurance.

Without this I would not be able to function. I wake up in pain and go to bed in pain. This Medication allows me to have some quality of life and allows me to get to work every day. Yes I know it is addicting, but so what. If it gives me relief, and I am under constant supervision from my doctor, then I will continue to take it. Have tried everything else, from surgery, physical therapy, accupuncture, epidural injections. Even bought a sauna for my home. Nothing helps. Can't take anti-inflammatory meds. This is the only thing (along with the Percocet) that helps alleviate my debilitating pain. I thank God for this medication(s) and for the Doctor that prescribes them for me. And do not judge me unless you have walked in my shoes and have experienced the excruciating pain that I live with.

The Generic does not help at all. It also costs $200.52 for 100 of the brand name of Watson. Shame on Watson.20 yrs ago 100 of them cost $15.00 per 100 made by (Eli Lilly) out of Canada. Codine Phosphate is a man made drug. We have a big problem with all our drugs.No wonder people go to the streets to find relief.I have Fibromyalgia and it is no picnic. New drugs make me sick.

However, I have found if I have several weeks of headaches occuring 3 or more times a week, the effectiveness is greatly decreased and I must temporarily use a less effective alternative or just deal with the pain for a few days. I use the generic version which has worked well for me. Happily as I get older I seem to be needing my medication less and less.

My doctor originally had me on Norco 10/325, which was working for the better part, and I requested something that might work better, so he put me on this stuff. EVERY TIME I take it, I throw up violently within 30 minutes, even with food, milk, no food, etc.  It really does nothing for the headaches, and to be honest, it is barely a notch above taking nothing at all and having both the severe headaches, plus withdrawls from being on Norco for so long. I have read how much it has helped others, and I have NO idea what the difference is between me and you, other than that it causes such a violent reaction in me. Please, for anyone considering this medication, take my words of advice and look elsewhere, or at least be able to change it immediately if it does not work on you. I feel like a thousand knives are stabbing me in my gut at all times, and I barely can function at all. BE FOREWARNED!!!!!!!!

I have suffered from migraines since I became preg in 1984. I am lucky that the years that I have been taking this medicine that it still works so well for me. This medicine has saved me alot of money over the years due to extra office calls and ER visits. I have found over the years that the trick is to take the medicine at the 1st sign of an attack. I occasionally have to take phenergan if the nausea hits too quick and I can't take the medication quick enough. After my hysterectomy I had severe headaches due to the hormonal treatment, which I eventually stopped. When I was on the hormones I would take them at night along with a Fiornal #3 and it would prevent the headaches.

The generic does NOTHING for my pain, and once when the pharmacy made a mistake and filled my Rx with generic, I found myself taking  more than the recommended amount.  In fact, I always select name brand medications and NOT the generics.  I KNOW, I KNOW that it's more expensive, but when I am sick, and taking Brand medication makes me feel better faster, I always take Brand.  I am lucky in that I have good insurance.

I've tried virtually EVERY known &quot;migraine&quot; med &amp; went to every neurologist in town -- to NO avail. Fiorinal/codeine + 50mg Phenergan IM (injection) which I take for nausea, is the only thing that works for me.  Recently I also began suffering from severe fibromyalgia, plus knee &amp; severe lower back pain stemming from an MVA that occurred more than 30 years ago. Since I cannot take most of the other pain meds, my doctor prescribed Fiorinal to treat my break-thru pain.  Although many doctors don't like to prescribe Fiorinal/codeine, this is about the ONLY pain medication I can take.  I always monitor the amount I take, and I've found that this medication works great.
