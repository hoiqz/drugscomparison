Pain	Rach, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	10/26/2011 3:29:01 PM	I have a sensitivity to ASA or any NSAID's for that matter. I asked my doctor to prescribe me something for my endometreosis pain. I have had this condition for 7 years and I know my body. After two surgeries and countless medications, I need something stronger. Levacet gives me ulcers because of my sensitivity to ASA.
