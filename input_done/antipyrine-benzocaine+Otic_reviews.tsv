Other	bob, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	19-24	8/19/2012 10:20:34 PM	I was prescribed this and Amoxicillin for an ear infection. I'm still in outrageous amounts of pain. Can't sleep, concetrate, talk, or even eat at times. For an ear infection of this severity I don't think that this is an effective medication. It has a very very minor effect on the pain and hasn't helped with the inflammation at all.

I had some ear pain and I put about 3 drops in my ear about 4 hours later a big ball of black wax was just sitting on the bottom of my ear canal. Works miracles.
Earache	momols, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	1/7/2012 10:43:11 PM	I used these drops for pain from an ear infection and although they did help with the pain for a short time they also made the entire side of my face go numb, can't blink, can't smile, can't taste...its really annoying.  I won't use these anymore!
Earache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	12/16/2011 5:48:11 PM	I had an ear pain due to a sinus infection. This took the pain away immediatly. The only draw back is that the drops are so think and hard to get out of the bottle that I had to have another person put them in for me. 
Earache	NoName, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	12/3/2011 10:54:09 AM	Doctor prescribed drops in place of an antibiotic to treat earache from severe sinus infection. Took multiple hours for drops to work at the start. Also took Advil gel caps that I think were more effective in treating the pain. As soon a pain surfaced again, I applied drops and it was effective in a lesser time frame. Within 1 hour. Instructions state to hold bottle for 2 minutes to warm up drops. That was ineffective, drops still cold upon application.

Earache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/9/2011 8:39:26 PM	As an adult, I still get frequent ear infections in the winter.  I SWEAR by these drops!!!  I get pain that feels like a knife being shoved in my ear and these drops immediately relieve that pain!  I also swear by them for my 5 yr old daughter.  She was in so much pain and within 5 minutes of using these, she was sound asleep!  I highly recommend these to anyone.

Was given these drops and antibiotics because I am not able to hear at all. No relief at all. Just makes an oily mess even with cotton in the ear.

When I was at the Dr. I enquired about a pain med. was told the benzocaine is all I would need. NOT. Don't you wish you could temporarily transfer your pain to the Dr. so they could see how bad you feel? Reviews seem to be very effective for children, not adults.

I guess (REGULAR) pain meds are for  excuse me... are not for people with real pain.  Waiting for the docs too get this amount of pain,  so they will know  what I went through. Maybe I have more than an earache...HMMMMM

Earache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	5/24/2010 1:55:46 AM	My five year old son has had tubes twice. The second pair just fell out and he got an ear infection. Within 2 minutes of using the drops, he was asleep. These are a must for every mom's medicine cabinet! Whenever one of my children have an ear infection and are prescribed an antibiotic, I ask for a prescription of this too and keep them for all my children in case I need them in the middle of the night!
Earache	NoneIknowof, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	1/22/2010 7:25:36 PM	Using this medication on my 8 month old son, as he's had a bad run with an ear infection (or multiple) over the past month.  I only give it to him at the beginning when the ear drum is really bulging and painful, and it's been a total godsend.  I will NEVER be without it in the medicine cabinet as long as I have children under my roof!!
Earache	mrswilc, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	35-44	1/11/2010 5:27:19 PM	I have been using this for about 3 days.The pain seems to be getting worse.Plus it said to hold bottle in hand to warm,it does not warm it.Its as cold as ever.

Earache	MS Children, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	12/7/2009 11:40:48 PM	I have children who are ages 5,4,3, and 6 mo. I have used this on my older children when we couldnt get into the ER because it was swamped or I have used it in the instants when I couldnt get into the DR for a few days. For my 5 yr old it worked wonders she was relieved for a while. As for my 4 yr old it worked wonders as well. I am currently using it till I can get into the DR for my son who is 3 he is fast asleep after using this medicine. I would highly recommend this to my family and friends when my kids have severe ear infections I usually get an antibiotic and some of this to help with the pain associated with some Tylenol to bring down the fever. I would say that the side effects dont out weigh the benefits/reaction I have had. I wish anyone the best of luck with this medicine its always worth a shot no matter how many bad reviews it might or might not get. Good luck to you and your family with this drug!

After using it 3 times, I have found that it works very fast, but the relief does not last long.

When my body rejected the metal pieces then I had incredible pain until they could remove them.  I started on the drops and within an hour I felt much better.
Earache	alsnap01, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	7/12/2008 5:26:48 AM	I have had numerous ear problems over the years, but the ear infection I currently have seems to be causing more pain than any I can ever remember. This drug has not seemed to help the pain at all, and if it possibly has, it has not been for more than a few seconds. Ear aches are tricky to treat, but I have found that rotating heat and cold compresses seem to help the pain more than anything.
Earache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/21/2007 12:02:41 PM	My daughter had a run of ear infections and we NEVER treated her with antibiotics.  Instead, we treated the pain with the drops - which stopped her crying within 5-10 minutes - and the infection resolved on its own.  I HIGHLY recommend using the ear drops!
