The insertion was extremely painful and I will spare the details of that ordeal. BUT, I will explain the months after. I was on BCPs for about 6 years off and on (I'm 25 now) and was tired of having to swtich pills because of side effects. So I chose to go with the copper IUD. My periods before BCPs were usually sporadic, heavy, long and crampy. On the BCPs it calmed down drastically. With the IUD, my periods aren't out of control like before but I have the most gross discharge at times. When I'm not on my period, I have to always use a pantyliner because of the thick discharge that I almost always get. This occured for the first 5 1/2 months. It wasn't until last month that the spotting/discharge relaxed a bit. I just had my period and I'm waiting to see if the spotting/discharge will start back up, so far so good.I'm hoping that this is the end of it. I can handle heavy periods but not the everyday spotting/discharge thing that has been occuring. Absolutely not.All in all, I don't regret it.Sorry for the TMI. :-)

I am 22 and I have never had children. I wont lie the insertion process hurts, really bad. I had even taken an old vicodin and that didnt seem to help much.. or it did and it was just that painful!But pain aside, it is 100% worth it.For the first 4 months my periods were about 9 days, with aprox. 5 days of heavy bleeding and the other 4 were moderate spotting. The cramps were intolerable... so bad I would take Benadryl to just make myself sleep though it. But now I take vitamin E in the morning and 2 Advil twice a day, two days before my period all the way until 2 days into my period and it has been great since then!It really is such a convenient form of birth control and the fact that it is no hormones is just amazing!
Other	Pleasantly surprised!, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	35-44	8/31/2012 3:15:18 PM	I am 43 and I had a ob/gyn dr with excellent reviews on healthgrades.com remove my Mirena and insert the Paragard. After hearing about my horrible experience with the Mirena insertion (cold sweats in the parking lot w/LOTS of pain even after taking an rx to dialate before insertion), this dr was very considerate. She sprayed my cervix with benzocaine which felt like putting a jalepeno down there, but tolerable. She then injected me with Lidocaine to numb it. I felt slight cramping, but tolerable. The first month, I had spotting for an entire week before my cycle. Then my cycle was really, really heavy...for 7 days straight(used to be 3 heavy 2 light days). Cramps were bad during the first 2 days. The 2nd month was spotting a week before my cycle, then 7 days full days but lighter than the previous month. 3rd month, spotting only 3 days before and lighter, shorter cycles. Seems to improve with each month. No headaches, no melasma, and no moodiness as with Mirena :) I did notice some acne start up during the first month, but washing my face thoroughly before bedtime and using gentle facial cleanser each morning seems to have helped.

I have never had children so I was worried about the &quot;intense&quot; pain that may come with getting my Paraguard.  I talked to my doctor she prescribed medication to soften my cervix, valium to relax me and 800mg Ibuprofen to take prior to the procedure. Was it comfortable? No, but it was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  It took about 5 minutes total and I felt 3 sharp twinges the entire time.  When I was done I had some moderate cramping but walked right of the office.  I went home put  on a heating bad and slept for a couple of hours.  For the next 4 days had some crazy discharge and spotting with cramps off and on but they weren't anything a couple of Advil didn't take care of.  It's been a week and I can say I feel 100% back to normal.  I will update my review once I experience my first period.  
Other	101rider, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/26/2012 10:40:04 AM	I have been very impressed so far with my Paragard!!! I have read so many horror stories about it that I was completely freaked out on the day of insertion. I'm a relatively tough girl...I ride motocross, run races, and work out at the gym often. The reason I'm telling you this is because even though I'm pretty tough, the insertion may have been the most painful thing I've ever felt in my life. Once it was over, I went shopping though...so the pain subsides. I had on and off cramping for two days then it was done! My period was heavier than normal...but, considering mine was typically too light to even use a tampon I was okay with that. It was still very light and didn't last longer than it typically would. I pulled off the pill before I got the Paragard and have had more trouble coming off the pill than dealing with the Paragard! I didn't realize how much birth control pills negatively affected my health! I have been showing visible more muscle since quitting the pill and have more energy! Woo-hoo!    Paragard is just awesome for me! Yes, the insertion was pretty rough, but for ten years of worry-free birth control...I'll take that pain again! Take not you may have a bit of spotting the first month. Mine was exceptionally light and a pantyliner was all I needed, if that. My opinion is that everyone will react different to it. It all depends on you.    I guess I sold mention that I have never had any children!!! This may be why my insertion hurt quite a bit! LOL, but I haven't had any problems since, I LOVE my Paragard! NO HORMONES, NO WORRIES, NO side-effects of the pill! 
Other	Followyourbliss, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	19-24	8/20/2012 7:53:12 PM	I had Paragard inserted only a few months ago. I have had sucess with it thus far. Only occassional spotting, but yes, much heavier bleeding and cramping during cycles.I must admit, having it inserted was one of the most painful experiences I have ever had. I suffered extreme cramping while having my uterus opened, having the length measured, and actual insurtion almost sent me flying off the table. Once inserted, I felt extremely nauseous, began shaking, had intense cold sweats and was unable to get up for about 15 minutes due to my intense cramps. I suffered intense cramps and nausea the remainder of the day. My doctor told me some women react as strongly as me because your body identifies the IUD as an &quot;intrusion&quot;. I have to say, it was worth the pain. I had been on the pill for three years and my libido was non- existent. I also sufferd strong mood swings. It is wonderful not dealing with the side effects of synthetic hormones. If you can, I suggest going without hormone based birth control. The lost sex drive and roller coaster mood swings are so not worth it!

I will never use this again. I ended up in the hospital and had surgery to get it out. I hope no one ever has to experience the pain of an ectopic pregnancy and bills that go with it.
Other	Jaystars4, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/10/2012 3:46:07 PM	&quot;this too shall pass&quot; that's the montra you need to say while having the paragard inserted. does it hurt, umm, yes, BUT it is over so fast that it SO WORTH IT!!!! I went to my primary doc and he wrote me a prescription for Valum &amp; Vicodin, and i took these before the procedure. And it helped me to relax and it helped the cramping afterwards. I recommend doing it on your period. I bleed after, but it could have just been my period blood. I feel great! There was slight cramping for about 3 days afterwards, but now... nothing!!! I was very nervous and read the reviews on this site before hand, and after having it done I wanted to share my wonderful experience!!! I have had 2 LEEP procdeures done, and thats why i was very nervous to have this because those hurt so bad, but in the end, the LEEP was much more painful then the Paragard. Just remember, &quot;this too shall pass&quot; say it again and again as you lay there during the procedure which only takes like 2 mins of pain. IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/10/2012 12:58:01 AM	I would recommend going the day after your period because my doctor said the cramping is a lot better that day. My husband and I were very torn as to what to do because of some of these reviews but I went for it anyway. I am very thankful we made the choice. It was only like two small cramping sessions during the insert and my doctor told me before they happened. I would totally recommend this to any female that has the chance of getting pregnant.

However, I don't think my IUD was placed correctly and I experienced extreme pain for two years. I also had spotting between periods and periods that lasted at least 14 days. (My first period on this bc was 21 days and my shortest period lasted about 10 days.) l just had it removed and my doctor put me on Loestin 24 Fe. Overall, for some women this will be an amazingly simple form of bc, but for me, it was a lesson in medical self-advocacy. 
Other	QuanYinT, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	7/24/2012 7:13:46 PM	I'm 26 and had Paragard inserted about 3 years ago. Insertion was uncomfortable but not too painful. In the first 6 months my periods had gone from 4 days and light flow pre-paragard to 7-8 days long with 3 days of soaking through tampons every 30 minutes. Over the 3 year period, I've noticed that I'm generally foggier and not thinking clearly, frequently depressed, chronically fatigued, having trouble losing weight despite running an average of 20 miles a week plus eating a mostly organic, plant-based diet, have developed bad acne and my hair is thinning (to the point of having to style it differently so my scalp won't show). Any time I get check-ups or blood work, doctors say I'm in excellent shape. I started reading forums and more and more women are speaking out about paragard being linked to these effects. Although pharmaceutical companies would like us to believe that the copper in paragard is too negligible to be toxic, I feel that perhaps combined with my vegetarian diet it's possibly depleted my zinc levels and could be creating a thyroid condition. I had the paragard removed today and will just use condoms for the next several months to see if my body regains a sense of normalcy, and if not, my doctor will be running more thorough tests on my thyroid.  I will try to review again in the next couple months to update everyone. 
Other	Mas582, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/24/2012 5:45:30 PM	I want to start by saying I did extensive research prior to getting the paragard iud 1 1/2 months ago.  Like most I was nervous about getting it because of all of the negative reviews but I am so glad I opted to get it. A little about me...I had never been on bc until after having my daughter 17 months ago but after she was born I thought it was neccesary my dr prescribed byaz which was fine until about 3 months ago when I realized that it could possibly be the cause of my mood swings and not being able to loose weight despit my continuous efforts Working out 8-9 hrs wk and eating no more than 1300 cal day.  Long story short I got off bc -2 wks later at apt to get iud they weighed me and I had gained 8 pounds in 2 wks!  They said the reason could be because byaz has a Insertion- was on last day of period took 600 mg of ib and felt a little poke and slight pain but it was fine nothing bad at al!  I fact right after I went to the gym did 60 min or running and 45 min of weights no pain! Days to follow-for about a wk after insertion I was extremely bloated Iim not sure why but I was eventually it went down after really watching salt intake.  I'm happy to say that I now have lost the 8 pounds of water weight and look forward to losing an additional 5 pounds left from bc. Period- I didn't get my period until 6 wks afterso about 2 wks late for some reason?  This made me nervous but I did finally get it and it isn't much heavier than before I started bc lasted about 5 days. String-can't locate string but dr says its normal. All in all I love it!  I wanted to share my positive experience in hopes it helps others. 
Other	vspangie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/20/2012 8:09:09 PM	I had two Mirena IUD's and loved the first one and after having the second inserted I immediately began gaining weight, having more headaches and overall felt like I had permanent PMS.  I debated and had it removed and began to feel better but didn't want to use hormones because of the above effects. (I am 41 with 2 kids 7 and 9)  I talked at length with my Dr who had used Paragard and Mirena, she is close to my age and is noticing same problems.  After discussing possible bleeding problems she decided Paragard was worth a shot.  Insertion was more difficult than the two Mirena's, I think it is because of the time since childbirth, but overall it wasn't too terrible.  I spotted for a few days after insertion, then about a week later I had what was a two week period (moderate but not overly heavy)  now I have not been bleeding for the past three weeks and I feel very good.  I think the Mirena hormones began effecting us differently as we age, but am glad I tried the Paragard.

I heard that it might be painful, but it wasn't too painful to bare. I cramped all the next day, and that was rough. I only cramped every so often on day two, and by day three all was well. I am very happy with my IUD and am very excited about not having to deal with horomones and side effects from birth control pills.

The insertion does hurt - not going to lie about that. But it is worth it to have the peace of mind that it brings. At first, I had heavy bleeding and cramps but after that, it's been smooth sailing. Highly recommend this product.

But only lasted during the time my MW was down there. (5 minutes) she had to hold a gauze on my cervux fir about a minute because the bleeding was a little heavy. I had mild cramping for the  first 2 days then it drifted off. I did bleed more than spotting but less than a full blown period. I had sex and it wasnt painful and hubby didnt complain of the strings. Even though i can feel the string just by putting my finger at my opening. I guess they are long but didnt cause a problem. So far i am pleases. Hopefully my periods are tolerrable as ive heard they get intense

Have had relatively intense cramps but nothing a little ibuprofen can't handle. Spotting started the day after insertion and lasted two days of extremely light spotting and is down to a tiny bit every other day. Overall, improving rapidly. I was really worried about it and obsessively read these reviews but I think it will be great! Has made me and my boyfriend so spontaneous and it's been great! (I used to use a diaphragm And condom And spermicide... Lots of prep time.) paragard is great!
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/7/2012 7:25:52 PM	While nervous about getting one from some reviews I'd read, I decided to go for it.  The insertion did hurt a little.  I had taken motrin as dr instructed and it felt like a pinch in your stomach.  I did have cramping and bleeding for about a week, which led into my period.  But afterwards it's been fine. Having my next period was pretty usual, maybe a LITTLE heavier and a cramp here and there but nothing like what I'd been reading.  I had very mild periods before, so that may have helped.  I haven't had it long, but so far I'm satisfied with the ParaGard.
Other	35-44 Female 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/27/2012 12:17:56 PM	I have had paragard now for almost 6 months and have had a great experience with it.  I was worried due to some of the reviews I've read, but so glad I have gotten it!  My first two periods afterward where abnormal, more bleeding, more cramps, longer lasting, but now they have regulated.  I have had three children so insertation didn't bother me at all.  I did find that Vitiman E once per day helped regulate my period, make the bleeding, and cramping much better. Now I take vit E and Ibuprophen during my period I have a very normal 28 day cycle just as I did before.  I love, love, love the fact that I am worry free for the next 12 yrs! Super affordable effective birth control.

It only lasted a day though and wasn't a continual cramping, just here and there. My first period was horrible. It was heavier, lasted longer, and I went from hardly any cramps to now knowing why other women get so pissy during their period, because of the pain! My periods after that (it's been 4 months) have gotten easier. Not as heavy (still heavy though) and long and no more bad cramps again! They're still irregular- I went from every 28 days on the dot to 30 then 25 then 31. All in all, very happy with it. Hard in the beginning because your body is adjusting to the foreign object, but once your body gets used to it, it's a breeze!

I had read some reviews the night before so i was up for anything because it effects everyone different. It only too about ten minute to put it in, the worst part was the measuring of the uterus, but it was only 30 sec of pain. After it was over I felt fine, then about 10 min after i started cramping and i had to work at 10:30 that morning and I am a waitress so i had to call someone in to work for me because the cramping was too bad I couldnt focus on work. So i had cramping all that day and the next day it was pretty much gone and i felt great! Had my first period it was a little heavier that usual but im use to heavy cramping and long periods so i didnt see a difference there. I am very happy with this method. 
Other	lexirae, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/18/2012 7:30:08 AM	I had heard terrible stories of insertion and pain and yes insertion was painful but was only bad for a few mins. I had bad pinching cramps the first day but by the second was absolutely fine! I was on my period when it was inserted and it did not affect my cycle. I have v heavy periods and painful cramps anyway so did not notice a lot of difference. V. Happy with it, I hated condoms as I couldn't go on any hormonal methods and this allows for the spontaneity that the pill offered. Very happy. One thing I must say though are to make sure your strings are cut quite short, mine were too long and caused some uncomfortable pinching it could also be felt by my partner.

My periods have become longer, going from 3-4 days, (at the beginning nine days!) to six to seven now. My boyfriend has felt it twice in the two years I have had it. Once it hurt him, but I went in and got my strings shortened and it has not happened since. Really happy about the money and worry I have saved myself. Also, I only had to pay for the insertion fee because I applied for a grant for women whose insurance doesn't cover it! 
Other	Coble Girls, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/13/2012 9:40:41 AM	I had this inserted Oct 2010, about 8 weeks after I had my second child.  I did take tylenol or motrin before having it done but it was still uncomfortable.  I was happy when it was over, the entire process took about 10-15 minutes.  I had some cramping and spotting for a few days after that.  What I hated and this may have been a response to the copper was that I had increase discharge for about four months.  I had read on another blog for this drug that this was normal so I stuck with it, but I literally had to wear panty liners ever day.  My period last about 9-10 days and it is heavier.  Also my cycles have always been irregular so I get a period about every 45 days.  The cramping and bleeding is very heavy for a few months.  Everyone is different and I also need to add that I was breastfeeding for the first year after I had this inserted.  I add this because I'm not sure how or if that had an effect on my body while taking this drug.  I must admit that now that I have been on it for almost two years, I am glad that I stuck it out.  I do go through more tampons and pads for about 2-3 days of my cycle but even this has gone done.  Previously I had 4-5 days of heavy heavy bleeding.  Best of luck to all who use this. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/9/2012 8:28:40 PM	My Paraguard has worked completely, is discreet, and obviously requires no maintenance once inserted. The only down side was the first insertion went horribly wrong, I almost fainted in the doctor's office from the pain and cramps, and spent over a week in bed as my body rebelled. And then two months later- it came loose and had to be removed. I had a new one put in THAT day and the insertion went 100% better (minimal pain, no after-cramping). I've had it for a year and half now. It does make your period a lot heavier. However, at about a year it got a little bit lighter. The cramps however, have redefined my pain scale. What used to be a 7 for me in pain is now like a 4. Without Aleve my cramps will research about a 6.5-7 for me. This means dropping to the floor and curling up crying/moaning/whimpering pain. 3 pills of Aleve bring them between 2 and 4. So discomfort, occasionally closing my eyes and breathing deeply but otherwise I can function just fine. I love that it will last 10 years. I'm not ever worrying about &quot;forgetting&quot; to take it, and it's hormone free - which also means no worrying about other medications interacting with it and making it ineffective. It is also worth mentioning that it did make my acne terrible for a while there- so much so that I had to get ProActive and change over to the &quot;extra strength&quot; version of the product- but at about a year, that too, has diminished. I would recommend it to people- but only if they know they're going to have to commit to high doses of OTC painkillers 8-9 days a month (the PMS cramps are just as bad) and potentially a change in their beauty regime to keep their face clear.

Everyone's body is different and what do you have to lose? The Paragard website has 150 day trial period and if you aren't happy with it you can have it removed and they will refund you. My personal experience has been great!! My first period after I had it inserted was heavier than usual and a lot of cramping, but I've had it for 3 month's now and my periods have actually gotten lighter than they were before I had Paragard! I love not having anything to worry about. I am 32 years old and have one son who is 10. My boyfriend has 2 children and we are both certain we don't want anymore children so this is perfect for us. I highly recommend it against anything with hormones. I was on the pill most of my adult life and even I the lowest dose of hormone I didn't do well with it. It feels great to be hormone free with no worries of pregnancy!

It was fairly painful to have put in and I had bad cramping for a few days afterward. My periods were also very, VERY heavy for 4 months, but have become less heavy the last two. I switched to Paragard because I was tired of taking birth control every day and, frankly, I think I made a good choice for birth control. It's convenient and it works.

Doctor's almost gave up. Extreme pain first day. A month later I still have cramps. Spotted during month. First period, was longer but cramps not unbearable (w/advil). Throughout month discharge. Avoided gym because of cramps. Went today and now cramps are like the insertion day and I am bleeding again. Have 1 month checkup in 2 days. Will see how it goes. Do not want children, so this hopefully works out as a beneficial form of birth control for me.

Insertion was uncomfortable but not as bad as expected. I had it inserted when i was on my period so i guess thats what made it easier. I bled for a couple days afer insertion and then it stopped. I got my period about a month later and had it for two weeks but the bleeding was normal. Then I got my &quot;period&quot; again 2 weeks later and have been bleeding ever since, so about 6 months now. I had it checked and it was in the right spot and even had a test done to check for infections, guess i had one so i was prescribed medication. After i started taking it I had noticed a lightening in the bleeding and thought&quot; thats what it was, an infection&quot;. NOT! After the meds were done the bleeding went back to normal. I finally had it removed yesterday and I've completely stopped bleeding. So obviously I didnt have any luck with the IUD. Its truly the best birth control I know and i wasnt that lucky of benefit from it for 10 yrs. I had the Mirena IUD with my first daughter and I had the same exact problem, my OB/GYB said that my body didnt accept it since it is a foreign body and Its most likely to happen again in the future. He was so righT! Me and my husband are happy there is no more bleeding for the time being. It feels good to not have to worry about tampons or pads. Well I hope this information helped atleast 1 person, then my job is done. :) I WAS ONE OF THE UNFORTUNATE ONES THAT HAD TO GO THROUGH THIS. NOT EVERYONE WILL EXPERIENCE WHAT I DID. LIKE THEY SAY, EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT. IT CANT HURT TO TRY IT.

Other	sjmommy408, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	5/29/2012 3:03:27 PM	I've had paragard in for almost two months now and I love it. I was skeptical after reading the reviews and almost decided not to have it put in. The initial bleeding was heavy but after the 5 days, there was no bleeding at all. There's been no break through bleeding like I expected and so far I still have not had a second period. My only complaint is I've been bloated a day here and there. I'm not sure if it's due to paragard or not but other than that, I'm very happy with it. By the way, I'm 35 with 4 children. Not sure if age makes a difference, I just thought I'd include that. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	25-34	5/28/2012 10:22:50 PM	I had the Paragard put in 7 days ago. The Dr told me that if you have had children the insertion is much easier. Not so for me. We almost stopped midway but I decided to finish it. It made me dizzy and nauseous and was really painful for me. I didn't have any Advil or anything beforehand and fyi pap smears hurt me too so I am sensitive. It took about 5 or 10 minutes to do and the rest of the day I was extremely tired and cramping a lot. Today (7 days later) is the first day I haven't taken Advil and the cramping is almost gone. I have been bleeding a lot though every day and today it is like a normal period for me, which is a massive improvement. So the initial pain for me was bad but it is getting better every day. I am hoping and expecting the pain and cramping to stop, but if it doesn't, I will take it out.   
Other	SCN1985, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/28/2012 12:09:57 AM	After doing a great deal of research on the paragard, I decided to speak with my gyn about it.  My doctor agreed the paragard could be a good form of birth control for my husband and I so I scheduled my insertion on April 19, 2012, when I would be on my period.  I have never been pregnant, so I went in expecting the worst.  I took 800 mg. of ibuprofin about an 1 1/2 hours before I saw the doctor.  I won't lie - insertion was severly uncomfortable and it felt like my uterus was on fire when she used the sounding tool and when the iud was inserted.  But as soon as the insertion was over, I felt 100% back to normal.  In the next month, I had bleeding and cramping that would come on at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon and would subside in the evening before I went to bed.  At about 4 weeks after insertion, my doctor did an ultrasound to make sure the paragard was still in place (which it was) and later that week, I got my first period while using the iud (although I had continued to use bc pills until the ultrasound check as my doctor advised me).  I did experience more bleeding than usual and more cramping, however ibuprofin helped that a lot.  And thankfully, after my period, I've had no more random bleeding and cramping.  I can't even feel the paragard is there, except for when I check for the strings.  Although using the paragard started out kind of rough, I'm pretty satisfied considering I will have up to 10 years of hormone free birth control and I would definitely recommend that any woman who is interested in an iud speak with her gyn about it.

Other	TJN, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/24/2012 4:59:42 PM	Eleven months in, and overall Paragard has been perfect for me. Yes (as my previous reviews outline), the insertion was horrifically painful and my periods are heavier and about twice as long (10-14 days each). I also was bleeding to the extent of thinking I was getting two &quot;periods&quot; a month, but my doctor found that I was producing too much of some bacteria that the uterus normally produces in response to the IUD. Not an infection, but it &quot;just didn't like the foreign object&quot; is how she put it. After some antibiotics, the &quot;double periods&quot; have subsided, but the one I get every 24-29 days is still about 14 days long, bookmarked by a few days of spotting each time. Obviously, that has taken its toll on our sex life, but my libido is much higher than it was on the pill or NuvaRing. The cramps have not been too severe (far better than when I was on no BC at all, but worse than with the pill). My husband and I planned to have it removed after a year, so we're still on schedule with that, and it stayed in place thus far with no pregnancy. Although, my sister-in-love just found out she's pregnant, and she got the Paragard inserted a couple months after I did, at my suggestion. It was still in place and she was in the group of women eligible for and recommended to use this method. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	5/24/2012 4:38:33 PM	I have had the paragard IUD for approximately 2 months now.  I couldn't take any other kind of birth control because changes in hormone levels make my migraines horrible!  So the paragard is a non-hormonal option.  I'm 25 with no children.  The insertion was painful, but with some ibuprofen you'll live.  My doctor actually had a great explanation that most women getting paragard are switching from a different birth control and aren't used to regular periods.  So the cramping and bleeding with paragard isn't anything much more then a regular period but for women not used to that it seems like a lot.  Made sense to me! I have had some spotting but nothing a panty liner couldn't fix and now on my first full period, it is heavier with clots.  Maybe the size of a quarter or smaller and I probably have gone through maybe 4 regular tampons a day or 3-5 pads (I don't like feeling wet at all).  I believe that clots are just because of the mucus layer that the paragard makes (that's how it prevents pregnancy).  And clots should be expected if your period is heavier, they're caused by you bleeding faster.  I looked that up on webmd, they are completely normal.  Every menstrual cycle can be different depending on lots of things like diet, amount of water intake, weather changes (our bodies are hotter in the summer), stress levels etc...  Sex has been a little bit tricky since I worry about the IUD getting hit (which is silly)  but you do have to give it some time before any rough sex because it needs to settle in.  Also my husband says there is a lube like film on his member afterwards.   But overall I like it a lot!   
Other	Bluemoon, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	3		25-34	5/24/2012 9:17:24 AM	The insertion was the most painful moment of my life.  I don't mean to sound dramatic, but it was, however it only lasted a few minutes.  I had terrible cramping the first night but a heating bad helped some and I took a lot of meds to try and just sleep through it.  That only worked marginally.  The following days, I only had minimal cramping and some light spotting.  I haven't had my period yet, but hoping it will be tolerable.  Just wanted to give other women a heads up that the insertion is very painful, but brief.

But the copper T that is supposed to be effective for up to 10 years wasn't effective for 10 minutes for me. I just had a baby on December 23rd of last year &amp; had paragard inserted when I was still going through the 6 weeks of bleeding in which I did not have sex. After all that was over with my boyfriend &amp; I had sex &amp; I had 1 period in february &amp; that was it, so I called my ob &amp; asked what was up. They told me that it's normal &amp; that some women don't have a period for 6 months after having it inserted but they said I could go take a urinalysis at the hospital or buy a test. I went to the hospital &amp; got a call the next day that my test came back positive! I was already 7 weeks along! They took the iud out &amp; this baby is due December 20th of this year!!

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	5/19/2012 12:08:09 AM	I have read a lot of comments about how painful or how terrible it is. In all actuality, if your doc was being honest, they would have told you that all women will expierence it diffrently, and you may spot for a while, and your periods might get heavier, accompanied with more severe cramping. I am a user of paraguard, and yes, I expierenced all that those side effects for the first 12 long months. After that however, cramping stopped, periods were not as heavy or as long, and the in-between spotting went away. Yes, there can be inconvenient side effects, as there are with many other forms of birth control. It may sound harsh, but if you can, wait out the uncomfortable side effects. In my expierence, Paraguard has been wonderful, and I would highly recommend it.

I just wanted to say that because alot of people said it was painful but not too bad. Others said they felt nothing. However, don't let it scare you because it feels like childbirth for a few mins instead of real childbirth for hours or even days and then having to raise a child you aren't ready for! Its only been a day but the pain is gone and I hope its as awesome as everyone says :)
Other	searching, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/18/2012 7:57:37 PM	I have tried over 5 different forms of the pill, all of which have been recalled (just my luck?? haha) but I gained 30 lbs and was extremely depressed on the pill. I went off of the pill and was healthy and &quot;extra hormone&quot; free for AT LEAST 8 months. I finally lost all of the weight and was the happy 19/20 year old that I usually am. I have had no kids, but wanted to make sure that I was protected from pregnancies with my boyfriend. I researched paragard for MONTHS. I read the reviews and almost scared myself out of the appointment. I went through anyways and went in to get the procedure and the IUD inserted... I fainted twice. Starting off I have NEVER had menstrual cramps (collegiate D1 athlete) and rarely got my period. I don't know any pain when that time of the month comes around- so the insertion blind sighted me. I took 4 advil 30 minutes before.. I could taken the whole bottle-probably should have. I curled in the fetal position for about an hour in the room, and FINALLY felt well enough to stand up. I had my mom drive me home (THANK GOODNESS she was there). I had contraction like cramps all throughout the day and night. HOwever, I will say when I went to practice for the day I felt 100% better. I spotted for the next three days... but had close to zero or 10% of the pain I had experienced the first day. Safe to say not looking forward to childbirth without the drugs-my hips are little and my uterus doesn't like that much trauma haha! I haven't felt for the strings but have had it for two weeks now. No cramps, no spotting, but slight bloating around my abdominal area. I noticed over the past three days an increase in appetite but Im struggling with some other issues with nutrition, so that has nothing to do with the IUD to my knowledge. My boyfriend and I had sex 4 days after, and he noticed nothing so woo! I would say use a condom for a couple weeks after just to prevent any type of infection esp when PID CAN HAPPEN. Other than that love it-update soon!

Then the day before getting it placed I freaked myself out by reading the reviews on line. The actual placement was no big deal at all, took minutes, minor cramping afterwards.  I got it placed during the third day of my period. Now with my first period after placement, it is only slightly heavier, cramping is heavier but not unbearable.  I had no spotting between the two periods.  I go for follow up in two weeks so hopefully it's still in place ok. Oh and if this helps anyone I've had two children.

I have never given birth before so I was very nervous for the insertion process, but overall it was manageable...I had intense pain for about 5 minutes (labor contractions), felt lightheaded for 20 mins, and then cramped for about a day.Since then I have had no cramping, even through my period (which was longer and heavier but not too bad) and no side effects. I am so happy! After years of horrible side effects with the pill, I have finally found something that works for me. I remember reading some of these bad reviews and almost not getting it put in, but I am so glad I did. Everybody's different but this really really works for me!

The insertion was not pleasant, I felt very uncomfortable. There was minor pain but I experienced dizziness (almost fainted) then threw up all immediately after the insertion. For the rest of the night I suffered cramps and back pain and was already thinking about having it removed. But the next couple days the cramps and back pain completely went away and I was feeling great and exciting to be off the hormones that had ruined my life for bout a year. I have so much more energy, no mood swings, and no side effects. I was pleasantly surprised when I had my first period with the iud about a week ago. The first day I bleed a lot&amp;cra,ps  the second day about half as much and the third day I was barley spotting. Over all a very manageable period! So far I am very pleased with this birth control :) would highly recommend to anyone who does not like hormonal birth control

I was thinking how great it was going to be that there are no hormones and nothing to make my period all crazy since there were no hormones. I listened to my doctor saying that it's a great BC as many women have not given a bad feedback. Well, I'm one of the few I guess because my experience has been horrible.For 2 months I have freaked out thinking I was pregnant from not having a period. I took many tests all came back negative. Then my back started hurting really bad a week after the IUD was placed in me. So bad that when I lay down I stop breathing for a second because it feels like someone is crushing me and stabbing me at the same time in my back. And I finally got my period and this is worst than bleeding after child birth. I'm on my 11th day of bleeding and going through a tampon every hour to two hours while wearing a pad. The pad will collect blood. After I gave birth, around the 10th day I was spotting and not filling up a pad by the time it needed changing. This is AWFUL!! My cramps are horrible too but the back pain, I can't even lay down without being in pain. It's constant pain! I'm getting this taken out next week! I wouldn't even tell my worst enemy to get this.No side effects my butt! 
Other	KItaliano, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	4	Female	19-24	5/8/2012 5:12:07 PM	1 week and 1 day ago I had the Paragard inserted. (Wrote about insertion process in previous statement). For about 3-4 days afterwards I was at a sit down. I didn't want to go anywhere or do anything. I constantly was on Tylenol, 2-3 at a time for the pain. The cramps would come and go. But they were way way way worse than after insertion. I was starting to think maybe my body had rejected it. Friday, I had to work, so I took have a Lortab to ease the pain, and get me through 8 hours of wedding catering. Saturday, I was in no pain at all. I worked another 12 hours at 2 jobs and was fine with nothing. Once I got home, I showered, and felt for the strings inside. Feels like toothbrush wire. I was told to have intercourse with fiance after 1 week of insertion. He was a little bit nervous. Still is to this day. To go all the way up inside. He says he can feel strings sometimes in only certain positions. He says it doesn't hurt, just awkward. but that's okay. The strings can be cut to fit partners pleasure as well. 6 weeks I'll get them cut. Today, I have very mild cramps, but due to intercourse last night. The cramps are due to the strings at the end of the Paragard maybe bumping into my cervix?? Has anyone had kinda the same healing process as me?? Is it normal to go a few days in pain for healing? Sometimes my cramps are bad, I don't want to move, but when my fiance stretches me, it all goes away. Stay hydrated! &lt;3
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/6/2012 12:58:20 PM	I just recently had this inserted. I was nervous about the procedure being painful, but it wasn't at all. My doctor said it's better to insert it when you are on your period because the cervix is already open. It just felt like cramps that went away almost immediately. I have two children already, so I'm happy this is non-hormonal and won't imbalance anything in my body. Definitely a good decision!
Other	ar729, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/4/2012 3:45:51 PM	I was very nervous after reading such mixed reviews about the insertion of the paragard iud. I have never had children before so I prepared myself for the worse. I was given 200mg of misoprostol vaginally the night before and took 800mg of advil one hour before the procedure. I felt two big cramps (exactly like a bad period cramp...i think ive even felt worse cramps at times during my period) It was over and done quick, the cramping subsided quickly. I read reviews of woman saying it felt like someone was stabbing them inside...its not even close to that type of pain. My doctor has been preforming this procedure for years and on a daily basis. I believe everyone will have a different experience because every body is different. My recommendations would be to opt for the misoprostol to dilate the night before and take advil an hour before, focus on your breathing through out the prodecure and you should be fine. It was literally a piece of cake and I have been shopping and cleaning my house all day with mild period like cramps. So excited to never have to worry about synthetic hormones again!!
Other	Evie1234, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	5/4/2012 9:56:18 AM	Insertion was painful for me (I've never had a child, but it was more painful than all 8 of my tattoos put together) and I had severe cramps for a solid five days afterward. My first period with it was much heavier than mine normally are, and I did have significant cramping, but only on one day. All around though, I prefer this method to any other method I've tried (numerous types of the pill and implanon, which I would NEVER recommend). I love that it is hormone free! Birth control always made me break out horribly and for the first time in 7 years I have completely clear skin, no migrane headaches, and I don't have to worry about weight gain or pregnancy AT ALL! So, I would highly recommend Paragard. Five days of pain (I had to take a lot of Motrin and use a heating pad for cramps) is definitely worth ten years of protection against pregnancy.One thing to consider is that iuds are recommended mostly for women in secure relationships because it can make it easier to contract stds. This is fine for me and my fianc&#233; but a few years ago Paragard would not have been a good option for me.

Other	Lizzie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	5/1/2012 3:27:33 PM	I have never been pregnant and don't want to be for a good long time, but I really didn't like how hormonal birth control affected me, so I decided to try the paragard. I'd heard all the horror stories before, and being quite tiny I went to my appointment prepared; 800mg of motrin and a valium, which helped immensely with the insertion. The procedure only took a few seconds and didn't hurt much worse than a bad period cramp, and I had some cramping and spotting for about 2 weeks afterwards. However, it was nothing crippling, and I was back to jogging and yoga within about three days.My periods have always been extremely light (a thin pad a day at my heaviest, lasting about 4 days) and I have noticed a change in flow, perhaps 20 percent more (up to a small tampon every 6 hours, lasting 5-6 days). Cramps are pretty mild and it's never interrupted my lifestyle; in fact, I would say they were worse before insertion.All in all, I like it fine. No pills every day, no hormones and all their side effects, and best of all, no condoms. I don't know if I would recommend it to someone with very heavy and/or painful periods, and as for insertion, definitely go prepared with painkillers and, if possible, a prescribed tranquilizer. It made it a thousand times easier. All in all, hassle-free and extremely effective.

I decided that I wanted a birth control that didn't contain hormones. I read many, many reviews of the medication and frankly, I was really nervous. The reviews that I read on here were nothing like I experienced. When I got Paragard inserted, it was a quick doctor visit. I was in and out within 15 minutes. I took an Advil ahead of time and was warned that it might hurt afterward. I had a little bit of cramping afterward but nothing really serious. I took another Advil later in the day and I was fine. I got it in November and it is now April. I have had no problems whatsoever with this. It has been by far the easiest birth control I have ever used. Once I had gotten the hormones out of my system from the Nuvaring, I felt like a whole new person. My periods have been slightly heavier and maybe a day or two longer than before. The periods are just uncomfortable enough to need a Midol a day.

The insertion was painful and I've had two children. Luckily my OB had had this inserted and used a numbing agent to try and ease my pain. It caused me to have a period from the time it was inserted. Light crampin. I've had heavy periods since then but nothing huge. My libido kicked into high gear after insertion so I'm convinced Paragard itself has had no effect on that. Over all a good birth controll method. However, the insertion hurts so if you have a low pain tolerance I recommend you think about it before deciding on this method.

The insertion process itself wasn't as bad i had assumed it would be. I have had much heavier periods but my cramping hasnt been bad at all. I chose to use the non hormonal iud because of a blood clothing disorder which if i had the additional hormones would put me at risk of a stroke. So i think its great and much easier then remembering a pill everyday.
Other	DeeBee, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	19-24	4/22/2012 9:42:38 AM	I had para guard put in 08/01/2012. That process was quite painful because I've never had children and the doctor was surprised at how tight my cervix was and kept poking at it to put it in. I would advise taking some strong medicine before you get it inserted. Cramps afterwards were pretty bad but the 800mg ibuprofen I was given helped. Since then, I've had very heavy periods (which was never the case before) I have had to wear a tampon and a pad on the first 2 days of my period and those will have to be changed within 2 hours or less. I cramp much more than I used to when I'm on my period. It was worse in the beginning but has lightened up to manageable. I was told those could be side effects so I can't be upset. One thing that I didn't expect is a change in labito. Unfortunatly it's way down :( this is surprising to me since there are no hormones. I'm not 100% sure if the IUD is to blame for my drop in labito but it started right when I got the IUD so...you can draw your own conclusion. Other than that, it is doing its job. My husband and I don't use any other form of contraception and I am not pregnant so in the end, I guess it's mainly worth it.  
Other	Elle1234, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	4/20/2012 10:26:42 PM	My paraguard iud was inserted on 4/19/13. The actual process not very painful, an intense cramp for maybe 2 min. I have also never had children. Hormonal birth control has always given me horrible side effects such as depression when I'm not a depressed person at all. I've had intense cramps and bloating since yesterdays insertion. Can anyone give me hope as to how long this will last? I just assumed major s/e such as bloating wouldn't be present with a non hormonal birth control. However, realize it was just placed.

Not even one week has gone by and it has proven ineffective.  I did major research into non-hormonal birth control and am very sad that this was my experience. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	4/20/2012 5:55:19 PM	I got the Paragard put in on 4/19.  The insertion process was very painful, but was attributed to the fact that I have never had children and that my cervix was more curved than normal.  I did not take any medication before, and had not been advised to so I would advise you to do so.  I took 800 MG Ibuprofen afterwards which did help with cramping.  I was able to go to work after the procedure.  I have had mild, dull cramping and moderate spotting since then with the spotting seeming to be heavier on day two. I have not taken any additional ibuprofen so far.  I took hormonal birth control pills for 9 years.  I ended up get adenomas (tumors) on my liver from the hormonal pills which is why I had to choose a different birth control method.  I will write another review in another couple of weeks.  According to the dr they said I should experience heavier periods for the first few months.  I hope it is not too bad because I am getting married in a month.

After reading many horrifying reviews, I was a little nervous about what to expect. I went through with it anyway, and I'm so glad I did! The pain is nothing, I don't know what everyone was talking about. I just closed my eyes and focused on breathing in and out. It felt like a bad menstrual cramps. Not *severe*, just bad. The whole process took less than ten minutes. I've had very little spotting since it was inserted, and most of it has stopped now. Also, let me add, I'm only 19 and have never been pregnant. I am so excited that I don't have to remember a pill everyday anymore! Don't let the bad reviews scare you!

I got this put in  and from the moment the dr put it in I was in tears. I have a high pain tolerance and this was the worse pain I have gone through, worse then labor pains! My periods become worse too, I would bleed through a tampon and pad in a 35-40 min time span. Finally after 4 months of pain I had it removed. For anyone thinking of getting this, think again!! I wish I would of never wasted my money, time and body for this 
Other	hope this helps, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	3	Female	25-34	4/18/2012 10:26:58 PM	I had the Paragard inserted on 3/27/12. On that day I experienced severe pain and some spotting. The next day I had heavy bleeding as well as cramping similar to contractions that would last for a few minutes and reoccure throughout the day. I went to a follow up appointment 2 weeks later to assure that the Paragard was properly positioned. I experienced continuos heavy bleeding from 3/28/12 to 4/17/12. Today is 4/18/12 and I am finally getting back to normal. Some of the side effects that I seem to be having is dryness/unable to have an orgasim during intercourse, and numbness during intercourse. I am going to give my body some more time to adapt to the changes. If I am still experiencing these symptoms then I will have the Paragard removed. Everyone's body is different,as well as their pain tolerance. Overall, my personal opinion is that it will be worth all of the discomfort so long as the intimate side effects diminish.

The next 48 hours after insertion were painful i felt like i was having contractions only spotting though...now past few days ive had cramps in the morning when i wake up..hoping that this stops soon or ill have to call my dr... motrin 800s seem to only help some. and i havent had a bowel movement yet i tried to go twice and starting cramping really bad and spotting...i can say the heating pad is my friend and hopefully these cramps go  away soon.
Other	bvw76, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/14/2012 9:16:03 AM	I had Paragard inserted 3/16/12.  I wrote a review on that day and now I'm writing a review since I've had my first menstrual cycle after insertion.  My cycle is usually 2-3 days and after insertion my cycle was 3-4 days which is not bad.  I had absolutely NO cramps.  The bleeding was slightly heavier, not enough to get the IUD out.  Having a 2 day cycle I had one light day and one heavy day anyway.  So I'd say this month I've had 2 heavy days.  Sometimes I can not feel my strings and sometimes I can.  Actually I have my partner check and sometimes he can not feel them with his fingers but occasionally during intercourse he feels them.  Since I've had it inserted he's felt it during intercourse twice. He says it feels like a pin prick.  All in all I am satisfied approximately one month later.  I'll write another review in a few months to keep you guys posted because if you're like me you've researched this thing for a long time and the reviews were very helpful for me. However everyone's experience is different and you won't really know if it works for you until you try it.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/12/2012 8:39:33 PM	I had read mixed reviews on Paragard but had heard good things from a personal friend.  The pill led to personal weightgain, a severe blow to my sex drive, and overall depression. So I switched to the no hormome Paragard.  Getting the implant was easy and only slightly painful. I went to planned parenthood and did not take advil before going. I was fine the day of and was sexually active that evening. Since getting the IUD I have been pain free, hormone free, and my periods are regular and not nearly as heavy as reviews said they would be. This is a fabulous device. It is so nice not to have to worry. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
Other	Kynli757, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/9/2012 7:35:40 AM	I had my Paraguard inserted on 04/06/12.  It is only 04/09/12 so I can't speak much about anything but the pain I experienced on insertion.  I would have to rate it as severe cramps.  I took a Vicodin about 30 minutes before insertion which may helped me out in the long run.  I had my Paraguard inserted at about 11:00 immediately after the cramping began.  I went to the 7-11 and got a cup of hot chocolate which did relieve some of the pain.  By 4:00 my cramps were gone and I have been fine ever since.  Good luck to anyone interested in getting Paraguard.  I haven't felt my strings I tried while I was in the shower but I was unsuccessful.  I will try again in a week or two.

I've also suffered since having the mirena inserted as reading many of your stories. My sex life was affected as well. Gladly, it has all returned. Although I suffered for 3 years.. for those whom feel the pain from the insertion, what I've learned was my uterus is tilted and the placement was wrong (Male Dr) left him directly after the placement of the Mirena (had infection next day, etc)became patient to the Nurse Practitioner (3 yrs now) whom explained my body in a new meaningful way. If you have concerns, have a sono done to ensure the placement is corrrect, etc. Good Luck
Other	lindalouaz, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/3/2012 1:08:34 PM	After trying the Mirena and not liking the hormones I decided to try the Paragard. I have to say I have never been happier! No hormones is a big deal to me as they cause my body to go out of wack. The insertion was painful but only for about a minute at most then went back to life as usual. Now I have had two periods and they were light and nothing horrible. I did take Motrin once at the beginning of the first period and that was it. I have NO side effects at all on the Paragard. The Mirana was a nightmare due to spoting all of the time, weight gain and constant breast tenderness. I say go for it, not having to worry about getting pregnant for 10 years, no hormones and side effects is wonderful!
Other	MorganLeigh10, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/25/2012 3:14:24 PM	I've had my Paragard for a little over a month now. I have never been able to handle any sort of birth control that contains hormones..they make me crazy, so this was one of my only options. My doctor had me come in on the third day of my period to insert it. The insertion is very uncomfortable-feels like extreme cramping. The insertion only takes a few minutes. After the insertion I had to go to work which was NO fun at all. I cramped all day and was miserable. I cramped for about 3 more days after insertion then it stopped and I have completely forgotten that I had it inserted in the first place. It is AWESOME not having to remember to take a pill and it's good for several years and contains NO hormones! You can't feel it and my husband says he can't feel it either. I just started my first period with it inserted and I did cramp a lot more and my period is a lot more heavy. Kind of a bummer but my doctor said this would happen for the first few months. If hormonal birth control isn't for you I definitely say switch to Paragard! I love my Paragard and am so thankful that someone came up with a non-hormonal birth control that you don't have to take everyday and is good for many years!
Other		4	3	3			3/22/2012 9:35:09 AM	I got this IUD on 3/19/12 and I found the insertion, though shortlived, to be incredibly painful. Probably the most painful experience of my life and I've passed kidney stones. The doctor had to dialate my cervix because even though I was spotting at the beginning of my period, my cervix wasn't very &quot;open.&quot; I had a vasovagal reaction and almost passed out and started sweating profusely and shaking. I definitely wasn't expecting it to be that bad. It's only been a couple of days but I've had constant cramps and severe bloating, I feel like my stomach is so distended right now I cannot suck it in at all. I also haven't gotten my period full on, just had some spotting which I'm guessing is because of this device. I will give this a couple of months but if the cramping and bloating persists, I think I will have it taken out. If the IUD does get expelled, I will not have it put back in because that pain was just so excruciating. I'm hoping and praying that my body settles down and gets used to this.

Having it inserted pain on a scale 1-10 ill give it a 7 1/2, yeah it hurted and alot of pressure. After it was in I immediately felt cramps, something i never get. Im hoping by tomorow the cramping &amp; discomfort stop. Also once i got home i checked to see if i could feel the two wires inside of me, but instead of me actually feeling them i could see them outside of my vagina, i will be making another trip to get that fixed. Make sure your doctor cut the wires short enough. My appt time was 11:45 am, its 5:17 pm &amp; im still cramping after even taking a Vicodin. Im praying it stops tmrw, so i can have sex again LOL.
Other	bvw76, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/16/2012 9:47:37 PM	The Paragard was inserted 3/16/12. I was very nervous because a different physician attempted to insert the Mirena about 5 years ago and was unable and that experience was horrific! I decided that I can not be on hormonal birth control due to the risks of pulmonary and cardiac problems and so the Paragard was my last hope, sort of, besides a diaphragm/spermicide which is too much work.  My insertion was MILDLY uncomfortable.  It was in no way like my first experience; possibly due to my new physician's experience with insertion.  He talked me through every step. From inserting the speculum, to measuring my cervix, to inserting Paragard took about 3 minutes TOTAL!! I am not exaggerating.  Again, I attribute that to my doctor's experience with insertion.  There was mild cramping.  I did take 400 mg of ibuprofen about 1 hour before insertion.  After insertion, I felt mild cramps and so took 400 mg ibuprofen about 3 hours later.  I went on with my day.  I had a lunch date, then I met my sister at the mall and later spent time with family friends.  I have been pregnant but have never given birth so my cervix/uterus is small.  I was told there is a higher rate of expulsion in my case.  I will come back in a few months to update.  But my overall opinion is that it is a great, non-hormonal birth control alternative.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	3	Female	19-24	3/16/2012 3:37:03 PM	Hello,I thought I would write about my experience with paragard. I got it put in two days ago. The first time I went to have it put in My Doctor ran into a problem Putting it in because of the way my cervix is tilted. I am 22 and never had a baby, so she said this was primarily my problem. She sent me home with meds to soften my cervix before she tried it again. I have to admit, insertion was very painful. The first time was painful, and  I think it was even worse the second time because I had taken  meds to make my cervix dialate and have additional cramps. Over all I have had moderate to bad cramping since insertion but all in all, if you can handle a bit of pain for a day or two, I think it is worth a try. As previous women have said, do not psych yourself out reading horrible reviews as I did,  it is a individual and different experience for every single woman.

However, I lost a lot of hair, started having all sorts of symptoms in the past 4 years that I thought were due to getting older and stress. This past year has been a nightmare with panic attacks, insomnia, allergies, blurred vision, dizziness, and a list of other symptoms much like those of hypothyroidism, which in fact is probably a cause since copper toxicity causes a depressed thyroid which is not good and also copper causes our body to produce more estrogen than normal therefore what many of us think is a hormone-free alternative is actually causing our bodies to get out of whack! I loved it for the first 5 years (although my string did go into my cervix a few years after insertion and I worried every month since I could no longer feel if it was in place). My advice is SAY NO TO THE IUD!!! If I had known that I was slowly going to poison my body to the point where I felt I was going crazy I would never have gotten it! I found all this out doing research on thyroid issues this past week. I am scheduled to have this thing removed on Friday and hope the damage is reversible.

The only good thing from it is that my periods are now regular &amp; I don't have to worry about taking a pill everyday. Downside is right before I start my period I get cramp like feelings on my right leg, it lasts about 15 min then goes away later comes back. At first I thought it was just cramping but tylenol or anything of that nature does not help. Even when I'm not on my period I randomly get cramps as if I was going to start, but don't. I'd like to get it removed but I don't have insurance or the money to. So I'm pretty much stuck with it until I get insurance or money. But if you're thinking about getting it make sure its the right one for you.
Other	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	19-24	3/7/2012 7:49:17 PM	I just got the Paragard inserted today but wanted to write a review while my memory of it was still good. I am also writing this review to let you all know about some possible &quot;complications&quot; of insertion that happened to me because of my particular anatomy.There were two abnormal things in my anatomy that caused insertion of the IUD to be difficult: a downward pointing cervix and a narrow cervix. I knew about the downward cervix before from paps but had no idea about the narrow cervix until today. She used an actual medical term for it but I can't remember it. These two things caused insertion to be more painful than it would have been otherwise.In order to work with the downward pointing cervix she had to use a tool to &quot;grasp&quot; it which from my understanding caused bleeding, and then she had to use other tools to dilate my cervix which was probably the most painful part. It was actually quite painful and my legs were shaking from the pain before the end... I think this sort of thing varies from person based on their anatomy and individual body, since I am normally very good with pain and have even had several tattoos and piercings in sensitive spots. She managed to get the paragard in fine in the end although in addition to being painful it also took longer than normal (I imagine) because of the extra steps, luckily I remembered to bring in some feminine hygiene products as I have spotted a bit since then. There was considerable blood from the procedure, even though when she was finished she used silver nitrate? or something with &quot;silver&quot; in the name to stop the bleeding.Since then I have had mild to moderate cramping, and that's with 600 mg of ibuprofen taken an hour before the procedure and once since then. I don't know how bad the cramping would be without the ibuprofen, and I don't want to find out.Anyway, hopefully my body adjusts to the object soon, and I hope I have provided enough information to help prepare people interested in getting Para

Before getting this form of birth control, I read tons of reviews.  Let me just say, the best review is when you actually try it yourself! Yes, it was slightly comfortable for about 30 seconds during the insertion but that is expected when having something inserted into your uterus. The only cons I have to say about the paragard is your period will last 10 days! and my period would come on late every month.. I guess due to how long my period was, it would extend to the next month. Also, the strings afe tricky to check. Overall, I was expecting to have horrible cramps and pain, due to the reviews I read, but I have yet to experience that. It might just be my body. I plan on keeping this for 2-3 years, But whatever choice you chose good luck;)

I got it 3 different times. The first time was before I had kids. The cramping was bad, and the periods were unbearable so I had it removed within 3 months. I was told it might not take well inserted before having children. So after having my first child years later, I got the Paragard again. It went great for some time. The periods were heavier, but for me it was worth it to have a reliable birth control that didn't involve hormones. When I weaned my child and started having periods again, I noticed a feeling of sharp pain in my vagina during my periods. I also got a bloated feeling between periods. I saw my GP, who said the strings were low but probably not a concern. However, that week I became pregnant. The IUD had dislodged and dropped to the bottom of my uterus, and the egg implanted at the top of my uterus. They removed the IUD and I had a healthy baby. After my &quot;IUD baby&quot; was born, I got the IUD AGAIN for the third time, inserted 4 months post-partum. I figured the IUD baby was a fluke. I had 3 ultrasounds over 3 months to ensure it was correctly placed. I had no problems at all and no discomfort for 6 months. Then I began cramping once in a while. Then cramps with radiating pain and a little nausea. I went in for a check-up with my OB and was told the strings were missing!! Hhad I been checking them myself as I should've, I would've known this). Next week I go in for an ultrasound and will have them remove the IUD from wherever it found a new home. I just don't think my body accepts the IUD. I'm of small stature and my babies were both small. I would recommend it to anyone else- when properly in place I never noticed it was there..

Pros include, that i've had it for 6 months now, and i havent gotten pregnant nor do i worry about it. Cons are that my periods occur every 21 days and last for 10 days, and of the 11 days inbetween i bleed alittle bit every single day. I got this BC so i could have worry free sex, unfortunately i rarely even have sex because it makes my bed look like a crime scene. I always bleed during and after sex as if i were having my period, then go back to spotting the next day or so. I also have alot of excess discharge thats white to clear in color and smells wierd. I've been to the dr and she says that everything is normal and will probably get better over time. I was terrified of insertion, but really it was not painful, no different than a routein exam. So now i'm at a point where the side effects are driving me crazy, but because my body doesnt tolerate artificial hormones, and i'm allergic to all rubbers, i'm kind of stuck with this or nothing, and using nothing scares me even more...

I just had it inserted today at my 6 week postpartum check up and did not feel a thing! No cramping, no pinching, NOTHING. Obviously, everyone's experience is different but mine was very pleasant. I was TERRIFIED to have this inserted after reading these posts and it turned out to be just fine. I now have very mild cramping (way less than a period) and some bleeding. I will update at a later time if there are any side effects. Just know not every experience has to be a bad one!

Did anyone know that? I'm 24 with no kids and went in on my period to have the copper IUD inserted.  I was so frightened and nervous about getting it put in after reading horrifying reviews that I asked on a whim if there was anything we could do to numb the area.  And she goes &quot;Oh yes, we can put a local anesthesia in your uterus if you'd like.&quot;  UM YES.  So it did hurt when she applied it, but once I was numbed, it was ok.  I did feel cramping through the anesthesia and it hurt, so I can't imagine doing it without it.  I feel like it would have really, really hurt.  So glad I did it though.The only problem with the anesthesia, and the gyno did warn me of this, was that you bleed a lot as it tries to get it out of its system.  And I bled a lot as it dispelled the anesthesia that it felt like I was basically peeing blood non-stop.  I went through a maxi strength pad in one hour.I also took 3 advil before going in so I was good for pain for about 3-4 hours.  It started to kick in and really hurt/cramp around 5 hours after the insertion of the copper IUD, but it wasn't awful.  I was ok without any more pain meds until I went to bed and took 3 advil again.So far today has been ok!  I woke up with no pain.  I took some advil with me just in case, but I haven't had to use it yet.  I'm not going to work out for a couple days, but I feel good enough to take a walk :)Of course - I have not had my first full period yet, so I'm sure that will be a different experience.  My period is continuing normally right now though (on my 3rd day) and I'm hoping I don't have spotting between periods.I'm just super positive and excited to start my hormone-free life :)
Other	Lala, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/13/2012 3:19:20 PM	I felt compelled to write a positive review about my experience with Paragard because there seems to be so many negative ones. I have had the Paragard IUD for about 4 weeks. Placement was uncomfortable, but tolerable. I took 200mg of Motrin before I went in so I'm sure that helped ease some of the discomfort. I can say that there were about 3 different times where I felt a quick pinch. The cramping I experienced was similar to a pap smear. I experienced moderate cramping afterward but took another 200mg of Mortin which helped. I experienced about 5 days of spotting with mild cramps.My husband and I had sex about 10 days after placement. I was a little nervous but everything was great. Neither of us could feel the IUD and I didn't experience any pain.I recently just had my period. Now, I've had 3 kids and my periods are extremely regular. My periods usually last about 4 days, with the first two days heavy, and the last two light; moderate cramping on day 1, maybe day 2. This time around, my period was a little heavier, and cramps were a little worse. My period lasted about 5.5 days.Overall, I am extremely happy with Paragard. My doctor said most people who have it removed can't get used to the heavier periods w/ more cramps. Since my periods are already heavy, I am willing to stick it out, and have faith that I have finally found a form of BC that is convenient and won't make me feel like I'm on an emotional roller coaster.

I decided to go with paragard due to it not having any hormones and the effective ratings of IUDs.  I have been extremely satisfied with it.  I have noticed that my periods are a little longer once they &quot;get going&quot;.  I usually have a couple days of spotting and then we're off at the races as they say.  I have also noticed a mucusy discharge which reminds me of losing the mucus plug when pregnant.  However, my doctor and I have read that this is normal.  Insertion was virtually painless and easy.  I have had it now for 5-6 months and am completely satisfied.  It has been effective thus far.

It has done its job so far I am not pregnant. The problem I am having is the past four months I am having my cycle every two weeks. The bleeding sometimes is so heavy I will bleed through my pants if I dont get to the restroom in time. I am planning on taking this thing out on the 22nd and going back to the marina because i did not have these issues with it.

I cramp up bad some days and sometimes not at all. In burning through pads and tampons and stress when I'm in public because I have already sprung a leak once on a hike!

Just shortly after Christmas I find out I was pregnant. On top of that it wasn't a tubal pregnancy 100% healthy pregnancy! Yes it's a blessing and we are keeping him or her. The fact is though my paragard stayed in place. My doctor said it never moved. I know it's 99.4% effective but it's kind of hard to deal when I find out TWO of my friends today both found they are pregnant and they had the paragard as well. That's way to coincidental.

I have been having cramps like the beginning of my menses all day. I hardly ever have menstrual cramps, so this is new for me. I normally have short (2-3 day) and scanty periods. I'm praying they don't get heavier. I am 40 and have had my children so I plan on keeping it for the full 10years. I have high hopes and remaining positive. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	25-34	1/27/2012 12:16:24 PM	I had a paraguard inserted earlier this week. I do not have children, 29, and was on the nuva ring until now.  I normally have a pretty high pain tolerance, but the insertion was extremely painful with hours of severe, nauseating cramping after. I HIGHLY recommend (and wish I had) taken some pain killers before the procedure.  I think that would have made the procedure much easier to take. The procedure only took ~2 minutes with 2 very intense moments when they dilate your cervix and insert the IUD. Today (4 days after) has been the first day with no cramps, 2.5 days with no pain meds.  I'm optimistic that it will work out and things will get back to normal soon. Anxious to be hormone free!

Insertion wasn't bad, was like a really bad cramp but got progressively worse the longer I had it.  Periods were 10 times worse than normal; bleeding was about 2 x as long.  I had to have it removed after nearly 10 months because I got PID from it's use.  It was very effective but would not recommend to others.

My partner always felt it during intercourse though. I was told my periods would be heavy at first and now 2012 my periods are real heavy, and very painful cramps as if they were contractions. I have become anemic, and alot of acne that I never had before. I went to my annual yesterday and was told all this pain is from my uterus trying to push the IUD out. I had it removed now and hope I go back to normal. Easy method, but side effects for me were unbearable, and I'm really petite so that also may have been the case due to the Cooper.
Other	JCarter, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/9/2012 3:58:31 PM	Had Paragard inserted just over 1 yr ago. Pinched badly during insertion, but relaxing/meditaing helped. Never had kids. bleeding cramps for 24-48 hrs after.  Initially (due to rebound from 25+ years of BCPs), gained weight overnight and had constant pink mucus discharge. Periods every 24 days but light (heavier for first 2-3 days, then spotting). After ~8 months, weight came back off suddenly and cycles lengthened to every 27-28 days. Expect to return to state you were in before ever taking hormonal birth control, which for me was mild cramps &amp; bloating during periods, a pimple or two in the T-zone each month and greasier hair. Mucus persists but discharge changed to clear/cloudy and less. A panty liner does the trick.  It is the only true side-effect. Dr. need to educate patients on the difference between side-effects and the 'symptoms' associated with rebound from years of hormonal BC, and the 'symptoms' of reaching your own bodies natural state.  And don't expect to normalize completely for a year to 1 1/2 years.  Now, if you have sharp pains and/or infections (&amp; symptoms associated with that), that is not normal.

It is by far the best decision for me for birth control! I have had heavier periods, but I have had less cramping and I haven't had any migraines before my period like I did with the pill. I have also lost 10 lbs. I am very happy to have an effective form of birth control that I don't have to think about and is hormone free! I do not have any kids and insertion was a little uncomfortable, but nothing horrible. I did have sever cramps for a couple days after insertion, but other than that I have no complaints. This is a great option!

Insertion was 100% PAINLESS, but I had a 10 lb baby so that may have helped.  I am SO GLAD to be free of pills/hormones yet still able to have reversible, reliable birth control.  I had to stop taking combo pills b/c of migraines &amp; minipill gave me 3 week periods &amp; massive weight gain. Paragard is such an awesome change!!

I was so scared after reading the reviews.  Granted, it's only been a few hours, outside of a few cramps it's nothing like anyone had described.  So far I'm happy with it.  My only complaint was my ob/gyn.  He didn't have the best bed side manner.  
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	12/27/2011 9:31:18 AM	I had a paragard for a year and a half before I had it removed and decided to go for Mirena. I had severe uterine cramping and heavy bleeding with my periods each month even after the 3-6 month adjustment period. A few women have asked if there are side effects like weight gain with paragard- typically there are not because paragard is non hormonal, thus reducing the chance of systemic hormonal side effects. Another women asked if removal hurt as much as insertion- it does not. It is as simple as your health care provider removing the IUD with the strings, and it is a slight cramp.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	12/22/2011 7:28:52 PM	I have had the Paragard in for three months now. It is by far the worst decision I have made. I am only 20 years old and have no kids. I have experienced nothing but pain and bleeding with it. I am planning on having it removed and going back to the pill. I wanted it because I hated the pill, but now it seems like it wasn't as bad as I was making it out to be! If I were you, I would go with another method. There are other forms of birth control. I would only use this method if I were older. 
Other	Kristin, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/19/2011 5:26:55 PM	I just had my IUD inserted today, so I can't really say how effective it is just yet.  However, I want to yet all young women out there who have not had kids yet that this procedure was nothing! I'm 21 and I can't believe there are actually women on here saying this was the most painful thing they've ever experienced.  It was uncomfortable, but definately not painful. First my doctor inserted the speculum (which was the most uncomfortable part for me, it was a lot of pressure), then she measured my uterus using the sound (she said I would feel a slight pinch but it felt more like a poke, during this time some slight cramping started kicking in), then she said I may feel another slight pinch once she inserted the actual IUD, once again, didn't really feel anything.  I did take 800mg of ibuprofen before I went in like my doctor told me to.  So either the ibprofen worked really well or I have a high pain tolerance.  I will say I do have some cramping right now, it's slight to moderate.  I was shocked to read all of the horror stories that I did online to find out that it was this easy.  But I understand everyone is different. My biggest recommendation is to take ibuprofen. I'm assuming it helped me a lot! It'll be so nice to not pay $288 a year for the pill!

However, I have had a great experience! A nurse did the insertion and all I took beforehand was IB Profen. The pain was very tolerable and felt like heavy cramping. I have not had a baby before and am 29. I was using the pill and Nuvaring before, but was very sensitive to the hormones.    The first 24 hours after insertion I cramped and it was painful. I spotted the first week. Since then I've had zero spotting, and my periods have been lighter but longer. I normally have heavy, long periods with sometimes intense cramps. I'm only about 4 months into this, so things may change. But I want people to not be afraid to try this and realize that many people have great experiences with it!
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/10/2011 6:52:27 PM	I am 24 and have never been pregnant, and I also freaked myself out after reading some very negative reviews. The insertion hurt--the uterine sound and the actual placement were enough to take my breath away--but it was really not bad enough for me to not recommend it, and I will happily have another one placed after I have children. Those two moments felt like very intense muscle cramps, but the pain was fleeting. I also have a very skilled and wonderful GYN, and I really do think it is important to find a doctor who places IUDs routinely and is a person you trust and feel comfortable with.I usually have moderate cramps during the first day of my period, but for my first period with the Paragard, I had about double the normal flow but no cramps. I also experienced very light spotting for three weeks after insertion, and some very minor and intermittent cramps during the first week after the insertion, but again, nothing too bad, really.It has been a month since insertion, and I am beginning to think that this has been one of my best decisions. No pain, cramping or bleeding during or after sex, either, and he can't feel the strings at all! So one month later, I am free from any side effects. I am so happy with the Paragard and recommend it to all of my friends--it is a fabulous alternative to hormone birth control! No pills or patches to have to remember, and no increased risk of blood clots, stroke, mood swings or breast cancer. I'm a happy girl!
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/6/2011 7:14:08 PM	Got my ParaGard inserted last week and I couldn't be happier. I've never been on birth control before, am in a monogamous relationship, and did not wish to go on hormones, so I felt this was best for me. I'm in my late 20s, never been pregnant. I had read many horror stories before going in, so I had psyched myself out. I took 3 Advil before going in, and hardly felt a thing during insertion, except for a little pinching sensation when they measured my cervix and inserted the IUD.I've had no problems with it whatsoever, very slight bleeding and mild intermittent cramps. I went shopping the same day and did a strenuous workout the next day with no problems. I just got my first period since insertion, and I don't have any increased bleeding or cramps.Best decision I ever made!

I didn't feel any cramps, no bleeding and was perfectly fine afterwards. I took 4 rapid release gel Advils 20 mins before my appointment.  It hasn't affected my periods very much, but I always had very irregular ones, I would often go several months without any bleeding. 20 years old, no previous pregnancies. And none for ten years!!
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/1/2011 5:30:49 PM	I had a Paragard IUD inserted when I was 28.  I've never had children.  I wanted the paragard because I'd been unhappy with hormonal forms of birth control and I also really wanted something I didn't have to remember to take every day (I have trouble remembering to take a vitamin everyday let alone a birth control pill).  I've had it for about a year now and have been very happy.  It hurt a lot to have inserted.  And I had cramps for several days afterwards (they got better every day).  And though my periods have been heavier since getting it, that too has gotten better with time.  For the first six months or so, I did have increased menstrual cramping.  But, like everything else, this has gotten better over time.  I barely have any cramping at all now (I didn't really have much cramping to deal with before getting it inserted).  All in all, though it was harder to deal with in the beginning, I'm so happy.  No hormones.  Nothing to remember every day.  I've been very pleased.
Other	MANDII, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	11/30/2011 9:57:32 PM	Great alternative! Im 21 years old, I have NEVER been P.G. and plan on not having kids for a while. I hated the side-effects of birth control (3+ years) I have no reason to take hormons either. My periods are &lt; 4 days &amp; very light. so parguard was right for me. I would NOT recommend paragaurd for thoughs who have heavy periods. Im on my first period with paraguard and it is about 50% more heavey then normal (the mirana would be best for thoughs who have heavy flow). Here is my experince with paraguard:Day one: Instertion was painful, although I did have an annual at the same time. If I had to do this again, I would be sure to take 800mg 30mins before hand. The FNP also used a numbing agent. It was still a painful experence, but no to bad. make sure you get a STD testing and P.G test before hand. They made sure I was all negitive. It mostly felt like the day before I was going to start my period, but a really bad burning sensation. I had to take 1000mg of ibfro. I was fine. I was also ok to drive 2 hrs back home. at night I made sure to take 500mg before bed. slept fine.Day two: about every 5hrs 800mg. day three: I took only 2 pills. pain easied up. Day 4. NO pain. mild bloating. took no pain medication.Day 5. no pain. noticed some discharge. mild cramping. Day 6. started period. 1 1/2 week early. maybe early from quiting birth control 3 weeks earlier. Day 7. no cramp, mild bloating. period is heavier then Im used to. used 4 tampons (regular) 2 pantey liners and 1 night pad.Day 8. period flow is about the same. day 9. eased up quite a bit. normal flow that im used to. day 10. period is exstremly mild. mild here and theres, but most likly going to stop.

I'm 20 years old and was on the pill but had a blood clot, so I wasn't allowed to go back on any form of hormonal birth control. I was extremely upset when I found this out because I was having heavy periods and cramps before the pill. When I had the Paragard inserted it was the most pain I've ever experienced and a very different type of pain and I felt dizzy afterward for about 15 minutes. I did have VERY heavy periods and cramps for about the first 6 months are insertion. Things have calmed down now and I would say flow and cramps are still heavy but manageable. My boyfriend says he can feel the strings and sometimes they prick him but nothing to painful.

Then, I became pregnant with it. I carried my son until my 2nd trimester before going into preterm labor. He lived for 2 hrs and then passed away. I will never use this again nor will I ever recommend it to anyone. This has been the most tramatic experience of my life. The company also does not publish statistics on the # of pregnancies that occur each year on this device. I had to do my own research through public posts and forums.

I had one long cramp during insertion and it was like nothing I've ever felt before.  Almost like someone was pulling down on my uterus and squeezing it at the same time.  It only lasted a few minutes but was very intense.  I actually told the doctor, &quot;I can't do this&quot; but she said it would last 20 more seconds so I just breathed really heavily.  Afterward the insertion, I became dizzy, very sweaty, and thought I was going to throw up.  My doctor said this was normal and about 50% of women have this response.  She told me it would go away within a half hour, and it did.  I did have some pretty bad cramps for the next 24 hours but nothing like when they inserted the iud.  I've had it for three months now and it's been nice not having to take a pill.  The pill made me extremely moody and depressed.  I will say that my periods have been heavier and the cramps are really, really bad for the first few days.  They are like no cramps I've ever felt before - I'm actually doubled over in pain, but they last a few seconds and go away.  I assume they are similar to contractions, but I wouldn't know for sure.  I'm really hoping that these intense cramps during my period will go away within a few months.  Oh, and my husband can feel the strings, but he said it doesn't hurt and doesn't bother him.

I took an ibuprofen an hour before getting it and it just felt like a regular pap smear exam. I didnt have any cramping afterwards or bleeding but I have 5 children so that may be a factor as to why it was painless for me.  Im very happy I did it though since I no longer have to take hormone birth control and it lasts 10-12 yrs.

Menstrual cramps during the first 3 months were pretty painful. It was a very different type of cramps then I have ever had before. They came and went and were intense. They felt like I would assume contractions felt like (since I have never had a child). I had pain with working out also. A sharp shooting pain, as if my IUD was stabbing into my uterus. My doctor told me all of this was normal and I should wait it out because it should go away. The ease of not having to take a pill or any hormones whatsoever was worth it for me anyway. 
Other	Lindsey, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/3/2011 2:01:31 PM	I have had the IUD for over 4 years and have been really happy with it. Never have to worry about forgetting to take the pill, so it's great. The pain of having it inserted was minimal, a bit of cramping. I have noticed recently slightly being depressed close to my period so I don't know if this has any connection but going to do some research. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/3/2011 2:17:06 AM	I decided to get Paragard when I was 18 years old, I had previously taken the pill, however it cause mood swings and weight gain. Paragard is a wonderful option to those who wish not to deal with the side effects of hormones. It has been one year since I got it implanted; I have never had children but that is no reason to not consider Paragard as a birth control method. The processes was quick, and painless the feeling consisted of a light pinch and slight cramping(I do have a rather high pain tolerance though). Overall I am quite pleased with Paragard it has taken away the burdens of daily pill consumption and missed period worries. I also find it funny that is occasionally pokes my boyfriend.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	10/30/2011 6:44:30 PM	The insertion was painful, but manageable.  I experienced serious pain throughout my experience with Paragard, however.  It was complicated by an ovarian cyst that appeared shortly after insertion, so I avoided going back to the doctor, attributing my pain to the cyst until I simply couldn't take it anymore.  It turns out that I was spontaneously expelling the IUD, which apparently happens to about 10% of women who haven't had kids. The cyst disappeared after the second month of having the IUD, so the last four months of pain were completely due to the IUD. In another month, it would have come completely out.  I gave it a full six months, trying to let my body adjust to the device, but all I experienced were much heavier, extraordinarily painful periods, and daily &quot;pinching&quot; sensations.  I wanted to go the IUD to get away from hormones and to simplify my life, but boy, do I miss the days of short, easy periods with almost no pain, all for the price of having to remember a little pill.  Now I'm out $700+, several doctors visits, two sonograms, a couple of days of missed work, and a lot of personal pain -- and I'm right back where I started.  My little sister had a similar experience.  We'll wait on the IUD until we're done having kids.
Other	gmm, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	25-34	10/29/2011 8:39:41 PM	In my case, insertion was painful (felt like an extended contraction), and the cramping afterward lasted a full day plus. Intercourse is sometimes painful, bladder feels fuller quicker, and cramps come twice a month (during ovulation and during menses)...I'm undecided if the overall pain outweighs the benefit..but it's prevented pregnancy thus far!

I cant saw anything about effectiveness yet but my first impression was good. Little pain &amp; cramps for first minutes, not pain relever required for me. And havent had side effects. 
Other	kris10, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/17/2011 2:37:56 PM	I have a blood clotting condition called Factor 5 liedian that prevented me from taking anything with hormones. So my only options were Paragaurd and getting sterilized. And apparently since Im only 27 and I have no children, I must not know what I want to do with my own body. So no respectable dr would sterilize me. Insertion: The pain was comparable to the first day of my period, but only when he was actually inserting different objects into my cervix. I would say it was about three separate times when I felt that all too familiar kick to the stomach. When he was done, it wasnt bad. I wasnt nauseous, dizzy, painful, or faint. I was bleeding (more than expected during the last few days of my period). I actually felt well enough to drive myself to work. About 5 hours later I took a couple more extra strength Tylenol and went to bed early. I had regular cramping that continued into the next day. Three- six months later: day to day, its not a problem. However I bleed a little and still have pretty bad cramps when I ovulate. Its getting old. I feel like I have two periods a month. One normal one and a mini period in the middle of my cycle. The cramping is actually less severe during my actual period, but I would say it starts lightly a couple days earlier (lasts a little longer). Other than that, no problems. I would do it again. Good luck!
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/14/2011 5:11:38 PM	I had this device inserted yesterday.  I have not tested its &quot;effectiveness&quot; yet ;) but I can tell you about the insertion process.  I am 21, have never given birth (or even had intercourse, I know, it's surprising) and I got the IUD so that I can be prepared for sex with when I am really ready and not on a timeline of when I can obtain birth control.  Got it at Planned Parenthood and I REALLY recommend this because they insert them all the time , no biggie (my GP would not do it for me because she said it was very hard to do for women who have not given birth).  There was some pain with the procedure, but nothing I couldn't handle.  It felt something like I imagine labor pains to be, but obviously on a much smaller scale.  The device they used to clamp the cervix hurt a lot.  I had no pain relievers beforehand.  I've had some pretty bad cramping since yesterday and I was on my period when I got it, and my flow has actually gotten lighter since the insertion!  I hear that it can make your periods heavier and increase cramping, but I'm alright with that if it doesn't mean putting artificial hormones in my body.  So far, yay!

My flow got soo much heavier i am a 18 year old petite girl and i had to start using super plus tampons and switch them out every 2 hours!! I began developing anemia from the blood loss.Sex was just painful. the only position i could actually enjoy was me on top anything else was just painful.. I loved that i didn't get pregnant though.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/6/2011 4:19:09 PM	I just had my paragard inserted. It was quick and with a lot les pain than I read about and anticipated. The sharp pain from insertion lasted about 30 seconds. The Cramping after insertion went away very quickly. for me this may the solution to non-hormonal birth control that is effective and easy to use. Insurance paid for the paragard and its insertion, so at a $15 co-pay this is an amazing low cost for the next 7-10 years. 
Other	COgal, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/4/2011 10:42:08 PM	I have had my copper IUD for almost 2 years. It has been a wonderful form of birth control for me and my fiance. I have never had children but insertion was almost painless. My periods were heavier for the first 4-6 months but nothing unbearable (I was never heavy before though). The only downside is that I now spot for 2-3 days and then bleed for 5 or 6 days. Also, I seem to have had more yeast infections in the last 6 months but I do not think this is a side-effect of paragard. One other gripe, I had to fight my insurance to get it approved (they didn't even know what an IUD was!) but it was worth the countless hours I spent to get authorization. Overall, I LOVE my IUD!!
Other	Svorellana, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	5	Female	25-34	10/3/2011 8:00:14 PM	  The INEFFECTIVE is because i had inserted a week ago. I have no real knowledge of anything further. BUT my issue is having a reaction to the ALLERGIC REACTION TO THE COPPER. I have an allergy to nickel and I'm concerned of the side effect. My dermatologist and obgyn have told me they have never heard of a reaction or issue. Also my OBGYN called them directly and asked. but searching through some of these forums and Drugs.com, I have read about that being questionable considering a do not use &quot;...if your allergic to any of Paragard's components.&quot; Please let me know if you've heard of or have experienced such a reaction do to the copper. THANKS.
Other	Renewed Self, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	9/30/2011 2:40:56 PM	Decided to remove added hormones from my body, thus chose to have the paragard due to migraines; which are increased with hormones.  The overall experience has been uneventful.  I did not experience any great pain with the procedure.  It did pinch, but my doctor had me take a pill the night before that helped soften the cervix.  I had read that did not help, but I believe it did.  I have had it for 2 weeks.  Just started period, and other than the return of cramps, breast tenderness, I have been pleased.  I am not pregnant, checked that too.  I have checked for my strings; which were cut a little shorter than I would have liked.  Things I read about doing to make sure the IUD was as effective as it says.  They are more prone to come out of place within the first few months after placement, but not everyone experiences this. I do check for my strings daily; and do check for them before sex. I did this even with the Nuvaring after I fist got it. Glad I got off the ring.  My sexdrive has returned; energy level has greatly increased; I don't feel like I am 3 times the size that I am; I have lost 6 lbs since removal of nuvaring and insertion of IUD; and I get excited again about being intimate with my husband (his comment I had gotten to where I seemed like I would just lay there). All of my other symptoms have disappeared, too.  I thought I was going into perimenopause already at 39.

Research has shown that prostaglandin levels are elevated in the uterine lining of women with IUDs (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7243136). These elevated prostaglandin levels are thought to be the cause of IUD-related spotting. As iudmama stated, Vitamin E is a prostaglandin inhibitor. One study showed that taking Vitamin E capsules every other day corrected the problem in ALL of the women who participated (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Vitamin% 20E%20(alpha%20tocopherol)%20in%20the%20managemen t%20of%20menorrhagia%20associated%20with%20the%20 use%20of%20intrauterine%20contraceptive%20devices ). I had this problem with constant spotting for over a year after I had my IUD placed. After reading this journal article, I tried the treatment out for myself and took one (400 IU) Vitamin E capsule every other day. After 25 days I stopped spotting completely. :) If you have this problem, DEFINITELY try this treatment (read up on Vitamin E also). I'm so freakin grateful that I found a way to get rid of this problem and I only wish I had found it sooner. Now I just wanna help anyone else out there with this problem because I know how stressful and frustrating it can be! So, one Vitamin E capsule every other day and it will eliminate the spotting... apparently 25% of women see results after 2 weeks, 60+% see results after 4 weeks, and 100% see correction of the problem within 10 weeks. 
Other	Kalen, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	19-24	9/28/2011 6:24:59 PM	I'm more so speaking about the insertion part since I've only had it in for a day. I went to the doctors office and they tested me to make sure I wasn't anemic with a finger prick &amp; blood taken. Then I was taken into the room where the doctor was. My best friend had gotten the hormonal one put in a month ago &amp; told me it wasn't painful at all, only like a minor cramp. Little did I know it's easier for woman who have been pregnant before, and she's a mother of a 7 year old boy. The doctor and nurse informed me that the worst part was measuring my cervix, which is what most woman complain about. She had me cough &amp; the moment it was inserted into my cervix for measuring, the pain increased. I've had bad cramps all my life, so I thought I'd be able to handle it. I started to cry &amp; turned to the nurse &amp; said &quot;I don't think I can do this&quot;. The next thing I remember, the doctor was standing over me trying to get me conscious again. I had fainted from how bad the pain was. It was VERY severe for me. They gave me some motrin to ease it. It's day two &amp; the cramps are still pretty bad, though nothing can compare to having it inserted. I'm hoping it gets better &amp; that in a few months my periods are normal. I'm reading so many mixed reviews.. If anyone has any advice, email me please. Kalennn@gmail.com

Other	ADaw, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	9/27/2011 7:24:07 PM	I had the Paragard inserted 6 weeks after my second C-section (I've never had a vaginal birth and was worried about the insertion because of that) and it was really pretty pain free. Mild cramping for the next day, nothing I couldn't handle. Since I had just had a baby and was nursing, I didn't get my period back for almost 6 months and boy, it came back with a vengeance (granted that first period usually does come back heavily). But major heavy flow- like stuck pig flow. Like bleeding through a jumbo tampon and a pad every 2-3 hours flow. However, 9 months later, it's somewhat more manageable- still heavy but not as out of control. I like that it's hormone free, that I don't have to worry about a daily pill or anything, and I can take it out any time in the next 10 years if I decide I do want another baby. And my insurance covered it. I marked it as very effective because it's worked thus far for what it's worth. I'm 33 now, and have had it for almost a year and a half without problems other than a heavy flow, which is not the end of the world.
Other	Kim, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	9/24/2011 5:20:18 PM	I recently had this inserted and wanted to describe my experience.  I've never had children, but I do handle pain pretty well and I've had a miscarriage with horrendous cramps, so I thought I'd be ok.  While getting this inserted is about a 5 minute process, it was extremely painful.  This is how it goes - they insert the speculum (no pain at all).  They clean out your cervix (no pain).  They then clamp your cervix, which is like a little pinch but not really painful.  Next they measure your cervix, and that hurt a lot - take the worst cramps you've ever had and multiply by 10.  I breathed really heavily which helped, almost like breathing during labor (which I've only seen on TV or in movies).  Then they actually insert the IUD, and again the cramping is horrible.  Right after it was inserted, I became really nauseated, sweaty, and dizzy and thought I was going to vomit.  They brought me a little tray to throw up in if I had to do so.  They also brought me an ice pack and some apple juice.  My doctor said this is a normal response, and about 50% of women have it (there's a medical term for it, but I can't remember it).  After about 25 minutes, I started to feel better and all the bad side effects went away, except for the cramps.  I took some Advil right away and then went shopping, so the really terrible feelings didn't last.  I did have cramps for hours after the procedure, so I just kept taking Advil.  I haven't had my first real period since having this put in, so I don't know how heavy it will be or how the cramps will be.  But the experience itself was not pleasant at all.  It better be worth it in the long run!
Other	MissMalone, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/22/2011 9:15:19 PM	I had this IUD for about a year and had nothing but problems with it. It was only painful for a day or two but my period was insanely heavy for the entire time. Didn't stop once. Then I went to the hospital because I had developed ovarian cysts which erupted (Went to the hospital because I thought I was dying). When I got an ultrasound my ovaries were COVERED with cysts. My doctor said this IUD has no hormones but it increases your natural androgen production (male hormone- fabulous) which causes acne, abnormal hair growth, ovarian cysts, etc. Just because Paragard technically has no hormones doesnt mean it doesnt screw with the ones you've got. He said Merena has a lower dose of hormones than most other birth controls and way better reviews as far as side effects are concerned!

I realize that by the...company's own statistics..

Yes, it was a little bit painful but nothing I couldn't handle. My GYN Doc would only insert it while being on my mentral cycle. She did this because it would be less painful. I wondered this is the posts that are listed here. It makes a different in whether or not it is painful. When my husband and I decided to have another baby, removel was easy and painless. I recently had it put in again and love this method of birth control. Yes, you do get a heavier period and cramps but overall I highly recommend this product. I do however do not advise women who have never had children get it.

As other people have said, it is extremely painful when the doctor puts it in.  I had extreme cramps the whole month, then my period (only 1) was beyond anything I had ever seen.  I had to change my tampon every half an hour, and my period is usually one panty liner a day! This may be because my body rejected it and it was almost completely out by the time my one month check-up occurred.  I'm so sad it didn't work out, I hope they can come up with another non-hormonal something that works.

Due to the insertion taking place at the same appointment as the abortion, I couldn't comment on the pain levels, but I think just bad cramps at worst? Mostly, I've been incredibly happy with it. Initially it made my periods heavier, and cramps (which I never had before) quite bad. Cramps improved over time, now they are minimal (a year later). However, over the last few months, the bleeding, which of course I was warned would increase, has been out of control. I use a mooncup, and I've been having to empty it every hour for the heaviest days of my period. I've been feeling like I'm going through menopause and thinking about having it removed. Possibly moodswings could be related too? But, it was great for a while, and I never had much problems with sex (my boyfriend is pretty large and he's never mentioned it), maybe once or twice it hurt, but never bleeding. Also, my periods mostly remained regular, but became heavier, longer and slightly more frequent (from a 30 day to a 28 day cycle). I'd recommend it, everyone's different, it's really a matter of what you prefer. Just give it at least 3 months and listen to your body -- there's an adjustment period.

The previous man never had a single issue with it, nor did he ever feel it.  My new man is built much larger, and the IUD actually causes sores on the shaft of his penis.  It hits in almost all positions, making it impossible to have normal sex on a regular basis.  It also hurts me when he hits it, so I am now getting it removed after only using it for a year.I will say that the heavier and longer periods were a bit frustrating (especially after never having cramps my whole life until now), but it certainly did it's job preventing pregnancy.  Overall I would recommend this to women who are married to men who are built smaller.  If you are single or married to a man with a large &quot;package&quot;, this method of BC is not for you.

Also, i was on day 3 of my period when I had it inserted, which they said was probably a good thing because my cervix was softer.

Other	TJN, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/19/2011 1:27:33 PM	ParaGard has been effective in preventing pregnancy so far. I've had it in for about 7 weeks. I did experience excruciating pain during insertion (felt like a heavy lead pipe was being suspended parallel by only my uterus). Awful, but fleeting. I was nauseous and dizzy for about 15 minutes and then it subsided. The biggest side effects have been much heavier periods (reminiscent of my teenage years) with increased cramping. I went from a 4 day period, with only two medium-heavy days (on the pill) to 7-8 day periods with 5-6 very heavy days. And my periods have been more frequent than they ever were.The first month, I had a surge in the amount of discharge present, but that has stopped. I have also been spotting between cycles, which had decreased with time. Background: I switched from the pill to the NuvaRing (which I hated) and back to the pill, which then began to give me severe side effects, including high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, decreased libido, anxiety and depression (YES, all of that!). I ceased taking the pill mid-cycle, and it has taken these 7 weeks to get back to my regular 26-day cycle, so I don't blame the ParaGard entirely for the irregularity. Overall, I have been pleased. The absense of any serious side-effects associated with hormones makes the longer, heavier cycles worth it. And I expect that they will decrease, based on the reviews of others and my doctor's input. I do not plan to have it in for 10 years (I'm recently married and plan to have children within 2 years), I just needed a hassle-free, safe method. I hope the removal doesn't hurt as much as the insertion, but now I know to take 1-2 Motrin (and maybe a muscle relaxer) before the appointment. I hope this review is helpful!

They are wrong!! I was on day 2 of my period when I had it put in yesterday, it hurt LESS than a pap and had no extra cramping than I usually do with my period. I also have no excess flow or pain. I know it's only day 2 but some women said that they had severe pain and Carry-like blood flow as soon as it was incerted. Not true in all cases! If you have the finances available, give it a try.

I do now have much heavier and longer periods...which also isn't really a big deal weighing out pros and cons. However, I have noticed that it gets in the way during intercourse. My husband has admitted to feeling it, and our experiences together without a doubt, have not been the same since I've had it placed. We are seriously considering having it removed. The only thing holding me back at this point is the amount of money I had to pay for it out of pocket bc insurance did not cover it.

Just shy of a year, i have had extreme cramping and bleeding for 9-15 days every month. It is painful during sex and I have also had to have blood work done due to fatigue, muscle weakness and dizziness. Turns out my iron is low! I have also noticed a huge decrease in my sex drive. I am actually excited to have the paragard removed tomorrow and not sure what form of birth control I will go with but probably the pill.
Other	Vanessa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	7/7/2011 11:57:05 PM	I have had the paragard for I believe 6 months. My husdand and I have 3 kids under 4 so we needed some sort of protection. On the pill I have no sex drive so you would think that hormone free would be good, right? Not really. Placement was smooth a little painful. I actually got it done on my lunch break. Since insertion I have had very heavy periods. I keep getting this strange cramping to my lower right pelvic area but nothing to bad. Big problem... I am having SEVERE mood swings, and as time is passing it is getting worse. I am now very depressed. I am always exhausted, and not sleeping. Since I got it inserted I have LOST 20 lbs and mt blood pressure has been 80/40 appx. Along with pretty bad acne which I really have not had trouble with since I was a teenager. All are signs of copper toxicity. I love the fact that my hubby and I can have sex at anytime but since I am a complete nut job our marriage is not doing well. Also, I am a little afraid it may have perforated my bowel because on my period I bleed from my rectum... not normal by the way. I have an appt to have it removed and I am gonna call to get some blood work because I am also displaying signs of anemia. Some people don't seem to have a problem with it by my expieriance has not been good.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	7/6/2011 11:59:52 AM	I had the Paragard inserted on 23JUN11 and have had nothing but problems. Painful insertion with heavy bleeding afterwards; rectal/vaginal pain; painful bowel movements; cramps; bloating; abdominal pain. 2 days after insertion I couldn't feel the strings. Finally called the doctor and went in-- no strings! After 2 cervical checks, 2 vaginal ultrasounds, 2 abdominal ultrasounds, and 1 x-ray...they discovered that it is NOT in my uterus but is in my abdomen. Needless to say, it is being surgically removed tomorrow, 7JUL11. 
Other	mommakris, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	7/6/2011 10:13:59 AM	I am 28 yrs old with to children youngest is 7. I just had the Paragard inserted yesterday afternoon. It really wasn't that bad!  I had my children C-sections but went through 12 hrs of labor with 1st before they decided C-S would be best.  I honestly felt more pressure than cramps.  When she 1st measured my cervix I felt a cramp.  Then she re-measured a couple times to make sure and that was just pressure.  I flinched when she inserted the IUD but it really wasn't that painful.  Take a friend if that helps.  I did!!!  I talked the entire time to keep my mind off it.  After the procedure I felt a lil pressure the rest of the afternoon but no cramping.  I took 800mg of ibu before going and took 400mg before bed.  I put my back out the day before insertion so i'm taking the ibu now for back pain.  But I still do not feel cramping or anything.  I can tell my body is udjusting to it cause i feel a lil off but nothing terrible.  I just hope this works because I'm not able to take the pill.  The Dr had issues with opening my cervix so I did bleed a bit during the procedure but now it's been very very light spotting.  I was on day 7 of my cycle for insertion, so I hope everything goes well when I get my period.  I will post again in a few months.  Everyones body reacts differetly so you really won't know until you try :)  You can always take it out.  Just remeber to a gyno you trust!
Other	andromedatpa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	7/5/2011 9:32:55 AM	I hate paragard! I had it for 4 years and finally yanked it out myself yesterday. The first year? Wonderful. Awesome. Couldnt be better. No side effects, placement was easy, never thought once about it. The last 3 years have been a nightmare! Horrible, horrible cystic acne explosion where I had very clear skin my whole life before. Im 32 now. Maybe the mild break out around my period, but NOT cystic acne. The other issues were extreme anxiety, depression, severe mood swings. I had all the symptoms of copper toxicity. Thinning, brittle hair and nails. I tried every remedy under the sun, liver detoxes, birthcontrol, antibiotics, expensive facial treatments and cleansers, nothing worked. NOTHING. I was very conflicted about pulling it out, debated it for the last year of having it while in total misery the whole time. And it didn't help that my doctors all told me I was crazy. Well when I pulled that thing out, omg, the copper wiring was rusted and corroded beyond recognition. The coils were no longer coils...they were completely rusted together. The plastic T itself was intact along with the wire, but on top of the corrosion itself there were bacteria colonies all over the device and especially on the top of the T where it blocks the fallopian tubes, thats where the most corrosion and bacteria growth was. Im a micro student so I know these colonies when I see them. I saved it to take to my doctor for testing to see exactly what it was growing there, and why the copper was so corroded. There is no way I could have kept that thing in me another 6 years!! I was very very depressed about having to take it out, I had very nice regular periods and it was very effective as bc itself goes...plus I have no insurance so, planned parenthood, here I come. And i thought I was done with them for another 10 years, guess not. Bottom line, if you have any metal allergy issues, like nickel, a very common one, most likely you will have eventual issues with the copper paragard.

I had it placed in March, and though my period is still a little heavier and lasts longer than usual, its nothing that I cant live with. So far it has been totally worth the money. If your willing to deal with the transition period that can be a little painful, then you will be happy with the results.

I had the worst time getting it inserted. I had my C-section surgeon and then his assistant try for a half hour. And it was so painful-Only for it to fall out in 3 days. Then my family doc tried as well, and it took a while-but finally got it in (again very painful). I have had it in now almost 2 yrs-&amp; I'm not still sure of it. Every 4-6 months for 2-3 days, I have extreme cramping, like my body is trying to get rid of it. It hurts to even sit. That started after about 10 months of it in. The beginning was rough-the heavy periods do get better tho.  Other than those flair ups, I am generally happy.
Other	Jen, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	6/29/2011 6:29:06 PM	I got the Paragard in February. It was extremely painful when it was inserted and I continued to have severe cramping and moderate bleeding for about a week after. Then my period started and was a little worse than usual, but I expected that. The cramping continued and whenever I tried to exercise it would hurt worse and I would bleed more. I felt like I could feel it in there and I was just very uncomfortable. Then my periods just kept getting worse. My bleeding was extremely heavy and would last at least two weeks. I decided I would give it the rest of the summer to see if it would get better. I got my period at the beginning of June and it just kept coming and when I thought it had finally ended, spotting started back up. I had it removed 2 days ago and felt so relieved as soon as it came out. Removal was very quick and I barely cramped at all. I would not recommend this to anyone.

I have recently been having gallbladder issues and thought that I better check to see if by some chance I am pregnant, before I have surgery. And guess what, I am pregnant after only 10 months from having my last baby. Very upset, as 4 children were enough for me.

Other	AC, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/21/2011 3:44:16 PM	I had this placed about 4-5 months ago.I was not on my cycle when I first went to have it placed and they were not able to insert it but I have heard that if you have an orgasm before going it will help open your uterus.  Otherwise, unless your doc requests, not - be on your period.  At least 2nd day.The pain of insertion was medium but it was uncomfortable.  Luckily it only takes a minute! Literally!  After wards I took 3 advil twice a day for 2-3 days.I did A LOT of research before choosing the Paragard.  I don't react well to hormones and the hormonal IUD is NOT REVERSIBLE IMMEDIATELY.  Since having it placed, the first week = do not have sex, and don't exercise too much.  I had medium/uncomfortable cramping but was able to go out to a dinner party the same night.   Pain after placement:  After 2 weeks I went back to my full gym routine and this was when the cramps really started!  They'd been less than I expected until I started doing my 200 abdominal excercises.  The follwing days brought such severe cramping, I was doubled over on the floor and crawling for long muscle spasms reaching down to my uterus area.  I went to have a check-up, it seems the problem was my abs muscles feeling sore and affecting the whole area.  So this has mostly decreased but still occurs.My boyfriend did initially feel the little string (its like a very light weight fishing line) but it didn't bother him enough to mention it till I asked.  It was easy to have it shortened when I went in for that checkup I mentioned.My periods came fast and furious - twice a month for the first 3 months.  Along with the feeling of PMS! Felt like I only DIDN'T have my period for a week at a time but I could be wrong.  They seem to have receeded now but I would still say that they are longer.  I occassionally still get a bad pain spasm but for the most part not much worse than cramps before I got the IUD.My man and I could not be happier. Finally: DO tell your senators to SAVE FAMILY PLANNING!

It was nothing 10 minutes and it was in and I was out of the office.  My first menstrual cycle was a mess, I chaled it up to it was something new.  Well my second cycle was better lasted about 10 days cramps were not bad.  I just had my third cycle which was nothing at all laasted 8 days.  Well now six days after I have bleeding and cramps all over again.  I know that there is an adjustment time but come on now for three months I have spent more money in pads and tampons than I would have on birth control pills.  I am seriously thinking of having it removed.  It has been effective cause basically I have not been able to have sex.  Well I think I will give it one more month.

Other	HOLYCRAP, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	19-24	6/8/2011 5:54:12 AM	I'm 23 and opted for the Paragard since I am extremely sensitive to any kind of hormone birth control. I've never been pregnant and I'm full time student, so I thought this would be a good option for at least the next 5 years. The insertion was less scary than I thought it would be. Mild cramping during insertion but HORRIBLE cramps the day of insertion and the whole week after. The bleeding was not bad and stopped after 1 week. Then the weirdest thing, everytime I had a BM (because of the bearing down) my bleeding restarted. For the following 3 weeks I was in agonizing pain from cramping that stopped and restarted, and continuous back pain and spotting. I think I had intercourse 1 time since putting the Paraguard in because I was so uncomfortable. The 3rd week I went in to have it removed. The continuous cramps and back pain were seriously debilitating, could barely concentrate on anything, was almost doing the Lamaze breathig throught every cramp, it sucked. Now am giving the Pill another try. We will see what happends, I'm just so relieved and glad that the Paraguard is OUT. Be very well informed about ALL birth controls before choosing, Paragard was NOT right for me. 
Other	19-24 Female 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	6/4/2011 12:42:33 PM	i just recently had a baby february and i decided i would get paragard since it is hormone free and since i dont want another baby. i had it inserted 8 weeks after having my daughter. i had really bad cramping right afterwards and bleeding and that lasted for a few days then 2 weeks later i started a period, a pretty bad one too. i had an ultrasound done to see if it was in place properly and it actually fell out. which who knew could happen after having a baby? so i got it replaced had very bad cramping ended my period a few days after and started another period 3 wks later and had excessive bleeding for 10 days straight.

Paragard is worth it!
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/27/2011 12:32:34 PM	I had the Paragard IUD inserted about a month ago. I was a nervous wreck because of all of the reviews that I had read online saying that if you haven't had children it was going to be excruciating to insert. I wanted to post as soon as possible to let people know that my experience was completely different. I went a few days before my period started, and have never had children. The whole insertion lasted less than 10 minutes, and while it did include some substantial cramps, it was nothing that couldn't be handled as they would subside quickly after whatever was being done. Once it was in, I sat up, got dressed, talked to the nurse for a bit and then drove myself to the store to buy some groceries. I did have some sharp cramping walking around the store, but just bought some Midol and took that as soon as I got to the car. I came home, put a heating pad on, and a couple of hours later felt just fine. I even had sex that night with my BF with no pain or bleeding. My period was a bit heavier this month, and instead of being 3-4 days long was about 6-7, but I think that's a small price to pay for such an effective birth control. I love the spontaneity that the IUD allows me to have with my BF. You can have sex anytime and anywhere without having to worry about whether you took a pill or having him have to pull out. And now that my period is over, I have no cramps or spotting. And my BF can't feel the strings like some other people have claimed. All in all, I'm sorry that I didn't do this years ago. All the worry that I could have avoided... If this is an option for you, I highly recommend getting the Paragard!!

I do have much heavier periods and some cramping but that is so worth it for the ease of use and reliability. During insertion I did not take any medication and it was not that bad being inserted and afterwards I had cramps for a day or two. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a easy and reliable birth control.

It felt like a really bad menstural cramp for about thirty seconds or less and the pain subsided. I have a little bit of cramping here and there, but nothing like a menstural cramp. I hope this is the right birth control for me. I love not having the hormones. I'll update a few months from now and let you know how I like it then. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/16/2011 12:37:55 PM	I had my Paragard inserted about 3 months ago, and haven't had any problems.  The procedure was a little uncomfortable, but nothing extreme.  I've always had bad cramps, and they were a little worse for the first 2 months.  But that was all explained to me before I chose to get it.  The side effects have diminished, and I am SO happy with it.  I really like that there are no hormones involved.  I chose this over the Mirena because it does not cause acne.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	5/11/2011 8:37:29 PM	I reviewed this device almost exactly one year ago, approximately 4 days after insertion.  Today, I had it removed.  About 3 months into it, I began noticing I was losing alot more hair than usual.  Over the past several months I've undergone extensive bloodwork for thyroid issues, hormone imbalances &amp; anemia.  Sure enough, my iron levels are now dangerously low, which both my gynecologist &amp; dermatologist attribute to the 10 -14 day heavy periods I've been having since getting my Paragard.  I have now lost more than half my hair.  I never got pregnant on this, so I give it 5 stars for effectiveness.  But after much research, I realize anemia is not uncommon from this form of birth control.  This is something to consider.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/7/2011 12:30:53 PM	I love the Paragard. I have had it in for over a year now. Nothing wrong has happened. No Pregnancies or Miscarriages. I got this because I know that I could not take a pill everyday and I don't like Needles. Another reason why I got is because I don't want to manually put things in my body. Also I don't like anything with hormones. But I was scared at first using it with out other protection. I had gotten it a month after I had my Daughter. My Husband actually could feel the strings as to probably because My body was not back to before birth. But now he does not feel them anymore. My Period starts with spotting for 2 to 3 days and then it gets severe. And it can last for about 7 to 10 days. But I like getting my period. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. 
Other	xeradiant, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/4/2011 11:28:39 AM	I had the Paragard inserted on April 28th, 2011. It was requested that I be on period during the procedure. The doctor used an ultrasound to make sure it was in place. I'm 5'4 and of a small frame. I've never been pregnant before. The actual procedure wasn't bad at all. There were a couple of times where it pinched but that was about it. I did have bad cramping that night though. I was fine the next day and my period lasted the same amount of time it normally does. I didnt cramp the rest of the time I was menstruating.I do have bipolar disorder and I have noticed that my moods have been a bit more irregular than normal. My body's been on the BC pill for 10 years so my doctor says that the mood swings are just do to my body getting use to not having hormones in them anymore. Hopefully that clears up. Other than the mood swings though, I think Paragard is awesome.

Please see the link below to read other true stories by other woman who are not happy with paragard, Most of the reviews on these sites are from reps of paragard misleading consumers to sell the product.  The product is usually removed by most woman with in the first 6 months due to side effects.  Please be do a lot of research before you get one.  I would never recommend paragard to anyone. http://www.facebook.com/pages/Paragard-Dont-GET-O NE-Woman-helping-woman-to-be-informed

I had taken a couple ibuprofin before due to a headache...insertion wasn't that bad. The little tool they use to measure your uterus hurt a bit but nothing I couldn't handle and it only lasted a couple minutes and I was out the door and had no real pain after. Heck I went hiking afterwards...that night I had a little cramping but nothing to complain about. I had some light spotting for a week or so and then got my period a couple weeks later...it was my first since having my baby in January. I'd say it wasn't very painful considering it's been a year since my last one! I flowed pretty good for one full day and then it lightened up. I was honestly expecting way worse. I'm not one to medicate pain either so I tolerated the mild cramping and just moved around more. Very happy with the paragard so far! 
Other	Lil_Red, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/29/2011 1:03:03 PM	I got my ParaGard inserted on February 11, 2011 just shy of my 30th birthday. I've never been pregnant and I'm barely 5' so I have a petite frame. The insertion itself was very painful, though I expected that since I've never given birth. I was on regular doses of Advil and Tylenol for three days after and experienced moderate to severe cramping. On my doctor's recommendation I stayed on the pill until my 4-week checkup. I did bleed for over a month and a half straight (moderate flow); which was more annoying than anything else. This month (April 2011) I had my first pill-free period and while I'm a little more crampy than I was before, it's not too bad and I am not experiencing a heavier flow than what I had while on the pill (which is one of the things they say can happen). Overall I'm so happy with my choice and it is nice to not have to worry about taking a pill at the same time every day anymore! I'm also glad to have a birth control option that is hormone free. I highly recommend the ParaGard!

However, insertion was only slightly more uncomfortable than a normal pap smear (and i had no pain killer) and I've had it for two years now. It's been amazing! No paying for pills monthly! No crazy hormones! No weight gain! No worrying about missing pills!
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/20/2011 1:38:39 PM	I just got my paragard inserted a few hours ago, and let me tell you it was so much better than I thought it would be! I am 20 and have never had a child and  read all the reviews before I went and was extremely nervous. I was expecting the worst. Basically, they will first open your cervix with a speculum which is a little uncomfortable but what you would feel if you have gotten a pap smear before. Then they insert the IUD and it definitely hurts ALOT for about 5 minutes, it felt like really bad menstrual cramp but once they take it out I felt completely fine.  I just have cramps right now but nothing Ibuprofen and a heating pad wont help! Also, they recommend inserting it while you are on your period so it will go in easier. I also had to insert the &quot;misoprostol&quot; pill vaginally 4 hours prior to the procedure which helped in opening my cervix. I would definitely recommend this device so far! It has no hormones, and if everything goes as planned I can leave it in for 10 years! So much easier than remembering to take a BC pill everyday!
Other	Hurley1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/19/2011 8:47:47 PM	I read all kinds of scary reviews before getting Paragard, so I thought I'd share a good review.  Since I haven't had kids, my doctor warned me insertion would be uncomfortable, but she gave me a painkiller and another medication to relax my cervix - very, very glad I had both because it was the most painful thing ever.  I needed to lay down for about 15 minutes following, and still almost fainted.  When I got home, I slept for about 3 hours, and was a little crampy the rest of the day (a 2 or 3 on a scale of 1-10, insertion being a 12).  Very light spotting and more of a bloated feeling than cramps for about 3 days, but haven't had a second thought since.  It's been about 6 weeks, and I've had one really heavy period - assuming that after a few months my body will remember what it used to do, and it'll calm down.  However, my skin, hair, and attitude have drastically improved since getting off the pill.  The 20 minutes of pain during insertion has been well worth it.  Unfortunately insurance didn't cover it, so I paid out of pocket - with the monthly cost of pills it will take a little over a year to have it even out, after which it'll essentially be free.  Overall, two thumbs way up.
Other	Tracey, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/18/2011 5:23:20 PM	I am 39 receive the paragurd a year ago. The period after 1st getting it did cramp. This does not cause side effects as to weight gain nor bloating, since it does not contain hormones. It has worked very well for me considering I am allergic to birth controls that contain hormones. I have never in my life had a yeast infection with nor without the IUD. I would highly recommend anyone to try it. I didn't have any pills nor numbing of any sort when having it inserted. Was no more different than getting a pap just a few mins longer.

Well, my daughter is 2 1/2 and I have basically put up with it for almost two years because it's the cheapest birth control as long as you have it in for 2 years or more.  I have the symptoms of a yeast infection just about every month right before and right after my period.  My husband can feel the wires, he says sometimes it actually pokes him and leaves a mark.  The doctor informed us that it would soften, it's been almost 2 years and nothing softened.  During intercourse, I don't have a problem being turned on, but sometimes I am completely dry no matter what.  If I am not on my period, I am usually spotting with maybe a week of nothing each month.  I have had two periods a month as well.  The periods have not slowed down at all.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  The only nice thing is that it's effective depending on how much you are willing to put up with.  I have read the reviews and it seems like you have a 50/50 chance of lovingbit or hating it.

Wanted to try Paragard because, unfortunately I am a smoker (for now) and this is the only option other than barrier contraceptives that does not have all the dangerous side effects to smokers. I definitely wanted something hormone free. I had it inserted 2 days ago. I took some Advil an hour before. No pain whatsoever. Felt like a routine exam. I don't feel anything. However, I have been spotting since the insertion. Which is annoying. I'm hoping it will taper off. Haven't gotten my period yet, so we'll see what that's like. So far so good, other than the spotting. I'll have to report back in a month or so.

Other	lhm36, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	35-44	4/15/2011 7:34:37 AM	I have had the paragard for a month so I am updating my experience.  I would not recommend the paragard to anyone.  I have gained 7 pounds and I am always hungry and bloated.  I have headaches, acne, back pain, no sex drive and almost constant yeast infection.  Before the paragard I did not have these problems.  Also very moody.  I had similar side effects with hormonal birth control.  I wish my body knew that there are no hormones in this thing!  Ironically, the side effects that bother most people (heavy bleeding and cramps) only bothered me for a few days and my first and only paragard period was just fine (6 days and slightly heavy but not a big deal).  I think I am done with hormones and anything that can mess up my body chemistry.  We will use condoms and the rhythm method.  I am having it removed in 3 days and I can't wait to feel like me again.  I did do my research before I got the paragard but I was hoping that I would be one of those lucky women who do not experience side effects.  Unfortunately, this is just not for me.  Good luck to all of you.  Just a word of advice, if it makes you miserable, get rid of it.  Don't let your doc talk you into keeping it six months or a year.  That is nonsense!  I realize this is not for me and it is coming out.

My dr had me take a pill 12hrs before to dialate my cervix and the insertion wasnt very painful. The numbing shot hurt more than anything else. I did have slight cramping for a couple hours after insertion. I have not experienced any painful or heavy periods. Actually I havent really had a period at all. I would recommend it!
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/12/2011 9:27:35 PM	I have had my paragard IUD for about 1.5 years now. I am 29 and have had no children so I expected insertion to be painful but I barely felt anything! Me and my gyno were kind of shocked (I wasn't taking any pain killers). Since then I have been so happy with my decision. Yes, my periods are heavier and a day or two longer (the extra days are spotting) but it is totally worth it to me to have NON-HORMONAL birth control that I don't have to worry about putting on/in right before sex. If I were not in a committed relationship I would not have chosen this method as any STD aquired while using an IUD is magnified and can be very dangerous. I have tried many birth control pills (and the ring), and condoms and the IUD has been by far the best option for me.

Other	mandy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/11/2011 4:20:50 PM	I had my IUD inserted 2 weeks ago and I won't lie, it hurt having it inserted!  But it was over pretty quick and I would have no qualms about doing it again.  I took Ibuprofen before and for the next few days.  I had it inserted on a Tuesday and was supposed to start my period on Saturday.  I pretty much started my period soon after it was inserted and cramped Tuesday through Friday.  The cramping is bearable with ibuprofen, so I'm not concerned about that plus it's supposed to get better after the first couple months.  The thing that concerns me is I'm still spotting 2 weeks later.  Hoping that will get better.  I'll try to remember to get back on and post in a couple months.
Other	ParaFan, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/11/2011 9:38:21 AM	I got the ParaGard 3 months after giving birth and it was really simple.  I read a lot of reviews (and was pretty nervous), but the procedure went really well.  The doc gave me Cytotec the night before to dilate my cervix.  The insertion was really easy, and I didn't have any cramping.  I was a little nervous for a few days following insertion because I kept wondering if I was going to move the wrong way and do some sort of internal damage.  I've had it for a little over a month, and haven't had any problems.

Other	ladymoonlily, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/1/2011 5:39:15 PM	I got the paraguard put in today. The probe that measures your uterus hurt the most I mean really hurt. I was squeezing the nurses hand. The actual insertion didn't hurt. Its been six hours and I still have bad cramps I still think it will be worth it in the end though. No hormones and birth control for 10 years is great. I got depressed from the hormones with birth control. I haven't had any kids so that may have been why it was so painful. I have a new respect for women who have had kids and especially ones that didn't get an epidural. My doctor sprayed some numbing stuff on my cervix that shot probably would have been better. I would recommend taking some ibuprofen before hand and afterwards. The cramps have actually effect my digestive tract so be prepared with that.

I was off of my period for about two weeks and as soon as they inserted it, I was back on my period.  Just about all month long, I am spotting, if I'm not heavily menstruating.  Even if I'm not on my period, when my husband and I have intercourse, I usually always bleed.  The ONLY good thing about this is that I don't have to remember anything and you can be spontaneous as long as you don't mind slight bleeding everytime.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone really.  The cramps as well are horrible. 
Other	KristiRenee, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/31/2011 6:05:14 PM	I got my ParaGard about 3 months ago when my second daughter was 1 month old. The insertion was slightly painful and a little uncomfortable afterwards for about an hour or two. However, I did take 2 ibuprofen before I got it inserted. I was still nursing when I got the PG and quit about a month ago and just got my first period 3-4 days ago. The cramping was pretty painful 2-3 days before I started bleeding, but I have always had really bad cramping so I was used to it. However, I am bleeding REALLY REALLY heavily and I am on day 4. Usually the first day or two I will bleed pretty heavy (never THIS heavy though) and then it will lighten up for the next 3 days and I will be done. My periods used to only last 4 maybe 6 days. Before I got my period, I had a lot of thick, mucousy discharge as well that I have never had before, other then when I was pregnant. I am satisfied with this method regardless of all that is mentioned above because of its ease of use. It is not horomonal so I haven't changed physically or emotionally and I don't have to  worry about remembering anything. I would recommend this to any mother out there, I have heard it hurts worse for ladies who haven't had kids, so I can't speak for them. But I certainly give it 2 thumbs up!!!
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	3/31/2011 10:07:18 AM	I am a 26 year old mother, wife, and nurse practitioner. I have had the paragard for about nine months now after the birth of my son. At first, nothing had changed. I had a little spotting for the first two or so months,  but nothing too bothersome. But lately my menses has been heavier and painful. I had cramps before, but not like this. To me is worse than contractions. However, I also have to admit, its not like that every month. Some months its heavy bleeding with hardly any cramping. Some months its painful cramps with moderate bleeding. And of course, for one month so far, it has been both! But other than those few days for the month, its pain-free, no worry birth control. So the paragard has its pros and cons. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/30/2011 11:51:08 PM	I decided to get Paraguard after struggling with depression and mood swings with hormonal options. I had the insertion done today and it was extremely painful. I have never given birth and the doctor said she could not get my cervix wide enough the first few tries, and i think this greatly contributed to the pain. Once it was in i felt slightly faint, but overall not too bad. I have had an on and off pinching cramping sensation for the last 8 hours but ontherwise feel just fine. I am so far very satisfied with my decision and really like how long term and easy it is! I'd much rather deal with pain then depression

Got it today and the only thing that hurt was the pain relief shot I got n the hip which burned for about a minute. Barely felt a little pinch when they clamped my cervix, didn't feel anywhere close to a cramp or contraction. I was very scared before the appointment but actually had nothing to worry about. Just cramping a little bit now. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/27/2011 4:55:48 PM	Im on day 3 post paragard insertion, the cramps and spotting are not to bad nothing that ibuprophen wont help. I do notice that im a little bloated, but that could be from me taking in to much air during the procedure because of nervousness. The procedure itself is uncomfortable, the worst part for me is the clamp that they use to stabalize your cervix, its like a constant dull pinching feeling. Im very happy so far with my choice, looking forward to my 12yrs not having to worry about birth control... yay

I've never been on birth control because of the side effects that come with them so after hearing about this non-hormonal method I then decided hey what is there to lose. I was extremely afraid that the insertion would hurt but my doctor surprised me with an shot of Anastasia in my vagina I felt almost nothing! My doctor said most places do not numb u down there OUCH thank god I was numbed. I had spotting right away and a little bit of cramping but nothing too bad. If u don't focus on the cramps they go away lol. I hope my period isn't to heavy like everyone is saying.

I have broken plenty of bones before (I am an athlete) and nothing can compare to this pain. I have taken about 15 ib's today and nothing is helping. I picked this method bc I did not want any hormones, however, I am having second thoughts. Maybe a little weight gain is worth it. Please carefully consider this when you get the IUD, also remember how you're not going to be wanting any sex when you're in a lot of pain!

It was uncomfortable and I think i had a few seconds of mild pain but not much more intense than a pap smear, and it was very quick.  My doctor was very confident that it would not hurt and she was right.  She is a very gentle doctor, pap smears don't really hurt with her either.  She put it in during the 5th day of my period and I do have one child so I'm sure that made it easier.  I took 4 advil this morning and I drove myself.  Went to work after the appointment.  I am now having mild cramps and spotting.  I have endometriosis but my periods are usually very light with no cramps.  Will update in a few weeks or a month to tell you how it's going. I was anxious about pain so I thought I should share this positve experience.  good luck to you.

It caused me to have pain for 3 out of 4 weeks for the first 6 months I was on it.  The insertion was painful and then for 4 months I had terrible sharp, shooting pain down my right leg and into my rectal area. Severe cramping constantly... Eating, sleeping, and just breathing were difficult.  My period was like 2 weeks long.

It didn't hurt a bit, I'm actually surprised some said it hurt them.  We plan to have more children, but not for a few years.  I'm not pregnant so it works!  My only qualm is that when my monthly came back (I nursed so it took a while) it is now uber-heavy!!  I mean SUPER-DUPER HEAVY!! Other than that I think Paragard is great--no hormones and protection for up to 10 years, can't beat it!

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/5/2011 7:46:06 PM	So Ive been dying to write about my Paragard experience so far. Im 30 and have never been pregnant (nor do I intend to ever be). Im not going to lie, the insertion hurt, and I was very anxious. I went to PP, I told the NP I was nervous to which she replied Dont be nervous I did 6 of these yesterday and we have never had a perforation (sp) happen at this clinic. So theres an argument for placement at PP. It felt roughly like someone pinched my uterus and shoved a pin through the pinched skin... however the initial pinch was the worst. Everyone was so nice and one of the assistants held my hand during the procedure. That being said I would do it 5xs again to get off hbc. Insertion was Monday; I bled for 3 days after even though it was not time for my period. I kept on a strict ibuprofen regimen until the bleeding stopped.  I was really starting to worry about having bleeding for months like some of the ladies. So Im very grateful. I wouldnt recommend doing anything after placement due to the cramping and the increased anxiety level; I also had my bf drive.  I technically could have worked or drove, but I was still quite nervous. Additionally I get nauseous with pain. I had sex on the second day, which actually ended up going well, despite SO concerns. I should have never told him about the strings, he never noticed them, and was quite concerned when I mentioned that he might. So Im looking forward to my first paragard period, I will update when it comes. 
Other	ginabean, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	3/3/2011 1:03:59 PM	I just had ParaGard inserted last week on February 25th. I'm 25, have never had a child. I admit, it hurt...a lot. When the doctor warned me I would feel a pinch as he passes the IUD up to my uterus, it felt more like a stinging/burning sensation in the most vulnerable part of my body. And immediately, I began to feel intense cramping pains once it was in place. It was very uncomfortable. I had to wait 30 minutes in the parking lot before I felt safe to drive home because the pain was so intense. The 3 Motrin I took did not kick in until hours later. I rested in bed for the rest of the day and put a heat pack over my pelvic muscles. By the time the medicine began working, it was 7 p.m. There was a little spotting right after it was put in place, but overall, I cant complain too much about bleeding. And after a week, I don't feel any discomfort. I do not want children at this time, as I am too fixated on my career/ life. I'm glad there is a no hormone option for women with minimal side-effects.

I am 19 yrs old and have never had any childern.I wanted Paragard because its hormone free. I have never taken a hormonal b.c. I was expecting it to be much more painful then it was. It was quick and I was able to go back to work right after insertion. I just had my period and my flow was much heavier and lasted a week when before it only lasted about 4 days,I have had mild cramps everyday since getting it but ibprofen makes them go away.

My only complaint is that my last three periods have been heavier and longer than usual with more cramping; according to the website this is a temporary side effect that subsides after a few months. My cycle has stayed pretty regular, and for some reason I've noticed an increase in my libido.    
Other	katie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	2/25/2011 4:44:49 PM	I had the copper IUD in for about a month.  It was uncomfortable, like bobby pin stuck inside my abdomen somewhere. Sex was very uncomfortable. But I thought this would pass. My husband and I went on vacation, when things really got bad. He said he could feel it poking him when we had sex, and my pain became worse with sex too.  On the plane ride home I doubled over the whole way, this little device ruined our trip.  I went to the doctor when I got we got home.  They did an ultrasound, I believe.  They said it had slipped and was kind of hung up in there, and gave me the choice to replace it, I said take it out.  It was torture.  Having the IUD removed was worse than inserting it.  It felt like a large fish hook being yanked out of vagina. I broke down as soon as I left the office, my doctor was not sympathetic (no, I was not after pain meds).  When I got home I went to the restroom and lost what had to be at least a pint of blood in the process.  I didn't call my OB after this, I was in too much shock, I've had a normal cycle since.  Horrible experience. 
Other	mommy1919, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/24/2011 8:39:23 PM	I had paragard inserted yesterday.While I cant really comment yet on it's effectiveness and or my satisfaction I will say that getting it put in was not as bad as I thought. It was uncomfortable and I did cramp. My gyn likes to wait until you have your period b/c its easier. It took a little longer then for most b/c my uterus is tilted. I will say it was all worth it to not have to remember a pill/patch/or ring. I have one child already and dont plan on another for awhile. Im glad I wont have to deal with hormones affecting my sex drive,weight,mood,etc. So I would highly recommend paragard to people who are looking into it.
Other	LadyOfTheLake, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	2/21/2011 9:27:19 PM	Hi All - Before you get a copper IUD I would highly suggest getting a hair analysis of your copper levels. I got the paragard and within one month started having strange emotional side effects similar to what I experienced on hormonal birth control (also the reason I opted not to be on the pill). After a few months of these issues and a lot of research I got a hair analysis done. My copper levels were through the roof. This is something that will rarely be addressed by medical doctors but be sure to look into this before having a heavy metal put in your body. 
Other	stargazer, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/18/2011 7:37:36 PM	I just had my ParaGard inserted earlier this morning. I am 21 years old with no children. I decided not to take any medicine before the insertion. The whole insertion process took about 10-15 min. and because I had not had any children I had to be dilated a little. There were cramps when it was being inserted and they continued through this afternoon. I have to say there were some intense cramps but I just went home, took some ibuprofen, and laid down for a while and while I still have a little cramping I am feeling fine and ready to return to work tomorrow. I read many reviews before my appointment so I think I was expecting more pain than I had but I am very happy with my decision for ParaGard!  
Other	Liv, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	2/16/2011 2:44:00 AM	i just had it inserted today, i have to say it wasnt horrible as i thought it would be. my doctor was very gentle. i just had my baby 8 weeks ago so i guess my cervix is still a little open, not painful at all just a little uncomfortable at first. so far, no cramping just very mild spotting. will see in the next few weeks, months.
Other	Inkeddoll, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	2/14/2011 2:26:58 AM	I've had my Paragard IUD for over 6 months now and all I can say is it's amazing!!! Yes, at first I cramped a little more than usual and sometimes my periods last a little longer than they did before, but it's worth it not having to remember a pill everyday and not worrying about taking a bunch of hormones all the time. I've never had children and don't plan to anytime soon. It's nice having a birth control with very limited side effects (In my case at least) and no real chance of &quot;user error&quot;.
Other	Satisfied, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	2/8/2011 4:01:44 PM	I got Paraguard when my son was 2 months old because i was breastfeeding and it was one of my limited options. It hurt a little bit going in and I had cramps and nausea for nearly two weeks. Still now and then i get period cramps and nausea eventhough i still dont have periods. So far so good though and no weight gain infact I have been losing weight. Paraguard over all was a good decision, only problem is it is going to be expensive to remove because I want another baby!!
Other	BreathinEasy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/7/2011 7:33:22 PM	So I just had the Paragard inserted today.  The insertion was a total breeze!  One cramp when my uterus was being measured, but the actual insertion was not painful at all.  My doctor did inject a little lidocaine which helped.I took 800mg Ibuprofin pre-insertion and it's been a few hours, and no cramps yet.  So far, so good!  So happy I chose to do this.
Other	The_Missus, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/4/2011 12:45:28 PM	After years of struggling with side effects from various hormonal birth control methods, I chose to have the Paragard IUD inserted at my six-week postpartum appointment after the birth of my daughter. The process was uncomfortable but not painful; I would describe the sensation as a strong abdominal cramp. My period did not return until I weaned my daughter,  fifteen months later, and it was undeniably HEAVY; I actually called the hospital because I was convinced I might be bleeding out! However, I believe this was attributable to it being my first postpartum period, rather than to the Paragard. In the subsequent year and a half, my menstrual cycles have settled down and are now considerably lighter and less painful than they were before I had my baby and the IUD. I do spot occasionally between periods, but have no cramping or other discomfort when my period does arrive. I also find it much easier to control my weight and mood without extra hormones coursing through my body.
Other	Cithergel, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	1/29/2011 2:25:39 AM	I was on the Depo for about 3 years, tried the pill and eventually banned hormones, citing weight gain. After a 1.5 year break I dropped 30lbs and went ahead with the Paragard. 20yo, no children.. was very worried about pain and side effects. JUST DO IT. Insertion hurt a rather lot, but Vicodin really helped. It's a big, dull pain, but I srsly didn't even know the moment she put it in, just when she measured. I was so woozy I needed to sit for a while afterward. Also something I hadn't heard about from anyone was bleeding after insertion. Not spotting, just bleeding. That was a fun surprise. Afterwards I mostly felt unstable, guts hurt pretty bad for several hours, but not several days.With Depo/Progestin I spotted a lot.. almost no spotting now, maybe 1-3x/month. Cramps are a little more present, but Ibuprofen will turn that frown upside down. (: And yes I do have a heavier bleed, but that's no real issue, they sell tampons for that.Love my PG overall, sex is hassle-free, no abnormal hormone related side effects (strange hairs, lack of sex drive, whathaveyou).. no weight gain! Highly recommended. Not to sound like your mom, but ditch the drugs! Keep life simple. :D
Other	NewEnglandMommy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	1/28/2011 11:49:15 PM	I had Paragard since August.  I read a magazine while inserted.  It was a dull pain that made me a bit nausea but I walked out fine and haven't had any pain since!  I love that my husband and I can have spontaneous sex, and I really love that I don't have to do anything but check the strings once a month.  I couldn't take the pill anymore so this method was a no-brainer for me.  The only issue I have is with the in-between spotting, brownish discharge and a gel-like discharge.  It sounds gross, I know.  And it is gross...I hate that!  It puts oral sex with my husband at a stand-still because I never know if I have spotted or not, at any given time during my cycle.  My periods are a little bit heavier the first day or 2 as well, but nothing that bothers me.  Despite the gross discharge in between periods, which I'm hoping will lessen with time, I'm so glad I made the decision to get a non-hormonal IUD.

Not the biggest deal - but certainly closes down some of the rides on THIS theme-park! Paragard went in fairly easy and has stayed put... I'm even able to use a menstrual cup with it:) but overall am a bit irritated about the gross pre-period. Glad to not be on the hormones though!
Other	mommyof3, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/25/2011 11:32:45 AM	Had the paragard inserted on January 17th and I love it so far.  I'm a mother of three, in my mid 30's and only taken bc after the birth of our first child and that was awful!  DH and I researched a lot and decided on a hormone free route.  I was initially very nervous because of all the negative reviews.  But this is the best!  I went in on the second day of my period to have it inserted and the only real pain came from the shot and cleansing.  That part was painful but lasted just a couple of minutes, the insertion was not painful and was done in a snap.  Went home and took some ibuprofen &quot;just in case.&quot;  I have not had any cramping and my period ended in 4 days...I regularly have a period for 7 days.  I have had a little pinkish discharge - put nothing like a period.  So far this is the best decision and it is worth the couple of minutes of discomfort.  I would say at least give it a try, you may be pleasantly surprised (I would strongly suggest getting it while on your period - that is recommended).  I like knowing that we can be spontaneously intimate and that my bc is working without having to worry about it each time.  
Other	AmberR, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	19-24	1/23/2011 1:11:16 PM	I just got the paragard inserted 2 days ago, it was a little painful after it was inserted. I drove my self home with mild cramping. Once home I put a corn sack on me and got the pain to lower down some. By the end of the night I was in tears cause it  was hurting so bad! Kept taking pain meds as said. Warmed up my corn sack mostly all night to help the pain. Finally got it under control and could get some sleep. Next day cramps were off and on not to bad... So far I love it, I won't have to worry about taking the pill and all of the problems that came with it... I have never had kids and the doctor said there was no problems at all getting the paragard inside me... I am very glad with the decision of getting this!!!! So far so good. Will check back in a couple of months to see how it is!!!! 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	1/16/2011 11:25:13 PM	I had paragard inserted two weeks ago. The procedure was painful, but breif. I am 23 and did not want hormonal BC. It basically feels like normal period cramps, on and off, or all the time. The first three days after, it was just like my normal period cramps, heavy spotting and blot clots. It went away for a few days and now the cramps and spotting is back. I'd rather be in some pain than on BC--as I see it. I will be doing Rythmn method as well, to be double sure. However, I can't tell if this is my period or just spotting. Since I'm 23, No Kids, my OBGYN told me my uterus was barely big enough and it might fall out. So I check strings alot. So far, I would defniately recommend it!
Other	kmo, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/14/2011 3:03:04 AM	IUD insertion included two major cramps and that was it - I had slight cramps for about two hours after that.  Over the next month I had random cramps for just a moments time.  When my first period came after insertion it was the same as my periods had been before I started taking BC pills... the flow was slightly heavy, but I had no cramps.I was expecting horrible pain after reading other reviews.  In reality, I think people who are unsatisfied are more likely to post a comment.  This IUD has been the very best choice for me.  Little to no pain.  Every body reacts differently to medication.

Then after a few months I lost my period. But then in two months I would always get it back. I had 2 false pregnancies, and 3 miscarriages. As of today, 1-13-11 (I got in 12-16-07) a little over three years it fell out. And I have been hurting very badly for 4 hours! I have talked to the doctor, who said just relax and the pain will go away. It does what it said it would do. But the pain involved is just to great to bare. Thank God it fell out!

Having 2 small children I'm lucky to remember to brush my teeth let alone take a pill daily or change a patch each week. Like many other reviewers I have heavier periods that I did on BCPs, and my PMS symptoms are much as they were when I was a teenager (cramps, back pain and fatigue). However I feel like the trade-off is worth it.

This is a GREAT option! My periods are Luke they were before I was on the pill, so heavier but not terrible. I plan on having more kids in a few years and once I do I will get this again. It is pricey and most insurance doesn't cover it. 
Other	bree, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	1/7/2011 6:40:36 PM	i have had my paraGard for 1 year now and i like that fact that i dont have to worry about taking the pill everyday. The only thing i hate about it is the horrible cramps and the acne i get. Usually for me i get the cramps a week befor my period and it feels like im in labor all over again. My periods have become irregular and very very heavy. i was thinking of switching to mirena but one of my friends has it and she says she sometimes misses her period which makes her worry beacuse she does not know if she is pregnant. overall except for the 7 days of horrible intense cramps and bleeding i like it.
Other	Melylynn, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/5/2011 9:26:22 PM	I am a 24 yr old who has not had any babies yet. I had my ParaGard inserted 3 weeks ago. The insertion was uncomfortable and painful (sharp pain that radiated and made me woozy/dizzy). My doctor gave me 2 pills to take prior to insertion to soften my uterus. To insert the device the Dr. had to dilate my uterus in order to safely insert the ParaGard. Not fun. He then proceeded to measure me inside to make sure the device would fit. That was another sharp stabbing pain that made me jolt. He then inserted the Paragard, removed the dilation device and cut my strings. The procedure took about 15 minutes (which feels never ending). I felt cramping immediately (my uterus was not happy).  I felt better standing than laying down. It is definitely important to take someone with you because you never know how your body is going to react. I was unable to drive. My ParaGard was inserted during the middle of my period. The next day I felt much better (strangely aware of my groin area though). No cramping for the next two weeks. Two weeks after insertion, I got my period again. This started with the similar cramping experienced during the insertion, a bit sharp. Because I had been on the pill 2 yrs, this period started out strange. It was dark and thick. I am now on my 8th day(which is 3 days longer than my normal periods before the pill), and it is very liquid and heavy. My body is experiencing a withdrawal from the hormones of the pill and an unrecognized object in my uterus, so I forgive it. Hopefully after 2 months this will lessen. It has been interesting and somewhat nerve wrecking because this is a delicate part of a woman's body. But so far, so good. I will update my post a few months down the road and hopefully my periods will have less cramping and shorter periods (even if heavy).With the pill I experienced a huge drop in my sex drive, headaches, weight gain, and irritability. If you need a BC with no hormones, this is a great choice. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	1/5/2011 6:12:44 PM	I had ParaGard inserted yesterday. For the past 2 years I've had the Mirena IUD. I decided to change to ParaGard because I completely lost my sex drive which is a known symptom of Mirena, and I did not like the high risk of blood clots after removal. I wanted to go with something that was hormone free and something that allowed me to get my monthly period. So far I am satisfied with my choice. Insertion was a bit uncomfortable, but it didn't last long. Since I already had an IUD inserted, I didn't cramp as much as I did with the first one. Today I am feeling some minor cramps that come and go. They are bearable and from what I've read they will go away once my body adjusts to my new IUD.  
Other	Sentenced, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/3/2011 6:58:16 PM	I decided to get the paragard because anytime I was on the pill I would experience horrible anxiety, and getting off of the pill sent me to the ER a numerous amount of times; so I figured I'd never want to go through that again. This is the last option out there for me - so I went ahead an made an appt. The Dr shot my cervix with a dose of Lidocane to numb the insertion area. I can say I think this really made a difference - I was just a bit woobily from the Lidocane if anything. I had taken 600 mg Motrin before hand to help with cramping as well. So far nothing but slight cramping - I got this at the tail end of my period and it has extended it a bit. One must remember that the copper IUD creates a hostile environment for sperm to try to kill them - immense bleeding is your body's way to replenish itself. Makes me sleepy - but it's worth it. Everyone's body will respond differently. Hopefully this will continue to remain as painless as it's been so far.
Other	loveit, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/3/2011 2:18:40 PM	I have had paragard IUD for about 2 months now. I am 20 years old with no kids. The reason I got it was because of the amount of issues ive had with the birth controls that I have tried. Insertion was pretty painful for about 10 minutes. I would say its worth it now because now I do not have to worry about taking a pill every day &amp; no hormones. I had cramping for a few days &amp; every once and a while I get a little cramping( nothing severe). My periods are about 6 days. After reading all of the reviews I was very scared to get it but I do not regret it at all!! me &amp; my boyfriend love having it and im very glad on my decision. I hope this review helped out for younger people who havent had kids.

I was getting the Depo shot, but was gaining too much weight. My periods are heavier &amp; longer but I will take that over beening huge &amp; uncomfortable any day. The insertion was quick &amp; painless. The 1st couple of days after insertion, that was a weird feeling but after that, u wouldnt even think about it.

After trying hormonal birth control, diaphram and condoms, I love this IUD.  The ease of use is great.  Insertion was extremely quick...over in a snap.  I had a little cramping but nothing to write home about.  Mu first period was a little heavy, but again, I was expecting worse.  I have regular periods with a slightly more cramping but usually do not have to take anything for pain.  My partner has never commented on feeling strings (he loves the freedom too).  The only thing I do experience is spotting about a week before my period. It is a annoying but a small price to pay in my book.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/8/2010 11:11:59 PM	This is my 2nd time having it. 1st time I had mild contraction-like cramping with insertion that lasted a second or 2. Took 2 Motrin for cramping once later that day while shopping.  No changes to period at all. Had it removed 9 months later to try for another baby...conceived immediately. Today no cramping felt with insertion at all. Mild menstrual-like cramping at one point today, but quickly went away without treatment. I love ParaGard and plan to keep this one for 10 years only to replace it with another one.
Other	 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		12/8/2010 12:19:34 PM	I have had the paraguard about 6 months now.  The insertion was uncomfortable and not painful.  The uncomfort lasted about 2 to 3 days.  Periods have definitely heavier and crampier.  Overall I am very happy with my decision to get this treatement.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	12/7/2010 12:43:48 PM	I had my Paragard inserted about 6 months ago. I have a 2 1/2 yr old son at home and the insertion was nothing compared to the 17 hours of labor! It was mildy uncomfortable and I had cramping for a couple of days. Ibruprofen helped but only some. Overall the pain was bearable. My husband could feel the strings during sex so I had my doctor clip the strings and he can still feel it from time to time. My periods are much heavier and I experience much more cramping than I have in the past. Overall, it's been worth it. However, lately I have been having constant spotting and my periods are very irregular. I am going to have it checked out and I am really hoping I can keep the Paragard in. I highly recomend it to anyone. A very safe, effective and easy form of birth control!
Other	ljepica, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	12/6/2010 3:21:40 PM	I've had Paragard (copper IUD) for 2 months now. The insertion was very uncomfortable but not painful. I had heavy spotting for about a week after the procedure, then, it stopped. I didn't have any cramps, just spotting. Once my regular period started it was much heavier than usual but didn't last any longer than normal. In my second month of use I didn't have any spotting (that was my main concern because I hated wearing tampons and having sex). The only downside is that my periods are starting earlier (every 27-28 days) and they used to be every 30-33 days. I would still definitely recommend Paragard because it's non-hormonal, just give your body some time to accept it. Hope this was helpful for those considering it. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	11/22/2010 6:46:12 PM	I had the ParaGard inserted 3 months ago. The first day my cramps were so bad I was useless the rest of the day, but since then it hasn't been bad. My cramps are worse than before and my flow is a bit heavier, but its manageable. Insurance covered everything but a simple copay. $20 for 10 years of protection that I don't have to remember everyday? It was an easy choice. Have someone there to drive you home and hold your hand when it is inserted and take some Tylenol after, and you'll be fine.

You don't pay for it monthly, you can have it taken out anytime, and you don't have to remember to take it. My periods did however become longer, heavier, and I cramped more, but I was regular until this month. I went to the doctor today to find out what was going on and I have defied odds and am pregnant even though it is perfectly positioned still. I had to have it removed for both our safety, but they did not see a fetus on the sonogram only a sack. It may be too early to tell if it's there or if I am miscarrying. There is also I chance I will miscarry from the removal. I feel bad that a device I opted for may kill my baby. I know it is rare for all this to happen, but I will never use it again. I will know better next week if my baby is ok.

The first period after the installation was a week early and the heaviest I've ever had.  BUT- the 2nd one was right on time and back to normal, only 1 day longer than expected.  Ladies, give it time; having this inserted may be one of the smartst things I've ever done. I know every woman is different but this is coming from one that has had numerous problems. I don't worry about anything, I can't feel it at all; I did have some pain for the first few days after insertion, but it goes away.  I will never regret having this done.
Other	Iladelphqt, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	11/17/2010 8:39:25 PM	Like many other users I have adverse reactions to hormonal birth control.  I have two children and am considering myself &quot;Done.&quot; I have been using a diaphram since college and honestly am completely sick of having it in there close to every night.  Since I am only 29 I am looking for something non-permanent.  My OB tried to push me on the Mirena but after the reviews on this site I quickly vetoed that.  I had the IUD inserted on Monday.  The insertion was not painful, just uncomfortable.  Once I felt the device open, that's where the fun began.  I could feel something in there, and as minutes clicked away the cramps got worse and worse.  I have had two children, two miscarriages and two kidney stones in my short 29 years so I am familiar with pain.  These cramps were radiating to my back the same way early labor does.  I am glad I had off the rest of the day but I did go to work after a restless night.  Now three days later the cramps are much less, I am still bleeding but that's fine I am mid cycle so I expect that.  The issue I am having is the lower back pain.  Its not cramping, its constant.  It makes me wince, and I know it is due to the Paragard.  Hopefully it will ease up, for me back pain is a deal breaker.  I will update this next week but so far I got what I expected except for the lower back pain.  
Other	mamaprecious99, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	11/11/2010 5:30:38 PM	I'm only 19, no babies and I really wanted to go hormone free. I was previously on implanon and gained so much weight that I didn't want to go back to that. I had Paragard put in about four hours ago, and it was painful. It wasn't even so much going into my cervix as it was when she had to measure my uterus. And then even after it was all done, it still hurt inside. I have been having bad cramps and can't take iuprofen for medical reasons so I'm basically on my own. I really hope that today is the worst day. I just finished my period a week ago so I don't have to worry about that experience for a while. All in all, if the cramps get better or I find some way to manage this pain and the strings don't interfere with sex, then I will be satisfied. I never want to go back to being 30+ pounds overweight. Take someone with you to the appointment to get it in and prepare yourself for bad cramps. When I think about the alternative though (nine months of pregnancy, labor and a baby) this is a small price to pay.

The insertion was painless in my opinion. Although my mid-wife informed me it would be less painful because of recently giving birth. I have been experiencing cramping and mild spotting, but nothing I wasn't informed about. I am currently breastfeeding, which will keep me from having a period for a while so I am unable to give my opinion about how heavy the bleeding is.  So far so good. I chose to get the IUD inserted because I was tired of taking hormonal birth control pills that affected my mood, skin, and weight. Also, love the fact that I can easily have the IUD removed if and when my husband decide on having another little one. I'm strongly recommending this product so far.

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/14/2010 12:04:57 PM	After having read all of the WebMD user reviews for Paragard, I was very terrified of getting the procedure. Because I'd heard from a co-worker about how much she loved the IUD, though, I knew I would go through with the process. I had the insertion done yesterday, and I would now recommend it to EVERY woman! I have never been pregnant, so I was expected a fair amount of pain during the procedure. I felt only about five seconds of mild discomfort, and I have a pretty low tolerance to pain. Took some ibuprofen immediately and took a few more late in the day. I did feel cramps on and off throughout the first day, but nothing worse than normal cramps, and they are completely gone today. DO IT! Don't let all the user reviews scare you off--Paragard is amazing!

First few periods were so heavy that I had to change myself every 45 minutes to an hour. Then the heavy periods were every 15 days. Now....I have been bleeding non-stop for a month. My doctor keeps telling me that it is going to take a while to adjust. I am miserable and want it removed. This is the worst decision I have ever made
Other	Momof1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/6/2010 1:35:55 PM	I had my Paragard inserted 1 week ago.  I won't lie- it was uncomfortable, but only for a couple of minutes.  I did have some spotting for about 3 days, nothing much.  I had no cramping, no pain at all. My husband says he can't feel anything and I now have peace of mind over not getting pregnant again (we have an 11 year old) and I love not being on the pill anymore.  After insruance, I only paid $10 out of pocket.  Definitely worth it for that reason too!! I would recommend it to anyone who has had a baby.
Other	summerwhitney, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	10/3/2010 8:03:19 PM	I am 23 yrs old and I had the paragard inserted two months ago. I have had no kids and decided to get the paragard due to the fact that it is hormone free, and I could no longer deal with the hormones in regular BC. The insertion was horrible. I highly advise having someone take you. I had to drive myself home and thought I might crash because I was in so much pain. I love the fact that I never have to worry about taking bc again, and dealing with all the excess hormones, but it is a different struggle with the extra cramps. My cramps have lessened somewhat, but they are more severe than normal menstrual cramps. I carry ibuprofen with me everywhere and take about 4 at a time when I need it. My flow is pretty normal, it's obviously a little more heavy than if I was on regular BC, but it's not really that much heavier. I would recommend the paragard to plenty of people. I would also recommend having someone take you, and even asking your doctor for a prescription pain reliever, I know I will be when I have it removed. But overall I am happy with it and I'm so glad I don't have to worry about taking the pill ever again and having to deal with the nasty side effects of extra hormones.
Other	no generic BC, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	9/25/2010 11:33:32 PM	The ParsGard T is fool proof but does have it's price. I have been on BC before I had children and did not have a good experience with it.  Pharmacist's always give generic, so.. was on 2 different pills and bleed every day!!!! Got the Paragurad because I thought great, no hormones. WRONG!!! My cramps literally felt like contractions for the first 3 months. Periods, almost 2 years later are EXTREMELY Heavy!! Sucks at night when you have to wake up 3 times to change yourself! I now just use one of my kids' diapers. I am trying again hormonal BC. Before they gave me the Paraguard, they gave me Ortho Tri cyclean. NAME BRAND!!! I was like WOW!! I didn't bleed all month and loved my period came when it was supposed to. My body is obviously sensitve to hormones so now I will ONLY get NAME BRAND BC. Every woman is different but I hate the Paraguard!! It is fool proof but too much misery 2 years later!!
Other	fblend, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	9/24/2010 11:47:58 AM	These reviews come from women who all have had children, so as someone who has never been pregnant, let me write of my experience getting the paragard inserted. It was absolutely horrible, but I wanted to desperately to get off of any type of hormonal birth control, so this was my only choice (other than condomes, etc). I am 22, and the insertion process was very, very painful. I took Ibuprofen before insertion and nearly fainted on the table. I cramped the whole day, with every few hours having especially bad &quot;spasms.&quot;Please, let those considering it not scare you however, I just am writing this for them to be better prepared in what to expect than I was. And every body is also different. For 12 years, not having to worry about getting pregnant, I think this one day of pain is worth it (even if it was the worst of my life). 
Other	VegasChick, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/22/2010 12:09:51 PM	I got the ParaGard 19 hours ago. As far as pain goes, it wasn't painful when I was measured. It was uncomfortable, and it took longer than the actual insertion. The insertion itself was painless. What did feel like bad menstrual cramps, was when my cervix was clamped. And the reason for that is that my cervix is at an angle and she had to manipulate it. But it was nothing unbearlable. I did spot for a few hours, but the bleeding is completely gone. I took 800mg of ibuprofen an hour before the procedure, though. And did take another 800mg dose about 3 hours after the procedure because I started to feel crampy. I do recommmend the ibuprofen, but you should take it at the first sign of pain, or else it might not work as you would like it to. The doc also said that I as soon as it was in I was protected. But I did some research, and found out that the risk of getting pregnant while on the ParaGard is higher during the 1st year. Especially during the months 1-3. I feel normal, no change, no pain or cramping. Just remember, everyone's body is different. And our bodies react differently to different foreign objects. It looks to me like I'll be very happy with ParaGard and happy with being covered for 12 years!! They're trying to make it 14! :)
Other	ellojenn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/20/2010 1:34:57 PM	I just got this in three weeks ago. The procedure was crampy but once it was done, I felt fine. I have one child and tried NuvaRing which gave me headaches and weight gain. I'm hoping this really works because the hubby and I do not want anymore kids at this time. I just had my period as well and while it was heavier for two days, it stayed the same length and I actually had no cramps. As long as this keeps going as it is, I'd recommend this to all of my friends

Other	StephK, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	8/19/2010 9:15:48 PM	I just got my Paraguard inserted today. I read a lot of reviews before hand that had me worried but I still went ahead with it and vowed to write my own review to assist others. I am 26 and don't have any children. I have been taking the pill for the last 10 years and was just sick of the mood swings with PMS and didn't want to take hormones anymore in addition to my insurance company not covering my pills anymore. I heard about Paraguard from my sister who just got it a few months ago. I did my research and figured it was the perfect fit for me. After all the awful reviews I read I was quite worried about the insertion process. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. It was painful but it was very fast also. So it was a lot of pain for a short amount of time. The measuring of the uterus was more painful than the actual insertion of the IUD. I get dizzy easily and have passed out a few times. I felt like I was going to after the procedure was over. I laid in the bed for a while and my doctor gave me some candy for sugar and some water and I felt fine after about 10 mins. The drive home was more painful as I had not been sitting up at all yet. It was tolerable though; just felt like menstrual cramps. It's been about 4 hours now and I still have cramps but don't know if they are from the IUD or my period since I was told I had to get it inserted when I was on my period. I would say I have moderate cramping but nothing intolerable. I think it will be worth it in the long run to not have to deal with hormones and worry about taking pills every day. I will report back after a few months with an update. I am worried about having heavier longer periods as I was told I would and more cramping, since I have very short, light, painless periods now.
Other	nire, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/9/2010 5:18:10 PM	Getting ParaGard inserted was painful, but expected.  Insertion only lasted a few minutes and I was able drive home afterward. I took 800 mg of ibuprofen every few hours for the next 24 hours and then I was fine.  My period was a little earlier and heavier than before, but that's a very small &quot;price&quot; to pay for not having to worry about birth control. One note: My boyfriend said he could feel the strings during sex.  At my one month checkup, I mentioned this to my doctor.  Turns out the strings were a bit too long and the doctor trimmed them a bit. Good communication with the doc = Problem fixed!I love Paragard for the convenience and the spontaneity it helps provide and I would wholeheartedly recommend it. 
Other	Lauralou, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	7/14/2010 6:56:13 PM	I have had severe hairloss due to the copper in the IUD. Please do your research about copper toxicity before you decide to go ahead with it. I have had the Paragard IUD for almost 2 years and my hairstylist pointed out my hairloss 6 months ago. It is getting gradually worse. I have had every test imaginable done on me and all have turned up fine. The only cause could be from the copper toxicity caused by the IUD. Everyone may not experience this same problem but do your research first and you decide if it is worth the risk. I would not trust only your doctors opinion. It is your health!
Other		5	5	2			6/18/2010 11:14:55 PM	I had the Paragard inserted 12 weeks after the birth of my son, because I wanted a dependable birth control method with no hormones. The insertion was just briefly uncomfortable.  During the first couple of months, my cycle seemed normal.  However, then my cycles became extremely heavy with cramps and blood clots.  While I had heavy bleeding in the past, the cramps and blood clots were new to me.  A year later and after speaking with my doctor, we decided the Mirena may be better to control the extreme bleeding and other symptoms. Also, my Paragard was too low, so she was going to remove it anyway.  It seems everything has the possibility of side effects, but I  will see how this works out. Good luck!
Other	***,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female		6/4/2010 12:17:33 PM	I had my IUD inserted awhile back and have been very pleased with the results. The insertion wasn't very painful but the following two days involved severe pain,cramping and bleeding. I have never had children so maybe that played a role.... I also cannot take any form of hormonal birth control after having a life-threatening complication while taking YAZ. Having a nonhormonal IUD gives more peace of mind and having no associated weight gain is nice! 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/28/2010 11:33:56 AM	My IUD was inserted in Feb 2006. On my last GYN visit a few months ago, I found out that it had been inserted in a lower position than where it needed to be. I thank God that it still worked!! I had it removed a few hours ago because I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. My GYN believes that a low dose birth control pill would be a better option for the PCOS. However, now I am having some regret of even having it removed. I've never been disciplined to take pills at the same time every day. So now I am afraid of becoming pregnant on the bill. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE PARAGARD IUD...NO SIDE EFFECTS, NO ESTROGEN!!
Other	bluesail2681, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	5/7/2010 5:34:21 PM	Had my paragard put in 5 hrs ago.had 1 child and cytotec prior and md still had to force thru cervix. u should definitely take something prior and request the numbing agent.pain probably depends on predisposed sensitivity there.some women just feel their uterus more.still have some cramping but even with the pain fresh in my mind the benefits outweigh the discomfort. its nothing compared to 24 hours of labor. no hormone complications or worry about a missed pill or expired ring.
Other	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/7/2010 4:13:31 PM	I had mine put in four days ago.  The insertion itself, while uncomfortable for less than a minute was not at all the worst pain I've ever experienced.  I had very little cramping &amp; went about my day afterward.  I had moderate bleeding for about 2 days, which tapered off &amp; now I'm not bleeding at all.  I did a ton of research on bc options before I opted to go with Paragard.  I didn't want to put synthetic hormones in my body, nor did I want to fuss with a condom or diaphragm everytime.  My gynecologist told me iud's are the best, yet most underused forms of contraceptions in the country.  It is definitely worth it.

Other	Alexis, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	25-34	4/9/2010 12:33:45 PM	Have had paragard for a week and probably getting it removed.  We chose paragard with our doctors advice because we aren't sure if we want to get pregnant again and medically I don't need to get pregnant again right away.     The procedure to put it in was painless.  But within an hour of getting the implant I started having some mild lower back pain.  I also had some cramping and spotting but no big deal.  As the week progressed the back pain became worse and it now is my whole back from my lower back to the neck and shoulders.  Never heard of that happening before.    I have an 8 week old daughter and the pain is making it difficult to give her my full attention.   I'm managing but its not easy.   The doc said periods would probably be heavy, and I figured no big deal I already have heavy periods but my gosh never have I had anything like this.  It started 2 days ago.  And honestly I don't even want to have sex anymore, after reading about this because I'm scared it won't work and I will get pregnant and it will be ectopic or if the pregnancy is in the uterus you are at a higher risk of miscarraige even with removal.   I don't want to be pregnant again any time soon but I definately don't want that.  Going to give it a few more days but Most likely going back to the pill.

Other	Abbeymarie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	3/31/2010 4:12:35 PM	I'm 24 years old and I have 1 child and I got the paraguard inserted about 8 hours ago.   After a somewhat difficult pregnancy and a long labor, I am not quite ready to get pregnant again any time soon.   I chose the paraguard because its good for up to 10 years and being that it isn't a hormonal birthcontrol there isn't that whole weight gain side effect.    I was really iffy about it at first, because I really wasn't sure how it worked.   But I'm glad we went with this choice.   It really didn't hurt at all to have it inserted.  There was one little pinch when the doc inserted it.  I had some mild spotting and cramping within the first hour but Ibuprofin fixed that.  It was a quick, painless procedure that didn't take more than 10 minutes.   I like that its supposed to be so effective I feel it really gives us time to decide if we want another child or not, it may be good for ten years but its nice that it can come out before then if we decide on another.   I like that after the first 2 weeks we don't have to worry about condoms, I don't have to go and spend 30+ dollars and get a new thing of pills every month.   I'm hoping that this will be a good method for us.

Other	Rachel G.T., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	3/24/2010 4:10:29 PM	I had the Paragard inserted a month ago. I am on my first cycle since insertion and it has been heavier than normal.  Which is what to be expected. The first week after Paragard was placed was the worse week by far.  I had severe cramping/bloating/weakness and general abdominal discomfort.  I called the nurse and she prescribed me ibuprofen 800s.  I suffered through the first week and after that, its been a breeze.  I will endure a slightly heavier period than normal, rather than forgetting to take/pick up/ refilling/paying for another BC pill.  It just works well for me. My spouse nor I have not had any problems with Paragard.

Yes it works, but I still have to take pills just to control the bleeding. I would highly recomment the Merina instead of Paraguard!!!
Other		5	5	4			3/15/2010 9:34:11 PM	I just had the Paragard IUD inserted about an hour ago and I feel fine! I was totally nervous going into it, and although the procedure was uncomfortable, it was absolutely nothing worse than my regular cramps I get each month (which aren't horrible). Hormones never worked for me, I would get crazy and have insatiable hunger so I'm loving the fact that this doesn't have any hormones. Nervous about my first period on it because I hear bad things about that too, so we'll see. So far it's fine tho! I recommend. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/9/2010 11:32:57 AM	I had the paragard inserted March 1st. I never have had children and was prepared for it to hurt. My doctor had me fill a pill to help soften my cervix. The part that hurt the most was the measuring. They wanted to do it twice to double check. The 2nd time wasn't as bad. I had another doctor in the room as well and inserting the IUD hurt as well. I had some cramping and laid down for about an hour or so before I had to go to work. I had cramping for the following few days. Nothing horrible. Period ended that Friday. I started spotting but that is normal since my body is getting used to the IUD. My boyfriend can't feel the strings. I'm glad to be on no hormones. I previously was using the ring and just fed up with it. I will update when I have my first period. I was told it can be heavy and cramping for the first few periods becuase of not being on hormones. I also considered the IUD because the cost is nothing compared to birthcontrol. I was paying 265$ a yr for the ring not including when I'd have infections from it, and the IUD was 500$ total for the apointment and insert. Considering the economy it was a good option for me.

The procedure itself wasn't so bad.  The best way to describe it is like someone pinching you from the inside of your uterus.  Got a little dizzy at the office had to lay for a while and drink some juice. Had cramps, nothing I haven't had. Seemed like the more that I moved the better the cramps got.  Was kind of poopy for a few days.  Like when I'm on my period.  My husband loves it!  He says he can't feel anything, and neither can I.  I would recomend it to anyone.  10 years of birth control built in.  No hormones. Plus if I want to have another child at any time I can go and get it removed.  It's been perfect for me.

Other	aebfraz, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/9/2010 8:44:09 AM	I have been on Yaz for two years following my son's birth but I really didn't want to keep up the hormones, especially after the emerging health issues associated with it. I researched and decided that Paragard fit my needs as far as no hormones needed and no daily reminder of where I was in my cycle.I was nervous after reading some reviews (&quot;Oh my gosh, I thought I was going to die from pain and blood loss!&quot;) but honestly, that was not my experience at all.  I had my appointment January 4th for the insertion. Because I have given birth before, there was no mention of anything to open my cervix. I've heard and read that if a gyn will insert a Paragard in a woman who hasn't given birth, she is likely to give some sort of medication for this purpose because the cervix is closed and tight and would be hard to insert the device into.The nurse did my procedure and it really wasn't bad. Yes, it did hurt but I just breathed normally and the nurse kept talking to me while she was measuring and then inserting the device.  The measuring was painful but different than a menstrual cramp. I would say that it was closer to a jab or pinch in the uterus.  Then the actual insertion was more like a bad cramp. On a side note, I was intrigued that I could actually feel the 'T' portion of the device opening in my uterus. I thought that was pretty interesting as all I ever have felt is cramps, never a specific feeling.The discomfort/pain lasted maybe a few minutes. Certainly not long enough to cause me to cry or carry on.  The doc gave me some pads becuase she said I could not wear tampons for at least 24 hours afterward (I wish I would have know that ahead of time, I would have brought my own pads! The nurse gave me the equivalent of a twin mattress to wear under my slacks!!!).During my first month I did have random spotting to lighter period -like bleeding. Annoying, but certainly nothing that I hadn't read about. My fear was my first period after insertion.I had read some horror
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/29/2010 7:32:17 PM	I would not recomend this to anyone who has not had a kid. Or who is not in a long term realtionship. The best method of birth control when used right is condoms HANDS DOWN but I know that is easier said than done. I only considered this and accepted the slight risk of steralization (THERE IS ONE)becuase It was the right fit for me I have three kids and I am definitly done. I just wanted somthing that was as close to accident proof as possible. I really think this birth control is wonderful and effective  but think about it... its in your body for ten years thats a very long time. I  shudder at the thought of young women with out children using this it just seems too heavy duty to me. I mean If you are the type of person who really cant remember to take the others types of birth control, and are dead set on a IUD then try Merana(sp?)its only for 5 years . And I really really recomend having a kid first before having this type of birth control(IUD) because your cervix is softened and the insertion will be almost painless .. uncomfortable yes but no chronic cramping ect. good luck ladies.
Other	mmorris25, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	1/29/2010 6:41:08 PM	The insertion literally took 5 minutes myself and my OB/GYN talked and laughed the entire time until she clamped my cervix!  I gasped, but it was little more than pressure and a prick of pain.  Then the insertion occurred I sat up put on my pants and walked out of the office with a smile.  On a scale of 1-10(smashed finger-childbirth) I would give it a 4.  I have one tattoo on my foot and the tattoo hurt worse than this IUD.  So far my body's hormones are balancing out and I dont feel crazy emotional like I did on the hormone treatments!  It's a great option for anyone, and I highly recommend it.  But DO take some sort of medicine before the procedure.  And carry Midol with you afterward.  YOU WILL NEED IT!

Other	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	1/4/2010 12:45:37 PM	Had paragard inserted on 12/12/09 after having my second child.  Was on my cycle the week before insertion.  The procedure was painless and only took a few minutes.  Had some spotting afterwards but now I'm on my cycle again and it's heavy (no cramping).  I'm hoping that the bleeding will subside.  During the brief period that I was not bleeding, neither my husband or I felt anything during intercourse.  If/when bleeding stops, I will be very satisfied with this method of birth control.  Also, the cost is very minimal for 10 years of protection.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	12/22/2009 2:59:50 PM	39, no kids. Had Paragard inserted last Friday. I took 400mg ibuprofen before. My OB shot me up w/ a numbing agent on the inside...sounds painful, but it did not hurt and neither did the procedure. A little cramping during, but nothing different than a pap. My OB said she now always numbs people first and it makes a huge difference w/pain. You might have to ask for it. I expected much more pain after reading post and was relieved when it did not hurt much at all. I cramped and spotted all weekend and some yesterday. We will see how the 1st period goes. Ibuprofen works well to help the cramps.  Good luck to all!

It could be that I'm a bit of a wuss because when I get my period I almost never cramp. I was a little nauseated and dizzy for about 15 minutes after. The cramps lasted for about 30 minutes for me, but I was able to go shopping afterwards. I found the more I move, the less the cramps hurt. I'm on the 4th day of my period so I'm not sure about spotting. I decided to go off the pill because it was killing my libido, and I'm ready to be hormone free. We'll see how it goes!
Other	Momof2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	25-34	12/3/2009 12:13:30 PM	After having Paragard inserted I had mild to medium cramping, Ibuprofin took care of that. The major issue I had with this was my husband was too sensitive.  During intercourse he could feel the string and it would ruin the mood. I was told that the string would soften over time.  After two months we had to start looking for a new method of birth control because of issue with the strings. Otherwise I could not tell that it was in there.
Other	veracruz19, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	12/2/2009 1:59:40 AM	I am 18 years old. And today at 1:30 pm had my Paragard IUD inserted. The pain of insertion was mild to moderate, but I generally have a good tolerance for pain. Also, during insertion expect to expeirence some intense/sharp cramps. Also, I might add, I have never been pregnant nor had a child. But overall, I wanted to share my expeirence for other woman and teens who are considering this form of BC. I have had mild cramps throughout the day. But nothing unbearable, considering my regular period cramps are considerably painful at times. But I didn't feel nausious and only light spotting after insertion, also, I was on the last day of my MC when I got it inserted. My best advice is do to a lot of research as I did before getting my IUD. I am hoping that the heavy periods and severe cramping will not be a side effect for me, but I think that is considerably less to worry about rather than the side effects of BC with hormones. But, I shall see how my period goes in about 3 to 4 weeks. The insertion was uncomfortable and will probably be painful for most. But that being said it has been a much better expeirence than I had intended. So wish me luck! And good luck to all of you fellow woman out there taking a step toward hormone free BC! I hope my expeirence stays a positive one. And I will follow up with another review in a few months..

I definately wouldn't recommend this to someone w/o previous pregnancies. It's been 5 weeks and I'm still bleeding.  Everyday I continue to have sharp cramping that sometimes takes my breath away, although the pain has gotten less painful than it was in the beginning. The insertion only took a few moments but hurt more than the pinch the OB warned me about. Sex is painful, although I'm not sure if that is directly related to the IUD or from a secondary cause. Even if my insurance doesn't cover another contraceptive device, this is coming out. I hate it and I feel that it has negatively affected my work and personal life by producing daily pain.
Other	Vaness, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	11/9/2009 7:34:13 PM	I had the paragaurd inserted today and let me tell you....I didn't have any novacane of any sort and I thought i was going to die from the pain. Cramping?  More then a huge pinch that lingered in my uterus. It took my breath away and my body instantly sweat. I had to breath out the pain. its been 7 hours and i still have a little pinch pain...almost like a reminder that it's still there. Otherwise, I just feel like i have back cramps and have been on the heating pad most of the day.  If you can take the day off, I would suggest it. Not only for the physical pain, but (if your like me) the stress of it all is draining!
Other	abbywall, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	11/2/2009 9:41:44 PM	So it has been only 4 hours since I had Paragard placed and so far so good.  I am 25 and no children so I was very nervous and I don't handle pain very well so I was a mess but my doctor gave me novicane injections to numb my cervix.  I thought it was going to hurt but surprisingly I didn't feel anything.  No poke or stinging at all.  The injections contained epinephrine so it made my heart race but that was no big deal.  They waited 15 minutes and then placed the IUD.  Next she dialated my cervix which gave me a pretty strong cramp that kind of lingered but I would give it a 4 out of 10 on the pain scale.  Then one more cramp when she was actually placing the device.  Untill about an hour ago the cramping was very minimal like maybe a 3 out of 10 and now its maybe a 4-5.  My thought is the novicaine is wearing off.  I have not had any spotting yet.  I decided on the paragard because it doesnt contain any hormones so hopefully I will still like it a month from now.  Hormones make me depressed and nuts.  Also Paragard offeres a payment plan which is about $41 a month.  You order it through them and they send it to your doctors office.  This really helped since my insurance does not cover the cost of the device.  Hope this helps
Other	kayla, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/2/2009 7:51:34 PM	I'm 24 and I've never been pregnant. I have had my paraguard for about 1 week. The insertion was uncomfortable, but it was over in a few seconds. I had it inserted on the first day of my period. Afterwards, I experienced moderate cramping for about 2 days, like period cramps- I normally hardly ever get cramps, but with some ibuprofen it wasn't a big deal. I went straight to my waitressing job after the insertion and was fine.  My period was on the heavy side, but not any longer than normal. I've been spotting for about 4 days but there is no pain and every day gets better. Oh, and the important part... I'm not pregnant and sex is wonderful and worry-free. I would recommend the IUD. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	10/28/2009 12:59:41 PM	Since the insertion of the IUD I bleed almost constantly.  I have had about 4-5 weeks total where I was not bleeding at all.  Bleeding ranges from light to heavy flow.  My doctor said bleeding is the most common side effect and may persist for 6 mos. to a year.  I am 28 and had been on birth control pills for 10 years and was starting to have negative side effects (increase in almost debilitating headaches) and was getting lazy about taking them.  Have tried Seasonale, depo, but was on ortho tricyclen for the longest time with positive results.  However I am currently contemplating IUD removal.

As a female that hasn't had a baby, I'm not lying when I say that the insertion process is uncomfortable. Don't let this scare you. While I did have 2 or 3 VERY intense cramps (took my breath away), they were very short (3 seconds?). I was given epinephrine (sp?) to restrict the blood vessels in my cervix, which I'm told helped a lot with the pain. The hormone made me feel weird for the rest of the evening (even though it wore off with 2 hours). If I had had the choice, I would have definately stayed home for the rest of the day (and the next day) to chill. Since insertion, I've noticed more uncomfortable sensations in the morning (nautous) or when I need to BM (due to possible pressure on uterus..?. As far as bleeding, I definately used both a pad and tampon at the same time the first day. For me, spotting has been minimal enough for me since day three to not worry about a tampon or pad. Overall, I'm definately very with my decision to try Paragard thus far. I haven't had any &quot;personal&quot; time with my man yet, but I don't expect there to be any problems. :)
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	9/18/2009 2:53:55 PM	I am 25 and the reason why I wanted to use this type of BC is because I still want my monthly periods, I don't want my hormones altered, I don't want to take daily or weekly pills, and overall not have to think about it.  I have never been pregnant before, and I also had to get an ultrasound to make sure everything was good to go down there.  The doctor tried to insert the IUD twice...the second time successful-she had me go in while on my period (On the heaviest day).  While it does seem kinda gross, it makes it A LOT easier to insert the IUD (Especially if you have never been pregnant) with minor pain and it took about five minutes.It's been over 30 days, and it hasn't hurt at all, however the last two weeks I have been bleeding everyday (Minor to medium flow), which is a normal symptom to have (As it says for common side effects for Paragard).  So far I feel good about making the decision on using this type of BC, especially since I've never been pregnant.  I would definitely research all options, as all women are in different circumstances. This one happened to be the best for me, and years down the road I plan on the option to remove it and go for future spawn :)
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	25-34	9/12/2009 4:01:56 PM	I got my IUD inserted on Friday morning. My doctor recommended that I take some Advil before I went, so I took 800mmg.   Because I had never had never been pregnant, it was quite painful.  My cervix did not want to cooperate, so she had to use some sort of dilator to be able to insert the IUD.  There was a lot of cramping during this process.  Because of my nerves, I got really dizzy and nauseous.  Once the process was done (about 20-30 min) she had me lay there for a little while.  She wanted to take an ultrasound to make sure that the IUD was in the right place.  I had cramping for about 12 hours afterwords, but today they are totally gone.  I still have some light bleeding.  I was on Femcon FE for about a year before I decided to switch to an IUD.  The hormones from the femcon give me insomnia, headaches, leg spasms and raised my blood pressure significantly.  I see the pain and discomfort from having the IUD placed a small price to pay to get rid of those other symptoms.  I am told my first few periods will be difficult, time will tell.

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	3	Female	19-24	8/14/2009 10:37:20 AM	I had ParaGard inserted 4 days ago.  And it was the worst pain of my life.  I have never had children so that could play a part.  I needed to be on a hormone free birth control, I was on the pill for 10 years and my cycle did not know how to function on its own.  I took 6 Advil, and my doctor prescribed me a Valium to take prior to the procedure.   It did not take very long to have it inserted but when the pain is that intense it seemed like forever.  I have been spotting ever since it was inserted, and having cramps.  I hope within the next couple of months I will come to like the ParaGard better but things will have to make a huge improvement, not sure I would do it again. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/11/2009 4:17:10 AM	I had paragard inserted January 15, 2009 about 2 months after the birth of my 3rd child. I am 26 years old. I took 800 mg of ibuprofen prior to my appointment. The insertion was uncomfortable but pretty painless, just a stinging for about 10 seconds. I had NO cramps or spotting whatsoever afterwards. I had read so many bad posts that I thought something was wrong. I had 6 heavy periods, bleeding so bad 1 day each cycle that you would have thought someone massacred me. But surpisingly this month, July, my period was almost like my normal one. The flow was much lighter, regular, lasted about 5 days. I am so excited, I hope this continues. I don't experience monthly cramps. In the first few months I would have some pressure like discomfort as if the blood was trying to get around the device (mainly a bloated type feeling). I am very satisfied, excited, and I would recommend this to anyone who has done their research and think that it might work for them.
Other	Happymom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/11/2009 2:26:26 PM	I am currently 34, married, and had my Paragard IUD (copper, no hormones un like Mirena) inserted four months after having my first baby.  I've now had it for 11 months. I tried to have one inserted before I had a child, against my doctor's recommendation (because according to him the cervix opening is usually too narrow in women that have not had children). I fainted when they tried to  insert it then-after I had my baby it went in immediately though, didn't even feel it, and had mild cramping afterwards.  I absolutely detested the weight gain, water retention, and fatigue that came with the pill-not to mention the expense and hassel. I tried many types of pills, and the Nuvaring all with the same problems. The IUD has none of those side effects, was completely covered by insurance, and is almost like it isn't there. Until period time-those are extremly heavy for a day or two, even eleven months later-heavier than pre-baby, on or off the pill. Though the strong cramping everyone mentions only lasted about 6 months for me. I highly prefer it to any other form of birth control.

I've never had any kids, so the insertion was extremely painful for me.  I had some cramps afterwards, but ibuprofen helped immensely.  I've only had it for a month, and I was warned about the heavy bleeding and cramping, but I was not expecting it to be this bad.  The bleeding, though heavy, doesn't bother me, but the cramping is miserable.  I get sharp pangs that last for about 30 seconds tops and then go away and for some reason is worse while I'm wearing a tampon.  Overall, I'm very happy with my decision do to the lack of hormones.  I'm feeling better already, and even though the cramping is bad, i feel it's a small price to pay in comparison to the hair loss, headaches, etc. that were caused by hormones.

I had been on birth control the pill form before that. I hated taking the pill because any pill i used i had a bad reaction. I was considering Meridian the other form of IUD. It has hormones so i did not want that one because i wanted to breast feed. The paraguard i researched for six weeks until i made the decision to get it. When they inserted it it went well i had no cramping just a little spotting after but it's normal. Now if you are alergic to copper or have a tiped uterus you may want to reconsider and your doctor should tell you that because you can have complications. The only side effects are having sever cramps, headaches, backaches, bleeding. I have been lucky and i have not had any of those side effects. This is a great method of birth control especially if you are going to breastfeed or are worried about having bloodclots due to regular birth control pills. It last for ten years and is easily removed if you want it out. I would recomed this to anyone but do your research be your own advocate and ask a lot of questions as you should do with any birth control. If you are experiencing sever side effects from paraguard like hair loss, weight loss something to that effect something else might be wrong. You could be alergic to the copper tubing. I have recently had the papraguard stings move on me but my doctor had to adjust it back into the correct place but i only had a light cramping sensation. It's fine now. Good luck to all

I've now gone to Paragard due to no hormones (breastfeeding) and longer effectiveness (10 yrs vs. 5 yrs. with Mirena). Though a little uncomfortable at insertion (take Motrin) I highly recommend either. We've used so many types of BCs and IUDs have been the way to go for me BY FAR! Just a monthly string check and a yearly pap? YOU CANT BEAT THAT! And what other BC can you get for that long for the price even if you have to pay full!
Other	Bullwinkel, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/23/2009 4:30:38 PM	I had the IUD inserted on Feb. 19th 2009. I had already had a child and my husband and I didnt want to have anymore children for a while so this seemed like the best route to take. I also didnt want the hormones from Mirena. The procedure was very fast and not too painful, but I have a very high pain tolerance. Everyones body is different. First the dr. will measure your uterus, you will feel sharp cramping. Then the dr. will insert the device, again you will feel sharp cramping. Just take a few deep breaths and it will be over soon. As soon as the dr. was done the sharp cramping was gone. I drove myself home and even went to class that evening. I experienced minor cramping and spotting for the next few days as to be expected. I would recommend this for anyone seriously considering having an IUD. I will write more when I go back in 4 weeks for the check up.

Other	ihopeparagardworks4me, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	1/27/2009 5:45:47 PM	I had Paragard inserted on January 6.  I'm single and never had a baby so my doctor said the procedure would be uncomfortable.  She was more than right!  The pain from intitially measuring my uterus was easily an 8 out of 10 (truly awful!), and inserting the Paragard was a 7 out of 10.  I took ibuprofen before and after the procedure.  Did fine the rest of the day then the cramping and spotting started the next day which lasted one full week.  It got better each day but the day after the procedure, I will admit I could hardly stand up straight due to the cramping and discomfort.  From January 13 - 21, everything was fine  -  no spotting or anything and i was so relieved, but I noticed some mild cramping that I could easily forget about if I kept myself active.  i still went to the gym and engaged in sex and everything was fine.  On January 21, I was hit with an unbelievably heavy period which is still very very heavy after 7 days.  Very little cramping but an incredible amount of blood.  I have tried on several occasions to feel the threads but i cannot feel them at all.  So between this incredibly heavy period that I'm experiencing, which was, by the way exactly one week ahead of time, and the fact taht i cannot feel the threads, I have been a little worried about what's been happening.  But I'm really not in a lot of pain so I haven't gone back to my doctor yet. I want to &quot;ride out the storm&quot; and see how long the bleeding lasts.   I go back on February 16 for a follow-up with my doctor.  I do recommend the IUD because of the freedom from having to take a pill but the side effects have been a bit more surprising than I expected.  I truly believe it will be worth it once things settle down and my body gets used to it.
Other	gadnur, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	12/29/2008 11:20:48 AM	I've only had paragard for about 5 weeks.I got it because my mom had a blood clot on birth control and tested positive for factor luiden 5. I didnt get tested because i dont have health insurance. I was on the pill but had migrains with aura (blind spots), the dr. said that b/c of my mom having the blood clotting disorder that i should get tested but since it was $200 up front, he said that since i was interested in paragard, i didnt need to be tested right now for factor liuden 5, although i plan on it when i have health insurance.Ive never had kids so the insertion was just cramps that weren't that terrible. Afterwards I had spotting for around 4 days. I had one period one week after insertion and it was heavier and i had stomach cramps, which i never had before, just lower back cramps. Now I am on my 2nd period and the menstrual flow is a lot heavier than the first period. I definitely use a tampon about every 2 hours, before paragard i could use a tampon the whole day if i wanted to and i still wouldnt leak. Also, I have such terrible stomach cramps that sometimes they take my breath away and I feel like i need crutches to walk with, but thats without taking ibuprofen, which i dont like to use too much because of the long term complications it causes. Anyway, I'm hoping the bad side effects subside within the next 3 months, but if not, its still worth not taking hormones. For someone who can't take hormones b/c of migraines with aura/blood clotting disorders that could cause death, I feel much safer on paragard and I haven't had a migraine at all while on it. Yeah the cramps hurt and the period is long, but ibuprofen and icyhot soothe the pain away.

I almost passed out from the cramps. I've been cramping ever since and bleeding too. But, so far I can handle it. It's only been 4 days. I haven't gone off bc yet because i have to go back to the dr in 6 wks after I get my period. I am on seasonique and will take this until two weeks prior to my appt. So far i would not recommend this to anyone who has a low tolerance for pain. If you doctor tells you it will just be a little cramping, don't believe him! I had to have a ride home because i was in so much pain and light headed. I was also a little out of it. I will update in a few weeks to see if any of the cramping has gone away. Thanks to all the women who wrote comments. It definitely helped.

One was in my uterus and the other was in my tubes so needless to say that traumatic experience made me re-think my birth control method. I had read about the Paragard and decided to try it since I was advised by my doctor not to get pregnant for at least a year. My husband and I decided that we would hold off for more than that and I opted to try the Paragard. I had it inserted almost a month ago and so far so good! It was a bit uncomfortable going in - I had a heck of a cramp - but after that I was fine. I used my lunch hour to get it done and still had time to stop for a sandwich before going back to work! I also, loved the fact that I only had to pay my $25.00 copay and my health insurance paid for the rest! I also love the fact that there are no hormones involved! No more monthly visits to the pharmacy to pay for pills once a month - Yea! I hated that I had to be having my period to get it done, but the pros outweighed the cons for me. I'm going in to having a follow-up with my doctor in January. If anything has changed I will update on here

After changing to Paragard, my period is back--heavy--but thats ok. I like not having to take horomones, they have a bad effect on my sex drive. I'm glad I can keep this one in for 10 years with no worries...
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/4/2008 10:10:46 AM	I have had the paraguard for 1 1/2 years and am VERY happy. I love not having to use condoms with my longtime boyfriend. We have two kids and don't want another for at least 1-2 more years. It was painful getting it but after about a week,the pain and cramping was gone. My periods for the first 3 months were very heavy (one super tampon an hour)but after that it has been normal. I do have spotting between periods but it is minamal and was one of the side effects listed in the brocure so I am not supprised.Don't use as your only method if your not in a long term relationship. And of course use condoms to prevent std's.(that disclaimer is due to the fact that I am a mom:) ) I really reccomend this to someone that doesn't want kids for a few years. There is nothing to forget and the little bit of spotting is worth the convienence.

The process hurt and is still killing me but i cant wait to get over the pain and start to understand how much easier this will make my life, i do recommend this product because it is very convient but if youve never had kids before this is very very painful.

Her Medicaid would not cover a BTL until she's 21 so she went to the clinic to have the IUD inserted. That was seven months ago, she told me today she is pregnant! They removed the IUD and told her she may miscarry or have a child with deformities. Not at all satisfied.

Overall I was happy with it and haven't had any serious side effects.  It did make my periods alot heavier and I get cramps during my period, which I didn't have before this IUD.

For a few days after I had cramping and spotting. Of course, I was warned by my doctor that this would happen so I was ready for it. I've had it for a little over a month now and I am very satisfied with it. I was on Yaz for about a year and have noticed positive changes in my body from not being on it anymore. I'm not as moody, my appetite has decreased, and I am no longer chronically constipated.
