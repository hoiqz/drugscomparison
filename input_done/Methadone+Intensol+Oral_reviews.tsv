Duration of dose by far outweighs oxycodone, dilaudid, etc. in terms of effectiveness and length of time of relief.

I highly recommend doing a MMT program for ppl who have tried detox and rehab and it did not work, but really want to stay drug-free

After suffering for a few years with addiction, I started to use methadone oral and I feel like a new woman.  My pain is tollerable and I do not want any other pain medication.  If by chance you find youself taking pain medication and not being able to stop, talk with your doctor, that is what I did.  He will help you decide what measures to take to stop taking pain medication.  I chose methadone and I feel free, like I am living a whole new life that is worth living.  Yes there is side effects like sweating, but as far a quality of life, I am living.

I do not feel it is appropriate for people who use only Vicodin or Percocet.  Methadone is more intense withdrawal than either of those.  If you are addicted to vicodin, I know from experience it is no walk in the park, try suboxone first.

Iwas an iv user. Methadone has kept me off it but now i have a new addiction to methadone. It takes longer to come off and now i have a new problem. I was up to 150 mgs a day of methadone and that docter got into trouble. Now i am down to 40 mgs a day and struggle every month to make my prescription last. It has put me into another hell. this does however keep me off the street and from stealing and hurting those around me. I am in a much better place staying out of trouble just with an addiction still. So at least my family and friends can look at me and not worry about their wallets, or be disgusted.

Narcotic Addiction	boaboa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	5	Female	35-44	4/8/2009 12:25:34 PM	this is a wonderful medication and if i would not of gotten on this medication i might not be alive today. i would recomend this treatment to anyone that has a addiction to opioids like vicoden or phentyol or most pain killers. i am on my way back to having my life back and alot of people that i know that are addcted to the phentyol patch are dying from over dose. i dont want to die so i am going to make this work and never again use the patches or any kind of pain killer. i am not going to disfappoint my children ever again.

I want to get off of it but find it very hard. It is an addiction in itsself. It takes a very long time to detox. Overall i would say it works well for my treatment but its not ment for everyone. It made me ill and now i find it hard to get off it.

I lost all my teeth from them breaking off while I was eating soft things.  It kept me in a daze all the time (and I was taking it as directed).  I went into rehab to get off of it and I feel better now I still deal with the pain but it is nice to know what is going on around me.
