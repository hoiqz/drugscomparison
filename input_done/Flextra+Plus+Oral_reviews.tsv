Head Pain	Happy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	1/24/2009 1:03:01 PM	I was given Flextra Plus for headaches. If I catch it at the onset one pill will work, even helps a little for neck pain, otherwise two.  And NO narcotic, can't go wrong. I don't know if it would be strong enough for a migraine? I would certainly recommend trying this.
