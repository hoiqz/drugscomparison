Muscle Spasm	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	7/4/2012 12:03:18 AM	I was prescribed this medication several years ago for tension headaches.  It was helpful, but not dramatic.Recently I became a sufferer of back pain.  What an absolute drag that is!  I had some metaxalone 800mg and I'm using it routinely.  I just put it in with my regular 7a/2p/10p medications and it's very effective.  Using it &quot;as needed&quot; wasn't so successful as I would let my back begin to seriously spasm before taking the medication and with a half hour or so before it became effective, I didn't feel it was much help.  The routine use has been the answer for me.

While trying to help the headaches I started Metaxalone and could not sleep, lay down or sit up, I felt numb and sort or &quot;out of body&quot; sensation from hips down. The second day I am experiencing nervous shaking of my legs like crazy.  This is a strange overall feeling.  No headache, but I do not care for the side effects.

My back spasms are due to an injury sustained when my bicycle collided with a Tundra pickup that turned in front of me. Humans don't make good hood ornaments. Before taking metaxalone, I was going 2 and 3 days without sleep because I couldn't lay down. This had been going on for about 3 months. I was at wit's end, what little was left. I can take metaxalone on an empty stomach or with food, and I haven't really noticed that it makes me feel drowsy either. So far, taking between 2 pills to 4 pills a day, depending on the duration of the spasms, I've not noticed any side-effects...so far. And I'm hoping it stays that way.
