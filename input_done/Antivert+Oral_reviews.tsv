Other	plaza64, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	5/3/2012 5:55:19 PM	Had my first attack of VERTIGO this past summer.  I would get up from the bed and went down on the pillows.  No control to stop it.  Sitting along time waiting to see the DOCTOR, got up and my HUSBAND caught me before I fell.  Did have repositioning which did away with the VERTICO.  Then all of a sudden every time I get up from my bed and walk a little, I get dizzy.  So the DOCTOR put me on ANTI-VERT 2 TIMES A DAY.  I get tired but it is working and I am also trying PHYSICAL THERAPY.  I am hoping one day I can stop taking the ANTI-VERT. However, I was told once one has VERTIGO, they always have it but it may not be active.  Really thrilled about this!

Spinning stops but there is a small amount of off-centeredness.  Believe it acts as a diuretic some.  Don't take all the time only occasionally. Don't like taking meds all the time.

Went 6 months OK and then it came back again - always in the hot , humid summer months. I took antivert - 6 mg 3-4 times a day ( I cut the 25 mgm tab in fourths. ) It helped a great deal with minimal side effects - I'll start my exercises again and hope this goes away faster this time.

But now that I am taking it I feel great and back to normal again and I can keep my ballance. I would recommend this to anyone with these kind of symptoms. Atleast you can get out of the unsteady phase and back to normal again.
