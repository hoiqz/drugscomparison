Migraine Prevention	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	6/14/2012 9:32:30 PM	I was prescribed nadolol as a preventative for migraines after using the anti seizure meds with no long term benefits.  At first I thought this medication was helpful, but after a month, I asked to be changed to a different medication due to significant heat intolerance, profuse sweating, and sore finger tips.  
Prevent Bleeding Varicose Vein in the Esophagus	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/30/2012 3:53:24 PM	I started having severe &quot;acid reflux&quot; type episodes where I could neither swallow or get my food back up.  Seemed to be &quot;stuck&quot; in my throat.  No previous problems with acid reflux.  When stopping medication for 0ne week this stopped but as soon as I got back on it it came back again.  I do  have varicese in my throat so unsure what other meds would be appropriate to take care of this.  I already take 2 blood pressure/fluid pills.

I have been on Flecainide and first Toprol and now Nadolol.  I am experiencing a lot of muscle pain since being on these beta blockers.  Has anyone else experienced that side effect?  I have only experienced 3 mild A-fibs since.

Migraine Prevention	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	6/21/2011 10:06:50 AM	I have been taking 80mg/day for about 6 weeks now to treat migraine headaches and have had absolutely no change. I'm still getting the headaches 4+ days per week but I'm gaining a TON of weight. I've gained 15 lbs less than 2 months while working out 5 days/week and eating properly. I'm also very weak and tired all the time, but am having a terrible time sleeping. This is the 3rd medication I've tried for prevention and nothing has even slightly decreased them.

I discovered a few things that trigger it in me.  First, chromium does it.  I can't take multivitamins that have chromium in them. Chromium is also in slimfast diet shakes so I avoid them.Gassy foods like brocoli and spinach salad will trigger palps if eaten a lot.I notice palps will start up due to constipation, so must keep that under control.  I hope this helps others prevent palps because they can make you feel miserable.

I went through ablation heart surgery to try to get rid of the irregular beats in hopes of getting off this horrible drug. Unfortunately, the surgery did not work and I am still on the drug and still no sex life. Does anyone have any ideas?  It seems that no one talks about ED resulting from trying to manage heart disease or congenital heart defects.

I also deal with chronic, transformed migraines, and this medication has been the one heart-med that has not interfered negatively with my migraine-meds regimes. Two thumbs and a steady heart-beat up for Nadolol.

Involuntary Quivering	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/22/2007 4:13:05 PM	Nadolol is a noncardioselective beta-blocker and a good alternative to expensive  Inderal-LA. It's a lot like Inderal but you only have to take it once a day. I take it for benign essential tremor. It works great with less fuss than Inderal.
