Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	1	4	Female	45-54	7/14/2010 3:18:50 PM	I'm using this medication (Darvocte N-100) for long time ago.I am suffering a side effect; I have irritation of my stomache and intestines, including an increase in my high blood preasure. Today I went to my doctor and I was explaining him about it. He did not accept it because according with his knowledges, Darvocet does not damage my stomache. He refused to accept my problem. What can I do? He is Dr. Robert Baylis of Orthopaedic Associates Usa in Plantation, Florida.
