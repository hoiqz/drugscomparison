I then experience a sore stomach for  2 days. CYCLE starts all over again.

I am worried about the shaking my body goes into when the drug wears off after 3 days. My dose is 125mmg. every 3 days. I wonder if this is a very high dose?Can anyone out there vouch for my dose?
Severe Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	45-54	5/15/2012 2:11:32 AM	I HAVE ONLY BEEN ON THE PATCH FOR A MONTH. IT SEEMS TO HELP THE CHRONIC PAIN DUE TO A INJURY AT WORK 7 YRS AGO. WAS PREVIOUSLY ON MORPHINE 30 MG 3X DAY WITH HYDROCODONE 10/325 5X DAY FOR BREAKTHROUGH. THE FIRST 3 PATCHES ALL FELL OFF IN THE SHOWER. HAD ORDERED TEGA-DERM TO KEEP THEM ON,UNTIL THAT ARRIVED USED TAPE TO KEEP THEM ON. STILL FELL OFF. CALLED DR WHEN I HAD ONLY 1 PATCH LEFT AND LEFT MESSAGE FOR A CALL BACK. NEVER CAME. SO UNTIL THURSDAY I AM WITHOUT THE PATCH. THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A FUN WEEK. 51 Y/O WOMAN WHO ISN'T A DRUG SEEKING ADDICT. WOULD JUST LIKE RELIEF FROM PAIN AND SOME DAY MAYBE A DR WHO CARES.

I am able to go about my business which I could not do on oxycodone. I can't even compare the differnce in constipation - much better on this. I use endone 5mg for breakthrough and find that the patch doesn't really last three days but it is a winner for me, I would be putting my head in an oven without some mobility and the only other source for me was facet joint injections. Hail the patch.

Request from the pharmacy that you get the patches made by Milan pharmasutical. They are better for me and have no problem staying on unlike the ones from Watson.  And they never fall off due to showers or swimming.  Good luck to all my fellow pain sufferers. And a good support system is key.

I have been on patches for 3 yrs. The patches do not last 3 days, also they do not stay on. I'm 53 and a woman with hot flashes. I do use film dressing to keep them on longer. My problem is, my family have read and seen shows on TV that show how dangerious fentynal is. So they are pressuring me to stop useing them. Plus my husband says I act like I'm taking to much, and I look high all the time. Lower doses do not help my pain as well. I'm very unhappy. They do not seem to understand.

Severe Pain	frustmom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/23/2011 4:36:18 PM	My 21 year old son was finally put on this miracle a month ago after 5 doctors, injections and every opiate available. He has chronic pain due to herniated discs in the thoracic region. He is now able to resume physical therapy to strengthen his core and can sit in a chair for the first time in a year and a half.For a person so young it is heartbreaking to watch life pass him by due to chronic pain. I hope his doctor will increase his dosage or frequency as they are not working as well as they did in the beginning. The worst part of this whole journey through medical hell has been the stigma attached to pain management. He has been accused everything from being an addict to a dealer when his meds have needed adjustment due to tolerance increase. It is a normal reaction and every doctor knows it. Because he is young people make assumptions based on prejudice. Pain is pain whether you are 20 or 70. He is monitored by urinalysis each month and has never abused his meds. He only wants to live at a pain level below a 6 not be high. That is why these patches are a godsend.       
Severe Pain	arizona, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	1/22/2011 10:58:58 AM	I find that this medication is reasonably effective, though I still have some pain. It does wear off after two days rather than three. I have no side effects except sleepiness if I should take too much.In my experience, using fentanyl lollipops is necessary for the times when the pain is worse. Without them, I have to increase the patches, which results in my being too supply and makes driving risky. As long as the lollipops are available, one is not forced to make a 2-3 day commitment to being sleepy in order to be out of pain.
Severe Pain	amy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	1/2/2011 2:13:06 PM	I am prescribed this every 3 days, I love not having to take pills especially with migraines that make me ill. I however know the last day is hell waiting on a new patch, I also know getting showers even fast make the patch loose and I have had them fall off. I only notice when pain is too bad that the patch folded or got knocked off in sleep, I do not like the lint rings around the patch area. Other than that I like it better than oxycontin, I just think I need stronger but the insurance may not cover it. :(
Severe Pain	DM, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	11/22/2010 12:36:05 AM	The fentanyl patch literally gave me back a life; of course I still cannot return to my chosen profession or do everything I used to do in my free time - but I am able to function - including going back to working part time. I finally have some noticeable relief of severe, chronic pain after neck injury and two surgeries. I change the patch every 48 hours and take 1-2 tablets of oxycodone/APAP, 5/325mg, 1-2 times daily as needed. This is much better than no relief at all from 80mg oxycontin q 12 hours or 20mg oxycodone/APAP q 6 hours - so I highly recommend the patch for chronic pain. They don't always stay on as long as needed, but if it fell off early it probably means I was in the pool or doing something active that made me sweat - which is very good news - because without the patch  would be on the couch 24 hours per day. Also, there seems to be a little less pharmacist-based prejudicial treatment with the patch versus huge doses of pills - and for all the pharmacists reading this post - you are collectively very possibly the biggest reason for depression in chronic pain sufferers. I need my pain medicine just as much as, if not more than, my cholesterol medication!
Severe Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/18/2010 1:28:05 PM	After more than fifteen years of taking various cocktails of medications for my chronic pain, my Pain Management Doctor put me on the Fentanyl patch. It has been a life saver for me, literally! I was suicical and actually planning my death due to the uncontrollable pain I was in everyday. Now, I can get out of bed everyday and have a normal life! No more pills, no more clock watching to make sure I didn't miss a dose of something, no more crowded medicine cabinet! I change it every three days and go on about my life! Because of this medication, I am out looking for a JOB! Something I haven't been able to do for YEARS! 
Severe Pain	lord love a duck, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/16/2010 11:23:14 AM	I have used the patches for over five years and they have allowed me to live a much more normal life. Without them I would be confined to bed. I change them every three days and find that they stay on fairly well.I still have to use another narcotic for occasional breakthrough pain and the dosage of the patches has increased steadily over the years. I was on oral morphine previously for ten years and suffered from frequent vomiting and constipation to the point of needing hospitalization. I have had no such problems with the fentanyl patches. I would recommend them to anyone with severe chronic pain who is having problems with oral opiates.
Severe Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	4/29/2010 11:34:43 AM	THE PATCH HELPED WITH THE PAIN SOMEWHAT AND WAS SUPPOSED TO LAST 3 DAYS FOR EVERY 1 PATCH, BUT I FOUND THAT AROUND END OF DAY 2, THE PATCH STARTED LOSING IT EFFECTIVENESS. I ALSO EXPERIENCED A RACING HEARTBEAT, HOT FLASHES, AND HAND TREMBLING. ALL IN ALL, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS MEDICATION. AFTER SPEAKING WITH MY DOCTOR, HE AGREED TO SWITCH ME TO MORPHINE 30MG 3X A DAY --- STILL ON THIS MEDICATION AND IT WORKS WONDERFUL.

Severe Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/13/2010 1:16:41 PM	This drug has been very good to me, giving me back my life.  I used to just lay on the couch, doped up under a heating blanket, now I am out doing the things I enjoy, with no pain or dopy feeling.  I realize this drug has severe withdrawel effects, when the time comes for me to go off of them I trust my doctors will do the right thing.
Other	Marc71, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	1/11/2010 10:15:23 AM	I have lumbar joint disease. It is very painful and the fentanyl really does the job. I started on the 50mcg/h patches, but now I am on the 75mcg/h. I'm afriad that I am going to have to go to the 100mcg/h before long as my pain is getting stronger and more frequent. I have had NO side effects.from using this medication. I hope everyone else how is on this medication will have the same good luck as i have had.
