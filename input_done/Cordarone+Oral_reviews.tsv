Atrial Fibrillation	southernbellak, 45-54 Female  (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/24/2011 7:34:37 PM	My mother passed away in January 2011 after many years of being on amiodarone.Death certificate stated she had interstitial pneumonitis and respiratory. As you may know this drug causes respiratory failure and I believe it contributed to her death as she was never diagnosed or had any respiratory problems. Pulmonary fibrosis doesn't just creep up on you.  Does anyone have any patient information pages from Wyeth prior to 2005 indicating this warning.  This is a drug that should be used as a last resort and if you are taking it you should be monitored and have pulmonary functions, thyroid, and liver among other body systems.  Thanks, Lynne
Other	Heartbroken,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		9/24/2010 11:30:26 PM	Any doctor who prescribes this drug is a murderer. It killed my husband.  We were not given a warning or an option.  Didn't even know the drug was administered during heart surgery.
Atrial Fibrillation	Bo, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	55-64	9/7/2010 11:23:41 PM	Taking 400 mg to begin treatment for A-fib.  After about 3 weeks, I have experienced new problems.  Bruise very easily, strong blood in urine, baloated stomach, possible swelling of kidney, Thyroid factor of 1.1 (bottom normal is 4.5), trouble with balance when walking, poor sleep, lots of yawning, swelling of feet and shins.  I had seemed to be doing good and all of a sudden all hell broke loose.  Primary concern was blood in my urine, but can't at this time verify that this medication is the cause...but it is highly suspected by me.  I'll call doc tomorrow to report my findings.  I am told that taking Warfarin (Coumidin) along with this drug may have caused some of the problems.  This was not an issue that was expressed in the literature.  I won't be taking any more.... unless it can be proven to me that these problems as listed above are not associated with the &quot;Amio&quot;.  I hope I don't die tonight from internal bleeding in my kidneys.  I will have to admit, that being a 'party' weekend, I did not slow down on booze.  I don't drink usually, so this weekend was an exception that may have contributed to the blood in my urine..which is bad.

Was in intensive care (3) and on a ventilator for (1) day.  Have been complaining of breathing difficulty since beginning of use, now am wheezing, skin rash, sensitivity to sun and has affected my thryroid medicine making me hypo.  Am in the process of calling doctor to change medicines, any suggestions of a medicine that acually helps you instead of kills u?? Only good thing it has kept me in rhythm most of the time.

Atrial Fibrillation	ASD Repair User, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	7/8/2010 2:22:28 AM	I am taking 1-200 mg. Amio tablet a day as a post-open heart surgery for ASD (hole in heart) repair. I have noticed that I have more acid indigestion. From this site, I realize that part of the formula for Amio is HCL - basically, stomach acid. I have had problems with HCL before. Now I know why Amio is bothering me. Pepto Bismal tabliets help, but I might take something stronger.
Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia	amy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	55-64	4/29/2010 7:13:44 AM	I am going to the cardiologist this very day, again, because of side effects of this medication which cause edema and shortness of breath.  I am much more miserable than I was with the original condition, but will consider trying other medications for the SVT. I do dread the long time it takes to rid my body of the Amiodarone.  I would not recommend this medication to anyone for any reason, even as a last resort.

Wish I could be put on somethinh else but dread the time it will take to get this toxen out of my body. Was put on beta blocker for high BP but after three months I could not operate in any normal way. I was grounded big time. They discovered that my average heart rate had fallen to 41 beats and took me off the beta blocker immediately. Two weeks later I feel a bit more energised but dread leaving home. Hope this is just the beta blocker taking time to leave my system.

Atrial Fibrillation	daughter in mourning, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	9/8/2009 11:06:58 PM	My mother was prescriped this medication in June for A fib. She began feeling dizzy, lightheaded soon after. She tried to get an appointment with her doctor but by the time she was seen it was too late and she was admited to the hospital with 70% oxygen. She was sedated and put on life support and pumped full of steroids. After 30 days in the hospital she hadn't made any progress. The steroids and constant oxygen were the only thing keeping her alive. She spent weeks struggling to breath till she was so exhasted she lost hope. She passed away last friday. I discourage anyone from trying this killer drug. The side effects will kill you! It's not worth the chance.   
Life-Threatening Rapid Ventricular Heartbeat	lloyd, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	9/8/2009 10:02:11 PM	I suffered with SVT's for two years afraid to go anywhere in fear of an attack. I was given this medication while in the hosp. with SVT and respatory failure. They had to keep me in a drug induced coma because of the tarcardia was so out of control. The doctors gave me this medication got my taccardia under control. I am still taking it. Have been on it for around 4 years.
Rapid Ventricular Heartbeat	Runner633, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	35-44	9/29/2008 2:14:46 PM	I was on Amio for about a year when I went in for a lung test.  The drug was working wonders and I hadn't had any episodes of VT in that time.  However my lung test (PFT) showed that my lungs weren't working properly which was a side effect from this drug.  I was deeply disappointed since I had already tried all the other anti-arrtyhmic drugs out on the market.  I had to stop taking it immediately and 30 days later I had an episode of VT which caused my ICD to fire.

Prevention of Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation	66rancher, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	4	1	Female		9/23/2007 2:39:33 PM	I had 10 or more side effects. Caused by blood pressure toodrop and I wold fall. I waked like a drunk from one side to the other.  After a pace maker conditioned stayed same.  After one month in rehab still on this drug.  I QUIT the drug and went to  another older drug and it has been 3 months and I am nearly back to my old self before this drug.  As far as I am concerned it should be taken off market it has too many side effects and some life threatening.
