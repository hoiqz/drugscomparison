It did help my breathing however it also triggered a large amount of PVCs. After checking that PVCs could be a side effect of Albuterol I stopped taking it immediately. A day later when I went to my doctors office I also found my blood pressure to be extremely high 164/101. Two weeks earlier it was just marginally high at 134/81. This drug did help but the side effects have made my life miserable for the last few days.

Daycare providers and myself could deal with the side affects since the medication provided relief. Once school started, her aggressive behavior and hyper attitude increased. The school worked w/me since I am a single Mother. Although, immediately following her treatments it was total chaos. It was a nightmare! Being called to the school to deal w/her after her treatments were given. My insurance didn't cover any other preventive meds due to cost and I had to wait to enroll into a new health plan. What a nightmare! Asthma medications are very costly and out-of-pocket expenses are extremely high. Switching to a more expensive medication completely changed her attitude for the better. I've never dealt w/asthma until my daughter and was not aware of all the affects. I've learned over the years and will never give or recommend albuterol for young children. The medicine made her heart beat so fast that it scared me. She could never completely settle down after her treatments. In the end, happiness was finally obtained.

Bronchitis	Dwight, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	4	Male	55-64	4/24/2011 4:42:52 PM	I've had bronchitis-like symptoms for about a year.  I'm on symbicort twice daily and have albuterol for in between use.  I had the canisters of albuterol first but changed quickly to the nebulizer as that is what had worked best with me in the ER.  Albuterol works well for me during the day but I'm home most of the day.  Between the Symbicort and the albuterol I've lost my sense of smell and taste.  After reading all the other comments it seems to me that these drugs are very &quot;individualistic&quot; in that every patient has a different reaction/side effect.  From what has been written it seems as if the cannister needs to be either reformulated or redesigned.

Being so close to Mexico allowed me to get my inhalers cheaper and quicker. Now with the passport change and all the recent violence in Mexico, I've had to switch to an American brand and it doesn't work as well. Plus, the solution in the old inhaler felt heavier so I knew when I was running low, now I can't tell. The American version also has tons of side effects that I never felt with my old inhaler. For the past 2 months I've been dizzy, had nausea, have trouble sleeping, trouble eating, and moody. I really don't like my new inhaler, but my choices are to use the new one with a ton of side effects or risk getting kidnapped, stabbed on a sidewalk, or shot. I also recently discovered that one of the side effects is death due to cardiac arrest.

After living in the Chicago area for 23 years, I recently moved back to Ohio, and the athsma returned almost immediately.  I exercise/run frequently, and had severe breathing difficulty. My doctor prescribed this and it has worked wonderfully.  2 sprays before exercise (or three on a really humid day) and I have no breathing issues.  It does make me a bit jittery, but that's not so bad when going for a run!

I was prescribed Proventil.  Without some kind of counter, there's virtually no way to know how much you have left.  I've weighed full and empty canisters and found the difference in weight to be only 3/16 of an ounce.  I've kept a count sheet with the inhaler and marked down every puff I used.  It was empty, or at least no longer working after about 170 puffs...not the claimed 200.  I've given up on the new propellant and started buying Salbutamol (the name the REST of the world uses for this drug) from Mexico, because it still has the old propellant.For the first couple of years using albuterol, I followed the doctors advice, and took 2 puffs every 4 hours.  Didn't work for me.  Gave me anxiety attacks like you wouldn't believe.  When I complained about this to other doctors, they tried giving me meds to combat the anxiety, which had even worse side effects, and when my lung specialist finally told me that so much albuterol was causing the anxiety, I started taking it only when absolutely necessary.  I find that using it once or twice a day is almost as effective as using it 6 times a day.  I wish there was a medication that works as well without the side effects, and I wish the U.S. would go back to the old propellant.

I suspect it's the new and far less effective propellant that accounts for this.  If you use it as infrequently needed rather than regularly, it's totally impossible to even approximately gauge the remaining contents of the cannister.  This could be a critical, or even dangerous problem for many people.

The propelant has been removed for our safety. We got used to the big spray and didn't work hard to get it into our bodies.Now we have to do the work. You MUST inhale fast and deep with this and hold as long as possible. Sorry your Doc didn't instruct you. I have had serious long term dibilataing asthma. Read all you can about it. Doctors don't keep up as much as we need. But we can. Identify and lose your triggers. If you don't know about Accolate, find out. Good breathing to you!

I asked doctors and nurses about this they both told me pro air doesn't have you lose your voice then I went to the pharmacist and asked them some questions they said it was a common reaction for pro-air users to lose their voice then after long term usage they didn't have that issue .  I asked her I didn't need it no more   and i asked her when will my voice be back ? She said a week or so .So I was doing research on the medicine it said if you have gerd, thyroid disorder avoid the inhalers which I have gerd and a thyroid disorder so this inhaler proably really aggravated my gerd and i have no thyroid .Doctors need to not give medicines to patients that will hurt them than help them fully .Because I haven't used the pro-air for 2 wks and my throat still feels as if it's frozen on the inside so tomorrow i'm going to be taking some axid ar than the usual prevacid .

ProAir does NOT work and I now have an Albuterol Pump unit at home to supplement the poor effectivity of the ProAir.

Bronchospasm	mitch, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	55-64	2/28/2009 9:49:55 AM	I get allergy induced asthma and have used Albuterol (originally Ventolin) for about 20 years, on occasion. My only problem with it is that upon use, it almost always immediately induces a cough which seems to reduce the effectiveness. Therefore, I end up exceeding the dosage in order to gain effectiveness. No shakes, headaches or any other side affects. It works for me.
Asthma	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	2/10/2009 11:31:56 PM	I can't use the pro air I have to use the name brand proventil I tried the pro air and i couldnt get any relief from it. I just wish the price would n't keep going up. I use to beable to get it for 25 usd but now it is like 53usd. I don't like the pro air seems like it is missing somthing. I think the drug companies need to reformulate it. 
Asthma	Margie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	65-74	1/29/2009 1:23:35 PM	I use ProAir albueterol 2xdaily,along with other asthma meds. Since the switch to HFA sprays, it is more costly,as you have to prime it before each use,there-fore I waste more than I use. This is a problem,as my dr. &amp; insurance only allow me 1 spray monthly. I'm to use it more as needed,and so run out faster. I'm suggesting a larger cylinder to make up for the waste. The cleaning after use is fine,unless your not around water,then what ?? Waiting a week to clean is not an option. All in all,love the product,hate the HFA cylinder.Gotta be a better way to help environment,without possibly harming the patient.

Asthma	Ashley, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/21/2009 1:08:20 AM	The Albuterol Inhaler has helped me a great deal. The only disturbing side affect for me is the tingling sinsation in my throat from having to use it so much. I also use a long acting inhaler so that I can be sure my Asthma stays under control. Albuterol is a great medicine to have on hand during an attack!

Bronchitis	candylamb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	1/6/2009 7:24:50 PM	Started using this inhaler with the spacer last night for severe bronchitis.  It did make me feel a little jittery and sleepless when I used it right before bed.  Also gives me a slight headache but goes away after awhile.  It does help to let me catch my breath between coughs during a coughing fit...before, I felt like I could barely breathe between coughs which was very scary.  The spacer makes this more effective as the drug residue doesn't stick to your lips and mouth and allows more of the medicine into your airway/lungs.  Thumbs up.

It has always helped with an asthma attack very well. I do feel jitterity sometimes but I can breathe normal again. The new inhaler &quot;Pro Air&quot; is terrible. It does not give an effective treatment and get clogged very often. If there is another albuterol inhaler,I want it instead.

Bronchitis	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female		1/1/2009 7:48:23 PM	This has helped ease my violent coughing a a great deal.  I have had no side effects even though I take quite a few medications for other problems.  Nor did I have problems with the use and taste of this product as other reviewers reported.  I did not receive the instructions that should have come with the inhaler. I now know the importance of getting these instructions.  The inhaler wasn't even in a box.  I will discuss this issue with the pharmacy.  I wouldn't hesitate to take this medicine in the future if warranted.

The inhaler  did its job and made me breathe easier, but after a day or two, I noticed that my sinuses were hurting along with my gums and lower jaw.I had a heck of a time eating and drinking since the roof of my mouth was raw. I felt intense pain in the roof of my mouth and in my gums.  I couldn't believe after all I went through that there was a part two to my misery.Anyway, I just want the pain to go away and I don't know how long it is going to take because it is going on 4 days.

It did what it was suppose to do and I was able to breathe much much easier in a very short time.  I was a little skeptical at first, but my sister, who works in the hospital said this is a non habit forming drug and I could use it and not get addicted.  After that I started using it as it was prescribed and found it to be very helpful to me when I have an attack.  Now I am not ashame to pull it out and take a couple of puffs on it, because I realize it is for my own good.  I would recommend this to anyone that has asthma and breathing problem.

I can't see a definite difference.  I see to think it makes the mucus loose, but I still can't do a productive cough. I have had cancer and a Thyroplasty completed in Feb. 08.  I had a respiratory therapist tell me two weeks ago about mucamist, he said they use this on vent patients and it makes the mucus like water.

I kept using it thinking I needed to get used to it.  After 2 months, I was using it day and night, instead of once before bed.  My lungs hurt, with congestion, and while in the shower, my lungs closed.  I grabbed an old bottle of Primatene Mist and it saved me!  Back on Primatene Mist, my condition improved drastically.  In 2 days, I was using only one spray at night and I coughed up a bunch of thick mucus and my lungs became clear without weezing again.

Bronchospasm	christy,  Female 	2	4	2	Female		6/7/2008 11:48:39 PM	I was prescribed albuterol for exercise-induced asthma, and this did not help my sports performance at all. It actually made it worse. One of the side effects were heart palpitations and anxiety, and before and during my games I felt nervous and so jittery that I couldn't concentrate. I did not feel my asthma symptoms improve either. I would not recommend using this before sports, or other activities that require a steady hand and focus

Bronchitis	tasha, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	3/30/2008 12:23:12 PM	I don't have asthma but I'm prone to getting bronchitis yearly around flu season. I'm usually prescribed this drug along side antibiotic and maybe a cough supp. and a steriod if needed. This tie i had serveral breathing treatments and steriod shot w/ the prescriptions. I really don't feel the difference when I use this. I think it is helping over the course of getting better but definalty isn't helpful to me for immediater relief - in fact I was told my a Dr once that it's not for immediate open lungs ...It's also very expensive. This version is better for the enviornment someone said - I would like to know more abou that... overall I'm glad I have it but I more hope it's working than feel it working - it's day 6 of a horrible case of &quot;asthmaic bronchitis&quot; and I'm almost better but still weazing and couphing and uncomfortably stuffed upI think I need that SPACER thing!!! I have been wondering why I felt so dizzy and shakey!! Thanks for mentioning that!

Unknowingly you could give your child a heart attack by administering these meds without a spacer...your heart may still race, but only a little...and the jitters...haven't really felt it like I did without the spacers...if your coverage won't cover it...they're only cheap...and will help with those 2 side effects. By the way...I got asthma during my pregnancy...never had it before.

I could NOT breathe or speak. After about 8 hits of Albuterol, I could finally take in a breath and the Paramedics did NOT have to transport me to the hospital. THANK YOU ALBUTEROL!!Now for the sad part. I understand that it's not in production and more. Is this true?

Gets clogged way to easily. I have been using the albterol inhaler for 20+ years, and definately not as good as the original.
