Most recently I had suffered a pretty bad shoulder injury. My doctor prescribed me this to get me through until I could seen an orthopedic shoulder specialist. No withdrawl issues, very minimal side effects when taken with food.

So now I started with 7.5-200 Vicoprefen but the generic...the brand cost $200 for 90 days with insurence, generic is $15.00. I will get a better feel in about 2 weeks how well it's doing. IB does not bother me. I use it for back pain osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia. I also take othe muscle pain killers. My pain is dibilitaiting and the medication gives me some relief. I don't work because I can't.

Pain	ANNE, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/26/2011 3:28:11 AM	I was first given viodoin 5/500 by my PCP, for muscle cramps in my neck and refered to a Orthopedic surgeon, after an xray reelled my spine was bent the wrong way. An ER doc changed it to 5/325 because of hih liver damage posiblities. The orthpedic surgeon changed it to vicoprofen after I complaine of stomic problems. It worked well, the problem for me was it continued to be prescribed for my pain, nerve damage and osteroarthritis, but it is suposed to be only taken for a short time. I did develop liver problem but it cleared up. I then went to a pain clinic because I wanted better long term solutions and PT. It did what it was suposed to, and helped as long as I took it with food. The main draw back was consipation for which I was given Laclose. I'm now off it and on a long term pain medicine which is working even better because I need only take it two times a day.

Pain	john, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	25-34	8/11/2010 12:57:54 PM	My doctor prescribed Vicoprofen for chronic tension headaches about 2 years ago.  Last year, I started to have severe back pain in my upper back, C7 vertebrae area, and continued to take the Vicoprofen. The MRI showed disc dehydration in that area, and I also had 2 prior injuries to that area in past years.  Since physical therapy and trigger point injections provided little if any relief, my doctor increased my dosage to 3 times per day.  I have been able to work, as I stand on my feel all day, and feel that the Vicoprofen has made the pain much more manageable. I have a sensitive stomach, and have tolerated this medicine quite well.  I also tried a nerve pain medicine called Neurontin which did nothing for may pain, and I tried Baclofen, an muscle relaxant.  Neither provided much help.  I cannot take muscle relaxers as they knock me out, so this Vicoprofen has been a real &quot;life saver&quot; for me because I get pain refief without feeling very drowsy.  Most of the specialists I saw didn't even realize that they make a Hydrocodone/Ibuprofen combination, and I am thankful to my Primary Care Doctor for his knowledge of it and greatful that it has helped me so much.

I feel worse and no pain relief at all. I have tried several pain medications after having (3) back surgeries and they all worked better. It is very upsetting to me when a doctor puts you on a medication he wants and not listen to my thoughts. I keep being told to find a Pain Clinic but the wait to get in can be months and I guess you are just to suffer.

The name brand works good but cost too much ( 120 pills $180 with good insurance ) I recommend for back pain over norco or vicodin i have been on all of them.

Pain	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	35-44	9/6/2009 3:17:12 PM	I have been taking Vicoprofen 7.5/200 for 4 years now due to cronic severe back pain associated with a lower disk explosion that occured in 2001. Following my surgury, I felt great for about 2 years. Over time developed severe pain in lower back. I am now seeing pain specialist regulary and have had very good results with this medication. Many of the other stronger pain meds do not allow me to function normally in my day to day related activities by either making me too tired or unable to productively think. Vicoprofen releives my back pain and does not take away any of my abilities to think or work. Without this medication I would not be able to work or perform many daily activities.

It helps eleviate my back pain and other various pains stemming from my back injury. I have had to increase the dosage to two pills every four hours. The only drawback is the weary feeling I get in the middle of the day and constipation (fiber cereal helps).

I was prescribed it for a strained rotator cuff, and it gave me the most bizarre hallucinations: wallpaper-like patterns in 60s colors that slowly moved across the room, slowly opening flowers, etc. When my cat jumped up on the bed, her whiskers glowed in the dark! I finally crashed around  sunup, and woke after 2pm feeling drained and shaky. Not a good outcome when I wanted pain relief and a narcotic effect! I called the doctor, and he told me to take plain old ibuprofen instead--I could have saved a lot of money had I known how I would react! Oh, well, live and learn.

If it is neccessary for you to take this for an extended period it will hurt your stomach. I have been taking this for over a year for chronic back pain. For about a week now I have been suffering from severe stomach pains because after sometime on the medicine you have to take more to get the same relief. The drug makers of vicoprofen suggest not to take the ibuprofen part for longer than 10 days and no more than 5 pills in 24 hours due to stomach problems and possible bleeding of the stomach and intestines. I currently take 6 to 8 a day to get partial relief of back pain and it causes my stomach to hurt severly. I highly suggest to take regular vicodin the kind with the tylenol.

This medicine works wonders each and every month.  A word of advice to some ppl who say it makes them loopy, buy one of those pill splitters, take half and you will see it still helps with pain but doesn't make you as loopy.  I take half if I happen to be working and experience cramps, or a whole if I am home resting. It doesn't make me so loopy I can't function but eases the pain and I feel relaxed.  I have never taken just vicodin but I have taken hydrocodone in the Lorcet form and it makes my nose itch off my face, this does not do that as well.  I am very satisfied with this medication for the reason I take it.

Because I have to work I cut the pill in half and take it every 2-3hrs with additional ibuprofen. Due to my job I can't take the whole tablet because it prevents me from thinking as clear as I should be.  When I'm not at work I'm ok to take the whole tab as directed.   YOU SHOULD WATCH TAKING THIS MED.  IT MAY WORK WELL BUT YOU MAY END UP TAKING MORE THAN YOU NEED. WATCH WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

I had some relief for about 1-2 hours.  I did the research and found vicoprofen and asked for that instead. I find the pain relief to last about 3-5 hours. The only bad part is I have to pay out of pocket for all RXs and this med costs 3 times as much as vicodin. This great countrys medical system sucks.

This med. relieves my pain enough that I walk and still work every day. I have tried it without it and unable to work or walk much due to the pain. For me it is a blessing.

I didn't notice drowsiness. And no stomach upset when taken with food.

I have severe whiplash, back spasms, and knee arthritis. Vicoprofen has helped me greatly. It works much better than regular Vicodin in my opinion. And you dont get that sick nauseated feeling from it at all.2 thumbs up!

My guess is that most of the people who say it isn't as strong are used to hydro/APAP products.  Because APAP potentiates the effects of hydrocodone, it will seem a little stronger in equipotent doses.  That being said, some people (like myself) have never been helped by APAP, it simply does nothing for my pain.  Ibuprofen, on the other hand, is very helpful.  The effects of vicoprofen also last a bit longer than other formulations, therefore you can go longer between doses.  Good luck to everyone.

Pain	Bailey, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	3/4/2008 1:00:45 AM	I have severe arthritis in my hip, lower back and hands.  I took this drug for a rib injury and it worked great.  As for the arthritis, Celebrex and Vioxx did not do the trick that Vicoprofen has done.  I take 1 or 1 and a half, starting in the morning.  I take this pill after I cut it in half and it lasts for several hour. Three halves a day and I can continue with my normal routine.  I now walk as much as possible during the day.  This drug works wonders for me.  I have blood work done every 6 months to insure no internal problems.  If you can handle this drug, it works great for arthritis. I also can bowl 2 times a week now.

I have status migranes that have accellerated since 2004 and I use to keep headaches at a minimum.I don't feel this medication works that well.When I get hospitalized for the pain of migrane I have to be sedated with Demerol from 7 - 10 days. Then coming home I take medication on regular daily basis.

This medication greatly reduced pain in a short amount of time when taken on an empty stomach. Did not do much for inflammation so I took an additional 200mg Ibprofen. Only needed to take two doses daily. Remember effectiveness also has to do with your weight, tolerance to narcotics and nsaids in addition to how much food and type of food you eat. 
Pain		5	5	5			12/5/2007 7:26:40 PM	I had fallen and suffered from a Lumbar Sprain and underwent physical therapy, and my doctor had put me on Hydrocodone accompanied with Tylenol, the dosage was 10mg/325mg, they made me deathly ill, so my doctor prescribed the Vicoprofen(vicodon and ibuprofen) 7.5/200mg and what a relief, the pills do not make me sick and it actually helps the pain and swelling. I would recommend this particular medicine to anyone who has a reaction to Hydrocodone and Acetametaphine.

Pain	EMTERT27PA, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	11/3/2007 12:09:19 PM	I asked my md to switch me to it from lorcet or norco.  I have had to over time, take a GREAT deal of narcotic meds with tylenol in it.  We first went from lortab/lorcet to norco to help it out.  Then I found Vicoprofen.  It makes just much more good sense to me to save the liver the damage for sure if you have to take it in large amounts on a regular basis over an exntended period of time.  Plus, the ibuprofen in it has very very good anti-inflam. properties in it too.......so it makes much more sense for a pain killer in my opinion!  Wish I had found it sooner.  Once I get through with school, I will be prescribing it to my patients across the board over the other narcotics out there of the same strenght (7.5mg hydro).
Pain		3	5	2			10/26/2007 1:01:05 AM	I have TMJ disfuction, degrenerative disc disease, fibromagia, migranes. I was taken Norco 7.5/325. The Dr downgraded me to some Tylenol/codene pill that i found out I was allergic to &amp; almost died in my sleep. They switched me to this which is much weaker then the Norco. Its ok nothing great.

Pain	Alli, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	9/23/2007 11:42:10 PM	My use of this particular medication provided relief from chronic pelvic pain associated with endometriosis and adenomyosis. The medication is very effective in treating my aches and throbbing type pain but did not have much effect on the sharp shooting pains I experienced periodically when sitting or bending. The side effects experienced were quite limited. It causes constipation which ultimately needs to be treated with some OTC type product to relieve it. The other was a feeling of light-headedness coupled with trouble holding attention on a given task or mental exercise. This product has, over time, created two issues for me. One is that of dependency and the other is of tolerance. I had a brief period of time when I had no medication. Within two days, I experienced severe muscle tightening, sinus drainage and an inability to sleep. The anxiety associated with the onset of these symptoms increased a feeling of what I'll call a &quot;tuning fork&quot; effect or &quot;buzz&quot; throughout my body. Not a good feeling whatsoever. The tolerance issue is that it now takes more medication to achieve the same level of pain relief. This is of great concern as the medication contains ibuprofen. Too much of this and other body functions become affected.Overall, the benefit outweighs the risks and side-effects for my situation.
