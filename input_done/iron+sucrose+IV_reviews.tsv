Anemia from Inadequate Iron	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	1/27/2012 7:49:56 AM	I was given the Iron Sucrose Injection all at once. It was given in an Iv. It took a total of 3 hours. A few days after the Iv I felt like every bone in my body ached. My joints were stiff and ached. I had terrible headaches. I ran a fever of about 101. I live in a resort town and this happened  Labor Day weekend and we were short of help. I worked but I thought I was going to die. I have no idea how I made it through. I seriously don't remember much of the month of September. All I remember is how bad I felt. I don't know the dose I received in the Iv but from reading on this site it looks like the Iron Sucrose is usually given over a few days. I'm wondering now if I was given this Iron to quickly. I think my research has just begun.

Other	Dee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	35-44	11/4/2010 8:33:25 PM	I had to have IV's of this iron for 5 weeks, It made my hair fall out, both of my arms hurt bad for weeks, and made me very tired for months, bad taste in my mouth, during IV, bowl trouble. I am more tired now then I was when my blood level was down to 6.0. I had surgery june 2009 that I had internal bleeding, but I was getting back up with iron then i started having bad female problems and my ob/gyn wouldn't help me stop bleeding(bleed for 7month) so my blood got down to 7.2. So thats why I had to take the treatments.
