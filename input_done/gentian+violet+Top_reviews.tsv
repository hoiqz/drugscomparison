She took Q tip and dried the sore,then coated the top with gentian violet.It killed the pain usually within 8 hrs and the sore went away. I have used it on both my children and grandchildren. We treated it as a miracle drug to be respected by all.

Last year I started to have horrible pain in my ears and sore throat. After going to Ear,nose doc twice he finally found a hole in my left ear. No Medication worked. The wise doctor painted the area in my ear with Gentian Violet and by the next day, no pain. The doctors fees $$$$. Gentian Violet from the pharmacy is worth millions to me.Last month, gradually had re-ocurring pain in ears and throat, so my husband carefully cleaned the applicator leaving the tip covered and coated the inside of my ear as far as he could inside as you would clean with a Q-tip and did this twice. What a relief..the next day I was able to talk. I will probably use for a few days, once a day. This is one bottle that should be in every household.

We used as directed and it healed beautifully. Since then we have used it for cuts on our children and us as well. I even used it for a brown recluse spider bite. It healed up beautifully. It stains  but most can be removed with rubbing alcohol.

Skin Infection due to a Candida Yeast	rfaulk, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	4/13/2010 1:30:34 AM	I've had nipple thrush while breastfeeding all 3 of my kids.  Gentian Violet is the ONLY thing that works to clear it up.  I tried every other anti-fungal out there. Nystatin (what a joke...I think the yeast fed off it!), monistat, even diflucan.  Nothing touches it but GV.  It is fast, painless, effective, cheap, and messy!

I raised 5 children and used this regularly for ringworm, infintigo and other infections the doctor even used it on me for a vaginal infection. the only downside to using it is the purple staining but a very good all purpose medication for fungal infections even athletes foot. was used a lot in the 50's.

After meticulous care of him and doctor and medicine totaling almost $350 the rash spread over a 3 week period.  I remembered gentian violet from when I was a little girl and sent my husband to the local pharmacy.  For 98 cents, I swabbed his tummy at 6 p.m. and by the 10 p.m. feeding, I could see the raised rash had flatened.  By the next day the rash started to dissapear and in 3 days was gone.  I have used it ever since on impetigo ring worm etc. etc.

Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/26/2009 8:40:14 AM	My family used this drug for minor cuts and abrasions since the 1960's.  My favorite use was for the sores during chicken pox.  Mom experimented when I got the disease and covered only half of my spots.  The treated spots didn't scar.  When my brother got chicken pox, she covered all of his spots.  Results: I have some scars from the untreated spots, my brother doesn't have any.... I mentioned this to my pediatrician when the first of my three children got chicken pox, he said that it wouldn't work.  He said that the thin skin in some areas resulted in scarring and pointed to one spot that would &quot;definitely scar.&quot;  I used Gentian Violet on all three of my girls.  NOT ONE SCAR ON ANYONE.  Plus it reduces the itching, so they wre less likely to scratch the sores.
Other	ellenpop, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	4/8/2009 9:14:30 PM	Gentian Violet has been a miracle-worker for stubborn thrush inside my 1 month old daughter's mouth and on my nipples since I breastfeed.  We were prescribed Nystatin that needed to be administered 4 times a day for 2 weeks.  Not only did it make a complete mess, it didn't work.  After only 2 treatments of the gentian violet, I no longer have the stabbing pain in my breasts and she doesn't cry during feedings.  The only drawback is that you need to be careful because it will stain, but I found it to be much less messy than the Nystatin since she doesn't spit it everywhere and it's not sticky on me either.

Unfortunatly, it means going into my obgyn once or twice a week for a couple of weeks until the infection clears up.
Other	painted purple, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	4	5	Female		10/12/2008 10:02:25 AM	My mother (82yr) on Oxygen due to COPD.  She often has irritation below her nostrils and sores just inside her nose due to the cannula. Her doctors would not suggest ointment,etc because of the petroluem.  I remembered using gentian violet for sore mouth with my children.  I painted the areas and within a few days the areas began to heal.  She often gets a second look from folks but it is worth it to get relief.My step-father has had problems with pressure sores on his buttocks that just wouldn't quite clear even after antibotics, sitting on a gel cushion,lying down twice a day.  So-I painted his bottom. The areas began to heal within a day.The purple stains may look a little wierd, but at least it is their color!!
