Cold Symptoms	N2S, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	11/22/2010 9:44:44 AM	worked great for my daughter!  Improves her symptoms within 30 minutes of administering it.  If you're worried about your child getting jittery or not sleeping, combine it with a little Advil to combat it.  Of course I only use this when she needs help sleeping because of a bad cough, but I think it's great!
Cough		3	3	1			5/22/2010 9:01:05 AM	Daughter had severe allergic reaction within hours of taking clofera and ended up in the ER.  Extremely dis-oriented, hallucinations, dizziness, eractic blood pressure.  Poison Control said this medicine works in the brain to suppress cough and has no idea how long medicine stays in the body.  ER doctor called in toxicologist to run a full tox screen.  5 days since last dose of medicine and my daughter is still a little dis-oriented.

Cold Symptoms	Skies2blu, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	2/9/2010 8:16:52 AM	Prescribed for our 3 1/2 year old.  Has worked very well and seems to assist her in sleeping.  No noticable side effects.  Basically used only at nightime as this allowed her to sleep.  During the day, we believe coughing is necessary to move phlegm.
