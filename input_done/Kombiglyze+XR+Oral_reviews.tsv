Something I normally experience.  As a restult, I feel like I have stomach discomfort all day long.  Since the drug is time released, I feel like eating to support my medication.  There is nothing better than injectable mixed pens to control your sugar.  You bring it to level, and leave it alone, and stop eating snacks between meals.  I will be having route y barriatric surgery soon to forever get rid of my problems.  I'm tired of the meds.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Joe, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	7/30/2012 8:51:56 AM	I have been taking this for about a week and so far so good.  Only mild side affect, some diarrhea.  Pill is large as others have said but not too hard to swallow.  My readings are improved and for the first time fell below 100 once.  Hard to say for sure though if it is the drug or the fact that I have changed my diet, but likely a combination of both
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Annie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	7/27/2012 4:25:38 PM	Went off of Actos and Metformin due to medical reports of bladder cancer. I went on this a month ago and levels went very high in the 190s to 315s. Prior to this, 147 to 180.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	6/12/2012 11:58:00 AM	This medication has worked very well for me, as I am bad at taking meds on time. It has helped immensley with getting my AM glucose down. I just have to make sure I have a glass of skim milk in the evening with it.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Pamalou, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	45-54	5/27/2012 1:40:38 PM	I started taking this medication over two weeks ago.  After the second dose I started vomiting profusely.  I continued for a few days and my readings came down from 180 - 190 to 120.  After reading these reviews I feel like I should continue this med and see if the side effect subsides.  Will let you know!
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	sandy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	4/28/2012 8:31:37 AM	I have been on this med for about a year, I take 2.5mg/1000mg twice a day.  It has been better than the metformin.  But I think I might get better results from the pills if I excercised and ate better.  It does make me nauseated if I do not eat after taking the pill.  I must eat something about every 3 hours or i will start to feel sick.  If I go to bed without something of substance in my belly, I will wake up 2 to 3 hours later sick on the stomache. Sometimes a cup of applesauce or fruit cup is not enough to prevent the upset stomache. So I have to eat more than I want sometimes. There is some loose stools from the meds but since I am on a statin that constipates it will balance it out most of the time.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/12/2012 8:33:34 AM	I take 1 pill a day with dinner.  My glucose levels starting dropping immediately and were below 120 within 3 weeks. When I started I had 1 day of mild digestive issues.  It has made my diagnosis and life style changes seem effortless.  I am very happy with this medication.

I really liked Avandamet--used it for 6 years with no problem.  On this new med for 3 days. I am experiencing severe chest pains lasting an hour (first night), severe reflux and abdominal pain (second night), reflux, gas, belching and constipation by 3rd night.  None of this is normal for me. Has anyone experienced these problems?

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	scaqrletheather76, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	35-44	3/27/2012 12:08:42 PM	It seems as though no one who's reviewed this drug has taken it long term! I've been on it for 7mos. It's helped a lot, with my insulin, to reduce glucose levels without causing me the diarrhea metformin alone caused. I take 2.5/1000 every 12 hrs. Now I'm having bad liver tests and presumed lactic acidosis. Short term I found it an excellent help but long term I'm suffering in pain, have a ton of trouble exercising and working is out of the question. There just isn't energy and the pain meds I'm taking to treat the pain from the lactic acidosis wipes me out. On top all that, the pills are gigantic, can't be crushed or split (because they're time release) and I tend to choke on them. 
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Linda, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/4/2012 1:55:47 PM	I have had no side effects from this medication, but I do take it in the morning with breakfast.  My AM sugars have been 120 and under with most at 98-100.  Like only taking one pill/day.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	MimiJo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	2/8/2012 11:59:09 AM	Have been taking this drug for about 4 months. Metformin alone did not do the job. This has been very effective, yes, there is some diarreha, but mostly just a more frequent need to go.  I've lost 14 lbs and do watch my BG very closely. The readings are great unless I mess up in the food dept. My excercise program is VERY low key.  I do need to step it up and get serious about it.  I take this med 1x per day with the evening meal and find it works great for me.  The most difficult thing for me is eating a meal on schedule!

I couldnt loose weight My MD told me you cant loose weight with high blood sugar. Now my BS is 90 and some 80s. I work hard. Because this med is really expensive. I walk 60 minutes every am. Then in the pm I go to the gym I do 60 minutes on the eliptical and 30 minutes on the rowing machine. Sometimes I swim after that. I joined calorie counter its free. I now know how to count carbs I bought the Mayo Clinic Diabetes Book. I know how to cook the right way because I feel like Im ripping my family off by throwing money away for this drug.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	kellyj, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	8/6/2011 6:57:25 AM	I have been on it for four weeks. My blood sugar levels are going down, but the nausea and diarrhea are very bothersome. I acutally did not make it to the bathroom one time while out dining with my family. I take it with my evening meal as prescribed but I am nauseous after about three hours until the next night when it is time to take it again. I find that I am so sick to my stomach at times that I skip a dose, which is not helpful in controlling my diabetes. Just the thought of taking it makes me want to vomit. I hope it works well for others.

Could not get my blood sugar below 180 with Metformin 500mg 2x per day and Glipizide 3x per day, since starting this about 2 months ago, I am regularly at 120 or below with some morning readings at 80-90.  I am also taking Glipizide 3x per day with this, going to cut back to 2x with doctor approval, hope to get down to one drug only eventually if I can lose another 10 lbs.
