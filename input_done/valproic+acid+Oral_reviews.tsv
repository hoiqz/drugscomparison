Petit Mal Seizures	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	10/2/2012 12:04:34 AM	My daughter is 4 years old. She was prescribed 1.5 ml which did work for her in stopping the seizures. She also had absence seizures. It made her hair fall out and gave her terrible mood swings. She is being weined off this medicine and put on Topamax Sprinkles.

Two weeks after he started it he had a major panic attack which resulted in a suicidal attempt he has been hospitalised in intensive care and his doctors insist on taking it. so he does. But i am very uncertain and sceptical about it because i beleive that this medicine is totally blocking him.

Weight gain seems to be the most noticable side effect, 10-12 lbs., then infrequent fluctuations of approx. 5 lbs or so. I also take sertraline; buproprion, propranolol, trazodone. Mild side effects overall.

Tried many other meds. None worked! I take this with xanax and it keeps me cool, calm and collect. I have noticed that it has had an effect on my sex drive which is much lower now and slight weight gain and loss of some hair. I use a medication for erectile dysfunction and it helps. To me this was my miricaL DRUG!!!!! For many it might not be. Im also on celexa for depression which also was a mirical med!!!

Since taking Intuniv he has had bad side effects. He has unctrollable vertical eye stares, explosive behavior and verbal tremors. The doctor said the reaction was from Geodon, but after reading the web info for myself, I notice that Intuniv lists drug interaction with Valproic Acid.  After today, I will gradually take him off of Valproic Acid myself.

Initially diagnosed with depression, subsequently altered to bipolar disorder.  Have been on 750 mg divided dose for several years, no significant side effects.  Went off medication for 3 months, had a manic episode characterized by wild overspending and other dangerous behaviors.  Resumed medication regimen and brought symptoms under control within 3 weeks.  I have had good success with this medication.

Bipolar Depression	Stephanie A., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	9/17/2010 6:02:23 AM	In the beginning this medication worked great for my Bipolar/ Manic Depression. My only complaint was the indigestion it gave me. I started gaining a lot of weight and my hair started falling out at around 4 months. I have gained 35 lbs in 5 months and lost over half my hair by the time my doctor told me to stop this medication. I had decreased my dose to 1/4 mgs until I could see her. This caused me to become more anxious than ever and began having bad anxiety attacks. Been off it for 2 weeks and my hair is still falling out really bad. My pharmacist suggested I take AG Pro (behind the counter at Wal-Mart but non-prescription). I am extremely unsatisfied with this medication and wish I had never started taking it.
Other	RicSis , 3-6 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	2	2	Female	3-6	9/12/2010 12:39:52 PM	My 4 year old granddaughter takes this medication for seizures.  She is also autistic.  Became very tired and nauseated and quiet urinating, found out that the drug had caused liver enzymes in the triple digets.  very scary, however the neurologist wants to keep her on it because he states that the othet meds at her age to control the seizures are even more dangerous.  Prescribed medication to help bring the enzymes down, seems to be working.  has anyone else had problems with the liver and this medication?

Had been taking it with no problems for years in conjunction with 2 mg of klonopin.  Went West and the drug store and they dispensed this drug as a generic for depakote.  Very bad reaction, incuding inability to walk, tremors, shaking etc.  This came in a large oval pill, produced as depakene on the label, the pill had &quot;Devil&quot; or something similiar imprinted on it by the drug company.  Those who have taken Depakote on the East Coast should be careful when changing to this &quot;generic&quot; - same for the klonopin I was taking - it changed to a green rather than blue pill in the West (Colorado).  Generics are not always the same as the brand name - depakote has two generics that are actually chemically different.

I am fairly active and eat a constant diet, so definitely from the meds.  Also have a lot of stomach pain, but the worst is the heartburn and taking so many pills at one time.

Multiple Seizure Types	thspaceman, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	45-54	7/6/2009 5:37:43 PM	This drug should not be given to any epileptic.This drug has caused many problems.I have been taking for many years.Effects have never been told, only liver, which count is starting to fall.I intend to see a neurologist immediatly to be taken off this drug. I have had epilepsy since i was twelve, and many types of drugs. I have all three types of epilepsy, and now reaching towards 50, and never going any length of time without seizures, one neurologist increased the dosage...and i didnt have the sense god gave me to look this drug up. If your doctor suggests putting you on this drug, ask for an alternative, i currently take 1250mg in morning and at night, as well as lamactogine and lorazepam. This drug does no good for anyone with our disability, please dont think that this drug will control your seizures. Thank YouLeonard K. Collins

Seizures with Breaks in Consciousness &amp;amp; Other Symptoms	Tom, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	4/12/2008 9:31:40 PM	I switched to Depakote in 1999 on learning that Dilantin made me dizzy.  I stopped taking Depakote for almost 30 days in December 2005 when I learned my insurance for the year had topped-out and a 1 mo supply would cost me $125.  I foolishly believed I bcould go a month with no Depakote until my Rx coverage kicked-in again January 2006.  Around Christmas 2005 my wife noticed i was having minor seizures that I did not even recognize at the time.  After about two weeks of symptoms reappearing, i mentioned to my wife &quot;oh, by the way, I've temporarily stopped taking the Depakote.&quot;  She immediately saw the connection. We asked our doctor if a generic, less costly, form was available, and I immediately switched to Valproic Acid, 2 250 mg caps 3 times a day.  With attention to exercise, sleep and diet, I've had no problems since.

I am frustrated that I have to take 10 - 250mg pills to get the correct does.  That's a lot of pills!  It is also the only medication I can afford.  I have hair loss and hand tremors.  I don't know about weight gain.  I don't think I can attribute all my weight gain to my meds.  I'm lazy.  I don't feel it controls all my bipolar symptoms and I don't want to increase my dose any further.  I would love to try something else with fewer pills that I could still afford.

Worked great on mood with pleasant side effect of deminished food intolerances. No more lactose intolerance etc. Downside it caused hands to swell and severe joint pain in already damaged knees. Changed to DIVALPROEX. Mood correction the same but food intolerance came back.

But this seemed to be the only generic brand of mood-stabilizer I could find and that's all my insurance would cover. I was on Depakote which is my preference.
