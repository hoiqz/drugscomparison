Overweight	Susie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	7/21/2012 10:08:36 PM	Alli 2012 GlaxoSmithKline changed the supplier of the Active ingredient Orlistat 60mg from Roche in Florence South Carolina, to India. The Orlistat from India is inert. Prior to the Orlistat shortage in January of 2012 this product was very effective. Alli with Orlistat from India does not work.

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	3	1	Female	35-44	9/13/2011 6:58:45 PM	I started using this product in February and was seening weight lose results. Towards the end of March I started feeling very tired and just not myself, few days later I ended up in the emergency room and was told I had pancreatitis. I had no health insurance due to a cut back at work and now I am stuck with a $18,000 hospital bill. I would be very careful if you choose to use this product. The weight lose results did not compare to the pain and finacial hardship this has caused.

I crapped my pant too but it was because I ate a high fat diet (I learned my lesson).  Those of you who are just starting; Don't fart!

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	5	5	Female	35-44	8/30/2010 8:32:38 PM	I have been taking Alli for two weeks and have had good results. After reading many replies to this drug one thing people forget is your body has to adjust to the medicine just like any other. The uses say Alli breaks down the fat in foods to smaller pieces and what is not absorbed into the body goes to the bowl. So if you are consuming more than the alotted amount of fat intake for the day, what do you think is going to happen? The extra fat has to go somewhere and would you rather it stay in your body or go out in poo? The first week I did have mild cramping just before a loose stool but as my body adjusted to the medicine, I no longer have the cramps or the diarrhea. Cut back on your fat intake people and the poo's will go away and read the directions thoroughly!

Overweight	mtbroadcaster, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	25-34	5/12/2010 5:15:30 PM	Alli was not helpful at all with in loosing weight.  Perhaps its because when the FDA approved this drug for over the counter, behind the counter it is known as Orlistat, the dose that was approved is not even close to prescription strength.  All I ever get from this drug was horrible urges to use the bathroom and the so called, &quot;treatment&quot; effects.  If interested in the loosing weight consult a physician and discuss the weight loss pill, &quot;Phentermine.&quot;  Very good pill that helps curb hunger like  you wouldn't believe.  Along with diet and exercise and changing your life, that pill seems to help greatly!  45 lbs in two months, in my opion, is pretty darn good!

Overweight	ILoveMyDogs, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	4/17/2010 1:06:44 AM	I am really confused with this product. I started out eating right and taking this, and I didn't have any issues with treatment effects, so I wasn't sure if it was working. To test it, I ate a meal with a good deal of fat in it, as I was staying home that afternoon and could be in the bathroom at a moment's notice. Well, nothing happened! So now I am just eating normally and taking it, and I have no side effects, except that I am more gassy now, but the gas isn't accompanied by leakage or stains. I am thinking I have an issue with my own digestive tract, because this doesn't make any sense. I am sorry that some people have had problems with this medication. I have lost 10 pounds, but I can't say that it was all due to this medication because I changed my eating habits at first, and now that I'm back eating normally, its at a standstill.

I stick to 12g of fat per meal MAX ... no alcohol ... no candy ... stuff you should be staying away from anyway if you want to lose weight ... this pill just sits there and reminds you what to eat because if you don't then you will end up with that leaky butt =/

Not only does it help by blocking some of the fat, if you do it correctly it helps you to really realize what you are putting into your body. I have not had ONE negative side effect as a result of taking this medication and it IS helping with my weight loss along with exercise and diet.

I've been taking it for a month and very easy to us and had NO discharge at all which I thought was great and lost 4pds.   THEN my gum's were really red getting canker sores and my private area also getting little sores. OMG!! At night I can not sleep because of uncontrollable chill then severe hot flashes.  I would wake up with joint pain all over my body like when you have the worst flu ever that's exactly how I feel.  I've been off the pill for 5days and still having these effects.  I go to the Dr. tomorrow.DO NOT US THIS PRODUCT IT REALLY SUCKS! I'm writing to the FDA after this BE AWARE!! 
Overweight	slim13, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	3/8/2010 2:38:11 PM	I had to review because of all the negative talk about the drug. I have only been on it 2 weeks, the people complaining are obviously not reading the label. Dont eat fatty foods! There are 2 things going on here. Helps you, well almost forces you, to cut down on fat or risks side effects and helps absorb less fat when you do. I am on a strict diet in hopes of losing some weight. I am healthy but I have put on a few extra in the last few years. I exercise and I eat food with almost little to no fat. (Egg white, chicken breast, veggies, salad, and I read every label b4 I eat)Some of these people compalining are probably eating McDonalds and then taking a pill or think they are eating fat free food and not reading the labels. Educate yourself people. I have had no side effects except once when I ate out with the family gave in to a craving and had a burger. I felt some crapping, mild,  but I deserved it. Other than that one time I have never felt a side effect. I eat well. If you eat poorly this drug or any other drug will not work, geez.
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	5	1	Female	35-44	2/25/2010 11:04:16 AM	This is a horrible product!! It shouldn't be on the market. I have only been taking this medication for a week and started having these issues within a little bit of time!It stains your underwear &amp; it even stained my pants!! It leaks the treatment out of you even if you have a high fiber diet &amp; low fat diet. I would never recommend this to anyone.

Overweight	KJCBW, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1		45-54	1/17/2010 8:08:20 AM	Only took it for a week and it caused an oily discharge that stained my underwear yellow. I admit I ate something I should not have but the real problem was a urinary tract infection that required medication. This was probably due to the leaky discharge going where it should not go. As far as weight loss I have lost a little but I will not continue taking Alli because it is messy business. Good luck to all of you who have had good results and have the willpower to not eat any fatty foods on a diet.  
Overweight	cutiepie1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/14/2010 3:03:38 AM	I've been taking Alli for almost a week. Its easy to use just take one at every meal. Now as for the side effects or wait, wait....&quot;treatment effects&quot;, when they say DO NOT go over 15g of fat per meal they mean it. Don't go out and try to STILL eat that pound and a half of bacon and 5 dounuts. This is NOT a &quot; I eat what I want and still lose weight thing.&quot; You have to work with this, you know eat right and work out. Also someone put a review on here saying DONT FART....this is so true! You may think that you just have a little gas.... GET TO A BATHROOM! Trust me on this one. As for the results..I just started, but I feel like my clothes are fitting a little loser! I hope someone finds this very helpfull.

I became concerned when I had what I thought was a crook in my neck from sleeping wrong, but it has been more than 4 days and it is still there. I have also experienced elevated blood pressure with a persistent headache that will not subside even after taking aspirin or tylenol. I have not lost any weight although I do make frequent trips to bathroom. I also can not get rid of this sore throat and flu like symptoms.  I will try to adjust medication with one pill a day in the evening and see if side effects subside, if not i will stop taking altogether.

I experienced severe sleepiness almost immediately after taking a pill that would last for hours.  Not only was I extremely tired but I felt like I couldn't think straight.  I stopped using it after a few days when I realized the symptoms were not a fluke. I regularly maintain a low fat diet but experienced the bowel side effects anyway. Those took days to subside even after stopping the pill.  Just not worth it to lose a few pounds.

I spent four days in the hospital unable to eat or drink.  My second day home and I still can not eat and the pain is still in my side from the after effects.  I'm a healthy middle aged woman who wanted to lose about fifty pounds.  In my opinion, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Google this before considering taking this product.

You only experience the side effects if you eat high fatty foods. The nice thing about this med is it reminds you of what we put our bodies through from eatting bad foods. I have lost weight on the drug. There is no magic bullet you have to eat right and work out. It takes energy to gain weight so it takes energy to lose weight. At least with alli a lot of fat is coming out your body making it eaiser to lose weight.

I have been overweight my whole life and alli is the only pill I have taken that has helped me to change my life completely.  Not one other diet pill has even began to do what alli has done for me I can't stress it enough! Alli has helped me to make better food choices and to make exercise a part of my everyday life. The alli program has been the easiest program for me to follow and as long as you know how to follow instructions it is as easy as PIE lol!  Yes there are treatment effects but they only happen when you eat something that is over 15g of fat.  Alli is a fat blocker but it also helps you to stick to your diet because if you don't you will get treatment effects. Alli does effect people differently but for the most part you only get treatment effects if you CHEAT ON YOUR DIET!  So stick to your diet and exercise and you won't even feel or see the treatment effects of alli but you will most deffinately see weight loss results.  It's all a mind game and lots of hard work but if there is a will there is a way!  Alli has worked wonders for me and I hope this review will help someone else gain the confidence to proceed with their weight loss goals. Good Luck and God Bless!P.S.  Be sure to get the alli starter pack first b/c they give you an online membership to their website which makes your life easier by providing different tools for your weightloss success!

But then I found god, and surrounded myself by those whom love me and have my best interest at heart. I then learn about this drug from my biology professor whom lost over sum 75lb from this drug. I have recently tried it and can see dramatic changes within my weight. I thrilled with the results. I have already lost 20 within 8 week along with diet and exercise. I filled with joy and wont to tell all I can about this drug. There is HOPE, there is HELP! its FDA approved. TRUST ME YOU WILL LOVE IT! I have changed my life and Im sure it will change yours.

But because of the flu symptoms( I was sick last oct for a month!) I have learned to adjust the medicine. For others suffering from the flu try this, I take 1 pill every other day and two if I go out to eat. It seems if you take the regular dose, 3 pills a day, you will get sick even if you take multivitamins.

Also, I understood how to use the product and how to take it. I am very pleased. Weight loss have been more than I expected with no side effects.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female	25-34	12/30/2008 3:19:36 PM	I have been taking this medication for about a week. The timing was bad due to the holidays but it helped keep me on track, and I have not had any abnormal bowel function. The one side effect I have had, is becoming extremely itchy. I developed hives on my neck and was so itchy I wanted to rip through my skin. I am not ready to give up on it yet, I am going to try removing a dose from my daily intake.

Overweight	ChicagoBride, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	4	4	Female	25-34	12/8/2008 12:57:10 PM	I used this pill before my wedding to lose weight. I lost about 10 pounds in six weeks using Alli in the following way: I didn't want to get the oily gross side effects, so I alternated meals. Day One: Take Alli with Breakfast and Dinner (not at lunch)Day Two: Take it with Lunch (not at breakfast or dinner)I didn't have any of the side effects at all, but I was VERY careful not to go above 15 grams of fat at any given meal, even those where I wasn't taking Alli. I did gain the weight back after I stopped taking it, but that was my own fault- I stopped watching my diet and stopped exercising frequently. All in all, I give it a good review- it was extremely effective then, and I've just started taking it again. 
Overweight		3	5	4			11/22/2008 10:54:44 AM	I have just been taking Alli for a week, and already feel my clothes are not as tight. I have no bowel side effects at all. However, I do sometimes feel sleepy after taking the pill.  Does anyone have a similar experience? Might be because I forget to take a multi vitamin each day.  Just wondering if any similar experiences.

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/7/2008 9:34:30 PM	I have been taking alli for about a year now. I wrote my initial review back in November stating that, at that time i had lost approx. 5 pounds and had been taking alli for about a month. Alli has continued to help me lose weight. I take alli for about 2 months at a time, after that I notice I stop losing weight (but don't gain it either as long as I eat right). After a month of being off alli I take it again for 2 months, then off again, on for 2 mo's again and repeat... I have lost a total of 25 pounds to date, about 1/2 pound to a pound a week. (slow moving but hey at least its something) I feel better than I have felt in years. I haven't been at this weight since I was in my 20's. I still have a long way to go, about 45 pounds. If I put a little effort into some exersize i know i would lose faster. Good luck to ALL. Hope you all do well in your weight loss.

I found a few boards online which state that could be a side effect. I was really hoping to continue with this but now and not sure. Anyone else have simliar problem?
Overweight	festivelady826, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/29/2008 3:47:33 PM	I have cancer (leiomyosarcoma) and take OxyContin for pain. I don't exercise much anymore, and have gained approximately 30 lbs. in the last 3 years. I bought Alli because my pain meds make me very constipated, and I had read previous reviews about the laxative effects.I love it! I abhor taking laxatives because of the cramping, gas, etc. I take Alli as directed with my meals and I keep them under the recommended 15 grams of fat. I no longer have constipation at all, but I have not had the oily discharge and spotting that others experienced, probably due to the high amount of pain mediciation I take.I lost 8 pounds in one month and I now have regular, painless BM's every day. This drug has been a miracle cure for my constipation and my weight gain! I suffered no ill side effects at all. Note: It is very important to keep your fat grams at or under the recommended amounts. The gas and oily discharge is brought about when one EXCEEDS the fat grams, as the drug cannot process the excess fat. It is very easy for me to stick to this plan by eating Lean Cuisines, or other pre-packaged meals with the caloric/fat gram count on the package. It is truly a no-brainer.

It worked perfectly for me. There's a learning curve, You'll figure out real quick what you can eat and what you can't eat alot of. Before Alli I was constipated always, Not anymore.I love my results. I use it now for maintance.

I have now been on it for a few months, the weight loss is almost NONE, and I am constatly hungry, my stomach growls alot. I stoped taking them, and am regaining weight.
Other	Cpose, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	5/7/2008 10:38:23 PM	For those with IBS, beware of what normally sends you over the edge.  I have it with constipation and this medication actually helps me eat better.  I tried to cheat when I first started, but I had an explosive BM.  After that, I learned to eat less fatty, sugar foods to include any form of red meat/beef.  It's all a mimd thing, but I have been on it for about a week and a half and my clothes have already loosened and I lost about 2 lbs.  I work out regaulary and eat right and drink tons of water.  Enjoy!

Overweight	paddle-girl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/30/2007 2:16:10 PM	I am extremely pleased with this product. I was on a LOW-FAT version of a low-carb diet...for years,... &amp; was stuck in a plateau. I have a verrrry sluggish metabolism. I tried Alli. I found I am eating as before... but started incorporating  either one-half of a low-carb pita bread for sandwiches, OR a bit of rice, OR 1/2 cup of oatmeal in the morning. On top of that.... I exercise like a madwoman...... as before. Did I experience incredible weight loss with ALLI...?    No,.... but I am extremely pleased... as I am actually eating a few  carbs ..usually first thing in the morning. This is amazing...  I have lost 30 pounds so far - in a 3-month period, but I  feel great, feel like I am eating a NORMAL meal now.  I still do not eat white flour, ice-cream, high-fat &amp; high sugar foods. I have not eaten them in 10 years. However I have balance in my life again.  I am SOOOOO HAPPY.   Try this... If you are NOT metabolically resistant like me - you will lose much more quickly,.... but I am abolutely THRILLED with my SUCCESS. P.S. One thing though... It's like having a built-in baby-sitter or guardian watching over you. If you eat too much fat at one meal....   you better stay close to home.... or wear a panty-liner, I now count my fat grams &amp; have been without incident for awhile.   EXREMELY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT.   You will be - TOO...!!!
