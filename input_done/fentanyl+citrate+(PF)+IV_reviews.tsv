Sedation with Ability to Respond to Stimulation or Speech	KJ, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/9/2012 3:18:49 PM	Received this drug along with versad twice for out-patient varicose vein procedures.  Found it to be effective- meaning I had no pain and wasn't aware of the procedure but could talk with the Dr. alomost immediately after he finished..  Felt and acted a little goofy for the next 24 hours but recovered well.  Only after effects for me were slight nausea and slight headache. 
Other	Didi Paano, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	65-74	9/27/2011 1:18:07 PM	Had lumbar facet injections past week; doctor used Fentanyl as an anesthetic.  Broke out in severe rash/itching, which has lasted for over a week.  Extremely distressful.  Medication to stop this is also very scary; i.e., Prednisone and Hydroxyzine.   Will NEVER have them use this on me again...not worth the hell I've gone through this past week!
Acute Pain Following an Operation	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	4/28/2011 4:21:26 PM	My 13 y/o son was given this following a crushing injury to his foot without effectiveness, after they had given him enough to 'knock a horse down' they gave him demerol with relief.  After orthopedic surgery to fix his foot,(I told the Dr about the first experience with it) he was again given this, without effectiveness. Transferred to Ped unit from Recovery with blood pressure out of this world and in an extreme amount of pain.  They all want me to believe was just a reaction to coming out from under the ansethia.........

Acute Pain Following an Operation	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/24/2010 8:56:06 PM	Great Stuff.  I was given this after open heart surgery after a couple days on morphine and before I was started on dilaudid.  Nurse gave me darvocet first, however, I had an allergic reaction to the darvocet, so they switched to Fentanyl.  I was able to sleep alot which was great.  Easy to use as the nurses just put in by IV.  Much better for pain control than Percocet which I was given at the hospital after a previous heart surgery.

I would not reccomend this medication to anyone who has trouble with pain medications not working right for them.
