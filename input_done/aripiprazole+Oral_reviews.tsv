Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	mswilson,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	1	1	Female		11/25/2010 9:09:28 PM	My 55 year old father was recently taken off Respridol and put on Abilify. In two weeks time he has lost mobility. He complains of stiff muscles in his legs. He looks like hes ice skating when he's trying to walk, unable to pick up his feet. He's not sleeping and even though i have to hold him up to walk, he still has the urge to get up and walk around every 10-15 mins. It's scary and sad to see my father like this. His eyes that were once bright and twinkled now look dull, dead and aged. The slight change in his mood swings aren't worth all of the side effects!

It has been a god send as I have Major Depressive disorder re current. I know get up from bed and have more energy to interact with others. 10mg. of Ablify has done it. Please if you suffer from Major Depression unresolved from SSRI's ask your doctor about this med. I am not 100% but the mood is so much better I can not tell you.

Only prob was I was TOO motivated, it was like I had restless BODY syndrome. I may be the only person who had this reaction, but I broke out in huge hives all over my body. We couldn't figure out what it was until I quit taking Abilify. *If it hadn't been for the hives, I'd still be on it. The restless feeling was definitely worth the good moods.

Schizophrenia	prozacplease, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	19-24	5/14/2009 4:16:10 AM	This is a better treatment for bipolar,schizophrenia is more of an incureable disease. The mood stablizing that this drug offers is useful when becomeing used to the symptoms associated with schizophrenia... It is not a cure all and there is no cure for something that is not caused by an chemical imbalance. However like I said it may ease the emotional symptoms, and cause weight gain etc.
