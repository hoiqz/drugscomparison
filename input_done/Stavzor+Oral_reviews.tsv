He started taking Stavzor 4 weeks ago.  His dose is up to 2000mg and he has had no side effects. It is working extremely well on his manic symptoms.

Migraine Prevention	Erin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/13/2011 6:31:02 AM	I was put on this medication for chronic migraines after being taken off Topamax, which was very effective but caused me severe joint pain. I take 250-500 mg a day, depending on how my symptoms have been, and that seems to be a good balance. I am not migraine-free like I was while on the Topamax, but it is quite effective. It has not caused any side effects, not even nausea, which I tend to get very easily on oral medications.

I gained weight on Depakote.  Then the pharmacy or insurance company switched it to generic - they were horrible - smelled nasty.  The doctor changed it to stavzor and  these smaller gelcaps are much easier to swallow - this is a big improvement - no more gagging.

Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	10/31/2009 12:31:43 PM	Hope this helps. I am newly diagnosed and have only been on Stavzor for a little over two weeks. It has considerably improved my mood! Some light side effects I have gotten are; diahrea, feeling drugged at a couple of intervals, restless sleeping, nausea and a missed period. But please note, the effects listed have been light. Overall, so far, the benefits outweigh the risks but always be very aware of what you're body is telling you.
