TIRED ALL THE TIME, HUGE WEIGHT GAIN and MY LEGS ARE LIKE MEMORY FOAM FROM THE SWELLING, I know it is from ACTOS 30mg 1 per day (enough said).  TOO DANGEROUS!  I ALSO PEE ALL THE TIME, RIDICULOUS! I'm not asking, I'm quitting.  I've been taking it for approx. (2) years, too long! Yes,taking 1 pill a day is easy and my A1C is always below 6.5 however, I wasn't an additional 100 pounds overweight either.  For Type 2 diabetes they say, LOSE WEIGHT, how can I if this medicine made me gain more?  I QUIT!

I looked it up on the web and it clearly stated under &quot;side effects&quot; that it CAUSES CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE!!  DON'T EVER TAKE THIS DRUG.  IT WILL KILL YOU.  After going off the medication I lost most of the weight I had gained, the swellling and shortness of breath went away and I could walk more that 20 feet without stopping to catch my breath.  I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS DRUG TO ANYONE.

A1C went down from 8.9 to 6.9, but the back up to 8.1 in 6 months. I used to play tennis 3 times per week and was very active. Now, my muscles, knees, hands, shoulders, and legs hurt so bad I can't play any more, I can't do the farm &amp; ranch work I've always done, and trying to sleep with the pain is nearly impossible. I got off of Actos for 2 weeks recently, but only saw mild relief....maybe I need to get off for a longer period of time. My diet hasn't been bad, but it's nearly impossible to lose weight. I have to take lots of Ibuprofen to tolerate the pain, and sometimes Vicoden at night. I've had about all I can stand of the pain, but need to get my BG levels down, and don't want to go on insulin......

In July 2011 I switched Medical Clinics and the first thing that my new provider did was take me off of Actos and place me on an insulin pen. I within 1 month had gained 20 lbs, and this was after I started eating less carbs and eating more fresh, uncooked vegi's. I now, Oct 2011 have been Dx's with new changes in my EKG. I should never have been put on this medication, I have had abnormal Liver panels for more than 5 years. Not life threatening high just slightly elevated, and have been monitored closely since that time with no changes. I need to talk to the Dr. about that and the fact that my Gall Bladder has been acting up since just after I started taking Actos.

I do sweat a lot, but perhaps that is just being outside in Florida!  I've not gained any excessive amount of weight over the 4 years I've been on it.  I've also not suffered from pain or swelling at all.  The effectiveness of this drug is amazing.  I could live without out it, but I'd have to be extremely careful with my diet.  My A1C is good, so I think that shows it is effect.With that said, after hearing about the cancer issues, I will be discussing switching with my doctor at my next visit.  Last time I checked two years ago, I didn't see anything that was as effective that didn't have significant risk associated with it.

I had heart surgery in Jan. and then had complications of water retention around lungs.  I had three thoracintis (remove excess water) procedures.  After the third time a friend of mine sent me an article explaining that actos caused water retention.  I showed family doc and surgeon the article.  Family doc took me off actos immediately.  Four weeks later my surgeon found no evidence of water around my lungs.  My blood glucose level stayed the same as well.

Weight gain 20lbs,swelling/bloating &amp; heart palpitations. Dr diagnosis is Nesidioblastosis not DM2. I am questioning now why treatment for DM2 with these meds. All is very frustrating. I think I will go back to the metformin. My alc changed from 6.5 to 6.1 while on the Actos but I feel the health warnings should be listened to.

I started out weighting 196lbs and now I'am 203lbs. I just wonder will the weight slow down or will it continue to escalate? I'am very concerned about the weight gain. Sometimes I notice that my feet and hands are swollen; but when I go to bed and wake up the next morning they aren't swollen at all; but later that day they become swollen all over again. Does anyone else have these same symptoms?

My sister's nutritionist took her off this medicine when she staarted her weight loss program telling her this medication can prevent weight loss. I need to know if anyone else has had this experience. I am trying to lose weight, I ahve cut my portions in half &amp; am eating healthier &amp; exercising, but I am not losing weight. I need to know if it is becasue of the Actos medication? 
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	7/13/2011 5:07:13 PM	my nutrionist (I have type 2 diabetes) said a recent study shows that is drug may cause bladder cancer and he was required to tell me about it.  I have a history of breast cancer and there may be an alternative medicine.  I opt to for go the actos and just continue to use the medformin 1000 mg twice a day.  I am going to have some blood test done and will determine if I use actos or something else.  I need reassurance that this is the right decision.  My endocrinologist and nutriencist agreed.

I have also had shortness of breath and edema. After a recent trip to the Dr.'s office (seeing a Dr. other than my primary care Dr.) I was told the extreme swelling in my right leg was probably a side effect of the Actos. I imediatly stopped taking this medication and after 1 week have lost 10 pounds and can actually see both my ankles again. I will be seeing my primary care Dr. and cant wait to ask him why after me complaing and being sent for mri on my leg yrs ago because of the swelling he didnt know or consider the side effects of this medicine.

When I saw my cardiologist he expressed alarm because of the side effect of fluid retention causing congestive heart failure.  He allowed me to try it for a couple of months, but it really had no effect on the diabetes, did cause swelling in my extremeties, and worst of all caused repeated sinus infections (due to swelling of sinus membranes)  Actos was not a good drug for me.

His insurance decided to take it off the formulary. There has been no change in his numbers except that he lost some weight. The swelling in his ankles has gone down. I can only say that I go with him to his Drs. appts, I take notes and ask questions. If your doctor(s) don't listen to you maybe it is time to find another doctor. They are your employe, you pay them directly or thru your insurance premiums. It is your body, your qulaity of life. fight for your rights as a patient.

Started with glimepiride/metformin..work well A1c 6.1 gained wieght, swithced to prandin/metformin worked OK A1cs 7-8 range lost wieght, but eventually even with a low carb diet/excersize the A1c over 8. Started Lantus/metformin..felt great, had no idea how bad I had felt...was even thinking of stopping omeperazol for acid reflux..then Dr. added Actos 15mg, at first I blamed everything on a sinus infection/acid relux..but the swollen/burning tongue/throat, trouble breathing at night, and now chest pain that is not the same as the acid relux pain has me stopping against Dr's orders to keep it up. Otherwise my next stop is an emergency room this can not safe. But only 4 days off and the effects are calming down...not sure if after almost 3 months the actos had any effect on the blood sugar. But with Lantus/metformin my glucose is in control....it is very hard for me not to obey my Dr., but there are so many other diabetes drugs, why use this one? Anyone else out there been through this?

What I thought to be diabetes complication turned out to be actos side effects. swelling,weight gain, urgent need to urinate, sweet craving, tired all the time, pain,pain,pain, and more pain all my muscles, my legs, the bones in my feet and ankles. I have been off the drug for less than the month and my sugars have improved and nearly all symptoms are gone or rapidly improving. I do believe this drug was killing me. I know for sure it made my quality of life suck while I was on it, I feel reborn since I stopped taking it.

This is fine, but I have the most excruciating leg, knee, joint pain and extraordinary weight gain.  I've tried to continue this regimine, but Actos makes it impossible for me to walk my dog, fit my wardrobe, and exist with the pain I feel.  Two two month usage trials left me unable to continue.  Had I known that it was the Actos which contributed to my pain I would have never tried it again.

Today he prescribed Actos for me however, I brought up the fact that Avandia was taken off of the market for causing heart problems and Avandia and Actos are made by the same company (I think). He advised me this was unrelated. Well, I purchased the drug and then read the insert. The insert gave one of the side effects as edema (swelling) and stated this drug could case CHF. Now, why the hell would I want to take a drug that can cause CHF??? I then stated doing some research and read the reviews on this site and more than half of them say the same thing.  You all cant be wrong therefore, I have decided to scrap this drug, even though I just spent $55.00, and go continue my insulin and exercise. I recently lost 22 pounds and dropped my A1C from 8.2 to 7.0 without this drug. I hate losing money but CHF and weight gain...  no I will just use he insulin and talk to my doctor about another medication. If he doesn't want to change it oh well, I will just change to another physician. You are the one who suffers. Take charge of your life and if your doctor doesn't listen drop him/her. Listen to your body. It is not lying to you.  Thanks for to all of you who took time to review this drug.

Found with insurance I'd pay $111.00 for 90 and every 90 days will move me $647.55 towards medicare's donut hole. Checked Universal drugstore com and the generic (pioglitazone) is less than $40 for 30 tablets and Actos 28 tabs is $62.50. Details inform pioglitazone should not be taken if you have certain heart or liver problems. I'll soon see my gastroentrologist for a liver dysfunction and will run it by him before giving it the Actos generic a try.

Went off medication then tried again after a month with the same results.  It is very expensive at $651 for 90 supply and with the side effects it is not worht it.  I also had some leg pain but the weight gain was the biggest problem and concern since I had by pass surgery also before starting the actos

Being legally blind in one eye I am very wary of anything that bothers the other eye.  Also I broke my leg over three years ago and have not had any trouble until after I had been on Actos about three months.  Now I have terrible pain, worse than the broken bone.  I quit Actos a week ago and the pain is much better but has not gone away completely.  No weight gain but since I am trying to lose weight and having no luck I am hoping that it will change with the drug out of my life.

Other	orchidlady, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female		11/9/2010 3:54:26 PM	For over 4 yrs. I have taken this drug. My A1C blood tests result in normal values.  I do not test my blood sugar because no doctor has ever told me I am a diabetic.  I do think a doctor said I was  pre-diabetic when I started this drug.  My last visit to the internist was 4/10 where the lab tests were normal.  I have told the doctor that I do not believe I have diabetes.  Maybe this last time I told him that he may have decided that was enough because he said he would see me in a year (4/11).  I do not have the s/s of diabetes except that I am overweight.  I try to watch my weight and take walks for exercise.

FInally my feet started swelling.  My original doctor said to use compression stockings!  I changed doctors and found a diabetic specialist who took me off of actos.  I am on two other medications that control my diabetes.  I lost 10 pounds in the first six weeks off of actos.  This stuff is toxic.  It gave me memory problems, tiredness among others.  Within one week off of this stuff, I felt so much better.  This drug should be banned and doctors who prescribe it should be versed in its side effects!

My blood sugar numbers are good, around 130. I don't have highs or lows, and my A1C is 6.1. I had been on other diabetes medicine before, and this one has been good for me.  I've had no side effects taking it these 8 years.

Does anybody have similar experience? 
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Wanda, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	8/4/2010 5:36:49 PM	I took this med several years back and had a problem with swelling in hands &amp; feet. My doctor at that time took me off of it.  I have since changed doctors- I was put back on it 2 weeks ago. Within a week my blood sugar had come down from high 200's to 160. The medicine works, however, I woke up one morning and had the worst headache of my life, I felt like I was in a daze, I could hear my heart pounding in my head and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. I was short of breath without doing anything. I  quit taking the med, it took me three days to feel normal again. I contacted my doctor &amp; told him what I experienced- he told me the medicine did not cause that. Well, if it didn't- what did? It went away when I stopped taking the med. I also reacted this same way when I was put on Avandia. I feel these meds are dangerous for me.

My A1C went from 7.1 to 6.0 and my triglycerides dropped over 100 points down to 192.  I have gained 10lbs but have not had any breathing problems.  THere has been the achiness but nothing like some of the reviews I have read.  After talking with my doctor, she said that I really don't want to take you off as I am showing the best numbers I've ever had.  She said try to add some more excerise in and see if that helps with the weight gain.  I've never been this &quot;healthy&quot; since being diagnosed so if I have to deal with the extra weight, I'll fight that battle too.

My ankles had swollen a couple of times but now they are swollen constantly and are painful (last couple of days).  I now have joint pain in my shoulders and have gained about 40 pounds.  I'm done with this drug.  Quit taking it last night.  This cure is worse than the disease.  I'll watch my blood sugar tests, watch diet closely, exercise and see how I do.  If I still need something, I'll talk to my doctor about Januvia or something else.  Actos did lower my A1C, but the side effects are not worth it.  I would not recommend this drug to anyone.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	dlecours, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	25-34	7/29/2010 8:28:12 PM	Just an update from my review two days ago.  I stopped taking the Actos about 2 1/2 days ago and I feel SOOO much better.  I am not having issues with my breathing, my muscles are not aching, my shoes don't feel as tight and I haven't been tired all day.  I know some people have had great results, but for me it wasn't worth it.  My A1C did go down a lot on the Actos, but my quality of life was terrible.  Actos may be getting more credit because I have changed my eating habits and also take Glipizide.  I feel like a new person the last two days.  I ran for 30 minutes today and didn't have to stop every 4 minutes because I felt like I was going to have a heart attack and couldn't catch my breath.  Now I just need to lose the 50 lbs I gained while I was on Actos for 19 months.  Funny how the Dr tells you that you need to lose weight to have a chance to get off all the meds, but yet they give you a pill that makes you gain weight.  I have also been checking my BG levels and they seem to be fine so far. If you are having any of the same problems I have had I would recommend you talk to your Dr.  Mine just blew me off and said I need to exercise and lose weight and I the &quot;problems&quot; I was telling him about would go away.  Funny not taking Actos for 2 and a half days and my &quot;problems&quot; seem to be going away.  I wish I could get my money back for the office visits, xrays, ct scan, blood tests, etc.  And it wasn't just my PA that didn't figure out the problem I saw the two &quot;big dog&quot; Drs and they both said lose weight and I probably had Chronic Fatigue.  I think it is only going to be a matter of time before the word gets out about what Actos really does to some of us.

As all of us Diabetics know we have to keep are weight down. I gained 35 lbs in  15  weeks. I also have RA and I was thinking my extra fatigue and swollen feet was due to RA. I am going to see my doctor next week to get off this medication. 
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	smcgee, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	45-54	7/28/2010 8:53:40 PM	I did gain 16 pounds and seem to be tired all the time. I know I'm always hungrey lately. It did bring down my number to 7.0 but I've been having some issues with my breathing. I will be seeing my doctor and ask her about these symptoms. I was on it once before and she took me off. I'll be working out in the gym again so I'll see how that goes.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	dlecours, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	25-34	7/27/2010 5:45:17 PM	After reading other reviews I am terrified.  I have been on Actos for about 14 months.  I have gained 50 lbs and am constantly tired and have muscle aches/pains all day long. It lowered my A1C for sure (well maybe just changing my diet did, but my Dr has given the credit to Actos).  I have been convinced that I have something major causing these problems.  Had Xrays CT Scans, etc.  Nothing.  I have had sinus and lung congestion problems even hacking up blood from time to time.  Now I am starting to have shortness of breath.  I have had a few instances of waking up feeling like I was sufficating because I couldn't breath.  I couldn't even complete the basic functions of my job.  I have tried to work out but can't go very long and have had little to no results for weight loss.  I was a scholarship athlete in College and have always been in good or decent shape at worst.  I never had a problem putting the work in at the gym but can't do it now.  I am going to stop taking the drug and see what happens I have no doubt this is the cause for more problems than the little help of a lower A1C.  I am up to 270+lbs.  I would rather go off it and die than keep living this way. I can barely play softball or play with my nephews let alone have the energy to put into a girlfriend or work.  This drug is evil and I think it is only a matter of time before the cat is out of the bag on how bad these side effects are.  I have never liked the sue happy mentality of people now a days, but I am furious with my Dr and can't believe this drug is around you get paid a lot of money to make me feel better not worse.  Of course it isn't about patients it is about money.  I wish I would have known this a year ago. Oh my Drs response to my description of my symptoms and telling him I feel like I am just surviving daily at this point was I probably have Chronic Fatigue and there is no way to test for that.  I wonder if he gets an all expenses paid vacation on the company that makes Actos?

Also my diet and exercise are important contributors to keeping me in check. My A1C has been in a normal range as well as my daliy testing.

Swollen ankles and legs, fingers, hands.  After reading numerous reviews I now realize what I have to do.  I'm going to my doctor and telling him I must be taken off the medication.  I'm also tired all of the time.  I've had this happen with other meds and when I mention it to the doctor I'm told that the medication doesn't do these things but I'm not a stupid person.  I have to learn to trust myself and do what I think is right for me.

I thought all of this was do to other things in my life. I've recently been going to a diabetic education class. The lady teaching it has sent a request to my doctor to change me to metforin.

Checked in with the primary doctor who was busy at the time and the nurse told me to purchase at drug store Prilosec and anti-gas which I did.  Did not help so I went to see another Doctor who called my primary care doctor (Secure Horizon Doctor) and they both told me to go to the emergency room.  Stayed in hospital for 5 days and they changed my medication and stopped my Actos.  Why?  They told me that my Kidneys were working only 35%.  What happened to me? Did Actos have anything to do with my kidney disfunction?

My blood sugar control was so good the Hg1ac tests were in the less than 7 range and the last one was 6.2.  I experienced none of the side effects listed, except fractures.  In the past 2 years I have broken an ankle, a knee and a hip.  Only after the knee was I aware that fractures were a possible side effect of Actos.  That was quite a blow to me, realizing that drug that was helping me so much was responsible for my, NOW, difficulties walking.

The stomach bloating, fatigue, severe unexplained edema of the feet, legs, hands and face has totally stopped and I fee great.  My sugars did go up a bit but not enough for me to ever use this again!  I can't tolerate the weight gain, pain, fatigue and swelling.  Can't believe this is allowed to still be given to people and my doctors didn't seem to aware of the side effects which is disturbing or they didn't care.  Kept attributing my swelling to sodium, my pain to my statin drug and my weight gain to my eating.  My diet hasn't changed or my exercise level and since stopping this I have lost significant weight and all other symptoms disappeared.  I have lost faith in my doctors.  Do your own homework and keep speaking up - you know your own body and feelings.  This has negatively impacted the quality of my life.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	wlfree, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	65-74	1/11/2010 8:00:44 PM	At age 70 Dr diagnosed me as &quot;pre-diabetic.&quot; He prescribed actos 45 mg once daily. Almost immediately afterward my vision was severely affected and began experiencing terrible fatigue symptoms, especially in legs.  After nearly passing out with low blood sugar symptoms, which my wife recognized because her mother was diabetic, she took me home and fed me candy bar which restored my normal feeling almost immediately.  After reporting this to DR, he took me off any med for this condition.  For next year a1c has been 6.2 without any meds for diabetes.  My recomendation: watch out.

After 3 years of chest pains, weight gain, severe leg pain, stomach cramps, I finally gave up on all the oral medications and went on Insulin.  While it can be inconvenient to inject every day I feel better than I have since my diagnosis in 2003.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	asevert@bgsu.edu, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	12/29/2009 12:01:03 AM	Ok so i have been on actos since august i believe. since being on actos i have been completely unmotivated and depressed so my doctors answer was to put me on depression medications, none of which worked and had horrible withdraw symptoms. i have also gained at least 40 pounds and continue to gain and my blood sugar levels seem to not be affected. i also have noticed swelling in my hands and can not wear my ring from my grandma any longer, it doesnt fit on any finger. i have not noticed the swelling in my feet and ankles as much though. one problem that i do have is that i get horrible migraines and nausea along with lightheartedness and dizziness which put me in the hospital but the doctor on call that night did not seem to think it was a big deal and sent me home even though my blood sugar and blood pressure was high. i also have hair loss and sometimes my heart beats so fast and i can not even exercise anymore because i get so out of breath. i am considering going off this medication because i believe that it caused the depression and the migraines. i do not think this is a healthy medication. i tried metformin and that was also a horrible experience, i will give one more try with byetta and then i am switching doctors and going to try natural methods. has anyone else had any of these side effects or any advice?
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	BARBIE357, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	12/24/2009 5:26:03 PM	After the A1C test that includes holiday seasons, a 'nurse practitioner' who was 'acting DR'? pushed this pill on me (drug rep gave her boxes of samples) at first i became nervous and oddly agitated; i went back to see her - she told me 'that was a psych issue - go see a psych md' so i did; and she also passed the buck back to nurse prescribing it. so, i stayed on it and gained weight and stayed nervous and odd feeling for over six month; by the hot part of July in Kansas i found my feet swollen one night at bed time and was shocked by what i saw. was admitted to ER that night for edema four days and night of IV lasix i was able to go home. discontinued ACTOS! it was unsafe from the first pill! Also; now I have permanent edema- swelling in ankles; any time i try to get off another med I have been given; the edema kicks in and makes it hard to stop using that drug. After taking Lasix for several years- after that ER/hospital visit i stopped lasix and the swelling in my legs went down!! so lasix does not fix what ACTOS damaged! I DO NOT recommend using this medication for any reason. it will damage your body. I was not monitored by a proper doctor, but that seems secondary to what the actual drug did to me. No DR is going to know or advise what those of us who have experienced it can tell you. reading the similarities in stories will convince you of probable outcomes, for most using it. those who do use it, and can't say much- may be too sick to know the difference.find another way to lower your blood sugar- and A1C tests that include Thanksgiving and Christmas and are taken after that period of time lead doctors to over react and give out this kind of big pharma junk. read up on these things; your own life depends on it.

Then he switched me to Actos, which causes diareah and gas.  On both medicines, he prescribed dicyclomine for these symtoms.  I refuse to take this anymore because it makes me nervous and crabby.  I have no clue what to do.

Went to my doctor who prescribed 15mg Actos, daily. After 60 days of use,150 minutes per week minimum, of running,and low card/sugar diet, my level went to 109. Side effect was a progressive calve muscle pain and lock-up when running for more than 5 minutes. Now after 6 weeks of non-use, I can run my full 30 minutes plus 10 minutes of warm-up and 5 minutes of cool down with no pain or effects. Scheduled for my next blood glucose test this week and am sure it be acceptable with my 5 plus day per week exercise commitment and diet control with supplements. I feel great and am not worried about reported side effects to liver and kidney funxction.Will re-post with results after my next blood test.

Yesterday went to the E.R. and Dr. suspended taking Actos. It caused a severe sinus problem 25 lb weight gain in 2 months.He also suspened 100mg of januvia. Blood tests showed that my liver and kidney functions was out of wack. So he suspened the Metformin for a week. He prescribed Glucotrol XL 10mg X2 a day. I use to take this and with 500mg metformin and felt great. I dont recommend Actos since it causes massive weight gain. I also believe that Januvia had a hand in it as well. Check this out: Daye before yesterday I took 1000 mg Metformin, 45 mg Actos and morning BS was 121. Last night I took 10mg Glucotrol XL and morning sugars was 150. I really believe with more exercise and diet control I can stay off the Metformin and get by on the 10mg of Glucotrol XL X 2 a day.Your thoughs anyone? danielfblades@yahoo.com

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	 Female  (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		11/21/2009 7:42:01 PM	Even though my mother (75 yrs old) told her doctor she was experiencing side effects from the Actos (weight gain, swollen ankles, feeling like she was experiencing angina), he assured her that he was &quot;a good doctor&quot; and she needed to &quot;trust him&quot; and continue the medication in conjunction with Insulin and other diabetic and high blood pressure medication she was already taking. Even though he had told her that her heart was fine, she had a heart attack within a week of taking the drug and died. He should have paid more attention to her. A week after she died, we received a brochure in the mail warning of conjunctive heart failure as a side effect of Actos. Yes, I'm bitter. PLEASE reconsider before taking this drug!!!

I too have had a lot of the same symptoms as others. Lets start with the night sweats,ridiculous! Aches and pains? Ohh yeah! Lethargy uh huh. I stand all day as a hair colorist and have found this drug not helpful at all. A definite energy sucker. The doc put me on this because I noticed a meter reading of 18 only once. When i did a yearly checkup at the hospital, the doctor seemed mad that I was put on this. Can you just stop taking this drug without problems?? I also have had problems with extreme sweating after taking with my breakfast. I am a male 5'10&quot; 184 lbs. Fairly active. What gives?

My A1C was 8.0. I started taking 30 mg of Actos midday for 6 weeks now. My A1C dropped to 7.0 which is great. I have been exercising 30-60 minutes(walking 60, bike 30-45) 3-4 times/week. No weight gain, no swelling/water retention, no muscle soreness to date. I am trying to lose 30 pounds over the next year. I routinely take 800 mg vitamin E each morning and afternoon to prevent fatigue during the day and early evening. An amazing side effect of the vitamin E is a very healthy and active sex drive - my wife likes this aspect. I manage my diabetes with a slick Excel workbook I created that documents all aspects of my health.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	9/11/2009 12:23:05 PM	My father started Actos the 2nd week of July. Only 3 weeks after initiating this medication he died of a heart attack. He was 58 years old and had no previous history of heart failure in his medical record. After thinking about our phone conversations he had complained of his feet bothering him and thought it was his gout flaring. He was inreasingly tired but then didn't seek medical attention and blamed all the symptoms on previous problems. If you start this medication, please pay attention to possible side effects and see your doctor immediately if any occur. I truly believe this is a dangerous medication.

Which after a while not only affects your self-esteem but also makes it harder to control your glucose level. I am also feeling some of the other side effects of the medication. I would like to stop taking it but my doctor says it is working.

Most recently I've become so fatigued I can't get off the couch. a few weeks ago I started having a mild nagging cough with pressure in back and lungs. it's lasted to long to just be a cold.I have gained an additional 35lbs.on top of the 50lbs. overweight that I was since I started the drug 5 years ago, I thought it was from the menopause I'm going through also.

Many Type II Diabetics have a weight problem.  Actos causes major weight gain and swelling.  I was on it for several years and gained a lot of weight.  I can attribute 40 plus pounds to Actos and no other reason.  I finally had lap band surgery and my doctor allowed me to stop taking Actos and only take Metformin.  I've lost over 80 pounds now.  The Actos was effective in lowering blood sugar, but the cost was too high.  My husband is a more severe diabetic than I am and also gained a large amount of weight on Actos.  He begged his doctor to take him off Actos.  In exchange he now has to take 2 more shots per day of another medication, in addition to his 6 insulin shots, but he has stopped gaining weight, so he's happier.

I am now taking 45 mg Actos, 2000 mg Metformin and only 1.25 mg Glyburide (at night).  The transition was somewhat difficult, but it has worked.  I gained 11 lbs and have now lost 4.  My A1c went from 6.0 to 5.4.  I'm very pleased and will be even happier when I lose another 15 lbs.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	6/17/2009 12:48:58 PM	This medication has helped in controlling my blood sugar level (along with lantus).  However, I experienced a 12 lb. weight gain within the first 10 days of being on it.  I was following the Weight Watchers plan at this same time and had been losing weight. I also experience lots of swelling in my ankles which is very uncomfortable and not very attractive. I think I will ask my doctor if we can try decreasing the dosage or maybe try something different.

The dizziness is gone also.  I saw my doc yesturday and she refuses to beleive it could have been the Actos.  I am convinced on the other hand that it was.  One bad thing is my apptite has returned and I have gained 1/2 a pound back.  It was helping me to lose weight so I am gonna try a lower dose instead of 45 I'm gonna take half of that and see how I do.  I have a ecko for my heart scheduled soon to see if it has damaged my heart any.  I didn't have any swelling at all anywhere or weight gain but the feet dumbness and cramping was terrible if that starts back I'm through with this drug period.  Please be careful.  You know your body better than anyone.  I may even go to a even lower dosage like 15 and see what happens.  45 was just too much for me.

I feel alittle better already.  The feet sensation is still going on but not as bad.  Mt BS tonight was 112.  So far so good.  I may have to have heart surgery because of this medication.  Anyone experiencing swelling and if you have ANY heart condition such as mine,  a heart murmur which could barely be heard and no meds for it now since the Actos may need surgery.  Be careful.  My Doc is a FNP and doesn't know I've stopped it but after stopping the Actos if things don't improve back to normal then I'll know it wasn't the Actos.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	ladyck3, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	5/28/2009 12:11:53 AM	I was on Avandia for a few years when the warnings came out about heart issues so I stopped taking it cold turkey (was on Glyburide and Metformin as well). Because I swore off Avandia, I was put on Januvia and Metformin, no Glyburide (which worked so well, I was in the 200 range and immediately it knocked me down 100 points) .  Well After 3 months the Januvia did not return the results like she would have hoped (is it A1c?  was at 7.9) So she switched me to Actos, Glyburide and metformin.  3 months later brings us to 3 weeks ago... my checkup brought my A1C down to 7.6 she was not happy and she always asks, do I experience swelling and I said yes my feet, calves and ANKLES especially... so tight at the end of the day they are twice the size.... she did not say anything about the Actos being the issue or possible issue.   Now we come to the last 7.6 reading.. she calls with the results and says... well we need it a bit lower so I am going to up you from 30mg to 45mg.. I hate to do this because you are already experiencing swelling.I thought WHAT?????   She wants me to pick up some samples of the 15MG tablets and take with my 30 to see how I handle it. I kept thinking about it.. my swelling was gone in the morning or pretty near gone but as the day went on it was not a matter of &quot;IF&quot; I would swell it was a matter of WHEN/HOW EARLY.  I work at a computer and don't get up much because I'm just too darn busy to do so... but after 8 hrs my time is mine..  I kept thinking about this and decided to cold turkey this actos... I had gained 8# which had dropped off immediately and after a couple of days my ankles were almost back to normal.. 2 weeks later my ankles are small once again (small hands and ankles are my only small anything) I wrote her she suggested other meds which sound HORRIBLE in reviews Prandin, Precos and Starlix?  I'm going to opt back to Januvia and see what happens, change diet, and cross my fingers.  Thanks EVERYONE for your feedback, INVALUABLE!!

My doctor added Actos 45 for better control.  I have been taking the Actos now for a few month's maybe 3 or 4.  Since then I have lost 10 pounds not much nausea just no appetite.  The worst is now for the past month I have had leg problems feelings like if you apply Icy/Hot to a area.  My feet sweat and feel tingly tis never happened before the Actos.  I also have a heart Murmur that has got worse since the Actos.  I am stopping it myself.  I know how I feel and the feet feelings outway the control of my BS.  The foot feelings are horrible a sensation that is driving me crazy.  Walking also has been difficult because of foot cramps.  It has controled my sugars and losing 10 pounds has been a plus but this foot thing is too weird of a feeling for e.

Someone said it would take month to work, but don't think it did the first time, maybe some one will tell me if this is true. Now my BS runs from 140 to 250, so Actos kicks in some?

He is always tired and is always hungry and can't lose weight. He did the first month but he has gained it all back and plus a few more. He comes home from work and is more tired than usual. We do things with our children and after a few hours he has to lie down. He is active and his numbers aren't the best but better than before Actos. He eats a well balanced full meals and should not be so hungry and he HAS to eat or he gets very moody.

Gained about 40lbs in that time.  Have had some dizzy spells and heart palpitations as well I feel the Actos was partly to blame for all of those symptoms and in the end was not very effective at helping me manage my blood sugar.  Was also taking 1000mg Metformin twice a day.  My Dr. had switched me to Januvia and Glyburide in place of the Actos and will continue the Metformin.  We shall see how this goes.

Then I learned of the press release warning about increases in hand and foot fractures in women. I cannot begin to tell you the discomfort of having to be in a cast and on crutches for 7 weeks and now physical therapy to relearn how to walk!  THIS MEDICATION SHOULD BE RECALLED!!!!!

On day 6 the headaches left me bedridden and my eyes began to blur. My Dr. took me off this drug as well as my metformin. Since then my headaches have decreased dramatically but my vision still blurs at times.

I gained 30 pounds in 5 months and kept getting shorter and shorter of breath.  I changed Doctors and was taken off the Actos and my metformin increased from 500 MG twice daily to 850 mg.  The first night I took the 850 mg of metformin only the swelling had decreased by 75 percent.  I have been on the metformin only for four days and already the shortness of breath has decreased.  The swelling is almost completely gone.

Neither of these drugs was effective in lowering my blood sugar, so I stopped taking them six months ago. Since then I have been sleeping well throughout the night for 7 or 8 hours usually without any recollection of dreaming and no nightmares.Last night I took my first dose of Actos and suffered the same terrifying and very vivid nightmares about drowning. I awoke half a dozen times huffing and puffing, all out of breath and was unable to sleep past 3 am.  I've had enough.

I am not saying everybody could gain weight, I am a person who looks at food and gains weight.

The recommended drug of choice to treat that disorer (Glucophage/Metformin) had so many dangerous side effects for me that I couldn't take a full dose of it.  In the end, the doctor found it wasn't even helping lower my insulin levels and my cholesterol and triglycerides were high.  My endocrinologist took a more creative approach and tried this medication.  After three months, she had my labs rechecked and I was sure it wasn't working because I had no side effects.  Labs showed my cholesterol had dropped 20 points, triglycerides had come down significantly and my insulin levels had been cut in half.  My last round of labs in September showed my insulin level was 5.1 and cholesterol was 166.  This past May I dove into a healthy weight loss plan and managed to drop over 25 lbs.  (Lowered my calorie intake, added more fruits and veggies, started exercising an hour a day.) While I've got a lot more weight to lose, I've been able to maintain the weightloss pretty easily.  Since I've lost the weight, I've found my energy level has increased significantly.  The only side effect I have is very mild water retention (probably a couple of pounds max).  While their are significant side effects for some people, there are people (like me)out there who are glad this drug is on the market.  I couldn't ask for better results.

Glucose control was fair, but the side effect of weight gain made control of diabetes more difficult.  Now I'm hearing about other side effects that may surface.  The benefit of taking this drug are not worth the worry about what problems it may cause later.

My feet and ankles were so swollen I couldn't wear shoes or sandals, I hurt so bad. The end of Sept. I began having trouble breathing. Within 2 weeks I was gasping for air just sitting in a chair. I ended up in the hospital for a week the beginning of Oct. After numerous tests for CHF I was diagnosed with Paricardial Effussion (fluid in the sack surrounding my heart) inhibiting the hearts ability to function which could have killed me if I hadn't finally by passed my Dr. and went to the E.R. If you are on Actos, do your research. Keep after your Dr. if you experience swelling, shortness of breath, painful muscles and joints, and weight gain. I gained 43 lbs. in 10 months. I discontinued Actos on Oct. 5 and have lost 17 lbs. by doing nothing different except stopping the Actos. I had a repeat Echocardiogram a few days ago and the fluid around my heart is gone. This is serious folks. Be your best research person and read up on drugs you are prescribed. I will definitely be more cautious from now on.Deb

My ankles were constantly swollen and the muscles in my leg never stopped aching and cramping; I could hardly walk.  My doctor had a different diagnosis for every one of my complaints, from being told I had developed osteoarthritis to obesity (I weighed 153 lbs. at the time).  He NEVER told me that weight gain, swollen ankles and sore leg muscles were all side effects of Actos, the prescription he had me taking for the last four years to treat my diabetes.  When I started having severe chest pains and difficulty breathing, the cardiologist told me to discuss changing meds with my doctor.  I'm now on Glucophage and I'm losing weight and feeling GREAT, and no more chest pains or swollen ankles :-)  Before taking Actos, carefully study the side effects, and if you develop any of them, make sure you tell your doctor that you'd like something other than Actos.  I think changing prescriptions helped save my life!

Legs swelled up, figured it was just from the Diabetes.  Then started to have missing heartbeats, after a sonogram of the heart, was told it was from congestive heart failure...a Aorta was enlarged.  About three months ago, a PA told me that was bad stuff and to quite taking it.  Had a sonogram of the heart valves again this last week and that &quot;Enlarged&quot;, ppear to have become &quot;Normal&quot;, heartbeat is now also steady and not erratic since quitting the drug.Would not recommend taking this drug in any form...

Severe joint &amp; abdominal pain, swelling and bloated.  A poor replacement for glucophage and metformin (which gave me debilitating diahrrea and kept me in a stupor).  None of them were successful in lowering my blood sugar readings.  Am now on Januvia and am WELL pleased and my readings are now consistently within normal ranges.

I was asked did I care if I gained weight or did I mind a yuck stomach WELL great let me see where to I sign up for this great deal...THEY WILL TRY TO SELL YOU ON THE OLDER AND CHEAPER DRUG BEFORE THE UNVAIL JANUVIA.

I am considering having to stop taking this med which has been very helpful. I have stopped taking it for a week now to see if I can survive safely without it. I just cannot afford that much money for 1 drug. Why can't a generic be made for it so it can be more affordable to those of us who need it?

My Blood Glucose Levels are now where they should be with the Actos and I feel much better.  However, I just found out that I am a bit anemic, a common side effect of Actos.  However, I remain on a strict diet, try to exercise (walk) 30min each day,reduce/eliminate Salt from my diet and take B12 daily. I hope to be able to continue the Actos as I reduce my weight and hopefully my need for any medications at all for my Type 2 Diabetes.

I've lost about six pounds but I don't have much energy and I feel as though I am experiencing morning sickness all day, especially in the evening. And I'm way too old to be pregnant. I also have many bouts of loose stools that leaves an embarassing trail if I sneeze or cough hard.  I never had anything like that before I started Actos.  My glucose levels are finally in the acceptable range after several years. Of course, being nauseated keeps me from any sweet cravings, too. Overall, I don't feel as well as I used to even when my blood sugar level was in the 200 plus range. And I found out the hard way that alcohol is definitely a no-no.  Eyes swelled up for days after one drink.

After little over a year on it, i asked doctor if we could try metformin ER as regular metformin had caused stomach and loose bowels.  The metformin worked without problems, but the swelling did not leave my left leg.  After several weeks of checkups and doctor visits, i was told to go to radiology at the hospital.  There it was discovered i had DVT and was immediately admitted for treatment.  Placed on Heparin and then on coumadin i was sent home after 5 days.  Still have swelling in left leg.  Never did have any pain from this condition.  I wonder if actos contributed to blood clot forming as we cannot determine the cause for this as i'm very active and had no history of this problem.

I was concerned about the cardiac risk with Avandia which I was taking before so my doc switched me to Actos.  I am also taking metformin and was taking a sulfonylurea which he also stopped.  This was puzzling to me but I will see what happens.  So far my blood sugars seem ok but it has only been a day or so.  I am closely monitoring.  My A1C was 6.1 on the 3med (metformin, avandia, glyburide) regimen so we shall see what happens with this 2 med regimen.

My doctor put me on this medication because my sugar levels jumped to 200 after meals.  I also take glipizide. I'm going to stop taking Actos for a couple of months and see if my problems disappear.  If they do, then I'll stop taking the medicine completely.  I'm tired of the mucles aches that cause me to be too tired to do any of the activities I enjoy doing.

I stopped taking it this morning and am able to speak today.The sore throat is clearing and pain going away.

I'm a marathon runner so I'm quite active.  However, Actos surely made me gain weight and my thighs just gotten bigger and for awhile I didn't know why.  I run about 25-30 miles per week and when the training got intensed, I run 20-22 miles just on Saturdays.  My hands and feet get swolen and I had problems breathing.  Gonna take myself off Actos for now.  I'm training for another marathon in June and cannot risk being heavy with breathing problems.

I have defintely gained weight already and started having diffuse pain in my thighs. So I called an on-call Doc and he said to stop it and talk to my regular doctor. I did, and after a week, my pants started falling off me...seriously...and the thigh pain went away (it had been feeling like I had been doing heavy weights/leg extensions in the gym). So, then my regular doc finally go ahold of me and said to start it this weekend again, and if I started having problems, he'd switch me back to Avandia. Well, in just 2 days I can already feel a little pain in my thighs and I feel like my pep is being zapped. I'll call him tomorrow and switch back and take my chances with Avandia, which I had no problems with in the first place.

Is that something I have to talk to my doctor about? I have type II diabetes and was hospitalized after I have acquired a series of TIA's. I have suffered from paralysis of the left side of my body. Right now I am still taking Actos with Januvia and Prandin for my maintenance medication. Please advise. Thanks
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus		3	4	1			1/29/2008 8:27:03 AM	I experienced swelling of ankles and hands  for quite a time, then found it was due partly to the high dosage recommended by my doctor. When the dosage was cut in half,  this improved markedly, and had very little effect on later glucose readings.Suggestion: check with your doctor, see if a reduced dosage helps .

Even if you doctor says it is safe DO NOT TAKE IT during pregnancy.  My son has serious health conditions now linked to this medication that I was taking while pregnant.

I had been able to control my glucose level for nearly 6 years with diet and exercise before my levels increased. Actos gives me a range of readings from 94 to 140. I am eating less and exercising more than ever to NO avail. Additionally, I have had about a dozen days of low blood sugar.  I would gladly go to something else if there is something better. I have given Actos a fair trial and am very disappointed.Does the maker NOT understand Type 2 diabetes at ALL? Weight gain as a side effect is ludicrous!   Dr. Walter Yingling

There has not been any side effects unlike the Metaformin. I don't run to the bathroom anymore and don't feel like my heart is racing anymore, as i did with Metaformin (it was a reation). I also take glyburide with this and this combonation is working for me. Note, I don't drink and or smoke. I try to get as much exercise as possible by walking and by bicycle. Hope this helps someone.

I had some difficulties at first with gastrointestinal distress but after several months I was able to figure out how to manage by eating the right things.
