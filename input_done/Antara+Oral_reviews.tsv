After taking for about a year with no major issues, I had to go into the hospital due to serious pain in my stomach.  I always had a bad back so I never attributed my back pain to antara.  After a year of taking this medicine it built up a sludge that shut down the pancreas.  Two reason it's important to know this; One, this major side effect does not occur until prolonged use and many people may think they can tolerate the medication well.Two, the symptoms, back pain, acid reflux and stomach pain are so general that they are often ignored before full blown pancreatitis. FYI - pancreatitis is one of the most painful things that can happen to you.

Can't get the blood test 'til next month. They cover my $10/month co-pay. The Pharmacist gave me their information. It's covered for a year. The only problem I've had is some weird (like hot flashes) from it. I can tolerate it though.

Antara has not caused muscle pain or muscle weakness after one month of use.  Won't know if it's effective in reducing LDL cholesterol until next blood test in another month, but I'll add that info at that time.
