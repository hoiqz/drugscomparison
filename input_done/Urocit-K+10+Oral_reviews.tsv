Uric Acid Kidney Stones	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	4/3/2012 1:09:27 PM	After taking this medication for 5 days I noticed that my arm was very weal and my two fingers on the same side went numb and were tingling.Also had diarrhea and pills were in stool like stated .After the weekend I made an appointment with my primary doctor only to refer me to a neurologist.I came home and was ready all the side affects and came across Tell your doctor immediately if any of these rare side affects happen.All that i stated also my same hand was very cold and could not get warm.I was so freaked out that i stop taking them and wanted to vomit my last pill out because i was so scared.My advise is to read the side affects .Now i'm out 150.00 for two months worth and i only took 5 pills.
Calcium Oxalate Kidney Stones	russettroberts, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	2	Male	65-74	2/29/2012 4:50:25 PM	I have had 7 or 8 kidney stone operations over the years and my urologist says that this medication will greatly decrease the chances of having several types of stones.Unfortunately, these tablets are very difficult to swallow,  They are large and  coarse textured and begin to dissolve immediately. I take 4/day and it easier to swallow my other 8 pills at once than one of these.  Cant they coat them!!

Now I don't take it  and  Now I changed my diet and drink Lots of water. seems to work.......

Calcium Oxalate Kidney Stones	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	35-44	12/30/2008 12:57:21 PM	I take it with meals to avoid the upset stomach that it sometimes causes. I use cold juice to help it go down.When I take it regularly, it seems to decrease the frequency of kidney stones (with the drug: one stone every ~10 yrs; without the drug: one stone every ~5 yrs).
