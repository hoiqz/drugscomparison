The doctors have tried taking me off and it just ended me up with a 3 night and day stay at the hospital. Now I'm stuck on this medicine till death, my body can't function without it. I don't like having to wake every single morning and start putting pills down my throat. For everyone who reads this I understand we all need alittle help with our problems but in the long run is it really worth it.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Jeanette D, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female		7/26/2012 11:49:34 AM	Being a caregiver for my 84 year old husband is stressful because I now have to do everything he used to do. I get to bed and I start the whole role of things I should do, can't do, want to do, care of the car, bills, home maintenance, doctor visits, making decisions as POA and everything else in the course of activities of daily living. I don't think my doctor is very understanding of what I am going through, but this medication has been a wonderful way to deal with my stress.  It seems he always makes me feel like I might become addicted to it, and he doesn't like to give me pain medication for my chronic back pain....so....overall, this medication is like a miracle for me.  If I can sleep at night, I can care for my husband, and, more importantly, take care of myself!

I'm on .5mg and that worked the first couple of weeks. Not it's not helping with the sleep like it had been.

Anxious	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/4/2012 3:38:15 PM	Have always been a little anxious with mild panic attacks rarely.  Doctors tried giving me anti-depressants, which I did not think I needed.  I thought their side effects were not tolerable.  Bottom line is that my doctor gave me 1mg XR that I take daily.  I also have a prescription of 2mg XR that I take infrequently, only when I know it's going to be a long stressful day.  Both work amazing and I feel like I have my normal life back.  A life changer for me.  Slightly worried about addictive traits but I know I can handle and it will not be a problem.  I look at it the same way I take my blood pressure medicine, I need it and it works.

I was given a dose of .5mg, but that is too much for me! While it definitely relieves anxiety, it also relieves any desire to do anything more than sit around alone.  I can't function well enough to work as my job requires constant interaction with people. I started taking half (.25mg) and have had much, much better results.  The anxiety goes away leaving me in a functional, better place.

I know a lot of folks do not think it really helps and think you should not be taking it this long but it along with a doctors permission I find it really very helpful.

Xanax worked excellent and also decreased my depression at the same time. I was cool as a cucumber and became the &quot; life of the Party&quot; while on xanax. It also lowerted my inhibitions to a dangerous level. Unfortunately, I became addicted and my doctor took me off this med. Your body becomes immune to this drug very quickly. It is not meant to take every day!!After 2 weeks, I was taking almost 5 mg a day to get he same effect I was getting from 1 mg 2 weeks prior.  Xanax is a good drug, but a very dangerous one. It is Very addictive.

It works to keep the anxiety at bay, but once it wears off I'm irritable and depressed. I take more than prescribed 0.5mg up to 3x daily, by usually take double that amount. I can go 2-3 weeks without it, but I'm not a pleasant person. I suffer from anxiety and depression and I think the Xanax makes me more irritable and depressed when it wears off which is rather quickly (3 hours) IMO. I would advise against this drug, especially if you have an addictive personality (and I don't when it comes to drugs..just food and shopping!).

My primary doc. doen't know enough abouth the medication to prescribe it or even have an intellegent conversation about it. I did offer to buy him a medical book. I am worried about the addicting effects of this medicine, however my pain doctor explained to me that yes is it addicting and if you want to even cut dow it must be done very slowly. Don't beat youself up for requjiring to take a habit forming medication. This doed not make you a drug addict. Would you call a diabetic who requires insilin an addict to insilin. As long as you are under a doctor (who is qualified with this type of medication as it is a serious drug) do NOT beat yourself up of listen to other peoples experiences. As long as you are not abusing the drug and you know if you are or not, there are enough people to beat you up and call you an addict especially if you won't give them any of yours. Be kind to youself and you may even start taking less.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	gigi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/3/2012 12:58:37 AM	I was prescribed xanax in my 20's when I suffered from severe panic attacks. It helped like nothing else. I broke my .5 mg pills in half and only took one as I needed it. Most days, just having them with me was enough to calm me. At some point, I just stopped using them altogether. That was years ago. Now I'm in my 40s and I suffer from chronic tension headaches. I already know xanax helps me relax and does not cause me any bad side effects so I want to try it for my headaches. My doctors (through Keiser) refuse to prescribe it to me because they &quot;fear addiction&quot;. This is so insulting to me, especially since they monitor refills. Wouldn't they KNOW if addiction was becoming a problem? I just want my headaches to stop and no medicine they are giving me is working. It's frustrating to know what works for me - and is LEGAL - and yet not be able to get it. I need a new doctor who respects me.

Anxious	worrywart, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	4/26/2012 12:01:40 PM	Started taking this med because i was going thru a divorce and custody battle and was extremely upset all the time and waking up during the night with anxiety. I was afraid to take it because didn't want any side effects from it so put off taking it. Then one day was very upset so I decided I had to try something. I was prescribed 0.25mg. the first time i split that in half and it did nothing so the next day I took a whole one and it took the edge off with no side effects except for some yawning and a little bit sleepy but not bad. Only took one (.025mgs)during the day  even though it says may be used up to 3xs a day but one took the edge off. As far as needing more I dont take it everyday . My doctors said I can take two .025mg tabs at once making it a total of 0.5mg to help more when i need it--which is still only half a One mg tab. This seems to help alot when i do need it without making me feel loopy or foggy a little sleepy but its not like i have to go lay down to sleep (i only take during the day when needed)I do notice however that the next morning i feel a little nauseous if i took it the day before. Try it and see if it works for you if it doesn't try something else .Use it in moderation and only when needed to reduce the need for dependency. Good luck

It helps with panic attacks.  The only side effect is a little tiredness.  That keeps you from taking to much or abusing it.  I have had a lot of trauma in my life the last year &amp; this drug has saved my life.

The first time when i woke up the bottle was empty, 120 of .25mg. I went to the emergency room, accidental overdose. Then a month later, again i remember the first one. I had blacked out, i had poured the bottle into a bowl and was eating them with soup. My daughter called the ambulance, because she couldnt get me to cooperate. I was yelling in the e.r., they admitted me I kept trying to leave, pulling out my i.v., i wasnt mean i was told. This was on a tues. when i came out of it it was sat. and i remember nothing.

The doctor prescribed that I take 3 a day, but to function, I only take 3 a week, mainly to sleep. As long as you keep it in your system, it will work to the best of its capability. My doctor did inform me that if I was to come completely off the medication, I would feel like a heroine addict during withdrawals. It causes my mind to relax and I am not thinking 100 miles a minute. I am currently diagnosed with OCD and GAD.

Has stopped the attacks and 1 mg 3x day is the dosage I got to with the help of a psychiatrist. Anything less doesn't work.  GPs don't seem to understand Panic Disorder, so see a psychiatrist who specializes in it.  One interesting note is that the generic does not work for me.  I also tried various group therapy etc, deep breathing, alternate nostril breathing, distraction - but it didn't work. Was having 3 attacks a day and couldn't drive.  Xanax is a life saver for me.

My Dr put me on Xanax for panic attacks. I am VERY affraid of storms &amp; live in Florida, I also have very bad anxiety. I was so worried to even take the pill because I thought it would make me feel funny because of every time I heard of Xanax it was for peoples use other than anxiety. I finally took one of my pills the other day when I had an attack after reading these reviews &amp; I felt so much better! I'm glad I did cause I now know if I get real worried or anxious I have something to help that will work! Thank you everyone for your awsome reviews!

My GP prescribed this med for me  @ .25 prn. It worked great, then I began having medical issues from extreme anxiety so he doubled the dosage. That was 25 years ago. If I knew then what I do now I would have used much different methods for this drug can be very addicting even if you have never abused meds. The longer you are on it the larger the dosage is needed. Before I began tapering off I was on 6 mg. daily!!! For short term use I think this is an excellent med though I caution anyone that is just now beginning this. Great for short term anxiety though being a healthcare professional I am thankful my 25 years on this med is now in the past.

I became addicted and learned of the extreme difficulty of getting off of this drug. A caution against using Xanax over a long period of time or increasing your dosage. I am now clean 3 years but it required rehab and daily NA and AA meetings to get me here.

Doctor prescribed Xanax in combination with Zoloft with therapy and regular check-ups with my psychiatrist. I am now able to do everything that I was able to do prior to being diagnosed. The only problem is that Xanax is HIGHLY addictive and my dosage has increased since I started taking it. I finally asked my doctor to stop increasing dosage. I had to learn a healthy way to deal with my anxiety without a &quot;magic pill&quot; . Since learning techniques from therapy, I have decreased my dosage and am doing well.

It helps for my anxiety and panic attacks.  I haven't had a panic attack in a few months but my anxiety bothers me on a daily basis.  I have the hardest time deciding when I can take it though because it just puts me to sleep.  If I have to take it at work I get painfully tired and can barely keep up with what I need to do.  I have insomnia and it will help calm me down at night enough to sleep but if I know there are things that I need to do that I need to be alert for I am hesitant to take it.  I just wish there was something that would help without putting me to sleep.  The only thing I can do is make sure I have enough caffeine to keep me awake but I go through withdrawals if I don't keep up with the caffeine.  It is a vicious cycle and it isn't helping my anxiety.  I lost my insurance so I can't go back to the doctor to get a new med for my anxiety so I just have to stick with this method until I can figure something else out.  Side effects suck!

It's the ONLY med. that works for me. Have not been addicted to it. I take it if/when I need it, and don't HAVE to have it if I don't need it. No side effects at all! Does not make me &quot;out of it&quot; or sleepy, and can fully function normally.I'm on .5mg, and can split into if I don't need the full strength. I also suffer from OCD, and it seems to help with that. I've tried other antidepressants, but have side effects with my vision &amp; hearing when I take them. So I just stick with my reliable Xanax (the generic)! It's been a wonder drug and a life saver for me!

At firt my anxiety was not that bad. (The dr.s believed I developed the anxiety after a spinal tab went wrong and I was in the hosp.for 10 days and needed surgery.) At first it was .05 mg 3 x a day, than up to 1  mg 3x a day and that seemed to work and work well for me. Then once I STOPPED on my own and I called my Dr. who at that point I was off the xanax for 5 full days and did not have any side effects. He was not happy that I stopped on my own but understood. 4 full months go by and I seemed fine until One afternoon and I had to stop at the market and while shopping I had a sereve Anxiety attack. I had to leave my shopping cart and leave. I HAD to get out of there asap. So I went back to my dr. and told him. When my ANXIETY came back,it came back worse than before. I now I'am on xanax 2 mg 3x a day as needed but I only take as needed and my Dr. know's this. My Dr. this time wrote for 2 mg 3 x a day for a total of 90 pills a month. Plus he wrote for a refill of up to 4 times within the next 6 month's which I did not even know this medication could be a refill. I thought you had to see a Dr. every time you needed a script. I Do like this medication, it does help but sometime's it makes me tired.

I tried Valium first but it gave me severe hangovers. Xanax is an absolute wonder drug. I have tried several anti-depressants, but I can't take them due to adverse reactions. Xanax is most definitely the drug for me. We can't get the controlled released version in Australia, so I take about 2mg a day split into 3-4 doses.

My dosage is only .25mg and I even break them in half and find that it works just at good. I guess my disorder is not as bad as some others out there. I did get some advice from my phamasist to try to get off of them becaus, like stated, it affects your central nervous system.

IVAN SABIO. Well at my old doctor  first they out me on HYDROXYZINE HCL 50mg for a few months but. it didnt seem to work on anything, except making me very sleepy. he then switched me to CLONAZEPAM 1 MG, but had an allergic reqction to the medication (hives, ichy skin, red hot flashes). So finally he put me on Xanax 0.5, then to 1mg and finally ended up staying on 2mg for years ( it was abt a good 2-4 months for the switches to happen) and it has changed my life in such a good way, im not freaking  out at everything, tearing napkins under the table, cold and hold flashes,even my family said 'theres the old crIF weve missed.' I even ended up in the hospital multiple for such severe panic anxiety attacks. This Medication literally saved my life, but my old dr. is not taking people anymore. This is a VERY VERY hard thing to do anybody ALL IM DOIG IS ASKING FOR HELP PLEASE. Sorry for reacting like that for a few weeks now cause wmy PM DR wont fill it. i really hope you all really help me this situation. Thak you so much.

It doesn't kill an anxiety attack for me but it totally helps me keep it together when I am having an anxiety attack, and helps to get the anxiety attack under control faster and easier. It keeps my blood pressure down as I have already had one heart attack already due to pneumonia and having an anxiety attack. It helps me relax my breathing, which helps me breath easier when I have these attacks which happen many times a day. I am on 8 ml. a day. It helps me to keep moving and is keeping me out of a wheelchair. It also helps me sleep as I have problems breathing when I lay down. That's the good part. I know I will be on this drug until the day I die, and I constantly worry about running out early if I have to take an extra one during the middle of the night ect. I worry about the addiction to my body, but the benifits outweigh any other problems I may have with the drug.

BUT, I still had attacks, either because I missed a dose or waited too long to take it.  Now my Doctor has me on Xanax XR 4mg and it is amazing!!!!  NO more sudden attacks and I feel &quot;even&quot; all day.  Although this is a very addictive medicine, if taken as prescribed you will be fine.  
Panic Disorder	Luna, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	12/8/2011 1:33:44 AM	I'm taking Xanax CR 3 times a day and it is helpful. The only thing is it can be addictive so doctors move doses up and down because of it. Anyway, I am agoraphobic (was a shut-in for 2 yrs)w/pa's and I also take Seroquel CR at night for sleep/PSTD -- that combo takes some getting used to but over all Xanax CR seems to be the only thing other than Klonopin that works (NOTE:Klonopin is least addictive so if you're worried about that- I'd try that first). Make sure you take as prescribed...you know the deal.:)Taking more than needed will NOT help you at all. If you are agoraphobic as I am--it, along with cognitive behavioral therapy is really a godsend. I'd keep a journal to regulate your progress, etc. Be safe &amp; Good Luck everyone!:)

I use the low amount .25 mg. Even then, I break the pill in half. If I am really anxious , panic, I might at most in a 24 hour day take 3 halves. Or that equal 1-.025 and a half of one. Most days I do not take them. Sometimes I take a half, if I can not sleep. I have never had any side effects or problems. People having problems are NOT following Dr. orders. They are abusing them or taking friends pills. Follow Dr. order, check in with Dr. if any questions.

It was always situational.(my parents death,sweetheart's death and dying, my aunt, whom I took care of) dying and after death. I rarely take it now. I went 3 months without taking it once. When I feel the need, it does the trick. Rarely, but if I have not slept at night, and must get up early for work, it helps me drift off, and get a night's sleep.I have never had an abuse of drugs/alcohol, there is no complication, or sideeffect, I have had with this medication. I discuss openly what my need is, and then do follow Dr's advice.

I would still have them. Even worse than that was the effects it had on me. I was sick every single day that I took it, and became very angry and hateful and overly emotional. It got to the point where I was either sick, sleeping, or crying. My mom finally got rid of it for me, and I was back to myself in no time. When we talked to my doctor again, he prescribed me Celexa, which took care of my panic attacks and had no awful side effects. I will never take this again.

Other	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	5	Male	19-24	10/23/2011 8:02:00 PM	When i first took xanax i took two, two mg xanax and i slept for 3 days strait.  As time progressed i loved it so much,  then i started upping my dosage because 4mg's per day wasnt enough, so i started taking more, it got so bad that i had to have at least 8 bars a day, thats 16mg's. Finally wen i slept through 6 months of my life, and gained 20 pounds, i wanted to stop.  This was a challenge.  I felt like my heart was going to explode and i didnt eat anything, obviously i was going through withdraws.  The racing of the heart was unbearable.  Thank god we live in the information age so i looked up withdrawls from xanax.  And i discovered that you cant just stop taking the pills, you have to cut your doses in half based on a chart.  After that was all over with i feel much better, i never had any anxiety problems i was just having fun, bud damn it cost me 6 months of my life.  I lost alot of weight and now i feel awsome. Just stick to the pills once in a while. BE SAFE&lt; PLAY SAFE&lt; STAY SAFE besides even if you have anxiety boo hoo its all psychological!! So dont be a baby and face your fears!! 
Panic Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	10/23/2011 9:40:22 AM	I have suffered from severe panic disorder for most of my adult life also associated with agoraphobia. I also have difficulty sleeping. I take 1mg in the AM and 2mg at bedtime. I still get breakthrough panic attacks and floating anxiety but not as frequent. When i do I have extra Xanax to take for these breakthroughs. i have noticed over the past few months that I am not sleeping more than 4 hours a night so my physician added 50 mg of trazadone to take with my xanax at night. I still wake up several times and noticed as of late that I get severe cramping in my legs (charlie horses} which may be due to the Trazadone. I will discuss this with my doctor at my next visit. But all in all, the xanax has been a life saver for me with my panic disorder.

I wake up a bit groggy (which wears off quickly), but I sleep straight through the night, which is a blessing. I only take 1/2 a pill when I need to sleep (only once every two weeks or so). It is so effective, though, that I will talk to my Dr. about prescribing it for my sleeplessness. I have experienced no side effects other than the grogginess, which I will gladly endure for a good night's sleep.

Panic Disorder	yfabb, 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5		45-54	10/8/2011 1:34:28 PM	I used to have panic attacks few and far between.  Then I moved to another city that was smaller.  When I had panic attacks in a store, I just never went back, but in a small city it got to the point there were fewer places I could go and I became a prisoner in my own home.  Agoraphobia took hold.  Fist started at .25 mg, 5 years later to .5mg  I have been taking 1mg for 10 years twice a day and I can go anywhere.  If taken as directed there are no side effects that I have experienced other than I have much more of a life.

I was diagnosed with GAD (general anxiety disorder) and there were times where I was convinced I was close to death; this medication helps when the symptoms pop up. Yes, it can be addictive, but if you suffer from severe anxiety as I do, you'll find that it's a non issue. I do have to stress that it's important to take something with it (I use to take Prozac, now, I'm on Paxil). Xanax helps to taper off the anxiousness, the anti-depressant treats my GAD long term. I'm finally at a point where I've been able to reduce my dosage due to Paxil and only take the benozpine as needed.It really does work wonders. My best advice is to take it when you're not working or driving (this way you can know how it affects you). Also, don't take more then the prescribed dosage. Should you find that it's not helping, talk to your doctor immediately about changing the dosage to find a level that works for you. When you feel ready to get off the drug, don't just stop, gradually decrease your consumption or lower your dosage. I use to think I was just crazy or overly paranoid, I now realize that I'm not, what I have is a chemical disorder--this medication works and helps me to maintain a right balance.

After 5 minutes of takeing my pill, which is 2 mg, I am back to my sweet and normal self, thank Gods! I will tell you this though... There have been times that I have had to take more than just my 2 pills a day. I run out early and go into instant withdrawls and it ain't pretty! Lasts for just over a week and it sucks, BIG TIME!!! So, just be careful, use your brain, don't take more than you are suppost too...just breath and tell yourself,,, if you think you need more than you are to take in a day, &quot;I can breath my way thru this attack.&quot;  All and all,, it's a mind &quot;F*@K!

The Problem I have with any medication, including sedated before an operation.Saying all of that.  My psych. changed me over to Ativan, he said it stays in the system longer than Xanax.  I am taking it now and it does seem to. It also, for me doesn't have the effect when wearing off that it has gotten out of your system and you are searching for another one.  I have chronic anxiety and am Bipolar. So my situation is different. I take it 4x's a day.  It does not make me sleepy as many think it would. Especially other Dr.'s when they see the dosage also when I have been in Hosp. Someone else wrote about how hospitals wouldn't give him his meds. Also someone mentioned generic not being the same as brand name. I had a problem with it being a the brand of a generic compared to another generic that did absolutely nothing and I had to call my psych. and he had to call it in at the Pharm. I had been dealing with.To the comment about it being taken off the market I have not heard that and with my background I should have. Maybe it is where you live.  BUT&gt;&gt; like they said :  there are too many other issues with real drug abuse.  Also people WILL turn to illegal drugs or alcohol&gt;&gt;and there are many who get it off the street.I am just so thankful I have a psych. who is so wonderful!! overall time of benzo's over 10yrs. below.

I've tried prozac, zoloft, and wellbutrin...all of which made my anxiety worse.  So we tried Klonopin, which worked great for about 2 weeks, then I started having breathing problems, (shallow breathing, and shortness of breath) which are listed as sever side effects.  It sucked because it was really helping me...I had no anxiety!  So now I am taking Xanax regularly, and so far so good.  Still waiting for this breathing thing to get better from the Klonopin though.  I am very happy that Xanax does not have that side effect.  I have never had a problem with Xanax, and it always helps very quickly!!

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	funnyface, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	8/21/2011 4:08:05 AM	HAVE USED FOR MANY YEARS, AS NEEDED. IT WAS VERY HELPFUL IN CALMING ME DOWN AND ENHANCED MY MOOD SO AS NOT TO FEEL SO DOWN.  THEREFORE I COULD/CAN CONTINUE WITH LIFE.  DR'S WANT ME TO DISCONTINUE USAGE W/O EXPLAINING THE REASON. STOP IMMEDIATELY, NO TIME TO WEAN SLOWLY &amp; THAT MAY CAUSE OTHER PROBLEMS. I HAVE TYPE 2 DIABETES, USE LANTUS &amp; NOVALIN, HAD A TRIPLE BY-PASS &amp; A HEART VALVE REPLACED 27 MONTHS AGO AND THUS FAR AM DOING FINE. DUE TO FAMILY PROBLEMS I AM UNDER A &quot;LOT&quot; OF STRESS, WHICH I DON'T NEED. THAT'S WHY I FEEL I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE W/XANAX AS NEEDED. IT HAS HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY. I ALSO RECOMMEND IT FOR OTHER PEOPLE TOO. ALSO HELPS WHEN I AM DEPRESSED I FEEL LIKE A HUMAN AGAIN.

Small dose(.25) Worked great. Then I took one every time something went wrong or I expected something to go wrong. Then I took half a dose before bed to help me sleep. Pretty soon I hardly got thru' a day without one. By the end of a year my balance was off(especially standing still)and I found myself making stupid mistakes.  So I cut back for a week and then stopped. Not something I want to do more than once. Still not completely back to normal. That was 3 months ago. I have taken a half dose a few times to prevent a full blown attack,when I couldn't remove my self from the situation or person causing it. If you have to take it,limit your use, unless you want to take it for the rest of your life.

Be forewarned the DEA is pulling licences from psyci., and private practice drs so soon this will be a thing of the past.  Buspar is supposed to help just the same but let me say as a person who has to use a service dog to help with the panic attacks, the second drug does nothing.  it acts more like a manic reduction drug.  i live in IL and all the medical comm. is acting as if they are giving you meth.  I only wish the gov. who makes these rules could live with these problems.

Panic Disorder	Bruno, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	55-64	8/17/2011 6:20:00 PM	This drug literally saved my life, and to this day still makes it much-more manageable, especially when life throws a &quot;curve-ball&quot; at me---keeps me in a rational state-of-mind. Prescribed to me at 3x/daily, but Dr. approves of my use on a &quot;as-needed&quot;-basis. Until you experience an attack of the &quot;D.T.'s&quot;---you just can't understand. Takes only a matter of minutes to help, on an empty-stomach, a bit-longer after a meal.It MAY cause cramps/nausea, if taken at bedtime without a light-snack, like crackers---but that may vary by individual.I'm always surprised, by the people who chastise me for being &quot;drugged&quot;---when they themselves do too, behind &quot;closed-doors&quot;. Or worse still, attempt to drown the problem with alcohol, as well.It doesn't take long, before you'll find them on a gurney, either going IN, or OUT one final time. The two DO NOT MIX. Period.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	 Male  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male		8/4/2011 4:02:14 PM	Why is everyone so angry with this drug? It is WONDERFUL if it is not abused. The problem with benzos is both doctors and patients will abuse it at times. Doctors often prescribe this as a treatment and Xanax should not be used as a treatment, it should be used as needed, which is what I use it as. I take 0.5mg as needed and  sometimes 1mg at bedtime. I can go a couple days to a couple of weeks without it. Follow those rules, and you won't get hooked. STOP ABUSING, DON'T BE STUPID!

I also, had a consistent eye twitch off and on for 2 years, and noticed soon after taking Xanax my eye twitch was gone.

If it were not for modern medicine I'm not sure where I would be right now. Either lock up in an insane asymlum or maybe even worst. All I do now is that between the axniety, the depression, and the bipolar, and the raging due to the aniety it hasn't been aneasy ride. It cerainly has been a see-saw. Psycho Tropsics can be very effective but for some reason after some timne the body seems to change and starts to become adjusted or numb atleast for me anyways and I need to start switching up. It's like a game of Russian Roulette. don't know, and I'm cetainly not a health care professional evn though after all these years I feel I have enough personal experience to be one. I guess this is just part of the story of my life, and until the right medication come to pass to story will continue to be wrote.

Anxious	danieldom, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4		19-24	7/20/2011 2:25:18 PM	I have been on Xanax for appropriately 5 months now. It has calmed my nerves and allowed to be 'normal'. Of courser normal is suggestive. I am able to get of the house more and experience life. This may be in the combination of my Adderall, but even fore i started taking it i was able to even walk into a grocery store all by msyelf! This was something i was never capable of doing months ago. Just be careful it can becaome quie habit forming. Have your doctor keep a close eye on you, as well as your family and physician. This is what my brother got started on by stealing pills out of my mom pill box. I'm just excstatic about this drug. It's not for everyone, but if all else fails talk to your doctor about his positive effects!

I was able to cut the MS Contin (morphine) dosage from 90 mg/day to 45 mg/day (a 50% reduction!) I have maintained this level for 4 years. Evidently it acts as a muscle relaxer forme.

It makes a lot of patients pass out, or nod out without them being aware of it. I tried to get my wife to stop taking it, and we even had the Dr. switch her to Serax 15's, which did help, except when she found the bottle and took six of them. My wife needs help. BADLY. I know she has panic disorder, but I would rather have her ALIVE for our kids than DEAD. She already totaled my SHO. She broke bother her arms, one of her thighs, one arm, and had to have her nose reconstructed. Yet, the doctor STILL gives her benzo's. So, what do I do to help her? Taking a xanax when you are really suffering is one thing, but taking 4 every day IS NOT. SHe is abusing them. SHe is only supposed to take 2 per day. 1/2 at a time. I LOVE HER. What can I do to help? Loving Husband, Chris

I'm afraid of the freeway, which I had to drive on 60 miles a week to get to the hospital for my husband's cancer treatment. It was a nightmare  I'm also phobic of malls, large stores, DMV, medical offices, traffic, supermarkets, etc, etc. I won't to leave my &quot;safe zone&quot;, the community I live in, without a very, very compelling reason.  The panic I feel restricts my ability to travel or go to places I'd like to see that are out of town, even to visit family.  I can force myself to leave the house with great effort, breaking down the activity into &quot;baby steps&quot;, but it's difficult, scary and embarassing.  My  problem with a substance abuse history interferes with getting treatment for my anxiety, ADHD and insomsia.  I was so happy when my doctor perscribed Xanax as I'd heard it was very effective for agoraphobia and panic.  To my horror, I found out I can't use it. I used it as perscribed for 3 months.  I don't even remember when I started to overuse it, but I lost 3 days to a weird amnesia, like an alcohol blackout, but worse.  I was almost arrested, ran my car into a fence, went to work inebriated, screamed at my husband and then remembered only bits and pieces later.  I was so disoriented that I didn't even realize that I'd had memory loss for several days sfter the fact.  I understand that this medication is very helpful for many people, but I DO NOT recommend it for people with substance abuse tendencies.  Beware pill heads, recovered or not!  This drug doesn't even let you remember any fun you might have had on it.

This drug works for me which is a miracle because other medications (BP, cholestoral) have side effects, usually hives.  For those who can't take this drug, please be aware that there are those of us out there that this drug really helps.  Also, for those who have a bad taste in their mouth after taking this medication, try a carbonated soda.  When I try taking Xanax with water, the taste is terrible but with soda, there is no aftertaste.

I take Xanax and Paxil (both are important for me as I have been diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder). I use to go to sleep with my cell phone and insurance cards beside me, convinced I was going to have a heart attack. My heart would race, I'd grind my teeth, and my thoughts were racing a thousand miles a minutes. With this medication, I no longer have these symptoms.In the few moments I do feel anxious or my breaths are shallow, I simply take one pill, and within the time the symptoms abate. I would say that the Paxil is the key, but for someone like me, who is plagued with anxiety attacks without provocation the Xanax has been instrumental in alleviating the attacks. Talk to your doctor about it, ONLY take what you're prescribed, and over time you may find yourself not having to take the Xanax nearly as much. In the three plus years I've been on, I only take it when I need it now (instead of daily).

The down sound to this drug in my opinion is the dependence issue.  It is HIGHLY addictive and for me I have built a tolerence so I try to take it in cycles.  I will use it for a couple of weeks as needed then I'll force myself to deal with my anxiety for the following 2 weeks.  This cycle also helps me learn to deal with and control the panic as I feel it creeping up on me.  It is a great medication when used properly especially when you are going thru a patch in your life when you feel that you have no control over your panic attacks whatsoever!

I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression three years ago.  I have been taking .25 mg of Xanax, twice a day since then.  I have had wonderful results using this in addition to my antidepressant.  In terms of ease of use, there are times when I go months taking only one a day or even none.  I have been working with my family doctor and cognitive behavioral therapist the entire time as well.

I had attacks come up for one reason; walkinging, playing sports, working in the yard and any other physical activities...none that should cause stress or anxiety. It is a hereditary issue and my daughter has the same thing. Been on the same dose for all 17 years with NO side affects. People that don't have this condition and think bad things about Xanax must get educated on this terrible condition. Leading a very normal life!

This is a very difficult medication to back off of. The longer you're on it the more difficult it is to stop. Withdrawal symptoms are terrible which I've experienced numerous time due to lack of communication in the doctors office regarding refills every month for RSDS. Nothing like having to abruptly stop a Benzodiazpene you've been prescribed since 2004

We/I have found that Xanax has worked the best, mostly for my anxiety. I am currently taking Prestique along with xanax and so far so good. As much as I want to continue taking this drug, I also would like to take a step down and try something else. I say this because they are very addictive and I am almost scared to &quot;run low OR run out&quot; due to withdrawes that I experience. Although, I have cut back and try not take as many, my withdrawl symptoms have gotten a lot better over the past 8 months. I will continue taking xanax until my Dr. and myself are ready for the change.

I was prescribed while being treated for Lyme disease 8 yrs. ago. I take 1 mg/day. I have tried tapering off in 3 days, then over one week, then over two weeks. Each time was a complete diaster. I'm considering getting Buspar first, then doing an 8 week, .25 mg reduction every two weeks to try to reduce the severe withdrawals I have had. I will be talking to my MD. Get educated and beware- it can become very addictive, on low dosage, without abuse, like it or not!

After using it continually for a week or 2, I noticed I started getting very vivid really bad nightmares, when I woke up it still felt very real--after that I would feel sudden depression and a couple times felt suicidal. I would really try other alternatives rather than use this drug. I quit right away when I figured out I was experiencing side effects, the Dr never told me this could make my PTSD worse, but overall feel alot better now that I'm off of it.

I had my grandson then my daughter without notice came and took him from me, then I just lost an uncle and I have an aunt in the hospital. It's just too much stress for me that I cannot handle any more so he prescribed me 0.5 mg twice a day to help me cope but I try to take them when I really feel I need to. I do not want to get addicted to them because I'm hoping when all this passes I will be able to cope again.

I also like to put my IPOD Touch under my pillow woth the speaker on and listen to an inspirig and enouraging podcasts like Joyce Meyers or Chip Ingram. (My husband likes to listen to his business podcast with a monotone speaker).  It keeps my mind off my problems and I doze off.  My IPOD has a sleep timer, so my battery doesn't drain every night.  I have also used a IPOD nano with speaker headphones.  If I wake up in the middle of the night, I put my podcast back on and I am able to go to back to sleep.

I have had no issue with addiction and will go many months at a time without having a need for Xanax. This is one of the medications that truly saved my life. As with any medication, EDUCATE YOURSELF and use as prescribed.

My dr. put me on 2mg a day 3x a week after the 1mg was no longer working as well. Then I stopped all xanax on my own.(I did call my dr.a few days later to tell him, and well he was not happy.) I was doing o.k for about 5 months, than my anxiety came back much worse than before. Thankfully my dr. put me back on 1mg. He wrote for 90 pills so I can use them 3x a day if needed. It dose work better for me if I take them 3x a day, just to keep me calm and at a reg. supply in my system, than as needed. Xanax has been a life saver for me as I feel like a normal person again. I also suffer from depression and chronic pain(back injury o5). If you want to stop work with your dr.don't do what I did. I now regret what I did by stopping by myself.

The day I got out, I found one on the floor of my car, and it started all over again. I absolutely love them, I eat them like candy. They make me forget what I don't need to remember anyway. I may be hooked, but I hold down a very important job, never miss a day. I highly recommend them.

It is not useful as a maintenance medication.  It should only be used on an as needed basis.  For one, your body becomes tolerant to the medication when taken regularly, and you also become dependent.  It should be taken very judiciously.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Sandy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/6/2011 8:52:41 AM	Xanax is indeed a miracle pill for me. I have been taking it for over 15 years and if I don't take it I do not want to leave the house, I don't sleep, I do not want to do anything.  This is a great medication to take for anxiety and to sleep good at night. I cannot take Ambien it gives me nightmares and Temazepam is too drowsy to take during the day. I don't like Valium but XANAX is the best medicine there is. It makes you feel alive and you want to do so much. I have so much energy and feel great when I take my xanax.Yes, I do agree with another review that the pharmacist does look and treat you like you are some kind of heroin addict looking for a fix when you try to pick them up a little earlier because it's considered a controlled substance. I think the FDA should relax and approve this medication for people and not be so strict about it. I'll tell you I have tried to not take it and it makes me feel terrible and I do not want to function on a day to day basis and hate the way I feel.This is a MIRACLE pill!!!! I cannot believe how many people do take it. Forget these anti-depressants like Zoloft and all the others for depression and anxiety. I tried them they work for a little bit but do not have the effect of a Xanax!!!! Doctors please do not refrain by not giving your patients this medication.  It is the best.   The FDA needs to get a grip and maybe get in Xanax themselves like some probably are.   Let's please get as many reviews on this med as possible......

Anxious	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/5/2011 7:05:18 PM	I was prescribed Xanax years ago, before it became a very popular recreational drug. I then had to sign a contract and go through all these hoops to get it from the dr. I moved to another state, and then moved back, and now I am unable to get it from the dr. I took 1 mg three times a day, and now I am the one buying it off the street. I am much calmer when I take it,and it makes me forget some terrible things in my past that I no longer need to even think of. So thanks to all the drug addicts out there who swallow it, bang it,chew it, snort it and smoke it, you made my life hell as I am unable to get it legally. I do not abuse it, I need to work for a living, and I could not do my job if I abused it. You need to keep a handle on how you take it, or you will be going down the addict road.

This helped me sleep all the night and without popping up after 3 hours!!Im seeing some statements made about the &quot;addictivness&quot; of this medication.Sorry; but that is a personal decision; not one to blame on the medication.When something is prescribed- you know your limit, dont go over it!!Learn to live a better,more honest life-and the temptation wont even be there to overuse anything!I dont mean to lecture here-but common sense should not be lost when using this or anything else. So dont tell People to NOT use it -that is wrong.

I wish that i could stop Xanax and i have tried many times but then i get so sick i give in and take another Xanax. I wish someone could tell me the safe and easy way to stop.Someone thats been there and done that.

When a situation comes up that I would normally get depressed about, I'm more like, &quot;ok, we can handle it this way&quot;. For example, our car was repo-ed, we knew it would be but when it actually did get repoed I would of normally freaked out. But we have enough cars for my hubby &amp; I to get to work &amp; $$ to fix what needs to be fixed on back up cars. es, Xanax has helped me. I'm scarred of getting addicted to it though. Any thoughts on addiction to this drug?

None of them worked well with me except seroquel and I was on it for 4 years. Well, eventually it stopped fullfilling it's purpose. Still have mood swings and do not get recooperative sleep. I feel like a zombie all day. I'm having trouble focusing and remember things on a daily basis. I feel like I am a big void inside and that I was losing myself. Now, after being on xanax for the first day, I couldn't be happier. I can think clearly, remember more, and stay calm..I even started laughing again, which is something I haven't done for some time. I am BACK! Thanks to xanax :)

I have all these symptoms and it helps me tremendously. I am also prescribed 10MG Lorcet for moderate pain, though the xanax also helps my pain when I dont take the Lorcet.

I would never take it on a daily basis, due to its addictive nature and danger of quitting suddenly. But anyone with anxiety symptoms, I would recommend it greatly!!

My pain management doc has me take periotic urine tests to make sure Im only taking the meds Im supposed to be taking that he perscribes, my problem is, is that twice I have had a test some back as testing positive for valuim when I do not take and have never taken valium. Has this ever happened to anyone else? Im trying to find answers to this as my pain management dr has dropped me due to my taking meds he did not perscribe, which I did not, just have this freaky false positive for valium when I am taking xanax, and am curious what could cause this.

On one hand it is  lifesaver, on the other hand it is a nasty little pill to be avoided like the plague. I've been on it about 15 years and take it everyday, I have never, not a single day, been without it. I get 90 bars a month and it is up to me to regulate my dosage. Some days I only need a bar, somedays I need 4 bars. I am in no way a drug addict, I don't even drink (at all). Withdrawal is REAL and MISERABLE.  Sometimes at night I'll wake up covered in sweat with full on tremors.  I keep water and a tiny pill box of xanax on my night stand. The good is I can live a calm, active, normal life that I simply could not have otherwise. Over the years I have had my bottle of xanax stolen several times.  Hide it when you get it. People will take it out of the medicine cabinet, leaving you in a perilous situation- luckily my Dr. has always trusted me and refilled early.  But, really, hide them. Use them as directed or you will be in a world of hurt- HURT-. Xanax addiction is very dangerous.

However, tolerance to the drug builds up rather quickly. The biggest issue(s) I have with this drug are negative. Firstly, doctors push this drug onto consumers...I mean patients, like the stuff is harmless candy. Candy it is not. Extremely dangerous when mixed with alcohol, and moreover anything else, EXTREMELY difficult to withdraw from or stop usage of.

Panic Disorder	Katrina, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	35-44	1/31/2011 7:11:48 PM	I took Xanax for almost six years to treat panic disorder. I typically took .25-.50mg a day and funtioned pretty well at this dose. I was still having problems with depression, though, and went to see a psychiatrist who upped my dosage to 1mg. I thought I had hit the Xanax lottery! Unfortunately, with my history of alcoholism, this proved to be very dangerous. I almost died this summer when I mixed the Xanax with vodka and diphenhydramine (Benadryl). I had to be hospitalized for 4 days and under 24 hour care to be weened off this drug. Since stopping it, I have found that I actually have LESS anxiety then when I was on it. After a while, you start to have a roller coaster effect with your anxiety levels getting higher and higher without the drug in your system, so you take more to knock down the anxiety. I think more clearly than I have in years since I stopped taking it,and I no longer suffer severe blackouts and dangerous loss of inhibition when I drink. Be very careful with this drug if you are a drinker. It's not worth losing your life over.
Other	Kkbdal, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/31/2011 8:22:38 AM	I've had sleep issues all my life and was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia at the age of 16. Not long after severe anxiety and panic attacks came along. Then a sereve car crash brought on PTSD. I just thank God my Dr had already put me on Xanax for my sleep issues when all this other crap happened in my life. It has helped me from going off the deep end several times! My dosage is 1 three times a day as needed but I only take them when I really need them. Like others have said they can be addictive and once I almost slipped when things in my life got really really bad. But whats the point in drugging yourself into a stupor and acting like an idiot when you have problems to solve!! I am 33 now and have been on and off the drug since I was 16 and yes it does taste nasty as all get out but it does its job. It calms you, for me it stops my racing thoughts so I can sleep restfully with no panic attacks in my sleep. But one thing I have learned and this may sound silly, but something that powerful, you have to respect it. Because if you don't it will end up taking over life and destroy everything you have. I know b/c it happened to my bestfriend despite everything I did to try and stop her. So friends stay safe and stay healthy!! And may love always be in your hearts!

I used to take valium, however both the Dr. and I agreed this would be a great alternative medicine. It does work, however my schedule has increased over the years. I was hospitalized and not given the drug for a period of 4 days. NOT GOOD! All the information is out there, but the hospital had such disdain for the drug that the drug wasn't even on thier formulary. Absolutely terrible withdrawal symtoms!

I am diagnosied with Bipolar 2 and am prone to anxiety attacks. Whenever I feel a trigger come about that I know is going to cause a mood swing towards hypomanic, I can take .5 of a xanax and I can be relaxed. The only downfall is that it only works for me if I take it &quot;as needed&quot;. When I use it to take care of smaller panic attacks over and over again, it stops working and I am left with an unmanagable panic attack.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	rockione, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	3	Female	65-74	1/9/2011 10:46:56 PM	I had viral encephalitis at age 33.  I almost lost my life.  Most of my sleep centers weredestroyed or damaged.  Sleep would NOT come. I went to Mayo's for Sleep Study.  Dr. Peter Hauri, widely known for his work,did my study.  He remarked &quot;you need to find a regimen that works for you&quot;.  I was told to take Carbo/levo (generic for the drug people take for Parkinson's), Alprazolam 1 mg 2xdaily, and the generic for remeron (sleeping pill).  I have had a couple of changes on the sleeping pill and I need to get off after 60 days and take Benadryl so as not to habituate. If I stay on this regimen, I do very well in my life.  I'm very active in church,I have sang all my life, am currently a Sweet Adeline.  I travel, attend outings with friends and drive a car.  I NEVER feel drugged, but if I forget meds, I pay a very high price with a panic attack that lasts until I get to my meds.  Yes, you could say I am addicted, but I want to live a normal life and this regimen helps me do that.  I am retired, but held a part time job for almost 15 years.  That is normal living.  Maybe I am locked into this regimen, but I am an active person. I am always monitored by my physician.  If people want to put me in a category that is not pleasing to everyone, that's ok.  I need this regimen to be active.  I am on these meds because they work.  They work and I am free to work or play.  I do volunteer work at the nursing  homes in my area.  If I didn't go to visit these people, they wouldn't have anyone else who would see them.  I like my full life and don't intend to give it up over a silly stigma.  People, these meds work. Get over yourself and get busy!!

The only concern I have for this drug is that it really is not beneficial after about 8 weeks. This means that in order for it to  keep working my doctor has to keep increasing the dosage, which I do not like to do with any drug. When it works it is a great help and I would  recommend it to anyone who needs it.
Panic Disorder	PanicFree, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/21/2010 2:31:17 PM	I would begin by stating I believe in this drug and how it works with individuals that really need it, I have been on and off of it for 4 years.  I do not take more than one to two times a day and a max of 1mg and never take your doses on a regular 4 hour schedule.  This is how I have kept from becoming addicted, as advised by my doctor.  It has worked.  Now with saying all of that I then have to add that one of my best friends was also on this medication and she became addicted and when it was no longer enough she turned to pain meds and she is now a true pill popping addict.  So be very cautious and listen to your body.  I have severe panic attacks so I do understand when others state they have to have it to function.  I say to that look at your schedule and think about when the best time of the day maybe when you are alone that you can skip doses so that you never become addicted.  It is a horrible double edge sword; a beautiful thing when taken correctly and satan himself when abused.

However, the anxiety leaves quickly.  Must be careful when driving a car or going to work or run errands.overall I believe the ease which the anxiety dessapates is well worth any side effects.

Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/18/2010 2:33:54 PM	I started taking Xanax in December of 2009 for panic attacks and it has worked wonders. I take it as needed and now I'm able to go out and do things that used to cause panic attacks. It does make me drowsy, so I usually only take half a tab (.125 mg) instead of a whole one (.5 mg), but since I don't take it everyday the drowsiness isn't a major problem.

Pros- it works, calms you down, relieves anxiety fairly quick.Cons- if your new to the drug, it makes u sleepy, it doesnt have a lasting effect and when it wears off, the rest of the day is foggy.

Anxiousness associated with Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/1/2010 8:37:57 PM	Xanax was effective for me and I had no side effects. However, like other benzodiazepines, Xanax has the potential to become a crutch. I no longer take Xanax and it was the best decision I made. I think a lot of medication masks problems, and unless you confront your issues head-on you will always rely on medication. I turned to psychotherapy, which helped more than the medication. Results are different for everyone, but this is an opinion coming from someone who suffers from depression and PTSD.

I've had the same bottle for over two years, so I don't feel it is addictive at all. It makes me tired, so I can't understand people who can take several pills a day. I can only handle one at a time, and very rarely. I find that prayer works better than anything!!

It took away my racing thoughts  or rumanating (muling over and voer my day). I take it to make it through an agrument or confrontation with spouse or children. To put on  a birthday party or go to Walmart without fear.  But sleep is where I reserve the most Xanax.  I caqn take up to 1mg a day. So I may take .25 for a situatuion but have at least .50 left to fall asleep better.

This med is wonderful for my anxiety.  I call this medication my happy pills, for reasons that are clear.  I am careful with the correct dosage as it is very easy to become addicted. I have Crohn's Diease and Xanax really works for me.  My G.I. Dr. has recently abruptly discontinued my Rx. I have had no withdrawl sympotoms. I do however feel my anxity levels are very high and should not have been taken off the med. I am not a Dr., and I don't play one on T.V., so I am trying new relaxing methods for now. Thank you for listening.

Normally i take 1 or 2 1mg pills about 7 in the evening and it does just what i need it to do.  My only concern now, since I've been taking it about 15 years is that i'm not sure if it's the Xanax or premenapasal that has me feeling really weird.  i just don't feel like myself anymore, I find myself often feeling all alone, even though I'm not.  It's really hard to explain and i'm afraid to tell my doctor because i don't want to be taken off the Xanax, it really has brought alot of peace to me over the years that I have taken it.  I hope it's just my age and the premen stuff that is making me feel weird.

It has been a miracle drug for me.  I have a wonderful doctor who first put me on Lexapro.  The Lexapro worked for the panic attacks and anxiety, but the side effects were terrible.  So then he switched me to Xanax a year ago, and my whole life changed.  I take .5mg 3xday, but basically just take it as needed.  No side effects and it works very quickly.  I do agree that there is a stigma about this medication, but people need to realize that patients are prescribed this for a reason.  I also suffer from extreme spinal stenosis, and it relaxed the muscles in my back that start to spasm because of the intense pain of the stenosis.  It helps me sleep through the night without being a zombie the next morning.  Xanax is truly a wonderful drug and a god send to me.  Don't be afraid to be proactive in your health care.  If you think this medication may help you than you need to talk to your doctor about it.  After all you are the customer and you are paying him, so he should take your comments and desires into consideration.  I hope that people find this useful.

Xanax has been wonderful for sleeping. I cannot remember the last time I've slept so soundly (&amp; all through the night). I usually take it an hour or 2 before I go to bed and wake up feeling refreshed and not groggy.

The scan gets very close to my face and I cannot tolerate such closeness.  The CT tech requested a valium, however, my primary doc prescribed xanax.  It worked perfectly.  I had 2 .25 mg 1 hr before and 1.25 mg 30 min before the procedure.  Mission accomplised!! No attack and no side effects.

I have been taking it for anxiety/panic attacks.  The first week or so, it worked.  However, after that it had no effect on my attacks.  I take it twice a day, at a 1 mg dose.  Since it hasn't helped me any my doc has taken me off of it and prescribed something else.  It also leaves an awful taste in my mouth.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Hooray for Xanax, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/23/2010 1:24:28 AM	After a big move (losing my home) I went into severe panic attacks and could not sleep or focus. I literally felt like someone opened up my head and sprinkled pepper on my brain. As soon as I would finally fall aslee due to sheer exhaustion, I would wake up 10 minutes later with severe anxiety.I was hesitant to try medication because I've always been able to get through difficult situations through through breathing exercises but I had not slept in weeks. It was so awful to be awakened 10 times a night.Finally my doctor prescribed .5 mg of Xanax three times a day. What's great is that when I took the first pill, it worked right away. I got a little sleepy about 15 minutes after taking it but then I was back to my normal old self. I didn't feel drugged, I just felt like I could handle things again. I still have the same yucky situation and when it starts to overwhelm me, I take my little peach-colored pill and then I feel like life is going to be okay, no matter what happens, I have the tools to try to move forward and all is not lost.I wish anyone with anxiety the best with your trouble. I hope me sharing my experience helps.  PS...My doctor also prescribed Lunesta which works great for sleeping the night through (but you must definitely make sure you will be able to stay IN BED for at least 7 hours or you will be loopy when you get up, and could make stupid mistakes like leaving the front door open, etc.)The nice thing that since I've been on Xanax, I don't need the Lunesta to sleep. Good luck everyone...don't despair. Things will get better!

Be very cautious, it is extremely addictive. Meaning, if you take high doages (3-6 mg daily) over several weeks then suddenly stop, you may get seizures from withdrawals,exremely dangerous to stop abruptly. The secret is to cut down very gradually by .25 or .5  mg daily until you get to 1mg daily dose. Then you can reduce by .25 mg after 1 week at 1 mg until you get off it. I actually cut the tablets down to 1/8 mg pieces and reduced that way very effectively. Best not ever to go above 1mg daily. It is a very deceptive drug, stores up in your inetrnal organs. I have been taking it for over 5 years. I now know how to handle it. At one point I was taking 6 mg a day for several months. Took Months to reduce down to 1mg a day!

Panic Disorder	healthygirl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/19/2010 8:46:52 AM	I use generic Xanax for panic disorder and anxiety; 1 mg each night. This dosage is enough to get me through a normal day just fine. I take an extra fourth of a tablet during the day during stressful moments, such as when I am in a vehicle with someone else driving and I feel loss of control.  A great side effect is I get 8 hours of sleep each night, although it makes me dream a lot.  If I am under stress, sometimes the dreams are a litle intense, but coming from a family where ALL of us suffer from insomnia, this has been the perfect drug for me.  I have been taking it for some time, and have always followed doctor's orders regarding its use.
Panic Disorder	JK, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	35-44	8/17/2010 2:09:11 PM	When they say do not stop taking this medication suddenly if you've been on it for an extended period of time, I'm here luckily to tell you it's no joke. Be very careful. Although the benefits are tremendous, make sure to do your due diligence and research this medication. I was just released from the hospital last week. I ran out of my script early and couldn't get a refill for 10 days. I figured I would tough it out, but after taking 3mg a day my battle didn't last long and before I knew it I could barely move any muscle in my body, let alone speak. I thought I was going to die and to be honest the Doctors in the ER were quite concerned. Good luck and please be very careful. Watch your dosage and use!

The doctor put me on this drug when we had a traumatic situation and continued to increase it. I took it as prescribed and the negative effects were horrible. My doctor at the detox unit stated, quite accurately, &quot;they were going to make a long term anxiety-ridden customer&quot;  and I agree totally.  This drug should NOT be used for longer than a few days according to the instructions and the doctors are prescribing it for way over that amount of time.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	brneyezz, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/14/2010 8:24:05 AM	I have been on Xanax for 6 yrs. when I had my very first anxiety attack after my 1st separation from my ex-husband; I have never been addicted to it and only take it when an attack occurs.  Unlike what I have read and heard, I do not feel this drug is habit-forming, in my opinion.  The only affect I get from taking this medication is my anxiety attack is relieved within 10-15 minutes and I rarely need to take a second pill unless the attack occurs again.  I have on a scale from 1-10 a 8-9 in my attack range.  My 2mg. dose does the trick every time.  I keep 2 on me at all times because I never know when an attack will occur.  I have no euphoric feeling, which I like, and only get relief from the attack which the drug was made to do.  I can keep a full prescription bottle for months at a time and my doctor knows I only take this medication when needed.  My 18 yr. old daughter was recently prescribed this after coming off heavy meth use and loves it, she too only uses it when needed and agrees it is not habit forming.  I administer her daily dose and find she rarely uses it, unless she feels the affects of anxiety which can occur from detoxing off meth or other hard core drug use that she has been sober from for almost a month.  Xanax was administered to her for 3 days 1 very 6-8 hours and was fully detoxed within 4 days, thereafter she has rarely taken her Xanax because she states she only needs it when she feels that anxious feeling to use or deal with the affects of her anxiety.  By using it ONLY when you feel anxiety is what I recommend and so should your doctor; if you find you are using more than what is prescribed I would suggest talking to your doctor and finding out what may be underlying a more serious condition that may not be anxiety but a more serious condition like drug abuse, or the need to feel medicated to cope with reality.  That is my opinion because I have seen too much drug abuse in my family and have learned what is real and what is not.

I've tried everything there is and xanax DO work for anxiety attacks, the only problem is they don't stay in your system long enough to &quot;calm&quot; you if you're anxious pretty much 24/7.  That's where the abuse comes in because you have to take so many.  Also, I've seen waaaay too many people abusing this drug that don't even have anxiety!  That's why Dr.'s  will hardly prescribe it to people.   I now take Klonopin 3 times a day religiously and it works just as well as long as you take the dosage even if you aren't anxious.  My Dr. does give me a few xanax a month for &quot;breakthrough&quot; anxiety attacks because they work so fast.  So, I have finally found the perfect combination to make me feel human again!!  Good Luck and maybe you could try this as well.

With my panic disorder w/severe depression, this makes me feel &quot;even&quot;; no highs or lows.  However this drug isn't for everyone.  Have seen people take this and get very agitated and mean.  A lot of doctors are afraid to give Xanax, and are being policed by our government, but if it absolutely works on a patient, then they should stay on it.  Why fix what isn't broken is what I say.  Been on other benzodiazapines and they just don't work for me like this does.

It allows me to breath and slow myslef down when I feel an attack of anxiousness starts. I do not have to take everyday just when I am feeling out of control of my emotions. I use to take anti depressants which I am so glad i do not take anymore. I never will again either. They did more damage over time than good. I know this drug can be easily additive so you do have to watch and moitor your self with the usage.

Side effects include fatigue and some memory loss.  I did have to stop taking it suddenly when I got pregnant - withdrawal unimaginably painful, both physically and mentally.  I advise anyone who is taking this medication to use birth control.

It was unexpected, and a sudden death. He put me on 6mgs/day. Later, he dropped my dosage to 4mgs. Now, 9 year's later, I am still on the same dose. It helped me through the anxiety, depression I was having.  Also, through the change of life. I take 5mg 4 times a day. Sometimes: 2mg in the morning and 2mg at night.  Since, it helps me sleep sounder.  I know that I have an addiction to it, since the length of time, I have been on it.  My memory has worsened, and I know it is the xanax that is doing the damage. I advise anyone thinking of getting on this drug, to read up on it. Also, there is alternative drugs, that are not so hard on your body, such as this.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/24/2010 11:44:24 AM	I tried taking ecstasy once and I had a bad reaction to it. Ever since I took it Ive developed horrible anxiety towards pills so it was extremely hard for me to find something to make my panic disorder go away. Xanax was the only thing that helped me. I dont believe in anti depressants but I couldnt leave my house without having a panic attack so I tried Celexa, Buspar, and Pamelor. None of them worked because the effects they had on my brain triggered my anxiety. Xanax did not give me that fear. I took it as needed for a year until I gradually travelled further from my house without taking any. I went back to my therapist, took up yoga and quit smoking. Now I rarely take xanax unless it's for situations to accommodate my new claustrophobia such as planes and small rooms. Xanax is not addicting, it just works. The problem is that your body gets used to the lower doses and you have to slowly increase your dose to be able to cushion the anxiety. I started at .5 and cut them in half and now Im at a comfortable 1mg. Im writing this review because xanax was the only thing that helped me fix a stupid mistake I should never have done in the first place. Good luck with your anxiety. I highly recommend any kind of change in your life to help put you in the right direction towards recovery. Please do not start taking xanax unless you have intent to manage on your own, the fear of being without xanax should not replace your original fear.

Anxiousness associated with Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	6/22/2010 7:28:35 PM	I started taking Xanax 2 years ago to help me cope with a stressful job.  I started with .5 mg.  Soon I built up a tolerance, and my doctor prescribed me 1mg 4 times a day.  When I built up a tolerance to that I started taking more....at one time.  I have become dependent on this drug.  Part of me wants to quit taking it, but the addicted part tells me I NEED it.  I let this drug ruin my life.  I lost my job, my boyfriend of 10 years, and my parents' and friends' trust.  I wish I had never heard of Xanax.

There is a long history in my family. I now am prescribed 20mg Celexa in the morning, and 4 - .5mg Xanax to spread out during the day. I usually only take 3 per day. It has helped me get through a bad case of Cancer I won, and a divorce that I won and several other things. I love my Xanax, and I don't abuse it. It just makes me more like everyone else, that is what I think.

Haven't had to go over .5 mil.  But take 4 times a day. Some days less, according to the daily experiences. Only problem I can see, is a decrease in sexual desire. I am 75, that may be one cause?

I do not like to take meds, but sometimes you have to.  I have had no side effects, but I cut my 2.5 mg in half so it is a small dose. A whole pill will put you to sleep! so that is perfect for at night.

If taken with typical depression meds without real anxiety symptoms, it's nothing more than a 3 hour nap.  I you can't sleep because of the anxiety, this may be the ticket.

With my experience w/xanax: I developed panic disorder after a death in the family. I was having panic attacks multiple times a day every day. My Dr prescribed Xanax and it did wonders @ first but my body quickly became immune to the effects. It would only work for about 30 minutes on 1 mg 3 times/day (I never went higher b/c of the lack of help provided by taking xanax)and inbetween taking the pill my anxiety and panic attacks took full effect. I never got addicted to it but it proved ineffective for long term use for me. It would not even calm me during panic attacks.

I only use it whenever absolutely necessary, approximately 1 to 2x a week. It works great for flying anxiety.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/23/2010 9:00:38 PM	Suffered for 15 yrs not sleeping. My Dr.s tried me on everything and nothing would work. The problem with this drug is that I have to keep increasing my dose. I started on .5 and 2 yrs later Im  up to 3 mg at night. I have become VERY addicted to this drug. It has totally changed my life though. I only take it at bed time, but if I try not to take it I WILL NOT sleep. And I also take 200mg of Seroquel at bed time and when I get up in the morning I feel like I have a hangover. But I do get 10 hours of quality sleep every night. I would love to get off of all these meds but don't see that happening. Its a no win situtation. They want me to start taking Provigle in the morning to help me get going but I refuse to take it. Bad enough I have to take pills to fall asleep Im not going to take more pills to get me going. Good luck to everyone out there thats in my situation. But if you need sleep Xanax works for me

Slurred speech, trouble walking, confusion.  My brother thought I was having a stroke.  I was severely allergic to it.  It still has taken me days to have the side effects leave my body.  I still feel like my brain  is swishing around in my head.  I cannot beleive such a small amount could do so much damage.  I will not recommend to anyone.

When the attack was coming, the pill really helped to calm me down. One problem...It is very addicting in my opinion. For anyone who has ever had addiction problems, please stay away from this pill. It works &quot;too good&quot;. I took this medicine for about 6 months before I realized that I could not make it through the day (so to speak) without it. I came to the conclusion I would rather pass out from an attack than become addicted to another drug. Please be mindful when taking this medicine. It is very easy to become addicted without even realizing it.

I probably would not have broken up with my fiance if I'd known about xanax.  It would have helped me through an extremely stressful, anxiety-ridden time.  What I thougth was just me being me was actually me in the midst of a prolonged state of high anxiety. This drug makes me feel normal again and reminds me of the difference between normal and anxious.

I've tried others anti-depressants but xanax has worked the best for me. I've been taking it for over a year and have not become addicted to it since I could go a few weeks without it with no side affects. I only take it when my grief overwhelms me.

Panic Disorder	Newtoallthis, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	5/12/2010 3:33:43 PM	I just started having panic attacks in the past 2 weeks.  The first time I took the Xanax (the lowest dose there is), I fell asleep right away and in about an hour had one of the worst panic attacks yet and had to go to the emergency room to get calmed down.Also, I never have slept on it.  When I feel the effects coming on, I have shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing and fight to keep awake.  It is almost like the medicine is causing the attacks.I only used this for 7 days and the doctor has said I am having a reaction to it and to stop.  And, I agree with the others, even after using it only 7 days, I found I was needing it more frequently and in larger doses to get relief.

I suggest you really seek proper advice and maybe look for an alternative there are other meds much better now a days. Cheers.

It enables me to go about my daily life without having panic attacks and problems with anxiety. I was almost housebound before I started taking it 3 yrs. ago. I have maintained a low dosage of 1.5 to 2.0 mg. a day. It saved my sanity!!

Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/6/2010 7:21:36 PM	My daughter died of SIDS in 2006 and I could not have made it through that without xanax. It does however &quot;bandaide&quot; issues that need to be fixed long-term. It works like a charm, and quickly when the onset of anxiety or panic begins. Highly recommended, yet be careful to not stop taking it without a taper. The withdrawls are VERY uncomfortable and can cause seizures at worst. Be mindful with this drug and you'll have great relief from debilitating anxiety/panic that greatly disrupts daily life.

I began having waves of anxiety a few years ago that were overwhelming but not as bad as panic. My doctor prescribed Xanax .25mg and said to take as I needed. I have never been on prescription meds in my life so I break these little guys in half. One half takes the edge off, relieves the attack and I have found joy. Don't take so much if you're afraid of addiction. Take 1/2 of the smallest amount available and not on a schedule, just when your heart starts to pound or you feel especially shy, nervous, angry or irritable. Believe me, in moderation, Xanax gives you back your freedom without the zombie effect.

Unless you are prepared to undergo extremely serious withdrawal once you decide to stop being the zombie it will make you (I was one for 5 years). Withdrawal from this is HELL - plain and simple. I wish my doctor NEVER prescribed it. AVOID ANY BENZO for anxiety - this stuff is NASTY and will put you through the worst experience of your life.

My symptoms were hard to explain and hard to understand ( to anyone but me ) I was terribly nauseous, anxious... I could not relax ( which everyone told me to do ) An attack would hit me at any time. During the day, the middle of the night, and all I could do was pace. Although I never had thoughts of suicide, I was starting to feel like I was lsoing my mind. I admitted myself into a hospital...&quot;mental ward&quot; and was diagnosed with stress/anxiety, and panic issues/depression. I was assigned therapy. and was given Xanax, and Wellbutrin. This was 10 yrs. ago. Occasionally, I still have the panic attacks, and they are rough. If it was not for the Xanax, which I take AS prescribed, I could not enjoy my family, or my life. When I take it, I do not feel any kind of HIGH. It makes me able to take a breath, relax, and go on with normal life. I am aware of all the Xanax hype,and yes it IS extremely addictive. I just stay fully aware of my meds and take them as I should.

I thought I was going to die.....Working in the medical field I NEVER  expected such small dosage would cause such serious withdrawals when not taking the medicine...

Xanax has evolved into many forms, I found the XR version fairly safe and effective, tho expensive, the short or &quot;fast acting&quot; formulations I find a&quot;rebound&quot; effect if I exceed 2mg, but any formulation has been very effective at near-instant PA relief.  As for the social stigma aspect - even within the medical community, I do not understand that, these are not meds to be taken lightly, and the condition is very disabling -  people have undoubtedly scammed doctors to get meds, but a blanket position on certain meds is prejudicial and does &quot;harm&quot; the undeserving.

Between money issues, job anxiety and life demands I had a panic attack. Didnt sleep for days couldnt stop my racing mind. Prescribed .25 every 4/6 hours as needed. Took as presc. for the first week and then tried to lower. It has taken time, but I only take as needed now. I am very healthy and sensitive to meds, I didnt have any problems with this, just quieted my mind so I could function. Dont be scared of it, and dont be so hard on yourself if you need help. We all need it sometimes. I had no side effects and feel so much better knowing I have it if I need it. You arent loosing your mind, life is just too darn demanding these days and we try to do it all ourselves. Hope this helps someone, you are not alone :)

I have been an extremely anxious person my whole life and had gotten worse with the transtitions of my 20's. Breaking up from a long term relationship, going to college and working full time really triggered my panic and anxiety even more.  With the medication I am able to think more clearly and logically rather then freaking out when things dont go right. Ive never had to take it daily and have a good handle on how often I take it. Its helped me to me a more calmer person overall even when I am not medicated.

Panic Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/30/2010 12:07:36 PM	This medication has worked wonders in my life over the last three years, unfortunately, there are some social stigmas attatched when taking a controlled substance and I have found that even some pharmacists like to treat you like a &quot;pill head&quot; even though I take it for legitimate reasons. Because of this, I have found it hard to be honest with my Dr. about my tolerance building up because I don't want him to get the same impression. Other than that, I would say that, in the correct dosage, this medication is very effective in treating both minor and severe panic. I regained control of my life and my ability to be a patient mother, I CAN SLEEP, I can have one thought at a time (which allows me to get things accomplished). Overall, I love this medication and my only complaint is that I feel like I'm not allowed to say that without being an &quot;addict.&quot;

I also take Celexa during the daytime to help with generalized anxiety disorder.  It's very effective and my sleeping problems have significantly decreased.  I use wake up in night sweats because of stress.  My doctor gave me the medicine to help until until the Celexa started working.  Celexa cured the night sweats.  Xanax made it easier to rest my mind going into sleep. It doesn't last all night because of the short half life.  This drug is habit forming, so be careful.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/26/2010 12:46:08 PM	I have been taking xanax off and on for several years. When I was younger, I had full blown panic attacks, had no idea how to handle it or what to do. I just lived in fear all the time. If I wasn't having a panic attack, I was afraid I was going to have one. Just a really bad cycle. A few years ago, I was prescribed xanax, which works so great for me. I was in such bad shape that I was &quot;anxious&quot; about taking the &quot;anxiety&quot; medication! But it turned out fine, it helped so much. The other medications for anxiety and panic, such as anti-depressants, I had a bad reaction to, I hated them, I won't take them. But xanax has no side effects, except occassionally it will make me feel a little sleepy for a brief time. And I have the option of only taking medication when I need to, instead of every day. Having this medication has greatly improved my life, and my condition. I haven't had a panic attack in years, and I am able to reduce and control my anxiety. I have never had to take this med more than once in a day. One of the great things is that it takes away the symptoms, but leaves you perfectly able to function, work, drive, do whatever you need to do. My dosage is .5 and I usually only take half a pill. Just that much works fine. I do sometimes worry about addiction, but as long as you keep aware of that possibility, and your doctor carefully monitors your usage, it should not be a problem at all. Coming from someone who has lived with panic and anxiety for 25 years, I can honestly say this has helped more than anything else.

At first it worked along with an antidepressant i was taking. Then i became used to the xanax dose i thing was .5mg.  When i could no longer deal with the addictive effects, i decided to go cold turkey.  i ended up in the emergency room shaking.  before that, i actually went in my bathroom and jumped for an hour.  i could not get myself together or stop shaking my leg.  It took a week for me to &quot;detox&quot;.  i couldn't sleep; it was like i was losing my mind.  I was out of work for two weeks. I'm on klonopin now 3 times daily.  I've had much better results.  I would not suggest anyone take xanax unless you are ready for the addictiveness and the detox.  I was told that i was supposed to gradually decrease my dosage to come down but i wanted that stuff out of my body. Be careful; this stuff works to a certain extent, but is super addictive. 
Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/25/2010 1:28:48 PM	My doctor prescribed this for me for my panic attacks I can have when traveling or in the middle of the night.  This drug has changed my life.  I only take half to a whole of .25mg when I need it and it instantly relaxes me.  It made me dizzy the first time I took it but that goes away after the first couple times.  Just knowing that I have xanax to fall back on if my anxiety gets out of hand has made my anxiety lessen substantially.  Because I used to have anxiety about my anxiety.  Im not on any other anxiety meds because I don't like the way they make me feel. I rarely have to take xanax anymore but I keep it around just in case.  It has helped me to live life to the fullest again which is what anyone with anxiety wants more than anything.

I am a 24 yr old that has been on &amp; off xanax for a few years. I was first prescribed xanax for panic attacks. Meanwhile both Zoloft &amp; Cymbalta wasn't working for depresson, therefore, they decided to dose me up on xanax just to mentally get through how miserable i was with depression. I couldn't think straight, couldn't remember anything, felt no happiness for anything, and worst of all i was wanting anything to make me feel normal or get my mind off the awful depression. The dr kept on telling me to take xanax to quit having weird sucidial thoughts. Although my head was telling me one thing, my heart was saying this isn't right.I was in living hell! The xanax helped ease everything and at times made me feel great, kind of a high.I have never abused drugs nor will i ever! I was prescribed this medicine to help my anxiety and depression and they kept me on it for 5 years. What people do not know is how dangerous of a drug it is. I had to visit about 15 different dr's this past year because of weird symptoms due to the drug; double vision with everything seeming slanted, dizziness, vertigo, depression, and on and on. I am here to tell you xanax is only a two week drug to help with anxiety. Please, Please do research before you take this drug. There are other anxiety meds to take that are non addictive and ask about them first. Also, start taking gabba because it effects your brain the same as xanax but its non addictive and non drowsy. I just got back from an orthomolecular dr to get me off all of the drugs. Went from taking 3 1/2 mgs a day to .75 mg. It has been hell even taking supplements to ease the withdrawls. It will effect so many different aspects of your life because it is a depressant such as alchoal is. My memory is slowly returning. At one point I couldn't remember how 2 even spell easy words. I beg users to do research because the drs are not waring you about the fatal drug. Plz e-mail me w/ANY questions. Janaed2000@hotmail.com

Other	Tinkibaby, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/13/2010 4:29:23 PM	I was prescribed the peach .5 dose 3x a day in 2000 to help with my anxiety, sleeplessness, and inability to deal w/the stress in my life. Around 2002 the dosage was increased to the blue 1.0 3x a day then last year when my dad past away it was increased to the white 2.0 3x a day. I've tried every sleep aide but nothing works or they make me feel drugged out or not w/it the next morning. This is the only med I have found that helps me sleep, helps w/my anxiety, works w/in 15 to 20 minutes &amp; doesn't have those affects. I take it to sleep at night now &amp; only on the days when I get really stressed or my anxiety kicks in because of the fact that it does make me sleepy &amp; I don't function well during the day on it. It does help &amp; is a wonderful med but I don't like the fact that it's so addictive.If I knew then what I know now I wouldn't have ever let my dr prescribe it to me. He did try all other options before prescribing it to me. I would recommend trying all other option before having your dr. prescribe it because of the fact it is highly addictive &amp; the w/drawals are not something you want to experience. I would give anything to have a med that is as effective for sleeplessness, stress, feeling anxious, panic attacks &amp; anxiety as xanax but isn't addictive like xanax. I don't recommend going off this med w/out your dr. supervision or just stopping it all at once. I have been told that the w/drawals from xnanx are worse then any legal or illegal drug &amp; can kill you. Is this true?

And IF my dpctor told me that I had to go BACK on it again, I would say &quot; HELL NO&quot; because Xanax made me forget that I had taken it so, I would take another dosage. An hour later , another Dose. This went on for a few days, UNTIL,My famil and I were having dinner, I rose from the table, flipped the table over, and announced that I was going to murder my family.At the time, I carried a 14 inch Military survival knife, I took itout of the sheath, and told my wife that I was going to cut out EACH of their hearts and EAT it. My 3 year old daughter, grabbed my leg, and asked &quot; Daddy, you ok?  I knelt down beside her, held her tight, then I looked at my wife. I started crying and told her &quot;Baby,I need help&quot;. I found another doctor who got me OFF Xanax. Now, 22 years later, and I am STILL doing great.Would I recommend taking Xanax, I will recommend AGAINST taking Xanax. That damned drug should be BANNED !

Afraid I'd feel drugged, out of it, out of control, etc.  I took 1/2 of a .25mg pill (and I was so panicked before I stool it!) and I instantly felt better.  At first, I felt a tiny bit loopy, but I think I was just a bit scared.  So, I have only taken the med once, but I will feel confident taking it when I travel, now.  Also, I am so happy to have some &quot;instant&quot; relief for those times when I am paralyzed by my anxiety.

My friend has been on it for years and he appears to be drugged all the time.  He is extremely paranoid that nobody likes him, he thinks people are trying to kill him, never leaves his house if he doesn't absolutely have to, he talks in disjointed sentences and is extremely forgetful. His doctor was out of town for a couple weeks and he couldn't get his refill so he had to cut back and he seemed soooo much better!  He stopped by to see us after work and acted like a normal human being even though he was experiencing insomnia and some withdrawls.  I would say this drug is one of the worst on the market and easy to get so please be careful, it is truly scary!!!

It has been a muscle relaxer as well. I'm a patient at the Veterans Hospital and keep all medical records years ago the pharmacy printout did list it as a muscle relaxer and the common usages anxiety, panic disorder toname a few. It has also helped with solid sleed. I continue even aftert he recommended tiem of usage with out side effects that are needing to be reported. I do have a dependacy but addiction the two are different in major ways. i hav e had to try up to 14 different med's during repeated tapers that I consented to, but the side effects in comparision were not tolerable by me. Still on xanax and achieving some relief from nerve pain which resulted in less anxiety.

I finally am panic free ONLY after recieving intense cognitive behavior therapy. I use them only every great once in awhile when Im having trouble sleeping due to anxiety. You get used to the dosage right away and need to increase to feel any effect. I think its easy to get addicted so don't increase your dosages! Just use them only when absolutely neccesary.

They really know about mind, and It&#180;s functions, and how to woork whit emotions. Preferible Tibetan budist tradition.Good Luck ! :)
Panic Disorder	roxie56, 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4		45-54	2/24/2010 12:59:04 PM	i took a variety of anti depressants for my panic attacks and they only seemed to make the symptoms worse.My doctor was hesitant to start me on Xanax due to it's habit forming nature but we both knew i had to try something as i was almost bedfast and had lost quite abit of weight. I also started therapy and for a while was panic free. i still keep them on hand as I still do have periods of anxiety and they do relax me enough to stop and take a deep breath and get over the attack.i can also use them at work and still function and be able to stay at work if I do have a panic attack in public. I try to only use the xanax when i am out of control and feel it is better going on with life miserable and out of control and sometimes not able to function at all.

However it is also very highly addictive and caution should be used when taking this medication. Not taking this medication can be a problem and taking this medication can also be a problem. I do not have an answer, I know this drug when taken as directed works and works well to stabilize the mood swings that are associated with Bi-polar and PTSD. How do you prescribe this type of medication so that the patient can remain safe? Do you have someone else give the medication to the patient on a daily basis if the patient has an addiction problem as well as the above two diagnoses..

I was short of breath, my heart was racing, I felt like I had to do something or something really bad would happen but I didnt know what.  It was so scarey.  I took a half a .25 xanax that night and I felt calm  Not drugged, not drowsy but in control.  Since then I have taken it PRN and sometimes I take .25 if I cant sleep because my brain wont stop racing I sometimes will take a .50 (which is what my scrip is for) This pill has also helped me stay calm in groups of people that I used to avoid such as parties and meetings because of the anxiety I have  It has changed my life in a positive manner.

Xanax works immedately for me and 60 pills lasted me 7 months. I take the .5mg dosage. I have had no problems with addiction and only take it when I need it. It has saved me from choking and freaking out in front of alot of people. Like if Im late to a college class and people stare at me, I start having an attack, but I always have xanax with me. I do not take on a regular basis and have had no problems with resistance. Doctors get skepical of me though when re-perscriping because I am not a &quot;serious case.&quot; They have put me on cleaner less addicting benzos but they don't have the immedate effect I need because I don't take them everyday.

It is however impossible to suppress anxiety with Xanax alone. You MUST be willing to redirect your anxious behaviors and thoughts. Xanax works extraordinarily well for me. But if you let your thoughts take over, you can easily override its effects.My main time I use Xanax is to combat the nervousness of a long morning commute to school. I take one (1), (.5mg) pill in the morning and I am okay for the day. I can like I said, override its effects if I am bent on concentrating on my nervousness. I have taken this medicine (NOT regularly; as needed), for nearly 3 years now. There are no lasting side effects for me. I don't drink alcohol so I don't know the medicine would interact (Its not recommended). I do not feel dizzy which is the most common side effect and if I am really uptight before bedtime, Xanax allows me to mellow out and have a good night's sleep. Overall I am very satisfied with the results of this medicine.

Also, my blood pressure is up so rather than take blood pressure meds, I am taking .05 but have only had to take it during the day two times.  It does help me to fall asleep but I have been taking it for two months and I think I need to take it at least 30 minutes before I plan on going to bed so it will work better.  I have read some of the reviews and hope you are all doing well - where it can be habit forming, just make sure that before your meds get too low, you make an appointment with your doctor to get them refilled.  And always get a second opinion - that is your right!!

Panic Disorder	Relieved, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	2/13/2010 10:04:45 AM	These reviews helped as much as the medication!  I'm so happy to not feel alone anymore. Panic attacks are frightening and the 'fixation' on one aspect, such as breathing, heartbeat, etc. really adds to the problem.  I also find I get scared that I will always be 'that way' (stuck in an attack that will never end)...possibly losing my mind.  It is horrible.  I started by taking 1/2 of a .25mg and in less than ten minutes...relief!  I use it as needed, but for some reason am reluctant, if not outright afraid, to ask my doctor for/about daily treatment to keep a more calm level daily instead of reacting when something happens.  I guess its the stigma, feeling less like the 'strong' adult male I should be and feeling more 'weak' and not able to handle life like a normal person.  I also worry, what if it doesn't work?  Sometimes during the attack I am afraid to take it because what would I do if it didn't work?  That's where the 'stuck there forever' anxiety comes from I believe. One good thing about this medication is how fast it works.  I know what I am going to write next might be part of a psychological placebo effect, but, as soon as I take that little half pill, the panic attack lessens.  I mean instantly.  And the thought of having them in the cabinet alone sometimes helps.  I tell myself 'well, I'll just take a pill' and sometimes I feel good enough just with that thought that I don't need it right at that time, if at all.  I keep two in my wallet and two in the car - and I laugh at myself over that, but, it helps.  If you are reading this, I hope it helped.  Stay healthy, keep positive and use your faith in whatever form it may take. Oh, and take the pill already!
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/12/2010 10:20:33 PM	I keep one with me at all times. We call it the &quot;Public Safety&quot; pill. I try not to take it if I don't have to. I am prescribed to take it for sleep, but to save them I take Melatonin at night for sleep. I have learned not to tell anyone that I have them, because I had an ex steal them from me. My Dr. didn't believe me at first so be very careful with your prescriptions. I have known people that have died from overdose on Xanax, so don't believe the reviews that say they are safe to take in large quantities. It is to be used for relief not for a high!!!

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Kyllein, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	2/5/2010 5:56:41 PM	I have used Xanax for a long time, and it has always worked for me.  I suffer from Chronic Pain, and sleep is something that is frequently difficult to obtain, since the discomfort levels keep me from relaxing enough to get the rest I need.  Over the years, I've gone from 1/4mg to 1mg per use; so yes, over time the amount needed increases.  Still, it lets me sleep without the muzziness that pure sleep-aids cause in the morning.  It also is useful when I get tense, since that can cause muscles to cramp in my back (damaged spine and cord), so it's helpful in that manner although it is not a muscle relaxant per se.  I've found it's wisest to take the smallest dose that will do the job, since over time it will need to be increased; and the smallest increase is always the best.

Panic Disorder	87_blueangel, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	2/3/2010 6:45:53 AM	I started having panic attacks at age 20 (although I didn't know that is what they were. All I knew that even when I was completely happy and relaxed, reading a good book or listening to music, my heart would start racing and I would be gulping for oxygen. As time passed, the attacks became more frequent and more severe. Many times I called for an ambulance because I was sure I was having a heart attack. I continually went to family doctors and they provided no advice. Never thought of going to a psychiatrist. Since the general M.D.'s offered no help, ended up self medicating with alcohol. Which only made matters worse. I got very lucky and ran across an ad looking for volunteers suffering from anxiety to try a new medication. After months of testing, the new medication did nothing for me. The psychiatrist running the test, gave me a book to read about anxiety w/ panic attacks, and put me on Xanax. Wow! I have taken it for about 25 years. Quit drinking because I no longer needed to try to heal myself. I was amazed to find out that people become addicted to it. To me it was no more than taking a vitamin pill. Didn't make me feel drozy or anything, just stopped the constant flow of adrenelin. Saved my life.

I put my faith on it that I would get better, especially having a two month old baby that depended on me. 2 weeks later after the doctor said it should start working I was prescribed different types of medications that varied. I fell in bed three months with a deep depression, no sleep, my husband brought me to my mother's house to care for my child and myself. With my Mothers help along with my husbands I visited a doctor who prescribed Xanax 1.0mg three times a day and I'll never forget the day that I finally hugged my son, carried him and caught a good night sleep. After five months later, I could finally go outside and play with my son and enjoy the daylight, I came back as myself never forgot the doctor visit, and thanks to this medicine and God, im here today telling my story. My previous doctors were just using me as a lab rat. The doctor I visited after my 3 month ordeal saved my life.

Anxious	American, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/16/2010 11:35:53 AM	I have a very stressful job. I am a firefighter and see very disturbing things at work. Not to mention i am put in very stressful sitations almost every shift.At work one day started having chest pains and difficulty breathing. Working at the fire station i told the guys to take me to the hospital. Scared the crap out of them because i told them i felt like i was gonna die, anyway, after every test known to man was done at the hospital, nothing was found and i was sent home. The next few days were fine and i thought it was a one time thing. Then one day out of the blue another panic attack hit me and fortunately my mom was over visiting and she had a Xanax with her for her anxiety attacks, i took one and within 15 mins i was feeling normal. I went to the doctor and said i want some xanax pills and she gave me a perscription and i have been using them since. This was about four years ago. I am 37 now. I could not imagine myself without them and i am one to avoid taking any medications. They have saved me numerous times, at work, home, out with the family, too many times to count. I stick with the .25 mg as needed. If you have panic attacks, have anxiety proplems, even just feeling anxious on a daily basis like i do this drug will change your life. Use it, dont abuse it and it will make you feel normal again and you can enjoy life. I hope this helps someone like it helped me. Anxiety almost ruined my life.

It doesn't say anything in the side effects part about that happening to anyone else but I notice it happens to me once in a while, so I'm not sure if it's the drug or something else that is causing that to happen. It would be helpful to me if anyone else out there experiences this possible side affect.

Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	1/15/2010 4:34:36 AM	I went through a series of extremely stressful and out of the ordinary situations about four and a half years ago.  I had already recovered quite nicely from PPD in the years before and hoped to never see another psychiatric drug in my life.  Too bad that wasn't in the cards for me.  My husband was diagnosed with a rare and typically fatal cancer and Hurricane Katrina hit our home town during the same month.  I couldn't handle the stresses of natural disaster and brain surgery.  I wasn't eating or sleeping properly and I have a daughter to care for.  My panic attacks became overwhelming and after a particularly emotional visit to the NICU, a nurse brought me to the ER and had me do a consult with the psychiatrist on call.  She prescribed .5mg of xanax twice a day.  I think I only used that much when my husband was under the knife but I don't know how else I could've handled the insane situation my family was thrown into.  Please don't be afraid of this medication because it has the potential to be abused.  Responsible drs are there for their patients and make sure everything is going smoothly.  I still need it for my panic attacks, which now are rare, due to therapy and a great support system, but I know there are difficult times around the corner and I will not try to cope with them alone.  The stress on me and my daughter is simply not worth my apprehension about doctor's appts.  Good luck to all.

I scared my son to death one nite i had went into seizures and rolled out of the bed or he may not have known and i may not be here today. so if you take this drug for a long period of time don't take more than prescribed and run out.I was in the hospital for 4 day's and they said it was from xanax withdrawl.Be carefull with this drug and do not take more than you are prescribed and run out, and not tell your DR because you are scared they will take them away from you,i had 7 seizures beleive me it can happen to you.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	celestia, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/13/2010 7:11:36 PM	i have found out by taking xanax,it had helped me deal with everyday experiences without feeling anxiety to a point of calmness to where i could work with all problems involving with my job,my family, and give sound advise to others. my mind is clear and focused. i have had no side effects at all. i can feel when i am starting to feel uncomfortable so i know i should take my med before i have an attack of anxiety.i don't always have to take as many as prescribed because i know when it is a stressful day or not. although they say it is a possible habit forming, i believe that is up to you.i should take up to 4 a day if needed which i do at times but other times i can get by with 1.it has helped me get through some rough times,otherwise i wouldn't have been able to support my children and run my household. something as simple as going to the grocery store for food,and going through the check out isle was a chore.i'd have an axiety attack and leave everything on the counter and have to get out of the building.so embarrasing! i highly suggest this drug for anyone that has anxiety attacks as long as you respect it and use it as prescribed!i am able to do anything as far as being in public again including getting back into my music and being on stage again with confidence!the only other med i take is ibuprofen for my joints.i'm now 54 yrs old and doing great! i have taken xanax since 1992 and have you ever seen a recall on this med? compared to all the newer meds that has came out to help us?
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	bonuswoman, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/13/2010 4:15:38 PM	THroughout my entire life (57 years) I have had true insomnia (even as a child according to my mother).  My doctor recently prescribed xanax and trazadone together for my sleep disorder.  That was a week and two days ago.  Since then I have slept 8-10 hours each night.  It is important to select a bedtime and take the medications an hour prior to wanting to sleep.  I feel refreshed when I wake up, instead of wishing I had more sleep.  I only take the medications at night and hope to have continued success.  Hope this helps someone.  Good luck.

Panic Disorder	Steadman, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	25-34	1/12/2010 8:40:48 PM	Xanax works too well. It works so well and made me feel so calm that I soon couldn't function without it and quickly became addicted. Took several overdoses (60mg) plus 300mg of Valium and still did not die, so guess it is fairly safe in overdoses. Don't take it if you're depressed or have a history of substance abuse. Sure it makes you feel good and chilled out. But then again so does heroin.

I've seen this drug abused and it's a sad, sad thing. I stopped taking it when I became pregnant and have not gone back on it, although I know I need to. I get so anxious to the point that I can't focus on anything (both visually and mentally) and it takes a while for me to calm down and see the situation for what it really is. Overall, it has helped me.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	kmpqvz, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	1/8/2010 11:13:30 AM	I was prescribed Xanax over a year ago for panic attacks on airplanes.  Also, was prescribed Propranolol.  So now I take .5 Xanax and Propoanolol 30 min before the plane takes off.  I'm fine.  Sometimes I need another 0.25 Xanax during turbulence or on decent.  I had a very scary flight experience 8-9 years ago and never got past it.  I have occasionally used the Xanax to reduce my anxiety at other times too.  Be careful since an overdose can be a significant issue.  Xanax doesn't work for me as a long term solution for generalized anxiety disorder since its half life is so short - I'm using Lexapro for that - 20 mg daily.  It seems to work.  I also have Ambien at night - when needed.  All this was not prescribed by my doctor, I saw a psychiatrist.  The only concern I have is the Ambien - when I don't take it I can wake up several times during the night - no big deal though.  When I do take it, I don't wake up until morning.  I'd like to reduce my usage, but I'm being careful to ensure that I get adequate sleep.  That really seems to help my mood.  Along with regular exercise - dopamine.

I think everyone with a panic disorder should get a lifetime prescription.when having panic attacks my heart would pound so fast, I have vomited in stores,I didn't even want to go outside to check the mail box until I was put on this drug I've tried adavan valium &amp; clonipin. But xanax works very fast. I couldn't feel the 25mg or the halfmg I had a massive panic attack in my doctors office, when I had an appointment, He thought I was having a heart attack and put me on the EKG machine. I explained to him what was happening so he put me on 1mg 4 times daily. I feel normal.It is a very calming relaxed feeling so now I can take care of my business, I used to wouldn't even answer a telephone.I recommend this drug for panic attacks,anxiety and if it's hard to be in social situations....

Unfortunately, one side effect is insomnia- after 3 weeks of about 4 hours of sleep a night my Dr. prescribed Xanex. I usually take 1mg between 10:30 and 11pm and have woken up at 4am every morning- 1 extra hour hardly seems worth it.

I am getting much worse in my condition now.  everyone around me has noticed it.  My neuro/pyhsic now wants me to seek deep theraphy.  He is the one who has put me on many seizer/migraine med's. I do not think he knows what to do anymore or what is really wrong.  He is a very well known Dr. at one of the top N.Y.C.teaching hospitals.  Even his staff are questioning him.  I have been under his care for 5yrs and his personality has ghanged along with his fame.  His boss, who has treated me as well has the same attitude.  He is the go see guy for epilepsy and seizers. Patients from all over the U.S., Canada and other countries come to the center.  Many Dr.'s from the center proficient in the field have left the center to join other great N.Y.C Hospitals because the powers that be do not want to see past their nose (field). Xanax has hurt me terribly along with the other 20 med's I am on for other conditions.  Finally I am getting to the bottom of my illness's and I am putting them all together myself with the help of some new Dr.'s --Please everyone stay awy from this drug and run the other way when a physician wants to keep on increasing your dose and remaining you on this drug for more then 6-8 months.  Thank you

I was originally given the medication because I had a sever heart attack a year ago which left 50 to 60% damage. At least with the combination of medications I am on i can function with a clear head.

I have had experiences with Ativan and Klonopin as well (in the same class of meds.) Xanax seems to be the best for real panic with &quot;I'm going to die or kill right now.&quot; I still have a good result everytime even though I have been taking it at least once daily for about 5 years. I recommend it for those with panic...with those whom think they are having a stroke in the middle of the night...not those that social anxiety, anger problems, etc.

I try to take the lowest amount possible.  Lately I feel like I may have to take a stronger dose so I will be talking to my doctor.  I ran out one weekend and went into withdrawls.  I will never do that again!

I lost my job and insurance and couldn't afford to get my meds and/or go see my doc. A friend said they knew where to get the Xanax but that they didn't know who would sell anti-depressants.  So, I figured I could just try the xanax by themselves. Now I feel like I have to have them and if I don't then I am freaking out. Any advice on how to maybe ween myself off of them.  I have been taking what they call bars? I think they are 2 mgs.  I only take like half a day.  This as been going on since February 2009(approx. 10-11 months)  Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

My sister started on it 1st &amp; kept having to take more &amp; more to be as effective.  Also have an uncle on it &amp; his dosage has become very high as well. I ended up relying on it to fall asleep &amp; would have a hard time waking up.  I'm glad it's no longer in our house!

I went from being a crazy basketcase to being able to get through my days with a sense of easy. I now take 2mg 2-3 times a day. That along with my antidepressants has semmed to do the trick or at least take the edge off. I would like to eventually get on the extended release vaiety so I can cut back on amount I take during the day. Be sure to have your doctor monitor you carefully so that you know if uou should decrese or increase the amount your on. Best of luck!!!

I've been able to reconnect with the world and with people again thanks to Xanax.  I take a 1mg dosage once a day, with 60mg of Cymbalta. Sometimes 2mg if my attacks are intense or continue. There are virtually no side effects that I have yet noticed.  I've taken just Cymbalta by itself off and on for years, but have never had the results I do with the combination. My only warning is to be extremely careful with alcohol when taking Xanax, even a just a few drinks can be much, too much.

First .5 mg worked to get me to sleep, then 1 mg then 2mg...see the problem!I became addicted to the drug and ordered it illegally and easily over the Internet. After 6+ years I had enough. Quitting was extremely hard, I had to very slowly ween myself and deal with muscle twiches, insomnia and irratibility. Finally I got the guts to ask for help. My doc. put me on Trazadone which assists with insomnia and depression. I feel so free now that I am off the drug. I will never be able to take it or Valium again due to the addiction issues. Please be careful!

It has been a God send. I no longer fear having apanic attack and am able to do so many things that for years I wouldn't even dream of. I am sure if you take more than is prescribed it could become addictive but I am always very careful to only take it when I need to.

Its always best to take the minimum that works for you at the time and that can vary.I never leave home without it in my pocket.It eases anxiety and nervous feelings and works great. Learn what your body needs and some days you will need more. The docs are stingy with this drug so you have to store some like a squirrel. If I have a rough day I might have to take extra maybe 50% more on a given day. Most docs realize this is habit forming and slow to give it out. Most days I can get by with a total of 1 mg but some days needs more. Some people take 4 times this much so the dosage varies a lot.

After 3 months my doctor increased my dosage from .5mg 2x a day to .5 3x a day. It wasn't but about 3months later &amp; he changend my dosage from .5 to 1mg 3 x a day &amp; to start w/they worked great for my anxiety. Now here we are almost 3.5 yrs later and they are no longer doing for me the what they use to! in ct of this year 2009 i have been hospitalized twice for anxiety/panic disorder or @ the time they thought I was having a heart attack and after many tests they advised me &amp; my doctor that my anxiety meds needed to be adjusted! well here we are Dec 2009 and all my doc can say is because of the DEA his hands are pretty much tied &amp; he cannot write any stronger or anymore than what he is writing! He also says that he cannot wrie refills which I found out is a lie because my husband's Dr writes him 5 refills when he sees him! So here's my ?'s... is he just saying this because I have no insurance and I am a cash patience or is it because I don't have medicaid &amp; he cannot &quot;bleed&quot; medicaid dry?? Does he really care or is he just an egotistical a*s that like stringing his patients along? The Dr's @ the hospital when I was admitted said that I need to find me a new doctor!! So any fedback on what to do would B highly appreciated!!  Sincerely,   Insight=Needed badly

This medication works great for anxiety, once you have had the attack.  My doctor has put me on many different types of anti-anxiety, bi-polar and depression medication and the only thing that truly makes me feel 100% better is Xanax.  The only problem is that doctors do not like prescribing this medication anymore due to it being addictive.  I wish so many people did not abuse this drug so that people like myself who need it would be able to stay on it.

I then was put on effexor and tapered down to none with in4 months. I took as directed and only that way. I went off effexor and I am having withdraw symptoms and they put me on zanax again this time at full strength, 1 mg x3 s day and it is helping with withdrawl so far I will let u know as the days go on. I am scared of being addicted to this at such a high dose but we shall see. Last time it was not a problem at .5 mg every 6 hrs and I did not get addicted.

I am agoraphobic and without Xanax I could not leave my house.  I have taken it for many, many years.  It has given me a normal life.  Something I would not have had without it.I start out by taking 6mg per day.  Which is a very large amount.  As time went on and I had fewer and fewer panic attacks.  My dosage has gone down.  I now take 2 mg at night before bed.Yes, this drug is addicting and you have to be very careful not to abuse it.  But, for those of use who could not live a normal life with out it.  It is a life saver.

I take anywhere between 1/2 to 1 mg 1 1/2 hr before I sleep and a natural sleep aid (consulted my dr) 30 min before bed. I'm hoping I wont have to stay on this for a long period of time but for now it helps.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	zephyress, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/22/2009 5:59:14 PM	I read the first 75 reviews here, and most of them are similar to my story.  Some of you may have a similar story to mine. Here is my story...I have been on .25 ml xanax for about 8 years, usually only taking half at a time. BUT only averaging about 1 pill ONCE a week because I was only dealing w/ stress from my job, n stress from divorce with a newborn (13 yrs ago), n had most difficulty during the &quot;depressing&quot; winters.  I've been living with my senior parents since, and have had my casino waitress job for 18 yrs.NOW, suddenly my life completely changed.  I now have a young teen boy, who is a great kid. I recently lost my 18-yr job, still living w parents.  My job was my only stability.  I also recently lost my 13-yr-old dog, who went thru all my stress and problems w/ me... I'm definitely feeling grief and family loss. I recently graduated from Med Assisting school (since I lost my job) and cannot find a job, its been 6 months.  I stressed over getting all A's, which I did. And I stressed over getting an A on the National test.  My father also had a massive heart attack same time as my test - he miraculously survived, and living with him makes me worry about him more than usual.  There's a few more drastic changes in my life this past year.  Which brings me to my point - for the past 6 months i have experienced the extreme anxiety disorder symptoms: heavy n crampy chest, sharp pains in my left chest, tingles, fear, cannot breath, more fear, lots of tremors, extreme chills, heart palpitations and pounding heart that is constant all day.  These symptoms started out to average 2-3 /week. NOW suddenly this week its been constant all day every day, and I live in FEAR. This altered my life completely in one week. I even fear taking xanax more than Im used to. I also feel &quot;seizur-ic&quot; AT times.  In ER few times 6 mo ago and heart/lungs checked.  I now fear that THIS IS MY LIFE... FEAR n Anxiety constantly all day everyday n takin xanax more. WIll I EVER GET BETTER

It does help ease my depression, and it stops me from the crying spells over the lost of my parents so soon and the depression with problems with dealing with problems when grandkids get real sick, I don;t panic as muc h as I did. I sleep better, I do not wake up every hour on the hour.I dont have the night mares I used to have,I feel somewhat whole again.

It helped me sleep ok but effectiveness diminished over time.  At one point my doctor (who later lost his medical liscense) also prescribed Ativan to be taken AT THE SAME TIME.  This caused a severe manic episode, I was out driving in the middle of the night, got pulled over by police on suspicion of DUI.  The first time I withdrew without weaning off gradually I could not stop vomiting.  Also, if you have this drug in your home, be careful who you tell; there is a substantial street value and had my prescriptions stolen at least 3 times by so-called friends of my teenagers.  I finally weaned myself off once and for all about 5 years ago; however, I miss the ability to sleep since I now suffer from fibromyalgia and could use Xanax for sleep, but I don't want to go thru the addiction and withdrawel again.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/17/2009 7:52:41 AM	I recently lost ,y job, my son started school and I went back to school myself. With all the stressI have going on in my life, I started having severe abxiety/panic attacks. For a week straight I couldn't get out of bed, eat , drink, do anything. Finally after 3 trips to the doctor (with no insurance) and 4 meds later, I have finally gotten something that works. I can go to school now, I can do anything. Panic attacks are the most horrible feeling in the world and this has saved my life. My doc doesnt like prescribing this type of med so he only gave me 2 months worth... I sure hope he doesn't take me off of it becausde I do not want to go back to that downward spiral. The only issue I have is that I am tired a lot, but at least it helps me to sleep better at night.

I take it as need maybe a few times a week. Sometimes I have to take 2 a day others just one a day. I am also on other medication like Paxil Cr, geodon, and neurontin. I also take lunesta 3 mg at bedtime. I am currently weaning off the neurontin.

The only problem I see with this drug is if you run out.  I am on 2MG stick Xanax.  I ran out a couple of times when my doctor was out of town and I had a seizure.  The last time I had three seizures before the EMT staff could get me transported to the ER.  So if you are on large doses of this medication, like I am on 5 a day, do not come off of this medication suddenly.  They do not put this warning on the bottle, but it is a possible danger if you do not come off of the medication slowly.  I hope this helps others taking this medication.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Starburst, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/14/2009 1:09:00 AM	I have taken this medicine for apprx 10 + years. It not only helps with my panic attacks, my over anxiety, my sleep, irritibility is less, depression is less, also I have had less occurance of ulcers and other issues related to IBD. It helps me in soo many ways. I have also found that when my tolerance is getting to high we switch to Valium to give my body time to reduce its tolerance while still being able to continue with a medicine that also helps. When my tolerance to that grows we switch back. I love this medicine also because it is not something that has to build in your system for weeks to work. Yes, it should be taken for preventitive measures, but it does not have to be taken if it is not needed. Of course each situation is differnt. This is one of my meds that help me the most in many areas. It has saved me from many undesirable situations. But KNOW it doesn't do it a lone. I take an active role in implamenting many other learned techniques too. It only makes it to where they are within my control (with some work)and that is all I need to give what I am learning to do myself a chance to be practiced! Thanks for creating an aid to help me gain control over a lot of my issues!
Panic Disorder	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	11/12/2009 6:28:17 PM	This is a great medication for the panic attacks i've had for over 20 yrs. You do have to be careful at higher doses, like the 2mg. Ijust don't understand why it is harder to get a prescription than it was 10-15 yrs ago. So when i do i make sure i wait until it's needed bad. Be careful at higher doses start at .5mg see how it treats you.

I was first prescribed .25mg of xanax 2 years ago and have since upped the dosage to .5mg. The smaller dosage didn't really help that much, but when i moved to .5mg I really noticed a difference. The main point I want to make is that while xanax does help if you feel a panic attack coming on, or if you are in a situation you are nervous about, but it DOES NOT prevent panic attacks from occuring. It is a tranquilizer. I am going back to my doctor to see about getting on an antidepressant that is used for panic. I will, however, continue taking xanax as needed. I am a little concerned about addiction to xanax, but I feel that a doctor can help ween you off. Hope this helps.

It works great within 15 minutes or so.  I am terrified of the descriptions I've seen on this site by other people about the withdrawal aspect.  My doctor assures me that .25 mg. is a low dose.  He said that it will not deposit in the liver, causing liver problems.  Whom do I believe?  It is a great drug.  I was suffering from crying spells daily and continuous anxiety/obsessive thoughts about work and my situation in life.

Although It was hard when I stopped taking it, this drug did work wonders for me. I felt like I could live a &quot;normal&quot; life without feeling anxious all the time. Anyways, I hope this helps whoever is ready this. :)
Anxious	PaulCarbo99, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	25-34	11/2/2009 12:43:41 AM	I struggle from why my shrink called a mixture of anxiety issues ranging from general to social anxiety disorder.  This medicine has been a life/job saver for me.  Instead of getting so irritable. I'm able to take a step back and put the whole situation into perspective and realize that most of of the times things I stress over are not that serious.  I'm currently prescribed 3mg xr 2X daily, and 1mg regular to use as needed. Even though I take it as prescribed, memory loss is a big side effect for me.  I take a camera everywhere I go and it helps me jog my memory.  There was an epsidode where I actually had surgery on my knee and somehow lost/or someone stole my medicine.  I had an appointment two weeks later for my shrink.  I thought I would be okay not taking the medication.   Bad call.  I made it two days before having severe panic attacks. After trying to fight this for another five days I couldn't take it anymore.  I went to see my primary care physician who gave me enough to last me until my doctors appt. After then I did some research I came to find out if you're not winded of the medication over time you could have a seizure or even die.  So overall when I take my meds as needed, I'm a well balanced easy to get along with individual, the way I should be.  My point is do NOT try and just stop taking your meds.  Consult your doctor if you do wish to get off them so you both can set up a plan to wean you off.  Before I finish some side effects I felt were withdrawal feeling which mainly were I was extremely irritable, I felt creepy crawly over my skin.  Whenever I spoke on the phone It was like I could hear amplified which frustrated me more.  Also whenever someone as much as rubbed me the creepy crawly feeling was intensified and I was quick to yell and tell the person (ex) to get away from me even though I cared about them and wanted them.  I hope this helps someone and you don't make the same mistakes that I did.  I wouldn't wish that on anyone!

Anxiousness associated with Depression	packgoat, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		10/30/2009 3:29:37 PM	After taking 0.25 mg Xanax only as needed (1 to 4 times a week) for over 10 years I found that when another drug was proscribed because I had increased problems with depression, and I stopped taking the Xanax, I had almost no withdrawal symptoms.  After trying 4 different antidepressants, none of which were effective and/or had some side effects, I have now gone back to .25mg twice a day and have found my peace of mind again.

I could not under- stand why I could not get passed this. I was prescribed Xanax and it began to help tremendously. I could go out it public, attend social events. It motivated me to get in shape. I was then referred to a new doctor. We reached a range that was perfect. I was amazed at my accomplishments  My whole life changed. I was able to sleep, and do things that had been simply tossed aside. My husband and Children has also benefited from my emotional well being. Thanks to xanax I am living the life God gave me to live.

DO NOT take this drug is you are in a bad mood. It made me literally want to kill myself. If i could sue the manufacturer of this drug i would. It is the worse drug around. It is supposed to cure anxiousness not make you depressed and psycho. I couldnt even talk, slurred speech, crying and suicidal. PLEASE take this drug off the market NOW!!!! doctors should never prescribe this...

I almost wrecked my car on the highway but i was so nonchalant about it. somehow i got home. i woke up and found myself lying sideways on my bed. i retraced my foot steps and my keys were in the living room along with a path of clothing and my front door was slightly ajar. I ended up having an affair with benzos for a few months til i smashed thru a mailbox cuz i passed out at the wheel. In short, Xanax is fun, but don't abuse it like i did or you will wake up one day and realize you burnt a lot of bridges and left a path of destruction in your wake. After all, it is an opiate, and so is Heroin.

Involuntary Quivering		3	5	1			10/10/2009 2:44:26 AM	i believe my daughter, age 21, maybe abusing this drug. (a highly addictive drug) this may have been prescribed for a tremor and/or anxiety. i'm so discouraged by the limited info available on this sight. abuse of prescription drugs is SO prevelent in our society! Partly due to over prescribing by MD.  There was no info related to signs/behaviors to look for and only minimal discussion of potential of addiction.  i would sure like to hear others experiences.

I feel like I am gonna lose it.  I take a pill, it works for a couple hours, then I start to withdraw and have to wait for a few more hours for my next pill while suffering with crippling anxiety.  Have been on low dose of 1 mg for a year and now up to 1.5 and am completely addicted.  I don't know where the line between my legitimate anxiety and my withdrawal symptoms lies.  I hate this drug.  I think I need something else and a higher dose but am terrified of becoming even more addicted.  I have heard that benzo withdrawals can CAUSE anxiety and can last for YEARS.  Only take as needed, not every day, or you, to will feel like you are fighting a losing battle.  I am depressed and wake in the mornign with a horrible sense of dread.  I often cry every morning.  I do not think I am on a therapeutic dose of this drug at all.

I also have GAD, and Bipolar Disorder, which I take other medications for controling it. This medication has been a God sent to me.!

If I felt I needed help during the day I only took half of the .5mg. I have tried four to five other medicines and nothing else has compared. I no longer need to take it every day, but I know it's there on the occasion when I do neet it!

My attacks are so severe that I cannot breathe, I get numb from head to toe, I vomit and my muscles give out on me.I have been on Xanax for several years now and am prescribed .5 Mg 3 times a day. I only take 1/2 once a day, sometimes twice ONLY as needed, so somedays I dont take it at all. I cannot say enough about how much Xanax has helped me. Addictive or not, all I can say is that my dose has never been increased and I only take it as needed. I have suffered no short term memory loss. I am a single mother of 2 teenage daughters and they are extremely understanding of my condition. I do have to see my Dr every 3 months to get a new prescription, but it is well worth living life to its fullest (and much cheaper than a trip to the ER). I feel alive and under control and able to enjoy the simplest things without jumping out of my skin everytime I see a black truck or someone covers my eyes or taps me on the shoulder. Thanks to my Dr. for giving me my life back, my kids thank him too. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/24/2009 1:38:28 AM	I only used Xanex when I have suffered a long insomnia trip, which can last up to 4 days some weeks. I am a plus size woman. I can take half of one pill, and be out within 15-20 minutes. I sleep deep, well, and I do not wake up with any &quot;drug like hangover&quot; the next day. If you are seeking something to really relax, and rejuvinate you for the next day, ask your doctor about Xanex!

My pills are 0.5 mg,many times only a half pill is enough to help.If I didn't have this med I don't think i'd be alive.My dr too has said she wants me off this med,so I'm considering seeing a phy Dr.Those of us who get anxiety can't help it,we didn't ask to have it.I've tried to tell people if you've ever had a P.A. it's pure hell and cruel.Also..not everyone who gets depression has P.A.

The bad news about Xanax is that it is very addictive. After a few months, your body will want more and if you increase your dosage, you get really hooked.  Be careful and be very disciplined when taking this medication.  If at all possible, do NOT increase the dosage.

Now and then, I would take one for anxiety.  Lately, I've been depressed and feeling so anxious - it's been horrible.  And since I quit smoking 4 years ago, I never slept well - maybe 4 or 5 hours a night.  Well - this week has been a very stressful work week.  And I've been going home acting like a monster to my 9 year old and hubby.  I felt so overwhelmed with anxiety, that I took one.  I actually slept for 8 hours straight!  I was amazed; woke up feeling great.  I'm not a huge advocate of meds - personally, I hate taking medication for anything.  But, I'm realizing that I truly need this medication.  I'm starting to change life and I can get so filled with anxiety that the little stuff becomes HUGE to me.  I will start taking 2 tablets as directed.  I'm seeing my doctor today so he can prescibe more of these to me.  This medication truly is great.  Maybe it will eventually help with my depression as well.

I take it at night only when my legs are really bothering me.  It takes the edge off the need to move enough for me to get some sleep.

It was almost like a phobia. My therapist wanted me on Xanax when I couldn't calm down. I was put on the lowest dose possible (.25 mg) and it kicked in within about 20 minutes. It's great for short term use with the help of a therapist, but you have to come off of it slowly. You also shouldn't stay on it for more than 3 weeks as it can become addictive. I yawned a lot within the first 2 days of taking it, but was otherwise fine in terms of drowsiness. The only other problem that I've had is that it's caused me to start my period halfway through my packet of birth control.

I never had anything like this before using Xanax. It has gotten worse every night so I will see my Dr and ask him to put me back on Lexapro which worked good for me.  I had several personal family emergencies and my Dr elevated me to this drug as my anxiety got worse but it is not worth it to me to have these horrible nightmares.  FYI - I do not watch horror flicks or bloody movies so do no attribute it to anything I might have been watching prior to going to sleep.

Takes the edge off of anything. Only drawback is they cause drowsiness (cannot mix w/ alcohol either). I am on .05mg and have been for years, some days I take one tablet other days I skip - just really use it for bad days. I am very cautious about taking more than prescribed as I know it is addictive.

Anxiousness associated with Depression	carrod, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/23/2009 2:25:59 AM	I was prescribed xanax a long time ago for twitching in both of my eyelids that had lasted for 3 months before I sought medical help.  I was unable to walk into public places, get up in front of people without panic attacks.  This drug has given me a new release on life.  I was also unable to calm my brain at night until taking this drug.  I understand the addiction of it but I only take it at night and if there is a rare occasion during the day that my anxiety level maybe tested.  I love this drug but do follow the doctors orders when taking it.  I can now go into public places without fear, and I am sleeping at night and my eyelids no longer twitch.

The campus doctor gave me ativan  and before I knew it I was buying xanax off the streets.  THIS DRUG IS EXTREMEMLY ADDICTIVE.  coming off this drug is the most painful thing ive ever expirenced.  if you need to take benzos STAY AWAY FROM XANAX. you will regret it.  there is no reason why 2mg bars should be given to anyone.  i am day 3 off xanax and this is my 4 time kicking it.  i feel like battery acid is running through my viens.  do not stop taking this with out weaning off, it's very painful and you will be completley disabled.  hope i detered someone from taking this drug

I was on Xanax for three years and was able to control my moods, in a way that I woukld never want again as Xanax immediate release takes 10 minutes to be totally calm.  By the time, I told my psychopharmacologist that this was not working as his secretary called in scripts, I was up to 2 bars plus 8 mg of Klonopin.  I take Valium now and since I do not have an addictive personality, I am fine. Be careful!!

I take .5mg before when I about to encounter these events and it has worked great. I like to thank who ever invented this drug.

Early on I turned to alcohol to relieve it but eventually became an alcoholic. I have been in recovery for almost seven years now and treated my anxiety with several different drugs, ie..paxil, effexor, lexapro,wellbutrin,etc.. but all had side effects and became less effective over time. I asked my Dr. about Xanax and he first prescribed the .5mg to take as needed. This was good but had to remember to take all the time. Now I take 2mg xr and it is wonderful. My life has changed dramatically for the better. I am very relaxed in all social/work situations and feel much more confident to speak out. It also has not increased my desire to drink. I just feel normal!

I cannot stay awake if I take the whole pill and i feel the effects into the next day. Take half a pill and it takes the edge off. Anything more than that, I sleep. ITs hard to shake the effects and honestly your body wants you to keep taking it. Dont take it longer than a month and try not to take it at all if you can get by without it.

And this past weekend we went camping and he forgot to take his pill and later that day he had a seizure. The doctor said it was caused from a withdraw of this medicine. So if you take it becareful not to miss a pill or just suddenly stop taking it because it can and more than likely will cause you to have a seizure.

I'm in the process of withdrawling from this medication and it's horrible! If you don't need it, don't take it! And if you DO need it, take it for under 1 month or you WILL regret it! I promise you!

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Old Timer, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	8/7/2009 11:21:10 PM	At first it was for Panic Attacks that I never knew what I had, these attacks are strange at first because you do not know what the is going on. But now I can easily tell if and when one is about to happen, which is not very often, I use Xanax more now for sleeping at night. It is difficult for me to turn my thoughts down, I do not wish to turn my brain off but to tune it down a little does help. I find Xanax easy to use and not addictive for me at least, I have been on drugs in the past so I cannot say that I never been addicted. But Xanax is inexpensive and easy to use, one a day at night at most, but sometimes I do take one just before a meeting. It helps me to focus, I do not get drowsy at all.

I tried it on and off for a year and it just didn't work.The Xanax brought me down so much that I was constantly tired, listless and really didn't care about anything. It took away the fiesty side of my personality. She recently switched me to Lexapro, so I'll see how that works.And let me say that Xanas does work great if taken once for an episode. My issues were when I was taking it consistently for 3 nights or more.

I found out that I was addicted when it was too late.  Thankfully, I had family who noticed me &quot;stoned&quot; and drugged without me realizing it.  IT WORKS TOO WELL!!!  When they say that it makes everything &quot;go away and you feel great&quot; so does heroin.  I had the most awful, painful withdrawls.  I have had multiple health problems since I came off of the Xanax.  I wouldn't let my worst enemy take Xanax.  BE CAREFUL!!!! ***(NOTE: I have NEVER been addicted to anything before.  This was not in my usual character to abuse medication. BE AWARE!!!)****

Panic Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	7/22/2009 9:23:33 AM	I was diagnosed w/Generalized Anxiety Disorder(GAD) yrs ago. I have been taking buspar for that for years now. But i have been getting worse Anxiety/ panic attacks due to increased stressful situations in my life recently. Doc prescribed the Xanax because i had terrible symptoms, chest pains, feeling like i couldnt breath, bad restlesness, mood swings, tingling in limbs &amp; in my jaws. This medicine has seemed to help me somewhat. i only take it if i have these bad feelings and cannot control them on my own. so i dont take it everyday. I take one when i feel like i need it when im feeling in a bad way. I worry about the addiction. The only thing ive noticed as far as side effects are it makes me feel very &quot;woozy&quot; like someone else said like they have a &quot;buzz&quot; from drinking. and it does relax me but then my limbs feel somewhat rubbery for awhile also. This does pass but i dont like the feelings because i have 2 young children to take care of so i have to be very cautious when picking up the baby etc until these feeling pass. the tired feeling also doesnt help when i dont get much sleep due to having a baby. but all in all it does seem to have helped me.

I take it prn, when I need it, and it certainly does the trick.  Told a friend who is a doc and she agrees she writes alot of perscriptions for it.  They should put it in the water!!!!! It smooths everything over and makes thinking clear. Did anyone ever think of giving Xanax to all of our world enemies??? I believe that if it were handed out we would have the possibility of living in world peace.

It has worked very well for my anxiety and panic attacks. I haven't had a panic attack in years, but still deal with a little anxiety. I can go out in public and socialize a lot better than I used to and not stay closed up in the house all day. But if I don't take it on time, I get that &quot;something's not right&quot; paranoid feeling....I get dizziness, a tightness between my eyes and my throat feels like it's closing up and it gets harder to breathe. I become highly sensitive to light and sound. I couldn't function without it, but I don't like being addicted to it.

I no longer wake up during the night restless. However  Xanax is very addicting. I have tried to go off it but the withdrawl symptoms, lack of sleep (did not sleep for 3 days), headaches, nausea are brutal.

I take the alprazolam 0.5mg tablet at night (when needed), but for some reason it seems to leave an aftertaste in my mouth that is so gross it sometimes makes me gag. Now when I take it I try to get it down so fast that only the back of my throat is touched by it, but no matter how fast I try to take it I always wind up with that nasty taste in my mouth. Thankfully my doctor gave me the Zoloft as well, and now I only take the Xanax when I absolutely have to (which is not very often now). I definitely think this medication was very helpful for me, and I recommend it to anyone who needs it.

For as long as a can remember I have been a nervous person. My temper was so bad I could hardley stand myself I threatend to quit my job on a daily basis. After using xanax [0.5mg 2x a day] I feel soooo much better. Now if I get angry about something I am over it in 5 minutes instead of 2 weeks. I sleep better and Im just a happier nicer person. I beeen taking xanax for almost a year and have had no side effects

The withdrawl symptoms of just being on .5mg 3x a day after 6 months are terrible! Dont be fooled when people say you arent addicted to something that works and you need it, down the road it will affect you as it has me with other symtoms especially as you get older.

I actually lowered my dose and wont take two a day only for severe episodes like a bipoler episode. Its easy to like the relaxation but eventually the pain of having to one day be taken off for any reason keeps me grounded. I promise its gonna hurt the withdrawl one day! stay on a low dose and try to find something other than benzo's to help your urges. I am looking for my best regiman to take. I am so afraid of withdrawl it is sooooooooooo bad you wish you were dead when it kicks in...

Xanax helps me calm down and sleep. I only take it when needed, so sometimes I find myself taking one from an expired bottle. I can go for months without it, but when I start feeling nervous, anxious and confused, I need it. The best part is that it puts me to sleep within a half hour. What a blessing! When I feel crappy and anxious, sleep is the best thing for me. The long term side-effect is that my memory is shot. This does me no good when it comes time to take midterms &amp; finals at school. Luckily, the school accommodates for &quot;mental illness&quot; students and they provide tutors and extra time for testing. I have never gotten addicted, because I do not use it as directed. Use as needed and you will get good results from it.

My dosage is only .25 and only taken as needed.  It has helped me get through the attacks when I could not &quot;talk myself out of them&quot;, but does not eliminate them completely.  It gives me peace of mind to know that I have this medication for backup if needed.  I have not felt any negative side effects.  Very happy with it so far.

Xanex is the first and only rx Ive taken, and I cannot speak highly enough about the drug. It has helped me to manage my daily duties in an actual order now, calm me down in high levels of anxiety within 20 min of taking it, and lessened the occurance of my attacks by more than half. I am prescribed 3 1mg tabs daily, but only need 1 tab to get me through an entire day. Even with all of that said, I fear ever having to deal with becoming dependent on xanex or having withdrawals, because Ive heard so many bad things in regard to both.I think that because I only take 1 daily,I am excluded from those 2 issues..does anyone have any useful advice for me? Its greatly appreciated.
Panic Disorder	nancy neptune, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/3/2009 11:10:23 PM	I have had panic disorder for 18 years. Before there was Xanax, I was put on some very dreadful MAO inhibitors that made me unwell and did nothing. Less than a year later Xanax came out and it was a miracle. No more extreme fear and no more anorexia. I had attacks all day long so bad that I couldn't eat. I thought I had Pheochromocytosis, a bad disease of the adrenal glands. I was given a bunch of tests to make sure I didn't.I would not be alive today without Xanax, it has stopped the attacks and I've been on the same dosage for 15 years. .50 2x's a day.For all you people who keep harping on the fear of addiction, just stop it. You need it or you wouldn't be on it. Would you be worried that if you had to take blood pressure meds the rest of your life you'd be addicted? In a sense you are, you'd be taking a risk to stop them, and you need  them.So stop pulling your hair out about being a drug addict, you're not.

She lives alone and is still independant but I believe she is addicted to them. My mom is 70 years old and never even smoked cigarettes in her life. I found if not controlled they are addictive and the withdrawl is terrible and can induce seizures.

Also has a short life so you just take it when absolutely needed and the effects don't linger.  Too bad I can't take it all the time and long term to take the edge off!

Panic Disorder	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	6/20/2009 1:44:21 AM	While highly addictive I still think it's good results outweigh it's bad on me. In a sense, it is a magic pill for me as I know that if I take one as soon as the panic starts to rise I will only have to wait 25 to 35 minutes for the medication to start working. This has allowed me to leave my home, to drive, to go hiking, etc... In other words it has given me my life back. I do not take it 3 times a day. I only take it when I am confronted with a panic attack or severe anxiety. This way prevents me from getting addicted which would be very easy, believe me. You do get that alcohol-like buzz from xanax, at least I do anyway. If your doctor won't prescibe this for you then you need a new doctor. I suffered for years for nothing other than the notion my doctor had in believing I would become addicted. What's worse though? Going through the hell of panic attacks or being addicted to a drug that stops them? Again, I don't take them unless I need them but when I do it works. This has been my experience - yours may vary.

However today the doctor put me on something different....its still a 1mg xanax and i still take it twice a day but its call xanax ER - extended release -.  Anyone take these whom have had repeated anxiety attacks....sounds like a good thing but usuallly when i took the normal 1mg pills i took them when i could almost feel i was going to have a panic/anxiety attack.  So i just wanted to know someone else who has taken it who has similiar symptems as mine...and how well it works for them....

I would NOT recommend using this drug as your sole source of treatment and I warn about using more than 2mg a day.  A doctor put me on 1 mg 3 times a day and it totally wiped out my short term memory.  A friend had spend 3 hours having lunch with me and I couldn't remember it at all even though it was only 3 days past.  My normal doctor pitched a fit when he heard what the other doctor had prescribed.

It can become addictive if taken for extended periods of time, or in higher doses than prescribed.

I was in constant depression, having anxiety attacks,nervousness, mood swings, and sleeplessness. In combination with paxil, the two drugs have brought me great relief. I could never be in a group of people and carry on a conversation but it's improved greatly.

Now I am on the .5mg and I am taking them four times a day.  However I have an appointment in two weeks and she is going to up the dosage to the one mg ones.

It works at first and you feel better but in the long run can cause a serious withdrawal effect. I was on it for 11 weeks and then my Rx ran out, because my doctor also said take it if can't sleep and I did. I went into serious withdrawal and it does not leave your system quicky. Being ona drug that in the vent you can't get more cause withdrawal so quickly is scarey...never take this drug.

I have tried every anti-depressant on the market and they either make me lethargic, or like I am on speed and cannot eat and drop weight quickly.  why have doctors choose to quit listening to their patients?  money is hard to come by these days and if you know what works for you and take it as perscribed (When Needed) what's the problem isn't it better than getting it on the black market?

I have to wait 2 1/2 weeks to see the specialist.  I wasn't sleeping well, stressed, agitated with no appetite and my blood pressure was elevated.  I called my doctor and asked if she could give me something to help me cope.  She called in Xanax, I was afraid to take it thinking it was for serious mental illness not my situation.  One of my coworkers said...get over that idea, it is a wonderful drug and will just help you cope until you get through this.  I took it and she was right.  I can relax, I'm sleeping and eating again and not consumed with negative thoughts and worry all day long.  I am able to function at work while taking it.  I am grateful that this drug is helping me get through this very difficult time in my life.

It relieves anxiety to be able to function, not be afraid to be in a crowd, speak in meetings or fly. The worst feeling of an attck coming on is the &quot;out of body&quot; experience you feel. The feeling of being out of control is horrible. I've tried therapy, have read books on how to cope, etc. This is a magic pill that takes those feelings away. I'm a highly educated person that works in the health field, so I'm aware of the risk of addiction. As long as it's taken as really needed, I feel it's ok.

After going to several psychiatrists and telling my parents, they diagnosed me with &quot;depersonalization&quot;. Xanax didn't exist at that time, so I was put on Valium. It made the sensations stop. When Xanax came on the market I was switched to it. I'm now 53 and still cannot function without the Xanax. I take three 1 mg tablets a day along with an antidepressant. My tolerance is high after being on this drug such a long time, but it has allowed me to have a life instead of being in the er or curled up in my room. Doctors try to take me off of it because it's addicting, which by now I find a joke. After all these years and if it works, don't change things. The only down side is that you MUST take it as prescribed and not take too much because if you have been on it a long time, give out too soon, after two days, you will be jerking, hallucinating, and can have seizures. I have done this in the past and I truly thought I would die. So if you don't need it, don't take it. If you do, be prepared for hell if the doctor tries to take you off of it.

The only time I tried to take the recommended dose of .25 three times a day I was ill, I hallucinated and had  suicidal thoughts after five days. But still take it when I get really uptight when my symptoms are dizziness, nausea, fatigue, speech difficulty, etc. It works. Years ago I had panic attacks and put .50 under my tongue for rapid results. That works too. Probably .25 would do as well. Try that small dose first.

I am downing my dosage to get off the Methadone.  Xanax 1mg tid helps me with the muscle restlessness, the inability to sleep, the anhedonia from lack of dopamine production, the dysphoria, from same lack of natural opiate production, and it generally calms the anxiety that goes with the horrible effects of coming off of precription narcotic analgesics.  I would not advise people to use benzos long term, or the withdrawal is very dangerous.  The only 2 meds that most insurance will pay for inpatient detox from are alcohol and benzodiazepines.  The seizures with both are very serious, potentially fatal with the right set of circumstances.  Used correctly, however, Xanax (or Val.) makes the withdrawal from Morphine/Methadone/Codiene/Oxy or hydrocodone tolerable - but incomplete alone.  They treat the symptoms, but not the condition.  Also, Xanax is helpful for panic attacks, but not so much after an attack is in mid-episode.  Good preventative agent for panic attacks and generalized anxiety disorder.  If you TRULY are suffering with anxiety or panic dis., and you REALLY want to get better, you need to mix the Xanax with counseling.  Look for a counselor who does Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,aka C.B.T.  They use techniques like Systematic Desensitization, if you can identify some situations that cause your attacks, but most ppl can't.  So they teach them Relaxation Techniques, to sort of put your self into a self-hynotic state of calmness.  It is basically a good diversion while the episode passes on its on.  Well, I hope this helps someone out.  I studied pharmacology as a req. for my undergraduate degree, and I am in grad school now working on a degree in MPH (Master Public Health), in an area called Epidemiology. So I am not completely &quot;full of it!&quot;  I also have some obvious personal experience with addiction, stemming from military service in the sandbox. DocXYZM

I also suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. i have cut back from x3 2mg xanax's a day to just 1 at night before bed and in the day time treating my anxiety  with x3 5mg valium instead. there are people that honestly need to take xanax and i fear that all the stupid people out there that are abusing it will ruin it for people like myself who really do depend on it. over all i rate it 100%

However, I beleive you can get the job done with lower doses than you may realize. If you take .05-.25 intermittantly (per episode) it'll most likely be fine...But if your taking more than 1 (for sleep) and you don't get a full 8 hrs or so, you will be groogy the next day &amp; I'f used in this manner regularily you'll develope an addiction. Of course as always, talk to your Dr. about dosing. Evey person reacts differenty to each type of med. A lot of the &quot;issues&quot; I see in the comments can be fixed with proper dosing...just my 2 cents...Good Luck  All :D
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Redrose44, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	55-64	5/14/2009 9:19:15 PM	I am being treated for Fibromyalgia,and neuropathy. With Xanax and Elavil, that supposedly regulates my sleep habits. As far as I can tell all it does is make me sleep more. But does not help the initial problem.The Fibromyalgia/Neuropathy are caused by shingles. the pain is in my upper left side.Left Hip. Spine to breast bone. Pain intermitently,andevery day.The combination is not adaquate to induce pain free living.But does minimize the pain somewhat.I have various undesirable responses to many medicaytions. So it is hard to find a supplement.This treatment has been on going for about (6)six yrs, or more. The nerves will not repair themselves. And somewhere during this time, I have developed a very bad Hiatal Hernia. The medication makes it worse.I am now   taking Reglan, which has helped some. But will hopefully get better as I go along. Although some of the warnings have made me uneasy!!!

I only use it in high stress situations ie: flying, riding in cars, crowded situations etc. I love this medication, it has been a blessing to me. Without it my world would revolove around my house and I would not be able to cope with everyday situations.  It stays in the system for 4 hrs so if I need to I take more in that time period.

I was on it for a couple of years and decided to stop because it was causing problems for me.  He did not tell me to go off it slowly or to wean myself off of it.  I had 2 seizures and had to be hospitalized.  The ER doc and neurologist both told me it was a common occurence to have a seizure when suddenly stopping Xanax or any of the other drugs in this category.  It is not as harmless as you think.

Do you remember the anxiety/panic attacks that put you on Xanax? Well, the withdrawl panic attacks you will expierence from over use and running out too soon, or just simply up and quiting suddenly as I did OMG, its simply the worst feeling ever. Im not sure about Xanax but I do know its very dangerous with some Anxiety RX's to do this. You could actually go into seizures.

So always plan your pills out in a daily organizer, or tell someone youv'e taken it.EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!!! If you have more that one DR. or Pharmacy. Make sure everyone is aware of the other and all RX's. Recently I was given a long acting Morphine called Kadian. After three days of build up of the opiod &amp; xanax in my system, I went to sleep and expierienced respiratory arrest.

Klonopin make me more &quot;out of it&quot; than xanax ever did. Xanax is highly addictive though. Im off it onto Klonopin now. It doesnt work as well as Xanax did. BE CAREFULL!!!Addiction is awlful.

I also suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after an accident in 2000.  I was on Lexapro for years but work, family and money is always a cause of stress and anxiety.  I do not have panic attacks per say but get very lightheaded and dizzy when I begin to stress about mostly work.  I cannot control my thinking and usually my stress leaded to major anxiety and psuedo panic attacks.  I have just started Xanax and I was taking reluctantly, only when I was already in a panic.  This does not work. Now I am beginning to take on a regular basis and it is helping so far.  My advise, if your Dr suggests you use it daily, do so.  Do not be afraid...it can and will help.

Other anti-anxiety drugs caused sexual side affects - xanax does not and can be taken on an as need basis instead of daily like other meds.

High enough to keep me in bed worrying, unable to function. And increasing my chronic back pain. The medication helped with me with in 2 hours of taking .5mg q 12 hours.  With no side effects.  I do not usually look for info on web sites about medication, because when you read about the side effects, all of a sudden you have most of them.  I find it best to talk to your pharmacist, and doctor about side effects, other wise you could blame your medication needlessly for a side effect.

The therapy really ISN'T working for me though. I just took xanax a couple hours ago for my first time. I've been researching a lot of different meds and options. I'm kinda testing the waters with this one but from what I've read it seems to be down to this or Klonopin (not yet tried). My anxiety/ panic is triggered by something in particular and does not come out of the blue like for most people. So I took 3 .25mg and let them dissolve under my tongue. Waited 15-20 mins and did something I know would trigger high anxiety or a panic attack. I felt a little anxiousness but nothing serious. I know these meds work different for everyone. I'll definitely be giving xanax a chance. The only downside that I'm seeing is the addictiveness that can develop. I'll definitely be taking it on a as needed basis! I do feel a little &quot;zoned out&quot; right now kinda like a small alcohol buzz feeling, kinda tired, and some clumsiness. Other than that I can still disguise it and act &quot;sober&quot; from what I can see. Hopefully this helped someone like all your posts helped me. Good luck!!!P.S. If anyone out there has any good info that could be helpful, please let me know.

I dealt with them the best I could on my own before thinking I was going to be in the mental hospital so thats when I decided I had to do something. Xanax has really work well for me I've been on it for 3 years and I have very few panic attacks now and they are less intense as they used to be. All I can say is what do you have to lose when you already feel like your going to die.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Jeff, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	4/23/2009 4:55:49 PM	I started having trouble sleeping a couple of months ago. I went to the doc and she thought it was associated with anxiety and prescribed xanax. I was worried about relying on a medication to sleep or for anything in general. So I only took it a couple of times and it worked but I stopped hoping I could sleep without it. For the next couple of months my sleeping problems worsened to teh point where I couldn't sleep for more than 2 hours and my lack of sleep started really affecting my life in many bad ways. I didn't have energy, bad moods, worry, and started being seriously affected by anxiety. So ultimatley I decided to take the doctors initial advice and take the xanax for a little while to relearn how to sleep. It has worked fantastic!! I've taken it for 5 days consecutively and I feel normal again. I take 1mg an hour before I want to go to sleep and I sleep very well. Sometimes I still wake up but I fall back asleep easily. I have young children so it's almost impossible to sleep all the way through the night without interuption but xanax helps me sleep deeply and fall back asleep when I wake up. Also, I haven't felt any of the groggy side effects the next day like I do with Tylenol PM or similar. As long as I can stop taking it without problems it is a miracle drug. I plan to continue to take it for another week or so and then stop. I'll repost afterwards and let everyone know how it goes. Good luck with your sleeping!! I've found out the hard way that the effects of not sleeping way out way taking the xanax. I'd suggest trying it temporarily along with making life changes to improve your sleeping habits.

Helped right away. No more fear of open spaces, could walk without getting dizzy and my head felt straight. Downside to this pill, is that it is so addictive! I am now on 4mg daily, and in the past couple of years am noticing I am animated, loud, full of life, talking very rapidly and way too much. It became obvious to me and then I overheard different people mention they thought I was &quot;on something&quot;. It also caused me to become very complacent with my job---I stayed in a low paying job, simply because it was easy--and on the xanax---sort of fun. I also was in a ridiculous relationship with a man that I never would have been with if not for the xanax. I found that I loved everyone, the world was rosy, and I didn't really give a fig about anything. Now I cannot get off this stuff. After all these years of being medicated, I have no idea what my real personality is, and often wonder how different my life would have turned out without xanax. Made some terrible choices while on this, not realizing I was &quot;high&quot;. Am now seeing an md to try to get off this. Do not start this stuff or you can't get through a day without it! Should be banned.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	4/16/2009 2:35:25 PM	This drug has changed my life! I used to suffer panic attacks, particularly for public speaking. If I take .5 to .75 I can function normally and not stress speaking, important meetings, awkward social engagements, etc.If I am stressed over something or cannot turn my mind off to sleep, .25 helps with that.I take it only when I need it and have never felt it addictive. The only issues I ever have are doctors who question why you take it and how long you have taken it.My wife took the drug to help her with panic attacks that she got after her first husband had died. When we dated over ten years ago, she saw that I had a anxiety and panic disorder, particularly associated with public speaking.The generic is alprazolam. It costs $3-$4 to get a 30 pill prescription.Best money I ever spent and what a God send it has been for my life.I have never seen a more effective medication to addressing immediate stress and panic disorders. 
Panic Disorder	Jessica, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/16/2009 1:50:17 AM	I have dealt with panic attacks and anxiety for years.I was on Buspar for 6 months and I didn't like the way they made me feel at all. So  I started taking Xanax about 2yrs. ago. They work wonders for me. I keep the dosage low and only take them when I can not work through a panic attack using other techniques or when my anxiety as at it's peak. I have had no side affects and I do not feel they are habit forming for me. Everyone's different though. I'm the type of person who hates taking meds. So to depend on this drugs must mean they diffidently work. 
Anxious	Kay, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	4/16/2009 1:43:00 AM	Reduces anxiety immediately, helps sleep. EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE. Even at the mildest dose (.25mg), if you take even just once every day you will experience withdrawal symptoms (crawling out of your skin) if you don't get your fix. Best used occasionally as needed and not daily or the body becomes addicted. It works but makes you feel like a junkie which causes anxiety!
Anxious	aztkdiva, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	4/16/2009 9:57:02 PM	My Dr prescribed this medication because I suddenly developed anxiety attacks. I only took it twice because the only thing this little pill did was put me to sleep faster than I could react. Then the second time I took it I woke up so irritated that I lashed out at anyone and anything before me. Since then I never took it again. I had never experienced such a moment and never have again.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	beachreakdave, 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		55-64	4/15/2009 11:14:46 PM	Changed my life.  I feel the way I think I'm supposed to feel--relaxed and calm. My urge to drink is now negligible. Plus, I used to have a stutter that sometimes manifested itself in times of stress and now I don't.  I only have the desire to take the drug when I feel like I need it and there seems to be no desire to increase dosage.
Panic Disorder	Diane, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/15/2009 8:34:18 AM	I've suffered from Panic/Anxiety Disorder for over 30 yrs. When Xanax first came out it was wonderful. Now doctors don't like it..too addicting. I never found it addicting or given a 'high' feeling..I felt normal. As docs want you to get off of xanax they put you on all kinds of other psych meds. They are free to give those out. Zoloft was added to my meds about 6 years ago. It helped some but never stops the panic/amxiety disorder to make you feel 'human' like Xanax does. I tried to reduce the Zoloft to the point of getting off of it. Big mistake. The side effects for getting off Zoloft are horrible. Numbness in the mouth and hands, crying all the time, jitters, feeling like your skin is coming off. The side effects are far worse than continuing to take the Zoloft 100mg a night. Soon I will give it another try to get off Zoloft. Xanax works the best for me without addiction or a drugged feeling. Good luck finding a doc who will prescribe it without making you see a psychiatrist! I recently moved and after some research on the doctor and an initial visit..I am lucky to find one that still believes it works and works well for many of us. We shouldn't be taking meds on a whim, as ordered by a doctor, when we don't need or want them.

I also deal with severe chronic pain and i have to say my panic attacks and anxiety are far worse. I been on klonopin, cymbalta, bupspar, elavel, lexapro, and effexor to keep it under control and none of them come close to the level of effeciveness xanax has. Unfortunately, i know to many people who abuse it or buy it off the streets to simply get high. if u have tried numerous medications to no avail, i do strongly recommend u try this drug.

If you find yourself addicted to it do not stop cold turkey. Talk to your dr. frsit and let him/her help you get off of it. I stoped cold turkey and I was found in the bathroom in cold sweats, dry heves and shacking so bad that it was hard for my boyfriend at the time to get me to the living room to help me. It is not anything that I would wish on anyone.

It literally saved my sanity at times.  I have not noticed long term effects or less effectiveness.  It just makes me feel more &quot;normal&quot; and able to cope with stressful situations.  If you have an addictive personality, it may not be the best thing to use.  Everybody's chemistry is different and what may work for some may not work for someone else.

I however do not take it every day as prescribed as I find that your body builds a tolerance to it and it becomes less effective during those times that I really need it. Maybe I shouldn't do it that way but I only take it when I feel I need it and on those times it works GREAT.

I have been trying to get off the medication because of its side effects for a yr. now. I have trouble breathing sleeping and my heart races as well as my mind when I dont take a pill within a day. I am prescribed 2mg 3x a day but am only taking 1 pill unless I cant sleep then I take 1 more. I am finding it very difficult to get off of...almost like a junkie. I AM TRULY SCARRED. My doctor keeps me on it and has me do a check up once every 3 months. I had to quit going to the doctor because I lost my insurance so now I need to find a way to kick the habit...so to speak. I am truly scarred that I am going to have a seizure if I just stop completely. I have expressed this concern but the conversation seems to take a different turn off of the subject. I really wish they could develop a drug that was not addictive but treated for the same condition.

At first it was because I had severe anxiety with depression.  My heart would race and horrible thoughts would go through my head.  It has helped me tremendously but the one bad thing is it is very addictive.  I have to have it now instead of needing it.  I have tried to stop but the withdraw is horrible.  My face gets numb and my heart feels like it is going to explode.  I hate being a &quot;xanax junkie&quot; but I guess that's what I'll be because I can't live without it!

I take a .5 tablet if my chest starts squeezing and can't go anywhere.  With 5 kids on the go is crucial.  I keep it in my purse and usually resort to 3 a month.  Just the peace of knowing it will go away in 30 minutes if I need to take it is enough to stave off an attack most of the time.  Love it.  This anxiety disorder started with hormonal flux of perimenopause.

I recommend you get off this drug as soon as possible.

Xanax is the fastest drug that works to help me.  Others I take are not fast enough to react to my anxiety.  Xanax has helped me better than any other anxiety medication that I've taken.

It has been great for me. Allows me to focus when I get wound too tight, relax when nerves are on edge. Also helps me repel the urge to turn toward alcohol for relief.

Panic Disorder	lily, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/9/2009 1:49:03 PM	I used to get really bad headaches everyday due to anxiety and I also panic attacks at any given moment. Even at my job which would cause me to have to leave for the day. I saw a dr. for this and the headaches were cut down to I would say a good 80% and i had only 1 panic attack since i have been on the med but only because my dr. was trying to wean me off of the xanax. i had started with .5mg 3times a day and now i take .25 3times a day and if need be a 4th. My headaches were also being caused due to sleep apnea and have been treated for that as well. I still get headaches but we're still working on getting the right setting for my CPAP machine. Anyhow bottom line is Xanax does work.

Anxiousness associated with Depression	ca, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	3/7/2009 7:56:03 PM	this med is a little too satisfying for me. Doc prescribed 1mg twice daily 5 years ago. Worked like a charm. Heart stopped racing, could walk without feeling like I was losing balance, etc. Then, an odd thing began happening---I felt as though I was on speed some of the time. Friends commented on how rapidly I talked (and how much). Cannot seem to shut up. I never took it to sleep; but now I find that I will reach for it if something bad/uncomfortable happens, or if I just want to be in a good mood. My whole point is that it's incredibly addictive. Mr doctor (shrink) added clonopin to the mix to calm down my racing thoughts. Frankly, the only way out of this mess, that I can see, is to have be de-toxed.Be very, very careful with this stuff---although maybe it's me--I have not read of anyone else getting this reaction of speeding......................................... ................................................. .......

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Matt, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	19-24	3/2/2009 1:18:27 PM	Of course, this medication works. Make sure to have a plan with your doctor before starting Xanax or any other benzodiazepine. These medications cause dependence VERY quickly for most people.  If you use this in high doses or for prolonged periods (2-4 weeks or more), consider your risks for withdrawal when stopping this drug.  Never abruptly stop taking Xanax or other benzos without tapering down, especially if you are experiencing withdrawal.  The withdrawal can lead to dangerous episodes of anxiety or convulsions. So.... use it short term, and seek other forms of therapy for your anxiety like counseling.

My doctor prescribed 1mg three times per day.  I take it as needed.  I usually take 1 or two per day.  If I have a rough day, I may take more.  I am probably addicted, but the drug eases my symptoms and I perform much better when I take it as needed.  My doctor agrees that I am probably addicted, but is not concerned because I am not an abuser.

Was nicknamed &quot;Spaz&quot; by Jr. highschool years.  Now I'm Rx'd 4 mg. per day. I take 0.5 mg. upon waking to prevent 1st anxiety. Then 1 mg. in early evening to calm me from day's events &amp; that is usually all I need.  But if something really bad scares me, I have the option of upto 2 more doses. / At 1st it made me drowsy &amp; I didn't like that, but things normalized w/in 2 weeks.  Especially when I started breaking morning tab in half.  I like that I can now leave to house to do business without the embarassment of looking nervous.  People are suspicious of shaky people when asking questions like at bank when have a large check to cash that perfectly legal. Spouse liked that I was not so self conscious for intimacy.  I have calmed down to have a normalized sex life after waiting 20 years. I like the built in &quot;can't get addicted&quot; b/c if take too much, it won't work as needed the next day.  Could abuse, but would run out of Rx way too early &amp; then Dr. would cease Rx or I'd have to live w/ anxiety for most of month until next refill.  I don't want either &amp; I don't want to fill sluggish so there's no temptation of abuse for me.  i just like feeling normal &amp; looking normal in public.  Only down side is that I choose to wait 2 hrs. B4 driving just to be sure I don't have the odd adverse affect unexpectedly

The doctor came into my room right away and didn't know what was going on. Meanwhile I am still beginning to have troub;e breathing and severe chest pain. He decided to give me xanax just to calm me down so I could tell him what was going on. It immediately worked and I was completely fine. He diagnosed me with having a panic attack. He gave me a scrpt for it and I have been taking it &quot;as needed&quot; since. it works GREAT!!!
Anxious	no worries, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/19/2009 3:04:03 AM	I have benn on xanax now for 3 years now and it gets me through the day comfortably! Some day I just need 0.25mg, and others I need 0.5mg. Point made here is that it does the job. I buggest concern was my organs. Was it going to damage, in any way, my liver, kudney, or heart? I have since found the answer to that question...NO! So knowing that, yes, this drug &quot;CAN&quot; be addictive, and I could very well become dependent on it, thats ok with me as long it does no harm to any other part of me. I'd rather take these and get through every day in a great way rather than to struggle through every day being miserable!

Panic Disorder	mr.smith, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	2/16/2009 6:51:14 PM	I've been taking this medication for 24 years now.  My first bout with panic disorder was in the military many years ago. They had no idea what I had, so I turned to alcohol (just for attacks).  When I returned to the USA, a doctor put me on Valium. Hated Valium.  Then came Xanax, and I was able to live again.  I was prescribed 2mg 3x a day which I took for a few years with absolutely no side affects at all. I read about it's addictivity, so I experimented myself and actually have taken myself off a few times, but the panic attacks resume within days. I have personally reduced my dosage between 3 to 4 mg per day and that seems to be the perfect combo for me. Never drowsy, eat well, sleep well and has allowed me to run a couple of successful businesses. I truly believe that there are certain drugs that completely take care of a problem with some people and do not do so with other. You have to find what works for you, simple as that. This medication has allowed me to live a normal life, be successful and even fly and drive cross country etc.

It has been working fine until recently. Know when I am starting to get a bad attack I have to take 2 or 3 to ward it off. So I went and saw my doctor today and he gave me 10mg of Valium 6times a day.4 during the day and 2 at night. I thought valium was the weaker of the two so I do not understand? It just feels like my body got so use to the xanax that it stopped being as effective.

Panic Disorder	happynow, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	2/10/2009 11:38:14 AM	When I was 50 years old I started having severe panic disorder which basically paralyzed me.  Any disruption of my regular schedule prompted an attack.  My doctor prescribed Xanax which immediately helped.  However, I was hospitalized with severe depression and the doctors there thought the Xanax was the cause so they &quot;weaned&quot; me off in a week's time.  After trying every antipressant known to man, I refused to take anything that made me feel like a zombie.  With counseling my depression was cured, but I started the panic attacks again and was again given Xanax.  It wasn't until I changed doctors in 1998 that I was offered Citalopram 20mg (to take at night because it made me sleepy), that I became like myself again.  I never laughed or had fun, but after about two weeks I realized that I was actually laughing out loud and just felt my brain was organized if you know what I mean. These two drugs together changed my life.  I have highs and lows and emotions, and feel 20 years younger.  For those who are scared of addiction, who cares if they help you and if you don't abuse them?  That's exactly what my doctor said.  I was feeling guilty of taking an addictive drug.So relax, find something that helps you and enjoy life.

I have been put on antidepressents,which is a joke,for me,my brain makes plenty of serotonin.Xanex is the only med that helps me.I take a light .o5 mlg. dose about every twelve hours,to keep it at a study amount in my system,which greatly reduces my anxiety,hyperness ,and balences me out,so i am not such a chronic worry wart.While on this ,it helps me not to dwell on stupid things that do not matter,not worry about unimportant things,or whatothers think,and enables me to concentrate on important things,along with making me more calm and relaxed.The stronger dose,the 1 mlg. is alot stronger, so if I really am in panic attack mode I will take 1 half or a full one if I am not planning on driving.This medicine is about the only thing that I have found to be effective for me,and has helped me so much.I do not feel it is addicting in any way.If more doctors would get over thier fears and treat people on a case by case basis and quit shoving antidepressants at people,and prescribe proven antianxiety meds like this to patients,we would see alot less heart attacks,and other stress related heart conditions,as well as alot less suicides,self medicating behaviors and the like.I have lupus and fibro,diabetes and premenstraul dismorphic disorder along with many health disorders as a result of the lupus and fibro,Keeping my anxiety and stress is key to keeping me healthy and reducing my flare ups.This is the only medicine that works for me.They need to keep it on the market and doctors who have stereotyped it or refuse to give it to certian patients who need it,to keep well like people like me,with stress related illnesses,should get in trouble.if taken correctly and not overdone or abused,this is a wonderful medication,I have nothing but good things to say,it has greatly improved my quality of life.The other things I have taken were a joke,this one works wonders!!!!

I was really anxious... it really helped me sleep and calm down.. Now I use it when I fly.  It really helps with the anxiety.  My doc only gives me pills for the flight! Taken with respect it really helps!!

I have been using it because I suffered a sudden health issue (GERD) and also several months of inability to sleep and possible other factors undiagnosed as of yet - such as anxiety and possibly PTSD.  I have been on it on a daily basis for 45 days.

I don't use it everyday but I have seen people get very addicted simply by following their prescription therefore I am very careful about my intake. I ONLY take it when I feel over-anxious and stressed and it really helps take the edge off without impairing my ability to function. I also have a low dose of .25mg which sometimes is not quite enough but I never need more than .5mg. Be very careful with all medications and don't take anything you're unsure about without consulting a professional.

I take 1mg 5 times a day.  It works great for me.  It definetely keeps me calm.  The only thing I would caution someone who is thinking about starting xanax is that it's VERY additing.  I can't stop taking it now without getting a serious case of the shakes and a feeling that Im &quot;Not all there&quot;.
Anxiousness associated with Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	13-18	2/2/2009 1:19:52 PM	This medication was great for relieving my anxiety and helping me sleep at night. However after a couple months i started to notice some short term memory loss. It was an annoyance but nothing that would keep me from taking the medication. I also noticed that i needed to increase the dosage after time because it stoped being as effective. I'm still on an extremely low doseage and i try to take it only when needed although i do have trouble falling asleep without it. All in all its a good medication with few major side effects. Just remember like with any drug side effects are different for everyone so don't let the reviews scare you. :)

Ready to switch to something else due to short term memory loss and joint pain. Have been on other meds for anxiety, but xanax seems to have caused the worst memory loss of any of them. Has anyone else had severe memory loss with this drug?I'm thinking of asking my Doctor to try Valium or Klonipin. Has any one else had good results with either of these meds?

Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/30/2009 12:00:24 AM	After suffering from 2 severe and debilitating panic attacks in a matter of a weeks, I was desperate for help. These were amazing. As soon as I felt an attack coming on I would take 1-2 1mg tablets and within 15 mins or so I would be calmed down. Which was wonderful considering my panic attacks would last for several hours. I also had severe anxiety. When I start feeling very anxious I take one of these and it helps a lot! I also find comfort in knowing I have these with me at all times in the event I were to have an attack. I don't ding them addicting. I believe if you use them as your doctor has prescribed you will be fine. They were truly a lifesaver for me! Drowsiness was the only major side effect I noticed.

I had heard Xanax was addictive but for me it has been a lifesaver.  I used it 2xday .5mg regularly for awhile but now only when I feel an attack coming on.  Unfortunately, it's a few times a week. But it really works quickly and I don't want to abuse it because I can't see lasting like I was before. I hopefully will be able to keep the dosage and not go up because it appears that's what happens to people who use it over time.

Xanax is by far the only med. that helps make me normal again and work very fast. I only take it when needed ,because I know how addicting it can be.

I haven't had a Panic attack in 3 yrs. I know it is addicting but, I plan on taking it the rest of my life. To me it is just as important as my blood pressure medication. Why would someone try to ween off a drug that works so well. I recommmend someone to find a good, honest Doctor and tell him everything symptom that you are having.

I was also taking Effexor for depression. By the third year I was up to 8mg a day. It's a great drug but very addictive. I would take my whole script in two weeks and go through horrible withdrawls. I didn't want to do it anymore. A couple of docs told me the only way to get off was to ween off slowly over several months. Then my doc did some research and wanted to try something new. He stopped the Xanax &amp; put me on a decreasing dose of Klonopin for a week then put me on Depakote, Neurontin, and Seroquel. I gained over 40 lbs. in less than 2 months. The withdrawls were nothing like stopping cold turkey but the other meds aren't helping with the anxiety. So now I have to ween off these and deal with a weight issue that depresses me even more. I think I'm worse off than when I was taking Xanax. If anyone has any suggestions I would love to hear them. Email me at ms_molases@yahoo.com

It can be very addicting. Be careful of overtaking this med. The withdraw from it is hell. Someone stole my whole script one time and I had to go to the hospital because I almost suffered a seizure. If used properly it works amazing. I feel relaxed and calm when I take it. It also works great at nite time if you cant sleep. It is very habit forming so use as prescribed,, or you will form an addiction and believe me the withdrawls are life threatning and misery. Xanax and alcohol are the only drugs you can die coming off of. So be very careful and talk w your doctor regurly and let him or her know how your feeling. As for Xanax I give it two thumbs up. Its helped me tremendosly.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	trnitup, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	1/23/2009 4:03:02 AM	I have been on alprazolam for ten years.It gave me my life back.The anxiety attacks I used to experience were debilitating.3mg per day.No more than that,but sometimes only 2mg.My thinking is actually clearer on this med than it was before because an anxiety attack would send my mind racing and unable to concentrate or focus.Not to mention the fact that I would get clammy hands,heart palpitations,severe chest pains and more making me think I was having a heart attack.When I started this medicine it all stopped completely.Now I feel absolutely normal and am not afraid to leave my house for fear of another attack like I used to get many times a week.Anxiety can cause you to become agoraphobic from fear of having another attack while away from your comfort zone like your own house.But yes,,it is addictive for sure,so if at any point in the future anyone that needs to stop taking this MUST taper off at a Very slow rate [like several weeks] or you will have very severe withdrawal symtoms which I understand is EXTREMELY unpleasant,also possible seizures and even death.I have no plans to stop because of it's effectivness for me.Buspar,Effexor,Paxil,Welbutrin,and all those types of drugs left me feeling unable to experience any natural highs or lows,somewhat like an automaton or a zombie.Alprazolam does not do that,that is why I like it.No,,it does not get me feeling buzzed except in the very initial stages of first use.I feel nothing from it now,just normal with no weird side effects and no anxiety.I hope this might help some of you out there with your quest to feel better and hopefully normal once again.

I did go off of it all at once a few years ago and DO NOT recommend that. It was horrible. If you go off of this drug, do so with the help of your doctor. You have to ease off of it. I am dependent on this drug but after all of this time, it still helps me. I take 0.5 mg as needed, up to three times a day. I have had four back surgeries and the Xanax has also helped as a muscle relaxer when I am in pain. Do not take if you do not absolutely need. It is a great help for some but can be a real problem drug for others. Stay in close touch with your doctor while on this drug.

I'm not sure why people like xanax so much. I am prescribed the maximum allowed by the government, but I hardly take it. It doesn't stop my anxiety unless I take enough to pass out on, but then it's not treating the anxiety, it's just making you sleep through it.

It calms me down in stressful situations and I will occasionally take it at night to help me sleep.  It doesn't give me a thick headed feeling, just a feeling of calm and relaxation.  It gets rid of the panicky, racing thoughts in my head.  I do occasionally have some vivid dreams when I take it, not nightmares, just vivid, colorful dreams which are not at all disturbing.  I have struggled with depression for years and about 5 years ago I began having severe, debilitating anxiety attacks on an almost daily basis.  After several trips to the ER because I thought I was dying of a heart attack, my MD prescribed Celexa with the Xanax as a supplement for the anxiety and the combination has worked wonders for me.  The generic equivalent (alprazolam) is also very inexpensive.  I have nothing but high praises for Xanax and I hope it can be helpful to someone out there who is dealing with depression and anxiety.

No side effects to report.  After a long period of use slightly larger doses are required.  But it is still the best drug I have used to help calm me down.  It works very quickly, but follow directions when discontinuing use.  Just stop taking the medication without easing yourself off causes mild withdrawal symptoms.  Overall very happy with its effectiveness.

This med does work for all or most symptoms. i do however feel listless, fatigue, lack of sexual or physical desire. I feel like nothing really matters,My house is no longer spotless, the thoughts are there but to act on them repulses me. I am going back to the Dr. and ask for something else in Feb. I can not live this way either. There must be something that makes me feel like living a life without making me just muddle through one. Better because i am no longer putting a gun to my head, but i think because i don't have the ambition to go get one.

Anxiousness associated with Depression		5	5	5			1/7/2009 7:42:38 PM	I've been on Xanax for about 15+ years for anxiety from bi polar disorder. I've have also taken every anti depressant out there. When I started taking Effexor about 3 years ago which helps with anxiety, the combination of both was very effective. I take 3 mg a day and fell extremely calmer.

Xanax is the only thing that has truly helped the panic attacks.  As soon as I feel one building, like they start in the toes, I take one, and it never reaches full panic.  I don't take them everyday, and would contact my doc if I felt I had to, since they are suppose to be addictive.  I have used them for over 10 years now, and never had an issue with them.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	dmy38, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/5/2009 3:27:44 AM	I have been taking xanax for 20 years now.  I am 38 and started having social anxiety disorder in 8th grade along with panic attacks, migraines, muscle tension and depression.  I suffered with that until I was 20 as the doctor I was seeing during my childhood told me it was all in my imagination and there was nothing he could do for me.  I decided it was time to see another doctor.  I have tried just about every medication out there for social anxiety disorder and xanax is the only one that has worked for me. It allowed me to live a normal life and function in society again. I have to take it every day as I have constant anxiety.  I do best on .5mg-1mg per day but I have gone down to .25mg per day now as I am trying to get pregnant and I will need to be completely off of the xanax during my pregnancy and for breastfeeding afterwards.  I am however very scared of coming off of the xanax.  I have been on it for so long and if I am not physically addicted to it, then I am definitely mentally addicted to it. Xanax saved my life.  I have always been aware that it is highly addictive and never allowed myself to take more than 1 mg per day and my body was fine with that.  I never needed any more than that, thank god!  I just hope now that I can ween myself off of the .25 mg without horrible withdrawals.  Like everyone else has stated, this drug is HIGHLY addictive and if you dont have severe anxiety/depression, try other drugs first to see if they work because once you are on xanax, you are going to suffer some withdrawals if you decide to come off of it.  I dont regret taking xanax and it is what works best for me but I wish they would develop something that works likes xanax but that is not addictive. I would recommend xanax ONLY if you have constant SEVERE anxiety, social anxiety and constant panic attacks as I did.  Dont give up though!  Keep searching for what works best for you as there are so many options out there.

Panic Disorder	Jperryprincess, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/4/2009 5:24:54 PM	I have been reading the troubles everyone is having with this medicine and don't understand it. I have Panic disorder, anxiety and Post traumatic Stress syndrome plus Epilipsy. The Dr's have tried every drug in the xanax catagory, kyloonipin, ativan and valiums and xanax has worked the best. I have been on and off of it for years. I was allowed 3 1mg tabs a day as needed, even with feeling a seizure coming on. I have reached that amount maybe 5 times. It helps for many reasons, lesser chance of addiction, more chance that it's going to work and it responds faster when it is given as needed. It's been a godsend to me when stressful situations leave me fighting the 'ora' of having an epileptic seizure. When nightmares drag me back to where I was in danger, it does help. It helps me so much that I don't need it 3 times a day let along adding more and bumping it up. Epilepsy came to me at a young age due to a stroke. I gave up drinking while young friends were partying. I'm not worried about mixing them. If you are taking this medicine, it isn't worth having that drink, your anxiety will only get worse or you will wind up where you don't want to be. the only bad thing about xanax if you don't let yourself abuse it is it tastes NASTY. BUT it is soooooo worth it to take the bitter taste for a moment and continue with life. it isn't a miracle drug, but it helps me to know when I need it to keep me fron getting hurt during a seizure or keep my anxiety under control, it's there ready to help me thru it. bless the inventor

I have never gotten addicted to it, but am careful to take it only when I need it (maybe 3-4 times a week) 1mg.  I have never had any ill affects from the medication.  However, I had a friend who had major anxiety, and he would abuse the pills taking 10mg or more a day.  Then one day his doctor wouldnt give him anymore, and he went through major withdraw feeling like he was going to die until finally three days later he got picked up by ambulance for them to detox him in the hospital.  For him it was very bad, but he took too many, with alcohol.

It was THE ONE MOST DIFFICULT THING I HAVE EVER DONE.  Finally, after probably a year or more of feeling horrible, panicking day after day, quitting and restarting, I broke the habit. I was attending a Group Rehab meeting and believe me, it was horrible.  I felt great after I was finally off it, but I really did a great bit of work with a Psycho Therapist, who came to my home, because I was too panicky to drive to hers.  I still take Prozac, and now to my amazement, I take Clonazepam (Klonapin) .50 before I go to bed.  It seems much better and works for me.  I did have to get off Xanax.  It was something I had to do for myself.

Nothing else I have used compares. The only drawback is the short half-life, and weaning off it after extensive periods of use. Anxiety heightens, emotions are haywire, fear is ever-present. You feel as if all eyes are on you. The drug of course relieves all of this and I have led a normal life on it for years. If you take more than prescribed, beware of the tolerance and eventual dependance. Doctors and pharmacists are not the enemy (as they seem if you are withdrawing)but they know the addictive potential and are very careful when prescribing. I have weaned myself to 2 1/2 0.5mg tabs daily from a high of 6mg (or 12 0.5) a day, and it was not fun. Weaning takes a long time and should never be done without a plan or you could have a seizure. Overall my experiences using the drig as prescribed have been very positive, and I am back to a slightly lower dose now. The best use is &quot;as needed&quot; as it avoidss tolerance and addiction, and you will not run out. No weird side-effects. Peace and tranquility that were never part of my life are possible now. Do not mix with opiods as that will land you in rehab before you know it. I was also addicted to various prescription pain meds which are no longer part of my life (thank God, but I miss them at times!). Good luck to those who use this drug as it can really be beneficial for anxiety and panic attacks.

During the time that I took it, I had no problems.  Then I had an experience when I blacked out, completely and became very aggressive, but do not remember anything that happened that night.  Over the duration of that night, I had two shots of hot dam.  The combination fo the two caused this blackout.  I had been ordered to quit taking my xanax immediately.  So I stopped taking it.  I went thru withdrawls for several weeks, severe shaking, nausa, paranoia.  Now that I have been off of them for about 10 1/2 months, I feel like they have done some severe damage to my brain.  I forget things, I cannot remember things that I have asked people, nor things that I may have done.  But during the time that I was taking them, I thought everything was fine.  But now, my husband will ask me about something that we may have discussed, or maybe something that we watched on TV, or anything during that 4 years that I took xanax.  I cannot remember much about anything during that period.  It is as if I was living in a fog.  The xanax was a cover up for me to hide behind to deal with issues that arise with my husband, and kids, I would just pop another xanax, and hide behind it.  Although I have had these severe reactions since I quit taking it, I still think that it works well to treat severe depression, and anxiety.

Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	12/22/2008 7:55:51 AM	The problem with Xanax is that if you have a panic disorder and are taking this daily, Xanax only works for about 4 hours, it starts working quickly but it is out of your system quickly as well. I was on this med for about 2 years and never really got my anxiety under control, I was of course dependant on it as well and gradually my Dr had to keep upping my dosage. I finally saw a different Dr. and was prescribed Klonopin....MUCH BETTER! Still is addicitive but is great for someone who needs something on a daily basis, takes about an hour to start working but lasts for like 8 hours, I have been on it for about 4 years now and havent had to increase my dosage!

I can't remember hardly anything, and I used to have basically a photographic memory with numbers and addresses and things. (I'm 22.) Now I can barely remember names and even worse if I have taken my pills or not. Also it's not easy to get off of.

WARNIG, it is highly addictive. I have had two seizures from trying to get off of it. I have determined that I will be on it for the rest of my life. I prefer the addiction rather then the anxiety and panic attacks. Once you start this medication, plan on long term use and never take more then what is prescribed to you. One more thing if you want to stop taking it, tell your doctor. Do not just stop on your own. I call it a life saver but also the devil, be careful!

It really helps to take this with propranylol (it calms the physical while xanax calms the mental more).

It's the only anti-anxiety drug that has really helped me feel &quot;normal&quot;.  I was having HORRIBLE anxiety attacks that would make me pass out.  Since on this medication I've had no more of that!!  The only downfall to this drug is how easily they are to become dependent on.  I take them as directed and have had NO problems in that area though...THE BEST for my particular symptoms!  Just take as directed...can't stress that enough.

I take .50 milligrams at bedtime. During the day I take the medication as I see fit.  Usually .25 to .50 milligrams if I need it.  In emergency times, (death or something else very stressful), I will take 1 milligram at a time.  I will say I do depend on the medicine.  If I leave home I make sure I have it with me as well as a supply at home.  The medicine keeps me on an even level.  I do not get as irritated and it clears my mind of those repeticious thoughts.

I have been on a program to stop this medication and I am now, after one year, down to 1mg at bedtime and will be done by 01 January 2009.  This pill is highly addictive and you should discuss this side effect with your doctor prior to starting this medication.  Try everything first and if nothing works go for this stuff.  Good Luck!!!

It works wonders, but doctors are so scared of addiction where I live, it's impossible to get them if you really need them. A three month supply could last me a year, as I don't need them every day, but when I do need them, they are a life saver. If I took them every day, I would be addicted, but you have to know how to control yourself and your state of mind to resist addiction.

I would have uncontrolable panic attacks at all times of the day and night with no known trigger. These started when I was 17 years old, and now I am 27. I do not take this drug daily, since I don't need to take them daily. I use this drug in emergencies only. And it says me trips to the emergency room. Which was what I was doing when I was younger and had no idea what was going on. My Dr has tried to put me on numerous antidepressants and take away the xanax. I noticed none of those worked, maybe I didn't want them too, maybe they didn't target what the problem really is. I'm not depressed, I just get scared. So I would always go back to the Xanax. Though the initial effects are severe sleepiness and and listlessness, I notice the calming, tranquil effects last for a couple days to follow. Nothing really bothers me. I say I take about 2mg in a week to two weeks. Never at the same time, and never in with the same time gap. I love to thave the fall back, because when it was happening EVERY DAY and would last for HOURS AND HOURS my life was hell. I say use with caution (don't abuse it), but I reccommend this to anyone who is suffering from panic attacks.

I was put on Lexapro for the anxiety/depression and the xanax for &quot;emergencies&quot; An example is during a test, i get that trapped in the room, need to leave feeling,  Anyways, if I take 1 xanax 4m within 5 minutes i am so more relaxed. I always feel like I am in a daze but I can still function in class.  Overall, I liken it but I see how it could be addicting also.  I use one MAYBE once every 2 weeks.

I am also working with my dr. on hrt, but that is slow going.  My psychiatrist has me on Paxil as well as .5mg of the generic form of Xanax.  I think the generic gives me headaches but so far it is the only thing that helps me function through the afternoons and evenings.

Once back on medication I begin to take care of business until what I call 'falling down the rabbit hole' begins and I find my self in bed for weeks at a time at which point I stop my medication becouse I need to leave my bed to see the doctor and it just doesn't mean that much to me. Only returning to the doctor for a refill when something in my life must be dealt with. I have gone as long as a month in bed,no lights no tv no contact with others not even showering or eating no smiles or giggles.

Panic Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/15/2008 12:42:05 PM	About 5 years ago i was diagnosed with Bipolar and anxiety which at times lead to acute panic attacks. I used to have severe panic attacks and would arrive in the ER feeling like an idiot when they told me it was just anxiety. My Doctor gave me Xanax 1mg and told me to take 3 times daily or when having acute attacks. I only took the pill when I felt anxiety coming on which always started with nausea and then stomach pain. When I have a full blown panic attack I take 3mg. It ussually works for me. I do not take the pills regularly, I take them when I feel an anxiety attack coming on. Since Ive been on Geodon my attacks are less. I carry Xanax in my purse at all times but thank God I rarely have to use it now.

I was always in complete fear and anxiety over everything.  Now I am able to relax, but I have gained over 20 pounds in 6 months.  My doctor says it most likely has to do with me not being so anxious which burns calories has anyone had this experience?

At first I was told to take 1/2 of the drug (or 1/2 of the .5mg) which I did and had very little results.  After 6 days I was told to take 1 whole pill.  Which after a week or so of taking I not only slept through the night but I sleep through most of the morning also (usually awakening around 10:30 or 11:00 a.m.).  I have a very difficult time waking up from the drug.  Then when I do, I yawn and feel sluggish until late afternoon.  Don't really get any pep until after suppertime.  I have asked my doctor to take me off the drug.

Xanex has helped in the past and definitely now.  I lost my 39 week old in utero baby in February and still have not felt any better.  Actually worse.  I am extremely worried about this situation and makes my anxiety increase.  Some Psychiatrists have helped tremendously and some have not.  The one I am seeing now is very concerned and and I feel a she does care about my situation.

I had no idea what was going on with my body.  Doctors tried putting me on Zoloft then Effexor.  Both of these drugs made me feel weird, almost zombie like not to mention the panic were still there.  I was finally put on Xanax and this was a miracle.  My panics were finally under control.  I was told that there was a chance I could get addicted to this medication. I am proud to say that after 2 years I was able to ween myself off of this medication with my doctors approval of course.  
Other	BostonSun, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/26/2008 3:06:51 PM	My condition is a combination of chronic (constant) anxiety, acute panic disorder, and chronic insomnia. I have a very high-pressure job in the technology field. My brain does NOT shut off. I had not slept more than three hours in a row since I was 14 years old. I am a survivor of a violent rape attack. For decades, I worried constantly and massive panic would paralyze me randomly (mostly at night). The emotional and physical symptoms (desperate thoughts, racing mind, pounding heartbeat, shaking, sweating, severe nausea) would make me think I was dying or going insane. It was imperative that I got HOME and turn on all the lights and create background noise. It was a nightmare to live like this.  Many doctors over twenty-five years prescribing countless ineffective medications only made me feel more hopeless.  Xanax has been a godsend to me.  I take one 1MG Xanax at night (as needed, only occasionally now) before bed (usually around 11:00) and in twenty minutes I am sound asleep. When I wake up in the morning (usually 5:30) I am relaxed. No longer are fear, worry, and panic my first thoughts of the day.  I experience very few side effects (a bit of clumsiness) but I can laugh at myself and am more tolerant of my own shortcomings.  If panic creeps up on me during the day/evening, I can calm myself knowing that when I get home, I will sleep - and things will be better in the morning.  It also helps knowing I have my Xanax with me in my purse at all times, and if I needed to take one, I can. I am not worried about addiction or increased dosage. My doctor (for the past four years) has monitored me closely, and my 1MG Xanax dosage is working well.  I am very grateful for it. Life, with all its challenges, is liveable now.

That is a complete turn around for me.  Thank you Xanax.

The first 2 years of this nightmare the doctors kept putting me on all kinds of drugs trying to help me feel some kind of ease or comfort. about 15 different drugs before they finally tried xanax. my Anxiety and panic got so severe that I would not leave my house for anything. Xanax has saved my life, and helped me to live a completely normal life. I felt hopless for so long that i was just going to live my life as a recluse in my home and never be able to feel or act normal. So many poeple do not understand these disorders and how severe they can be. from some people i get very harsh critisism for being on xanax, and being on a high dose of xanax (4x2mg/day)but they do not understand that they probably wouldnt be talking to me or seeing me if I was not on Xanax. This medication has enabled me to live a normal happy life versus a scared miserable reclused life!

Its very addictive and I found myself abusing the drug taking it while I was drinking which would really mess me up. I had to get off of it for this reason.

I have anxiety with panic disorder.Finally I was prescribed Xanax 1mg twice daily, which worked very well. I got off the Xanax for a bit, then my symptoms returned and was put on Ativan 2mg 3 times daily. it worked &quot;ok&quot; at first but I was on it for 13 months at that dose and it stopped working as well. Dr. has now put me on Xanax 1mg 3 times daily and again my anxiety/panic attacks have gone away. I like this drug the best out of all I have taken. I now can use only half a 1mg pill 3 to 4 times a day and is working fine.So overall Xanax get's 5 stars in all from me.

I have to say it got me through the worst times of my life.  I have never taken more than quarter of a pill (.5mg)  in one day,  sometimes don't need them at all, but do suffer with panic disorder.I also suffer with Claustrophobia, which is as bad as panic diorder, when the two are combined it is no picnic.  I can say this Medication has helped me get through some very horrible episodes .  However, if I had it to do over again would not take it again.  I do believe it is very addictive.  I for one would like to get off this medication ,but fear the other problems will multiply for me,  so which is worse.  Addicted to a  1/4 of a pill when needed or sufferening with Panic Attacks that make you feel like your going to die and Claustraphobia that is so intense you want to die.  People that have never suffered from this conditions do not understand the complexity of them.  I am 73 years old and right now the last thing I need is seizures etc.  had my share of the severe panic attacks that make you feel like you are going to die with rapid heart beat, sweating etc.  Maybe I should get off this medication while I can.  Does any one have any suggestions?  I am open to finding out the best way to detach yourself from this medication.  I do know my panic/anxiety,claustraphobia are kept in control when I have to take that little quarter of a pill.  I do not take the recommended dosage, which is 3 times a day.  Never had to do that.  Its just a relief to know if you feel an attach coming you have something that you know helps you through it.  Not fun having these attacks.

I take my Xanax at night when I am home from work. I get to  enjoy spending time with my family as I don't worry about work anymore, nor do I let problems bother outside of the ordinary. I am bi-polar so a freak-out could happen at anything. This drug works well with my other medications.

I only take one at night and during a flair  up I take half of one during the day. I work so I can not be foggy. The doctor seems a little reluctant to have me on it, but I almost died on antidepressants. Oh yeah! I''m not depressed. I just hurt

This med has helped me so much. I do not have any side effects and the small dose is just enough to take the edge off when I start feeling anxiety. I can totally function after taking it. I can drive, work, and do all the normal everyday things. I know it can be extremely addicting and if you take it every day, you will eventually have to up the mg to get the same effect. I think if you take this med sparingly and with caution, it can give you great benefits without the risk of physical addiction. I would also advise not driving until you know how you react to it.

As I built up tolerance I needed larger doses. Panic attacks became frequent as my body craved more. Towards the end I would experience withdrawal every 4 hours. I detoxed and it was living hell. It took 3 months before I could think straight and years before I slept thru the night. There is nothing that would make me take this or any benzo again. It should be banned.

Xanax has helped me through some very stressful moments, I only take 1/2 of a .25 mg tab for anxiousness when needed. I would say I only use it about 2 to 3 x a week. Definitely helped me with the following: Flying, social anxiety, helps me to concentrate (I'm a student), just takes the edge off in stressful situations. I plan on staying on this. I'm sorry I didn't try it sooner!

The problem is that it is addictive, and coming off of it, when the time comes will be quite a chore as I have been on it for 15 years.  It is only drug that does not give me tons of side effects and chills me out from extreme anxiety, panic, depression you name it.  Most Docs will not prescibe it anymore though which is a shame.  Also, a woman wrot in August she wished they made this in an extended release form, well the do.  XANAX XR is currently on the market in various dosages.  Great idea, don't have to keep remembering to take the meds.  Good luck.

I have suffered from anxiety for over 35 years.  Mundane chores or job related caused me to break out into sweats. I consider Xanax a wonder drug. I best describe the adverse feeling of anxiety an being very nervous inside and very hot thought my body temp. doesn't reflect a high temp.  Too many doctors apparently haven't experienced the feelings and refuse to Rx Xanax or give very small dosages.  I am educated including a law degree but never practiced because of anxiety and, later, depression.I am not concerned about developing tolerance to Xanax.  There is nothing on the market as good for panic attacks.

I initially started taking it (.25mg) for PMS anxiety. The presc. is written for 1 pill 2x's daily, but I have seldom taken more than 1 in a day. Usually a prescription of 30 pills (15 days) lasts me 2-4 months. I don't take them real often, but when I need them for a bout of anxiety or depression, they are a godsend!

It works very effectively but it also is habit forming. I have been on this medication for about 8 years and frankly, I can not function without it. It keeps my temper in check and allows me to focus. One side effect that I don't like is that it causes me some memory problems. People have told me things while I am on this drug and I swear I do not recall being spoken to. Aditionally, I have panic attacks and this medication is a life saver ! Although the pills are extremely bitter, when having a panic attack holding one under my tougne allows the medication to absorb quickly and bring me back down. Please use extreme caution while using this medication and do not double doeses ... in fact, I split pills and take 1/2 the recommended dose @ a time and then supplement about an hour later. The drowsiness can be a real pain so spacing out the dosages helps me to keep alert. DO NOT mix with booze or pain medication !!!!! I accidentially chose to drink after a stressful day @ the office ( forgetting I had taken several Xanax's ) and I had a full blown black-out and do not recall anything from that night past the first drink. Thankfully, I was with family &amp; friends that recognized what had occured and got me safely home. PLEASE, I can not stress this enough ... Be VERY careful with this medication, follow Dr's orders and DO NOT abruptly stop taking this medication if you have used it long term. The withdrawl effect for me are awful. Peace.

My work is really stressful plus the stress at home.  I only take it as needed...because I feel that if I take every day after a few days I feel worse or feel more anxious.  Also, have been dealing with the problem of diarrea, doctor RX Belldonna, but has not helped much. Just don't eat when stressed, feel nauseous all the time.  Can anyone relate?  Suggetions? Good doctors are hard to find, not compassionate or can't relate to this awful illness.  Considering a psych dr. but am very hesitant, just give up - no hope for a normal life.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/10/2008 6:12:52 PM	I used to take ativan for my anxiety attacks but that was way too strong for me, being a single mother of three I needed something not as strong. I started out taking .5mg twice a day, i am now at .5mg three times a day and it has also completely gotten rid of my insomnia that I suffered with for over 4 years now. I tried everything for the sleeping problem, nothing worked, this does. I also tried many anti depressant for my anxiety/panic attacks and they only made me jittery and more anxious. Some people just don't understand that  some drugs can have an opposite effect on you, like the person who said xanex will make you a crack head...he must have already had that problem and thought this medication would help but when you don't need a certain medicaiton it will give you the opposite reaction, so he must not of needed xanex and that is why it instead of calmed him, it accelerated him. Not everyone has the same experiences with medications because we are all different so its not fair to say that people should or shouldn't take someting, they need to try it for themselves.

After visiting my doctor, and two ENT who told me nothing could be done about this condition, I was talking to a friend of mine and he said that he have been suffering of tinnitus (ring of the ears) for years. He recommendeed going back to my primary doctor and asked him for a Rx for Xanax. I did. The doctor gave me the Rx and stared taking 0.5 mg of Xanax (alprozolam) before bed and 0.5 mg in the morning as told by my doctor. The tinnitus have been reduced by about 90%. Tinnitus is one of the most debilitanten condicion you can experience. I am now beggining to live again!

Panic Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/8/2008 4:40:16 PM	 I have panic attack and depression, with Bipolar Disorder so days are sometimes bad if sudden stress hits and it has been often the last years, This is the only drug that does not give me migraines or cause liver enzymes to elevate and the only drug that works, and my therapy helps me when I get to the real bad dangerous lows, sad point is family is ignorant about mental illness and it is all through my family, genetics and learned behavior one part we can change the other is part of our lives and I out of 9 are the only one in therapy the other are cold, cruel and right out mean and think they know who I am and what I'm about. They have no idea. They push me in to a suicidal mode faster than anyone, and I have to call for help and or pray a lot and ask God to  help me be strong and not let them push me. I try not to take this but when I get at that point I have a friend that tells me to take it. I take 1/2 and then if I does not get better within a hour I take the other. Depends on how tired I am if it makes me sleep most of the time I don not sleep unless I'm sleep deprived. If I have a bad anxiety attack I do not sleep it just takes more to calm me down. Depends on the drama and if it is life threatening, Like when my brother died, it only calmed me very lightly nothing can help that. Only time and God. The ache is a empty whole in my heart and stomach, they tried seroquel and it screwed me up and now I'm diabetic from all the medications but they will not take responsibility for the actions of there drugs and how it damages ones organs. Just from my experince I suggest that you just becareful with what you take,we only have one body and  any legal drug can make a mess out of your body.

But I only take 1/2 pill of 1mg. at bedtime.  Occasionally I will take 1/2 pill in the daytime, but not very often.  Should I be worried about this?  I am 72 1/2 yrs. old.

I would appreciate any informations you could give me.  Thank you...
Panic Disorder	Rowan, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/5/2008 3:47:42 PM	The ONLY benzo that works for me, and I have taken them all. Been on this drug for 20 years. Very fast working, can actually stop a panic attack from getting worse if taken when attack starts. NO side effects for me. After 20 years, on 4 mg per day, 1 mg 4 times a day. To CB, any good doctor is going to hesitate writing you a prescription for this drug. This drug is dangerous as you can overdose easily, and, even worse, getting off it takes months. After being on it 20 years, we anticipate it will take 8 months to a year for me to get off it. But since I have had this condition for so long, and it is the only thing that helps, I will probably be taking it until the day I die. It is the only reason I am alive today. Before this drug, I was suicidal. I had over 20 doctors tell me my &quot;spells&quot; were because I was nervous over something or other. The hardest part is to get a doctor to listen to you and understand what you are going through. The only ones that seem to do this are phychiatrists. Forget MDs and Interns. They don't get it at all.

Panic Disorder	Moderate1, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	8/30/2008 4:47:50 PM	I thank God for xanax. I can't live with these panic attacks and anxiety. I take 1 or 2 mg at once usually depending on how I feel. But if my anxiey turns into a panic attack its harder to control and I just have to take 2 mg and ride it out. Just remember no matter how bad a panic attack is you're not gonna die and it does get better. I started getting panic attacks 8 yrs ago and rarely have them now, I'm just a bit anxious sometimes, and I had it bad! So don't despair it does get better with time. It helps my anxiety very much but is addictive. As for the person who took expired meds, I wouldn't worry too much, when meds expire they usually just lose their potency instead of becoming poisonous although you obviously don't want to take expired meds. Any strong benzodiazapine like valium, klonopin, ativan, etc have similar effects.

Went to therapy and church but could not seem to ever feel calm. This was also due to being in chronic pain. My therapist recommended .25mg 1-2 times a day. It is a miracle how much more like myself I feel. I don't have any problems just taking it as needed. I don't feel like I have to have it and I was worried about that at first. No side effects after the first couple of weeks when it made me very sleepy. Now I can take it as needed with no drowsiness and do and enjoy life again.

Go see a new dr and ask about other drugs, Klonopin, Ativan etc. Xanax is EXTREMELY addictive and you will probably get terrible headaches on 1 side of your brain, almost like someone is squeezing your brain until you take a Xanax.  It has the same effect on your heart, you may feel as if it's in a Vice being crushed! That's the withdrawals and signs of addiction and dependency.  I would not wish this drug on my worst enemy.  A dr attempted to give this drug to my 22yr old girlfriend.  I was so disgusted that he would start a young, healthy female on SUCH a strong and drastic medication.  She had NO business taking Xanax.  She took Lexapro and did just fine.  Ask other people that ARE'NT still taking this &quot;sh*t&quot; as it's called and I'm quite certain they will agree, Xanax is BAD NEWS! I only hope to warn you, I was addicted to this crap for 3 years.  It was NOT fun or pretty coming off the sh*t! M. in Cali.

You will be less likely to get sleepy from it once your body gets used to it. I have taken the generic and it works as well for me as the brand name. Works well, but it only lasts for about 6 hrs. I wish they made it in a time release formula, unless there is one and my doctor does not know about it.

THIS HAS WORKED WONDERS FOR ME! I'M CURRENLTY TAKING XANAX 1MG FOUR TIMES A DAY, I'M ALSO TAKIN ZOLOFT 2OOmg EVERY NIGHT, AND INDERAL 20mg FOUR TIMES A DAY, AND THE RESULTS OF USING THE THREE DRUGS TOGETHER HAS BEEN A GOD SEND! MY MOOD HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTALLY. ALTHOUGH XANAX IS VERY ADDICTIVE, BUT I WOULD RATHER HAVE TO BE ON IT LONGTERM, THAN SUFFER EVERYDAY.

I had an eye exam while on Xanax back in 2006 and thought nothing of it.  In 2007 I went off Xanax during that year went for another eye exam because I was having trouble focusing and was dizzy a lot. Dr's told me I have MS, well went back on Xanax and low and behold I can see through my glasses without getting a headaches and I can focus and I am not so dizzy, so maybe I really don't have MS.

I take it only as needed. I have had some problems with having blackouts. I would have this problem if I was to take the drug and go to sleep and happen to wake up with less than a few hours of sleep. I would wake up in a black out not remember doing anything. my boyfriend was unable to even tell i was in a blackout. I would talk, move and seem very normal. but if i was to take the drug and not go to sleep I had no problems and it seems to help.

My attacks are very intense and can last anywhere from 15-45 minutes. The medication seems to take at least 20-30 minutes before It takes effect, and by that time the attack is almost over. It does calm me, but it just isnt fast enough for me.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	txrhandic, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/6/2008 5:10:29 PM	I started having anxiety attacks in February. One night the ambulance was called as my breathing caused me to pass out. A little oxygen, and I was fine. Two nights later I was in the ER with chest pain. I knew I was dying. I am 22 years old and was admitted in front of the 50 or so people there because they thought I might be having heart problems. EKG showed normal. Chest x-rays showed normal. Pain in my rib area, tightness and pressure on my chest and shoulders, and irregular breathing and heart beats. My blood pressure was 98/68 and my pulse was 140. The doctor gave me a Xanax .5 mg and my problems were solved. (At least until I could be given something else.) He prescribed me Lexapro with Xanax and the Lexapro didn't work. I was to take the Xanax 3 times daily, but instead just took it as needed with the attacks, and in no time, they were under control. Was then placed on Zoloft, and given Xanax (again, to take every 8 hours, but I still only take as needed) and life has become great again. Zoloft is taken between 8 and 9 PM and Xanax if needed (sometimes for sleep, too) and my life ROCKS! My husband says he can finally stand me again, and my mom (who lives 2 states away) says she no longer worries about me at night. It is my miracle drug. I will never go above .5 mg however, because I know plenty of strung out people who got that way from Xanax bars. I would recommend it to anyone with serious anxiety attacks. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder.

It works fast and I no longer notice any side effects from it.  Initially it made me tired but now I don't even notice.  It is habit forming but as long as the person taking it does not abuse it, then there should be no problem.  Definitely do not drink alcohol with it because it increases the effects of alcohol and drinking while taking it can actually cause death.  I made the mistake once of thinking it was out of my system and had a shot... big mistake.  I felt quite intoxicated from 1 shot.  My anxiety has been worse lately and so I am considering going on a daily medication for axiety (the xanax is as needed only) and my Dr. prescibed Paxil but I have yet to take it.  I have read reviews about it, and quite honestly... it almost scares me.  From what I've read, it doesn't seem to work as well for people in my age group (19-24) If anyone else is taking paxil and in my age group... please send me an email if you can and tell me how paxil has worked for you.

Involuntary Quivering	Jenerationx, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	6/26/2008 6:09:20 PM	I take this for Hereditary Essential Tremor which is combined with myoclonic seizures and dystonia (all part of one hereditary disorder). It also helps the panic attacks and anxiety that I have. I was taking 2mg/day for 10 yrs and recently went up to 3 mg as needed which I take maybe 2-3x a wk. *Note: I have a high tolerance for meds: I'm 5'4 and 140 lbs and I take 1 mg in the morning and 1 in the afternoon with no problem and it's always been that way. My 6'4&quot; 195 lbs boyfriend had to take 1mg for insomnia and fell asleep for 16 hrs.*The amount you take will depend on your tolerance and why you are taking it. If you are really uncomfortable with developing an addiction, keep in mind that you are under a doctor's care plus there may be another non-physically addictive drug you can try. This is a personal opinion and experience, but I find that the people who have become psychologically addicted a)use xanax as a  recreational drug and/or b)do not follow the prescribed directions. Respect xanax for what it is: a drug.  I find it really helps my tremors so I can write, type, speak a little better, feel less &quot;jumpy&quot;. It also helps my anxiety so I don't become severely agoraphobic again.

It worked well for me until the nut dr took me off of it last year, he said I was addicted, he gave me extened release xanax, from that I had problems, I am now back on regular xanax, but only as a trail until my appointment next month, I feel better on this drug, I sleep better and have more energy, my mood is better, more even tempured, and I feel calm, the only draw back for me is that I am diabetic and it causes glucose levels to be unstable, also raises blood pressure longterm. 
Anxiousness associated with Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	4	Male	45-54	6/23/2008 4:42:06 PM	Been using it since 1999. It helps with panic attacks, but doesn't stop one. Just makes it easier to get through the attack, so I take it only when needed plus one just before bed. No noticable side effects.

Ive tried the Wellbutrins and Zolofts over the years but the side effects were brutal.  I have a VERY stressful and high end/demanding sales job with many face to face meetings and presentations.  I almost lost my job because I would start having a panic attack in the middle of meetings.  My DR. gave me a RX for .25's a few years ago. I took them and they helped, but stopped because everyone told me I would get dependent on them.  DONT listen to other people, everyone is different and everyone has different tolerances and addictive personalities.  This is the ONLY RX ive tried that doesn't make you feel &quot;drugged&quot; and you can actually function normally.  Ive never felt like ive been addicted to them and it is comforting to know I have them when I need them.  Point blank they work, dont increase your own dosage and dont drink with them...if you get anxiety attacks or panic attacks, and you feel like you cant even walk into a restraurant, Xanax can help you....and they work quick and last a good amount of time. I believe people who get addicted to them increase there own dosage or abuse them. If you think they have stopped working, unless your a DR., go see one!! If your DR. was understanding enough to prescribe them to you, he/she will listen and help.  I hope this has helped others out there with the horrible disease...most of all never give up and think positive. Your not alone, there are more of us out there than you think!!!

My doctor put me on 1mg 2x a day.  I didn't realize how addictive it is until it was stolen from my purse on a weekend no less.  After two days without it, I was so sick, I thought I was going to die.  Until I filed a police report and gave it to my dr. did I get a refill.  I finally found a great physican that see this as a problem. 2 mg a day is to much for my age, 57.  This really scared the bejesus out of me.  I'm now in the process of cutting down &quot;slowly&quot; to .5 as needed.  I'm taking .75 per day now and cannot wait until I can control this med instead of it controlling me.  I don't recommend this med to anyone unless it is absolutely necessary and under a strict doctor's care.

Xanax at .5mg 2 x day has worked well for over 2 yrs. Now I see demishing effectiveness for anxiety. I take 1mg when I have to drive unfamiliar roads with hills or bridges. Had therapy called flooding but fears are now worse. Ativan worked better several yrs ago.  Seeking specific Doctor who is exp. with my problem. Will continue Xanax because it has helped me hold on. Had traumatic life and am alone with my thoughts. This has, am am certain, been the cause. Still seeking a better medication or the virtual reality machine in my area.

I also suffer from brain aneurysms. (3) One has ruptured and was clamped 2 years ago,I have one other that needs surgery soon before it ruptures.  I have been blessed and lived through the operation. Xanax is one of the medications I take every day to keep nervous and panic attacks down. I feel that it helps me a great deal.  Without it I would be scared and worried all the time.  It also helps me get some sleep.
Panic Disorder	Mary, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/10/2008 2:42:27 AM	I've taken Xanax 0.25 mg 3x a day for 22 years. I have panic attacks with out them. Xanax has it's drawback being it's very addictive. I have had several wonderful doctors who know people without a valid reason to take anti anxiety meds will abuse them and those of us who have valid reasons for needing to take them will not as a rule want to stay on them any longer than needed.  Xanax saves my life by letting me live it on a daily basis. It frees me to leave my house rather than being held a prisoner as I was for so many years. I've not needed to have my dosage increased (yet). I do worry whenever it comes time to change Dr's always  wondering if the next doc will be as knowledgeable about what works for me as the others were. Xanax also helps me sleep ay night.

It took years of trying diffrent medications before i was started on xanax, The medicine has helped so much, i was concerned about dependece, but i have stoped taking it, when i became pregant and i had no ill side affects. I did not restart taking the drug until my son was over a year old, I have been back on the drug now for about 6months. I am thankful for this drug it has given me the ability to do things that i had not been able to due to panic. LIke be in large crowds, handle panic attacks that come out of no where. And to anyone who has ever delt with this disorder you know how horrble it can be. You littlery feel like you are having a heart attack, cant breath, your hands go numb and so on.

It has helped me cope with my general/ social anxiety problems and panic disorder that has resurfaced again after many years of being fine.  I love it because it makes me feel normal and calm again, however, I just wish that it would last longer!  It usually only lasts about 4 hours for me so I end up taking .5mg 2-3 times per day.  I also take Xanax at night with Zoloft because Zoloft tends to make me an insomniac and the Xanax helps me get to sleep at night and rests my mind.  Even my husband has noticed a difference, saying that I have been a lot more calm lately.

When i returned home, I felt very cold and began shaking all over my body. I went to hospital ER and was given a half mg of Xanax three times a day for a couple of days and I recovered completely. Whenever i felt very cold or overworked thereafter, the same episode recurred and the Xanax worked great. My doc told me to take 0.25 mg of Xanax once a day regularly and indefinitely. The same episode still occurred once in a while and I had to take extra two more Xanax to stop shaking. Sometimes 3 more tablets. I wonder if taking one tablet of 0.25mg of xanax every day even when I don't have any shaking is ok for me or it might develop dependency. I want any expert's recommendation on this subject.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	35-44	4/16/2008 1:41:35 AM	Xanax (Alprazolam) is an effective sedative for my transient anxiety.  I usually take this medication (0.5 mg) before board meetings and other public events where I am on point; sometimes I take it before getting on a plane, especially if I want to rest during flight.  The only drawback for me is that this medication has a long half-life; I wish it were shorter-acting.  Occasional drowsiness 12-24 hours after use.  Otherwise, it's a very calming medication, but potentially habit-forming.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	cblpn2005, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	25-34	4/14/2008 5:34:37 PM	My MD prescribed me 0.5mg initially, then increased the dosage to 1 mg when I lost a family member. As a way to cope with my loss, I highly abused the 1 mg dose (I went through 90 tablets in just over a week's time). The withdrawals from this was complete hell, as I went through major psychosis, mood changes left and right, and so on. I managed to make it through withdrawals on my own and with friends as my support system. I am now on 0.25 mg as needed, and feel much better. Xanax can be great for anxiety/panic attacks, but can also be highly addictive, physically and psychologically. Remember to use caution when taking it. I regret abusing it and using it as an excuse to cope with losing a loved one, but after the withdrawals, I no longer want to experience something like that again. Taking a low dose only when needed is working just fine for me now.

I have to take a combination of meds and it is very dangerous if you are not careful.  please be aware of the addictive behavior it can cause.  I do not take as much that is prescribed to me and I find this medicine calms me down and helps me sleep.  I take 2mg pills but generally break it in half.  I take it 2-3 times a week.  This medicine has HORRIBLE withdraws and can lead to hospitalization because of the nervous system.  I cut my dosage back and have not felt &quot;addictive&quot; since that first episode.  I believe each individual knows their limits and you should get to know yours. do NOT take more than prescribed!! This medicine does work.

From .05mg to 1.0 mg. works wonders. Never could sleep before this. It is addictive. If I do not take it at bedtime I cannot sleep.

I have only needed it 1 time since being on Lexapro to stop a panic attack.  It worked within 30 minutes!  This is fantastic for me because before my attacks lasted around 1-3 hours full-out.  Then occasionally I have taken half a pill if something is going to be happening where I know an attack could be triggered.  Everytime it has worked and I am very pleased.

I used to have severe panic &amp; anxiety!! Thought I was dying of a heart attack or stroke! This is my lifesaver, and others, due to severe rage, to the point that I have wanted to physically hurt people, in fact have done so to my hubby. Have been on 3mg. X.R., because taking 1mg. 3x a day, left me feeling panic when it wore off! This has saved me! I am also taking Lamictal to help w/ the rage, also a great help! YES, your body does get addicted, I have been on it for 5 yrs.? Am seeing a psych., as my G.P. said she could not continue to write rx's. As far as bodily addiction, I ran out for 6 days, cause I couldn't get an appt. in time, I thought I was gonna die!! It was AWFUL!! Had to take massive pain pills from a friend to help calm me! Not much help! Should have gone to the E.R.!! Like I said, this has been a TOTAL godsend for me!! Just don't abuse! My psych. has me in every month, to refill. It does take effect very quick, which is great!! It does make me very sleepy, I am o.k. &amp; work, but get zoned, &amp; on days off, I do sleep way too much! I am going to ask my Dr. to put me back on wellbutrin, as I have heard great things about it, I just didn't give it enough time! All in all, this is the ONLY thing that that has helped w/ panic &amp; anxiety!!!

Feel like I'm having a stroke or something.  My Dr gave me xanax 0.25 2/day.  It is better than any drug I have ever had.  It keeps me calmed down.  Now, if I could just get the neck thing resolved, I'd be just fine.  One Dr says it is spurs in my neck, the pain mgmt Dr says it's arthritis in my head????  Never heard of that.  So, I'm still working on a cure, but xanax has saved me from going crazy while I get this resolved.  I try very hard to take it only when needed, some days I take 2, other days I can get by with 1.  It is a miracle drug for me.

I read that some people were told by their doctors to use Klonopin with this drug when its effectiveness waned over time.  Do not add Klonopin as medication with Xanax because it, too, is extremely addictive.  And yes, Xanax dosage must be increased over time to be effective, but this is a mistake as well.  Xanax withdrawal can harm your central nervous system, can cause extreme anxiety much worse than the original anxiety, and can cause seizures when stopped.  Please listen.

I'm now on 2mg qid which is a problem to get off of as it is very addictive buy nature, and must be reduced very slowly @0.5mg per every two months.

I have tried antidepressants over the past 12 years none of them gave me the freedom, to be able to sleep, go to work, have no anxiety but psychiatrist do not want you to take this because it works and it is not as expensive as the antidepressants...something needs to be done about it.  seriously,,the pharmaceutical companies have got to stop using us as guinea pigs and raping our pocket books

I helps with sleeping when our mind is racing and helps to calm you down. I take it as needed instead of a drug that has to be taken every day.I started off on a small dose 1/2 of a .5 and have not had to increse it.I has been a life saver for anxiety nd depression for me.

After some time I asked for something different for sleep.  He wrote for Xanax. Everything was fine.  I noticed the diarrhea had dwindled to once a month or so from 3-4 times a week with Levbid and Ambien.  It was so drastic a change I looked for a reason.  There it was, on the insert for Xanax.  I can't quote it now, but it said that Xanax can help in the relief of IBS. And for me, it did. Aahhaaaaaa.

The dosage was to little at first but worked perfectly once it was adjusted. I take primarily only as needed and never when I don't need it. I take it in combination with Prozac and Effexor and I am very grateful for a physician who has helped me keep my head on straight. I have not had any problems driving or working while on it, if anything I am much clearer, relaxed and more focused since using it. I don't suggest it for everyone and that you should find what works best for you.

Recently I had to switch doctors due to insurances and my new doctor will not refill the Xanax because he says .5 mg is entirely too strong for anyone to be on and if taken for a long time could be fatal.  Needless to say I'm finding a different new doctor.

It is extremely addictive and horrifying to stop taking; the withdrawal from this dangerous drug is the worst thing I have ever experienced.  My Dr. overmedicated me over a period of time by increasing the dosage I was taking and I when I stopped taking it, I ended up in the ER and could not eat for days and lost so much weight in such a short time, it was scary.  Please -- never take this dangerous drug.  It should be taken off the market.

I did once and couldn't walk straight or talk straight.  THAT GOES TRIPLE TIME IF YOU PLAN ON DRINKING AFTER TAKING THEM.  YOU FEEL GREAT THAT NIGHT, BUT YOU BETTER HAVE 5 ALARM CLOCKS TO WAKE YOU UP, AND YOU WILL FEEL THE EFFECTS FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE, AT LEAST UNTIL LUNCHTIME.

It never really made me tired b/c I only would take it as needed. Wore off really quickly though; about 2 hrs. Found I was experiencing more panic attacks, even before I was due to take another. I was prescribed .5mg 3 times daily. I requested to be taken off of this drug because they would of had to increase my dosage and I can see how they have the potential of making one addicted. On different meds now and feel okay so far.

I took this at .05mg 3 times a day for 1yr and I believe it may have saved my life  along with the consuling sessions with my Dr.   loses some effect after a few months but near the end of my usage I would drop down to 2 then 1 per day and when the anxiety would flare I would go back to 3.      Ativan is my medication now and this has a longer effect up to 6-8 hrs for me versus 2-4 on the xanax.

It truely addictive! I know 2 people who overdosed on it. The problem is that I started having panic attacks and the dr. offered valium or xanax. I had no choice to take xanax bacause valium doesn't help me and if I didn't take something for the attacks I felt like i was having a heart attack and do now as i write this. my mind is telling me i don't WANT to take the pill but the chest pains and shaking wont stop. I'm calling the dr. tomorrow to find a different drug or else i'll be addicted. ya know, it's a shame that dr.'s know how addicting this crap is but yet they pass it out like CANDY !!! don't start taking it! you'll never get off of it.

If you ever start relying on this drug it is impossible to stop without help.  Never stop taking xanax &quot;cold turkey&quot;, especially if you have been taking them for a long period of time. The side effects are harsh. Sometimes even seizures.  The xanax is very effective, but I wish I would have tried a different medication.

Continued with that dosage for approx. 2 months until symptoms were under control, now use as needed. Never needed to increase dosage. Have had no symptoms of addiction, will occasionally feel lightheaded if I haven't taken it for a while. This med was a great help during a difficult situation in my life, and a great resource to have on hand when I feel I'm completely losing control. I will be calm in minutes. Does taste terrible, though!

No one diagnosed it PROPERLY (anxiety, not depression)until I was in my early 30's, after being on countless antidepressants to no avail.  Being put on Prozac has absolutely changed my life for the positive.  No more anti-depressants unless I've hit a really tough spot in life. Have been on the same dose for 20y.  The trick is finding a doctor who is not afraid of precribing it, as it supposedly has such 'addictive' properties.  I do not have an addictive personality so it has not been a problem for me.

But, it's soooo addictive! Even if you don't have addiction issues, don't try it. It increases GABA in the brain, so if you take too many, you black out. Seriously, if you've got anxiety, panic, or trouble sleeping, there are alternatives to an addictive drug. Ok, off to a Narcotics Anonymous meeting I go because of this xanax stuff...

Panic Disorder	masonbamace@yahoo.com,  Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male		1/28/2008 6:28:39 PM	Xanax is a very dependant drug. I have been on the 1mg tablet for about 10 yrs then went on to the 2mg twice a day and it seems that the 2mg last alot longer. But I would tell anyone if you dont have a problem with your nerves and dont need this drug to just leave it alone. Ive been hooked on lots of pills and xanax is one of the worst pills to run out of!! They say that you can run out of pain pills and it wont kill ya but if you run out of nerve meds it will and if you have ever been thru withdrawalls you know exactly what im saying but I guess I would have to say Im 30 yrs old now and been on them sence 15 yrs old I will probably never know life without xanax so again if you dont have to have them please thank God above you dont have to have em.Good luck to all and God-Bless
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety		5	5	4			1/28/2008 3:38:18 PM	This seems to be the problem about taking Xanax, if you have ever had a panic attack you know that it feels like you're having a stroke, so when you feel like that and you take xanax, that's just it, panic attacks are over, shakey hands, all anxiety without reason is over, but from then on your life pretty much depends on this medication, trust me, it is the type of drug that you will know if you haven't taken in the last 10 hours or so. I know that i am addicted to life with xanax, but the trick here is not increase your dosage ever. the momment you do that then you're in big trouble (rehab problem). Take it only if no other treatment works to stop those panic attacks, if your attacks doesn't come everyday then don't take it everyday, take it only when you start to feel it coming. if you have any tendency to abusing or taking a little more than your supposed to. don't even start with xanax. it's all about controlling yourself, wether it's the panic attacks you have or the xanax addiction.

The first time I ever had a panic attack I was at work and I started crying for no reason.  My boss had a xanax and she give me one. It helped me instantly. I went to the Dr. an he perscribed me .5 mg 4 times a day. I tried the dose he told me to take but that was a little much. So I take 1/2 of one 4 times a day. It seems to work well for me. But I have to admit they are very habit forming. If I don't take one afterthe last one I took wears off I get very nervous. When I am about out of meds I get really anxious to where I will get them from someone else that has some. These people that only think they need them once every week or so don't need them at all. I am very sensitive to ssri's like lexapro or effexor so I don't take nothing else to manage my nerves. If I had to do it all over again I would have never started taking xanax. I feel dizzy all the time and drowsy and hungry,thats why I have gained 20 lbs. I am mostly more nervous in the morning. My panic attacks have been so severe I have had ct scans done on my brain, all kinds of blood work to check my thyroid and thank God everything is normal. I think I am going to need help getting off of these pills. They make me feel sometimes like I am so irritable I take things out on my kids. So my advice is to never take them unless you really, really need them. Because they are very hard to get off of without some kind of intervention.

I sleep better since on xanax. I would not want to take more then prescribed, I can see how it could get addicting.

I needed to address the stress that got me to the point of having anxiety attacks rather than treat the symptoms. Since I am not much of a medicator this works very well for me.  I take 1.5 mg when life/stress starts to get overwhelming.  I'm very pleased to have a tool at my disposal which helps when and only when I need it.  It's empowering to feel like I am in control again.

I took this medicine to help me sleep, to stop me from grinding my teeth @ night, &amp; TMJ. When I was on this medicine, I was prescribed 3 1mg @ bedtime. Everything was fantastic until my DR died suddenly &amp; I had no more Xanax. The 1st week was literally hell. I could not sleep @ night for more than 45 mins. The mornings felt like an acid trip. Very dizzy, vomiting, &amp; panic. I still don't feel &quot;right&quot; after 3years. I feel that being &quot;cut off&quot; of Xanax cause some type of &quot;brain damage.&quot; I will never take it again, not because it wasn't helpful, but because not having it suddenly was VERY VERY bad. Valium is MUCH better....not as harsh as Xanax.

My temper and very anxious personality I mean I go and hide from people when they come to visit just to tell you just one of the many things its just really calms me without no side effects except for eating sweats thats about all. I use it for sleep and thru the day for my attacts. Overall best medicine for my condition. And I dont take for a high or buz!

I have changed antidepressants several times, SSRI's work well for me, but I seem to need a change every 4-5 years. Currently, I take Cymbalta 60mg.,Norpramin 25mg. x3 and .05 xanax x2-3.I don't always take my xanax depending on the day. On a normal work day I might take 2(I'm in law enforcement)versus if I'm  going to a wake of a close friend I may need one per hour. I have gone off this medication for periods of time for various reasons, like surgeries, etc. and have never had any withdrawal symptoms, though I was warned that I would. Personally, I have not found this to be an addictive drug.

So far, this has been the best combination for me.  I still struggle with knowing exactly when I should take the Xanax, but I'm getting better at recognizing symptoms as they emerge.  I do have a little bit of lower abdominal upset when I take it though. 
Panic Disorder	 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		1/3/2008 7:06:40 PM	For many years I had sudden onsets of feeling disoriented, rapid heartbeat, perspiring, and unable to move when out in a restaurant or concert, for example. Tests showed no symptoms/diagnosis of thyroid problems, etc. Brain chemistry seemed scrambled for no apparent reason. Xanax has improved my life immeasurably, no side effects and I am monitored every 3 months with my doctor. Superior medication and like no other.  Beware of Cymbalta, Pexeva, etc.--dramatic side effects, but not Xanax for panic disorder.

Anxious	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	1/2/2008 8:00:25 PM	This medicine is fantastic for anxiety if used correctly. However it's not a good idea AT ALL to use this with alcohol, as I've found this medicine becomes very dangerous when mixed with it. Other than that, it's a great medicine.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/2/2008 4:12:47 PM	I take this medication when I have extreme bouts of my PMDD. It really helps to take the edge off when you have had a busy day at work and come home to uncontrolable children! This is a life saver when it comes to keeping my temper at bay.
Anxious	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/31/2007 6:37:08 PM	I did not suffer from depression, although I was drinking excessive due to lack of sleep. Once I took Xanax, it enabled me to sleep and I quit the booze now for 3 months although I stll have a beer or glass of wine but never to excess. In addition, I wake up refreshed and energetic, which was severely lacking for so long. It's a mild medicine. I believe many people have anxiety and worry but feel the fear of humiliation and worry, they will not seek help, so the stress will just continue day after day after day. Until I sought help, I would not be well today.

Panic Disorder	cybercin23, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	12/30/2007 9:15:12 AM	The first dose that the Dr. put me on, would take off the edge of my panic attacks somewhat, but once she took me to a little bit higher a does the panic attacks are under control within about 15 minutes, I also have to use it to help me sleep at night, otherwise I have horrible insomnia where I don't sleep for days causing the panic attacks to worsen with lack of sleep. She had me on ambien but I slept for maybe an hour while taking that medication and then the hr of sleep I did get I had bizzar dreams and at a couple points during these dreams, would be hitting my husband or up having conversations I didn't know I had.

That was the hardest hurdle to overcome when trying to get back to my happy me I knew before.I have been taking xanax for over 5 years now the only downside is the addiction end of it. I hope this helps.

Panic Disorder	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/25/2007 11:45:57 PM	I've had anxiety for nearly my whole life, as far back as I can remember, now 30, I've finally spoken to my DR and first prescribed Lexapro, which made me feel like I was completely crazy and had very negative side effects. Then he prescribed me Xanax and feel completely at ease. Still have small anxiety attacks occasionally, but I don't depend on the drug alone to make me better, just make sure to keep a positive attitude and know that you do have control over your own body! you just have to work at it.  I have been taking it for  about 3 months and think I am ready to start weaning off and geting back control on my own.  I always thought I was alone with anxiety but there are any so many people just like me and Xanax has been fantastic, but make sure to use it as a crutch to help through bad or stressful times. We all have it in ourselves to make ourselves well! Stay strong!

The side effects are loss of balance. The big deal about addiction is over stated I think. Wspecially at my age. Why shouldnt older people enjoy a few years of peace?

I WENT CRAZY. i felt like i was on a bad acid trip. at one point i actually thought i was dead and this was my hell.  i wish i had died that time. my worst nightmare is to lose control of my brain (thoughts, reasoning, etc) so the withdrawal producted such profound paranoia, did not know if this was happening for real)

My doctor perscribed xanax after other sleep medications left me with residual [drug hangover] effects. I take a .5mg xanax and sleep well for 7 to 8 hours and wake up feeling well rested and none of the bothersome residual [drud hangover] effects. As for some of the addictive qualites assocaited with this product I have not felt any of that. I sometimes go on vacations for 10 days at a time and I don`t have any desire at all to take it then; when I don`t need it.

I was scared out of my wits. I felt like someone I loved was about to die. I couldn't get off the couch. I was terrified for no reason, and it really scared me. I missed an entire week of work, sleep, and my daughter's birthday. I walked directly into a clinic I had never been to before when they opened in the morning, with no appointment, and pleaded for help. I was prescribed Prozac and Xanax. The Prozac caused me to be tired 24/7, which is not an option for me with a small child, so I decided to stop taking it. The Xanax has been effective in controlling my general level of anxiety overall. Not only do I appreciate it, my family does too. It has saved my life.

I don't recommend taking more than you absolutely have to. In higher doses, you don't feel as good. I keep it to .25mg-.50mg a day, sometimes less. Do not ever quit this med cold turkey or without DR. approval. It can cause seizures!

I took my dosage before nightime and slept the night through- I did not feel anxious the next day and was better able to deal with my mothers renal disease, nursing home acceptance and faulty health insurance.Health care in USA caused my anxieties from all the hellish stress and Xanax and prayer got me through these first three days and it was all overnight.

I'm on a low dose that I can double up if I need to but thus far I haven't had to.  I've tried others and have been very pleased with this.  Definitely do your research and keep an open and honest line of communication with your Doctor.

Now i sleep with no problem, and feel refreshed in the morning without being drowsy!! Hope this was helpful...&lt;:)

I was finally put on Xanax three times a day...about 5 years ago.  I truly have to say this medication was a miracle to me.  And I honestly could not live one day without it!  My only complaint is the quick immunity to the drug.  I started out 5 years ago on .25mg... then in less than a year, it went to .5mg... now, for the past 2 years I've been taking 1mg, 3 X's a day.  I've heard people complain about it making them tired.  For some reason, it does not affect me this way.  It makes me hyper?

I have used it on an as needed basis, .25mg usually 1-2 times a week for about 3 weeks now. I use it in addition to therapy and relaxation techniques. I am somewhat apprehensive to take it because I am afraid of becoming addicted/dependant. I have suffered from anxiety as long as I can remember, only I was using food and avoiding social interaction to cope. Now that I don't do those things, sometimes I get too wound up and use the xanax to calm down.

I was reluctant to take to much since I've heard it is highly addictive.  Sometimes .5mg were not quite enough to overcome the worst attacks but usually .25mg did the trick.  Made me less drowsy than I thought; it was more that it allowed me to calm down enough to sleep.  It is a definite sanity-saver in those moments when you're convinced you need to go to the emergency room for a million imaginary reasons.
Anxiousness associated with Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	13-18	11/26/2007 10:10:28 PM	I took Xanax RX about 20 mlg for three months to alleviate symptoms of anxiety disorder. I took a time-released dose, which put a complete stop to my panic attacks but ravaged my ability to function proficiently. I experienced extreme short-term memory loss, to the point that I would forget what I was talking about in the middle of a sentence or where I was going when I drove to the grocery store. I started to decrease my dose with the intention of alleviating these negative side effects, and I realized I had become completely physically addicted. So I kicked Xanax cold turkey (though this is not recommended by any physician) and experienced nearly debilitating withdrawals; very painful migraines, inability to sleep, and increased panic attacks. I do not recommend this medication in any high dose, or on a daily basis. AWFUL.

I was recently shamed by a prescriber into titrating down from 3.5 mg per diem to 1.75. (Yes, there is a lot of stigma attached to taking this drug.) I made the transition OK, but there's no disputing that it is addictive. Every patient on this med long enough probably has to try to establish what percentage of its effect is attributable to satisfying the craving and what percentage is allocable to anxiety reduction, and then decide whether or not to seek an alternative therapy. I have tolerated Xanax well over these many years, though, and haven't found side-effects to be a problem.

It was a life saver! I took this medicine for about 5 years. No adverse side affects. I had lessened anxiety, panic attacks and mood swings. My family doctor however decided that he would no longer write prescriptions for Xanax anymore and cut me off cold turkey! I am retired from the emergency medical field, so I knew what was about to happen: Withdrawl. I had a Very Hard time finding a doctor that would write Xanax scripts. However I did find one and he keep me at my usual doseage and all was fine. Later on he prescribed Clonapin, it works almost as well as Xanax with no side affects. I no longer have to take Xanax or feel the need for one. Before if I would be away from home and remember that I forgot my Xanax I would start &quot;Jonesing&quot; for one, like the need for a cig. or something like that. Overall I think what I am trying to say about Xanax is: It is a great drug that does what it is supposed to do, however it is HIGHLY addictive. So just be careful with it. Clonapin helped get me off Xanax and works almost as good. I don't know why so many doctors are afraid to give Xanax, it's easy to know if the person is abuseing it. Doctors need to wake up! If your going to give it to someone for more than 2 weeks, you need to be prepared to make it a lifetime prescription or at least take it away when the person taking it says they no longer need it. Withdrawl from Xanax would have been hell if I hadn't found another doctor.

Mostly it made me sleepy during the day, even on low doses. But it worked ok. Eventually I developed insomnia, and started to take it before bedtime.Worked well, as time went on I need more and eventually got dependent on it, to the point where I could not sleep without it. I explained to my doctor how bad it had become, and she said I was addicted and that it was time to get off. So now I am weaning off slowly, while taking another non-addictive med to help stave off the withdrawal symtoms, which include racing heart, racing thoughts, insomnia, forgetfulness, lack of concentration, etc.. I need to get myself completely off of it.I am not saying this is a bad medication, however, just monitor your usage and stay in touch with your doctor.
Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	11/17/2007 12:07:25 PM	I am taking this for pretty much every reason listed.  Restless leg syndrome, anxiety, and trouble sleeping.  At times if I do not take it at the right time of day or if I forget to take it, I have an increase in anxiety.  This can be very uncomfortable for me.  This has been the only drawback for me.  Possibly I need a higher dose that will last through the day better??  However it has been extrememly helpful otherwise, getting to sleep is much easier, and I don't have any problem with the twitching in my legs anymore.

I suffer from sever anxiety especially in social settings. This works wonders for me as it takes away many of the physical symptoms releated to panic attacks: sweating, blushing, trembling. I only take this on a needed basis, maybe 2 - 3 times a week and only .5mg. Careful if you're going to be drinking when on this, have a DD!

Now when I see things are starting to get crazy I will take a 10mg xanax and I dont get upset nearly as easily and I am confident I make more correct decisions when I am put on the spot with multiple questions because the xanax allows me to process the problem in the same amount of time I used to would have given the most obvious and sometimes wrong answer without getting all shot out of shape.

(Anxiety, without agraphobia).  After may yrs, learned from super expert psyc - alcohol in family, or I was born with damage to chemicals in brain:  did not cause it, cannot cure it but i can cope with it....thanks to lots of therapy, can identify anxiety, prepare/rid myself of it, with behavouir and xanax......!  Am 67 now and know quite a bit about me.......am not sure I want to know this stuff, but at least I know how to feel 'okay'!  Thank whoever for this medication - not to be abused, but such a life saver for me early on - now a regulated part of life.  Have had triple bypass, have diabetes and nerve pain (take Lyrica) - and other meds, but I learn all I can to make me feel right, good and positive.  It has not been easy!!! thanks for listening

It does not make me sleepy like a lot of people report.  The only side effect I noticed from this drug is that it kills my sex drive.

This is truly a wonder drug. No side effects, it calms my fears and irrational anxiety without making me totally loopy, and I've never had to increase my dose. Though sometimes, when my problems aren't severe, I do break the pill in half and only take a half dose. I think it's a miracle drug, and I hate to hear about idiots who use it to get &quot;high.&quot; I don't understand how anyone could get high from something like Xanax.

Once or twice a month I have uncontrollable anxiety along with depression.  i/2 of a Xanax is usually all I need to regain a feeling of normality.  Rarely do I take more than 1/2.  It works great, and I can go on with the rest of the day feeling fine.

Ended up in mental hospital for observation after 3 yrs of constant attacks.  Kindly doctor put me on Xanax and attacks went away almost immediately.  Xanax saved my life as I was unable to control attacks and suffered them daily. I only take 1 a day so maybe it is all mental, but nothing helped up until then. Felt like I could not go on any longer.  Now it has been 12 yrs and every day is a delight.  Also happily married again. Also never had to increase dosage.

Xanax is the only medicine of this type that has been a constant in my life.  I've been thru internal medicine, psychiatrists, psychologists, cardiologists, pain mgt., pulmonary docs etc.  I do not have a heart, pulmonary or psychiatry problem.  I do see my PCP, spine surgeon (for spinal fusion a few months ago),and a pain mgt doc. They all agree that Xanax is the best for me.  I've tried almost all the other meds but they do not work for me.  Within 1/2 hr. my heart rate and breathing comes back to normal and I can resume my normal life.  It took me 4 yrs., 3 hospitals' testing (I live in OH) and 7 docs to finally attest it is a chemical imbalance which causes the anxiety/panic attacks.  I don't think I will ever be taken off Xanax.  I never know when or where the attacks will come.  The docs have explained that the adrenaline in my brain gushes out in spurts rather than evenly.  My heart rate was 165, couldn't breathe, had to sit up to sleep a little and hands were fisted &amp; numb when awakening.   Also, I do believe it might be hereditary because my Mother, Brother, Daughter and Son have had attacks but not as severe or constant as mine.  None have been prescribed medications so far, except my late Mother.
Panic Disorder	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	10/26/2007 3:51:15 AM	Symptoms: Heart palpitations, derealization, slowed thinking/cognitive ability, lightheaded, brain fog, memory loss, panic attacks, obsessive compulsive, and depression over the course of 2 months.  Within two days on Xanax I was 95% back to normal.  Makes me sleepy though.  Wonderful drug for me, I'm pretty much back to normal and happy again!

It is fast acting w/no side effects for me, possibly because I have taken it for a long time.  I had already gone through all the other typical vertigo drugs when my Nurse Practioner prescribed it.

I take 3 mg a day no more sometimes less. But i did have to learn about how addicting this drug is, my husband picks it up from the pharmacy and hides it and gives it to me as prescribed. Use caution and do not go cold turkey if you decide to go off this drug, it will make you feel like you are dying.

Panic Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/2/2007 3:13:50 PM	Xanax gave me my life back.  I function very well on it with no side effects.  I've taken it off and on for many years now, and have been able to overcome severe agorophobia.  I take a low maintenance dose (.25 mg per day, split into two doses) that enables me to adjust it according to my stressors of the day.  Due to the low dose, I do experience a few break-thru panic attacks, but they aren't as severe and respond quickly to another half pill (.125 mgs).  The low dose keeps me functioning normally, while also keeping me from the side effects and withdrawal symptoms that I've heard about, but never personally experienced while taking this drug. It works for me.

I was only on .25 mg so if my episode was severe sometimes I had to take two pills to make me feel better.  I was taking these during a very difficult period in my life.

Panic Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/24/2007 7:50:54 AM	I have suffered panic attacks on and off for the past 2 years, and at first was given other drugs that made me prctically immobile, like a zombie. I went on no drugs and things settled down, then I was hit by a taxi and now take zannax on a daily basis and it is really helping most of the time.
