It should not be on the market. I wish the FDA would take it off the shelves. In Europe and Canada this substance is illegal. :( I wish it was here too. This stuff is just awful.

Then, I decided to try this different compound of lithium.  Immediately it caused great anxiety. I think i might be beneficial for other patients, besides bipolar disorder, but for me the lithium orotate compound works the best.

This axiety was so bad I ended up in a phych ward.  So, I stopped it and will ask my psychiatrist.  I have quit Lithum as well because both drugs have interactions with prozac--so that just make me more anxious.

I am not Manic Depressant..Using Lithium helps me to be somewhat balanced. It use to be like I'd talk so fast the words couldn't come out fast enough.  Lithium has helped stop that, but my body acts slow and I put on over 60Lbs

Other	shione, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	5	4	Female	55-64	9/7/2009 9:53:14 AM	I have been taking 1 5mg in the morning,I started out taking 1 in the morning and 1 at night but it made me dream too much and kept me from a sound sleep. I do get head aches, but have found that if I take an asprin I am fine. I am taking it to help with brain fog,and I think it is working i will wait till I have finished the bottle,but so far I do feel more alert.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	8/14/2009 10:39:38 PM	it gave me a headache and made me feel as if i was going braindead. a week after using it i no longer wanted to leave my house and was extremely nervous about everything. this stuff is dangerous, probably because it's bound to an aspartate ion (which is a neurotoxin) or whatever, but it's very reactive with the brain and feels as if someone is tickling the brain. don't take it and don't trust the TAHOMA CLINIC. They'll tell you no one has ever complained about feeling bad from taking lithium aspartate or orotate... trust me thay have. that person is me. i aslo have a friend who called and complained.
