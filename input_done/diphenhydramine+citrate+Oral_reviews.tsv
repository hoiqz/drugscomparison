Chronic Trouble Sleeping	peter mack, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	65-74	9/21/2009 2:13:52 PM	I have been using Alka-Seltzer PM for some time as the other brands don't seem to work for me.  If I take one tablet I get about 4 hours of sleep, but will fall asleep again in less than a half hour.  If I take both tablets I will wake up feeling very groggy for at least two hours.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	tbailey, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/2/2009 7:37:25 PM	I have always had trouble sleeping and in the past have used Tylenol PM which rarely worked. I finally checked out the active ingredients at the store and decided to try Excedrin PM because of the Diphenhydramine citrate. The first night I took two and slept for 14 hours. When I did wake up I was vary drowsy for at least an hour and a half. Now I only take 1 around 7pm and I go to sleep around 10:30 easily. Works great.

Other	kathryn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/7/2008 3:07:00 PM	I suffer from Insomnia and have found that Diphenhydramine Citrate works much better for me than Diphenhydramine HCL. D-HCL makes me so groggy all the next day, but Citrate does not! I've read many posts around the internet - I'm glad I'm not alone. We are all searching for D-Citrate without pain reliever in it. Can't find :(
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	sleepless on nights off, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/27/2008 12:46:51 AM	I don't know how diphenhydramine HCL and diphenhydramine citrate differ, but I am very restless with the HCL version and awaken very groggy for hours. I take only 25mg =1 tablet. When I take 1 tablet= 38mg citrate variety I rest well, not groggy. I did take a second tablet once in the middle of the night after awakening feeling fully rested, and even then not groggy next day.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	2/11/2008 8:08:07 PM	This is the drug that is in Advil PM. I have used this a couple of times to assist in sleeping as another medication I am taking sometimes causes insomnia. I find it does help me to fall asleep although it does leave me groggy when I wake up in the mroning.
