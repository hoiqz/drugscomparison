Inflammation of the Eye Following Surgery	terryd, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	7/25/2012 1:34:11 PM	I had a mini shunt implant and was prescribed this med for inflammation.  Was told I would be on it 4x's a day for apx 90 days.  It's been 2 weeks and have experienced mood swings, headaches and nausea. I get crying spells, and am very depressed, which is so not like me.   I am also on 2 other drops, so not sure which one is causing the effects, or if it a combination.  I'm concerned about the long term effects of steroids on other organs. I didn't know about applying pressure on the corner of the eye to prevent it from getting in to the system, thank you for that information, I will start doing that to see if it helps.  
Inflammation of the Eye Following Surgery	NeverAgain, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	7/10/2012 3:04:32 AM	I had a trabulectomy with shunt &amp; was on this every 3 hours for 3 weeks to prevent swelling. It made me so enraged I was bordering on being a lunatic so filled with anger that I felt like I could bite someones face off if they just looked at me the wrong way! I was screaming at the top of my lungs for minor annoyances! I felt like I wanted to crawl out of my own skin. It is like PMSing 1000 fold. It also made me so depressed all I wanted to do was sleep! I think it made my other eyes vison worse- It kept getting worse and worse over 3 weeks time to the point I cannot read with my unoperated on eye! I'm hoping that side effect goes away! I didn't need eye glasses for that eye before using THIS! If you have to use it remember to hold pressure with your finger on the inside corner of your eye for 2 to 3 minutes- this prevents the medicine from getting into your system-Not all Drs inform their patients on this- I was seeing Eye drs for 4 years before someone finally told me that was the proper way to put drops in! I would not reccomend this medicine unless you have no choice and have to use it after surgery. I'm normally a calm, peaceful person who abhors anger and violence- this made me extremely agitated, enraged, &amp; depressed.

Hope it will resolve or this was to no avail.

Have always used this since the start. The sad part of the need to use it so often and so much, is it also causes one to need cataract surgery, which I needed in both eyes about 3 yrs. ago and will most likely need in the future also.Also, it's so bitter and when it hits my stomach, causes nausea.

Not sure what causes this inflammation, but it can be extremely painful.  Don't use the generic! Doesn't work and there are studies.  I was on a generic for several weeks and the condition only got worse, for the first time in my 20 years.

Other	sjhg, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	7/3/2011 7:27:41 PM	I had two cataract and two DSAEK corneal tissue implants total. Started this drug (along with others) more than six months ago at the start of these four procedures, and never had an infection or any problem, so I guess it works. Still using it three times/day. However, I am getting big hemorrhages in the white parts of my eyes very regularly - not painful really except discomfort just before they let loose -and it looks really awful! They take a couple days to go away and meanwhile it feels like there's something in my eye - that annoying feeling something is there. Anyway, my ophthalmologist says it's not an eye problem, its a blood pressure problem, but my BP is controlled at a low level and it's always fine when I check it shortly after the hemorrhage occurs. The drug sheet says an adverse reaction is conjunctival hyperemia; could Prednisolone be causing this?

The drops taste horrible, when you put a drop in an eye right after press on your eye duct ( corner of your eye ) with your finger for about a minute.  This helps the medication from draining to the back of throat- which taste awful and will give you an upset stomach. Have had to take once every hour for weeks with adding dilating drops for my cycle.  It does work- but seems I flare up more when i completely stop.  Have asked my doctor to keep me on a low dose to use at least 3x's a day to help keep it at rest.  Hope this helps.

I, too, get an awful tasting post sinus drip which I believe has caused tongue soreness.  I also get a whiteish film in the corner of my eye which is stubborn to remove.  I have been using this product for three weeks now with no results.  Uveitis is not easy to clear up so I give the Prednisolone Acetate a little more time.

While it tastes bad for about 15 minutes, is a bit inconvenient to instill every 4 hours and has caused me to gain 6 pounds in the past 2 weeks of taking it, the redness is gone.  I'll find out in 2 weeks if the inflammation has gone as well.  If so, it was well worth it.

I, too, am dealing with the white gunk in the corner of my eye, the awful taste in my mouth after usage, and the sinusitis problems.  I also have an upset stomach and additional digestive problems following usage.  I am in the second week of my prescription, using the drops 3 times a day.  Then I will go to twice a day for a week, and then once a day for a week.My vision is blurry so it is hard to tell how successful the cataract surgery was.  I was also told to use otc artificial tears between the prescribed doses.

Other	Dee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	8/1/2009 2:41:50 PM	Not satisfied at all with this medication.  It leaves a whiteish film in eyes that goes to corner of the eye.  Is this suppose to be left in the eye or is this film to be taken out?  No directions at all on the Rx box nor on the pamphlet inside the Rx box.  Afterwards I would have itching and burning and pain down into my sinuses all around my entire eye clear up to my forehead.  Is this a sign that the medicine is working?  Or is this a sign I cannot use this medication?  I wasn't thrilled about putting a steroid into my eyes in the first place!!!  I wonder if this is causing more harm than good.  My eye doctor said I have meibomianitis.  When I looked up what that actually is...I had none of the symptoms.  I think I was misdiagnosed.  I have only used it twice.  I refused to use it four times a day!!!!
