I complained to my Primarey care Dr and he prescribed a 2nd medication to make the tremors go away. Why should I have to pay for another prescription to get rid of a side effect that innopran xl caused in the first place?If your Dr prescribes this please ask him for somthing else so you won't have to go through this and have to take a second medications so you won't look like you have Parkinson's desease!

As long as &quot;I&quot; remember to take it, it works very well.  I was taking one per day of 80 mg, but now I am taking two a day.  The only thing is that I have to take one in the morning and one in the evening because the 160 mg was to much at one time.  If you can get through the side affects and get the right amount it works well, but be sure you work with your doctor.

I finally went to the doctor and he prescribed this and naproxen for me.  I am very satisfied with both.  I still get migraines but only once a month and it is usually because i forget to take the innopran.

Lessened the severity of my migraines but did not get rid of them. 1 pill a day is easy to use. Still looking for a preventative that works without horrible side effects

This would happen at least 3 times a week. I don't know if I'm having a hot flash or the excessive sweating is caused by the InnoPran XL.

Every medication we tried just made me sicker.  Then what I call my wonder drug was great.  Taking two pills a day at 80mg was more than I wanted but it worked.  Now I can at least function everyday with very little pressure every now and then.  Gook luck
