Other	tmellison, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	1/19/2011 6:02:36 PM	I was prescribed this medication just last week in an attempt to reduce the amount of narcotic pain medications and NSAID's that I have to take for severe pain in my shoulder and neck. I was very skeptical. I'd tried other creams and patches with little to no relief. After just one application my skepticism changed to delight! Although I am not fond of the heavy &quot;menthol&quot; aroma, the relief I got from this medication makes it worth it!!

Joint Pain	MiddleLife, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	1/15/2010 8:21:28 PM	I had a really severe knot in my back due to stress and this worked perfectly; I applied this twice before bed, two nights in a row and  got great relief; also I had a stiff joint in my hip and this helped loosen it up and so far I only have a very small amount of stiffness; very effective!

I have tried physicial therapy, accupuncture, pain medications, topical lidoderm pathches, thermacare patches with little relief.  My treating physicina gave me Dendracin Cream.  I apply the cream over my neck in the morning and evening.  My neck feels warm and relxed all day.  I even feel the tingling in my skin the next morning in the shower. I don't nned those pills and I can keep working.  I thank my doctor every time I see him for giving me Dendracin.
Other	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	8/21/2009 11:27:29 AM	I was injured at work and I have suffered with severe back pain, neck pain, and headaches for 2 years. Even surgery did not relieve my pain.  I got hooked on Vicodin and other drugs and NSAIDS caused an ulcer.  Epidural injections helped some. Only Dendrcin helped me get off of the drugs and get my life together.  I am more active and I feel a lot better without all of those drugs.  I still get epidural injections sometimes when the pain flairs up.

Dendracin has helped relieve my pain better than any oral or topical medication I have tried. With Dendracin, I can be more active with no side effects.  the relief lasts several hours.  I can be free from the effects of the pills.

Pain medications made me sick.  Dendracin relieves my back pain and improves my function beter than anything else I have used.  I recommend Dendracin to anyone with chronic back pain.
