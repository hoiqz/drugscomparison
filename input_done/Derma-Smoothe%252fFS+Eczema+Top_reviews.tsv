Atopic Dermatitis	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female		7/2/2010 1:28:18 AM	I used this medication on my daughter. She developed very bad eczema. Her skin was extremely rough. After a few weeks of using this medication everyone in my family noticed the complete difference and how smooth her skin was. I highly recommend this for infants w/ very bad eczema

It doesn't seem to matter if I use if for days in a row it doesn't go away and when you stop for a couple of days it comes back. Also, trying to sleep with a shower cap on everynight is not comfortable and it takes 2 or 3 shampoos to get it all out of your hair in the morning. I'd really like to find a better solution. He gave me a shampoo to use, we'll see how that works.

He's now 4 years old and this is our miracle product.  I cannot remember when my little boy's skin was so smooth and clear.  We're only on day two of using it!

I have had psoriasis of the scalp for a very long time and this is the best medicine that I have come across. The only thing is that it is expensive even with insurance. I am trying to find the website to see if I qualify for assistance in obtaining the medication. If you have skin problems, try it. You will be surprised.
Atopic Dermatitis	0-2 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	0-2	3/14/2009 4:19:37 PM	I've been using this for 4 days on my 4 month old. He went form looking like a burn victim to looking like a doll. I have to start weening him off it and I'm a little nervous that it'll come back. 
Atopic Dermatitis		5	5	5			2/19/2009 5:30:14 PM	I've been using this on my 4 month old twice a day and it works awesome.  The only thing I'm disappointed about is her doctor told me to slowly get her off of it and since I've started that she's breaking out again.

I had it for over 15 years and nothing would work until I tried this. I have been clear of psoriasis for a year and every once in a while I'll have to do spot specific treatments, but nothing like before. I can wear black again!

But over all I don't think it improved it all, just helped to relieve a few symptoms. I didn't use it longer than a month due to the fact it was oily and gross and I found it very very difficult to apply to the scalp area. 
Atopic Dermatitis	Mindy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/2/2008 9:10:10 PM	We use for our 2 1/2 yr old.  While I would prefer to find the source of the problem for her eczema vs. slapping on medication, I have to say that this has worked very well for her.  When she gets an outbreak, I apply the oil immediately following a short bath and within 24 hours her spots are usually cleared up.
