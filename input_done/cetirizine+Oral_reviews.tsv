I moved to an area with trees everywhere, city nicknamed &quot;Arbor City.&quot; Suddenly nose went wild, sneezing terribly. Realized it was allergy to tree pollen. Started to take loratadine, after a while I had to double the dose to even make it work.  Ceritizine went to over the counter drug status. Started using it. Find it better then previous med, still having occasional sneezing breakthrough.

Normally he goes to bed around 8:30, after a few days of taking this med and reading up on side effects he stay up til 12:30 or 1am. Will discontinue and find something else.

Seasonal Runny Nose	Cece, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	4	Female	55-64	5/7/2012 11:08:51 AM	I started taking this med a few days ago for seasonal allergies.  I previously took Singular, but the cost was outrageous and my MD prescribed Cetirizine to replace Singular.  I take it at night so don't notice any of the drowziness mentioned by other reviewers.   So far I have had no side effects and this med seems to be relieving allergy symptoms just fine for me.

I am more tired durring the day than I use to be. I usually take it at 9pm, but last night I took it at 1am. I woke up dizzy and felt a little confused. I took it again tonight at 9pm. We'll see what happens in the morning.
Persistent Hives of Unknown Cause	Sofar, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/29/2012 1:25:35 PM	If I take my pill every morning, I will not become covered with hives. After the first few weeks of drowsiness and weird itchy soles of my feet, the side effects disappeared. I know if I have forgotten to take my pill  by late afternoon- I will get edgy and easily irritated, and soon start to feel the onset of pre-hives...generalized tingling and skin twitchiness. I am currently undergoing treatment for acquired hypothyroidism, of which chronic hives are a sign of autoimmune Hashimoto's. I'm hoping that the hives will cease once my meds are fully adjusted.

Then I really started to notice that I was becoming more lethargic and if I took it close to bed time, I would quite often have trouble sleeping (despite feeling tired, I would lie awake in bed for hours some times). Not sure if it is related, but I have noticed that my overall feeling of health has become worse over the past year or so. i have been taking this for about 3 and 1/2 years now. One a day for that whole time.Just stopped taking it about three days ago and already notice more energy (slightly) but more importantly to me, sounder sleep.I would suggest someone try or consider other medications prior to using this.

Other	hotwhls314, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	8/11/2010 1:42:51 PM	My doctor gave me the prescription for Zyrtec to take to help with allergies for both indoor and outdoor, to relieve watery eyes, sneezing, etc.  They said to take for 2 weeks to see any results.  I took the medication for the 2 weeks, no problems.  I continued to take the meds, still no problem.  I did get sick starting about the 3rd to 4th week.  I didn't associate that the meds would be the problem.  I continuted to take it and kept getting sick.  Nauseated to the point that I would vomit.  And it is rare if I vomit.  I also had symptoms of fatique/tired and most recently dizziness.  And this didn't occur until after I had taken the medication.  Finding the side effects and others with the same side effects, I now know that is not something else other than this medication.  I'll see if there is something else that can be done for the allergies other than taking Zyrtec/Cetirizine.

It doesn't contain all of her allergy symptoms but makes her life more managable. I do notice that she itches more when we take her off of it for awhile, so I would say it does nothing for long-term relief.

I could breathe thru my nose, which was wonderful, but was still not 100% clear as I would have liked.  Made me extremely groggy - even when taking it before bedtime, I had a hard time functioning during the day. Also, gave me heart palpitations.  I tried splitting a pill in half to see if that lessened the grogginess and palpitations while still relieving the stuffiness.  That didn't work - I still had the grogginess and palpitations (but it still helped my nose). So, I will not be using this any longer.  The negative side-effects of grogginess and palpitations outweigh the benefit of a slightly clearer nose.  I will discontinue use of this and see what else the doc can prescribe.

Finally after all this time he was written a RX for Singulair. I had to get samples cause my insurance was fighting not to pay. The nurse suggested Zyrtec. How do I explain to someone that thinks she knows it all that I have given him this and it DOES NOTHING. I hope we get some relief from Singulair and the insurance will cooperate. They gave me some generics but upon investigation one is Flonas. Both generics are inhalers or nose spray and I am not happy about that. Hope we can get things straightened out.

Seasonal Runny Nose	Rob, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	4/13/2009 3:49:15 PM	I tried using Claritin, but it did nothing to relieve my symptoms.  Benedryll made me too sleepy.  Soon as I tried the 24 hour OTC version of this, it worked great the first day.  My eyes didn't burn, my nose stopped running, and no more sneezing.  Throw in generic Sudafed PE for stuffy nose, and I've been pretty much allergy free.  So far, I haven't experienced any of the side effects mentioned on the box.  Definitely recommended for mild to medium allergy sufferers.  If you have severe allergies, I'd suggest the perscription strength.

Hives		5	5	5			9/21/2008 12:56:02 AM	I am prone to hives if I have a nervous problem or over-indulgence in seafood but got over this problem for quite some time. But then the break out of hives happened after I took the solution, golytely for the prep for my colonoscopy and have not stopped since. I took benadryl but once the drug wears off I have the hives. Even took the prescription a course of the prednizone but no relief either. Then my doc presribed this cetirizine hcl 10 mg tablets and they help quite immediately. But the other day I forgot to take it and the hives came back the following morning. At least I don't have to take the pill within hours.

It has only been a few days, but we have noticed no change in the relief that my daughter gets. We are quite happy with the results.
