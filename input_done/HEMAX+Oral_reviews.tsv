Anemia from Inadequate Iron	Mia, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	8/28/2012 9:40:25 PM	Eliminated my Anemia after only a few weeks. Ive got lots more energy from the B12. Downside is as the others have said, abdominal issues. For me, awful heartburn as well. The drug is also not covered by insurance.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/4/2012 2:51:41 PM	This drug is a life saver!  I was experiencing such extreme fatigue and joint pain that I could hardly walk.  After two weeks on the medicine I have very minimal joint pain.  I take the pill with a little bit of jelly to make it go down easier.  The jelly seems to have eliminated the burping and the horrible after tastes.  I hope to stay on this forever.  The only down fall is that my insurance does not cover it

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	35-44	2/28/2012 12:34:00 AM	The medication is definitely effective for eliminating anemia. (For me, in one month.)  Hemoglobin from 9 to 13 in four weeks on med.  The pill is huge, hard to swallow and has an awful taste.  After almost four months on this medication, it still makes me nauseous.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	5/17/2011 11:57:00 AM	It is a large pill but does go down easy with water. Side effects like the bad taste and burping do happen. I take the pill right before bed so I sleep through all of the side effects. The other problem I had previously with iron suppliments was constipation. Thankfully the stool-softener in Hemax is strong enough to combat that side effect.

Because of my nosebleeds due to (HHT) I have been able to keep up my iron level as well as my anemia is well control.  That one thing i dislike is the after taste but it does go away

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	JJ, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	12/2/2010 11:57:06 AM	I'm now at one week on Hemax.  Don't have any blood work until next week so don't know if it's effective yet.  Taking one pill isn't bad, but I was told to take after eating breakfast...with full glass of water.  Leaves me feeling nauseous, with stomach cramping, abdominal pain and burping with a foul after-taste that doesn't go away. So far it hasn't releaved my fagigue, in fact I feel even more tired after taking the pill. I hope to be able to avoid this pill and/or any other iron tablets.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	Pam, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	45-54	3/6/2010 7:23:04 AM	The prescription says you should take on an empty stomach, however if it makes you ill, you can take with the food. The first day I took it on an empty stomach and I had that metal taste all day when I burped, I also had smelly gas! The next day I ate a grapefruit 30 minutes before taking the pill, drank a whole glass of water and I didn't burb a lot and when I did it did not have the metal taste. I have been doing this every day since and it works for me!

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	hemaxtrip, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	3	Female	19-24	9/18/2009 10:16:37 AM	My doctor gave me hemax because my hemoglobin was at 9.6 after a month of taking it it went up to 11.5. It is a huge pill and it gives me constipation, you must take this drug with a lot of water. If not you will feel constipated. Other thing that this drug does it makes me burp with a metally taste in my mouth, it's horrible that makes me nauseas. I hate this pill. If it wasn't for my hemoglobin levels going up I wouldn't take the pill, horrible side effects.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	Feeling Better, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	2	4		45-54	12/30/2008 7:53:26 PM	It knocked out the anemia very quickly when regular Iron tablets did not. Easier to take 1X versus 3X a day. It also has stool softener in it. Tough on the stomach. Take at night after eating if possible.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	Liliann, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	19-24	2/21/2008 12:02:29 AM	This medication is not easy on the stomach when it is empty side effects are nausea, vomit and diarrhea. as well as if you do not eat frequently nausea will persist. the only way to keep the nausea from returning is to eat a full meal with the medication.also you must drink lots of water.in general the medication does take care of the general symptoms like the weakness or fatigue in general or during exercise, general malaise and sometimes poor concentration, and the shortness of breath. I have improve on the color of my skin i used to have really pale skin now i look more pink more natural.in general the medication does work and i can cope with the side effects.
