Pregnancy	Laura, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/18/2010 10:28:28 PM	After taking this three days I experienced a terrible rash on my face.  I started with a few bumps on the morning of the third day then by that evening my whole face was broken out with HUGE bumps, Even down my neck.  I took two benadryl and called the pharmacist and he confirmed that I was having a allergic reaction to this drug.

It was easty to take and did not make me sick. I decided to quit taking the pill because it has unnecessary ingredients, one of which is propylene glycol. My registered dietitian told me to avoid PG especially when pregnant. It also contains titanium dioxide. I know, that with small quantities of these ingredients, the pills are likely harmless but I decided not to take the risk. Found another brand with no unnecessary fillers and am eating flax seed to get my omega 3s.
Pregnancy	KC, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/10/2010 2:13:47 PM	Unfortunately, I had a terrible side effect a couple of days after I started taking this. My lip and part of my face became hugely swollen. I immediately called my doctor and stopped taking it and the swelling went down after 12 hours or so. My doctor said it could be due to the fillers in the drug.

My new doc gave me samples. It actually makes me sleep well and my use restroom regularly. I paid $40 with my insurance. Prenate DHA made my stomach upset and had difficult time to go to restroom. I just love it

Pregnancy	Care719, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/16/2010 2:35:22 PM	My doctor gave me a few samples of different prenatal vitamins and let me pick which I liked best. This was the only pill that I haven't felt ANY side effects from! No nausea - even if I take it on an empty stomach. No fishy after taste at all. And the pills actually smell like tootsie rolls! I'm very happy with Prenexa and would highly recommend it to anyone whose had issues with other vitamins.

Also, they are huge and look like they would be very hard to swallow. It's not that bad though, since they have that coating, they swallow really easy.
