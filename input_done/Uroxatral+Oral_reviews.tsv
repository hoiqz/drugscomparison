But the expense was too much. Switched to Rapaflo but almost immediately my ejaculate disappeared. I'm shooting blanks. That's too freaky for me. I'm going back to Uroxatral and hoping my semen stream returns. I feel dehydrated with Rapaflo.

Tried Flomax but was not happy with the side effects during sex - ejaculation was internal.  With  Uroxatral sex is more normal.  BUT, urination control is definitely not as good as with Flomax.  I take Uroxatral at night and most mornings urination is hesitant and I have to go back again in a few minutes.  Am considering taking out the prostate.

Cysto revealed nothing wrong with bladder etc. Now going for CAT Scan of affected areas. My Opinion is that the drug is causing the side effects. blood in semen and retro ejacualtion with blood now in urine.

Retrograde ejaculations, low blood presure at times (90/50) with dizziness, and muscle tiredness when BP is down.  I think I'll go for a green light laser treatment.

Lately I've experienced itching on my arms &amp; legs,some ringing in my ears.Energy level also seems to be an issue too with some dizziness. Nightly erections occur when there is an urge to pee.

ED problems seem to be neither better nor worse and am not taking any additional meds for this issue. Major issue that may or may not  be related is severe skin itch, speciallly on fore arms and lower legs. I have no idea if this is a reaction to med and would like to try coming off med to see if itch subsides.

I can now go as long as 4 to 5 hours before urinating.  I used to do this once to twice a night, now sometimes once in the  night.  The part where it helps to increase the flow rate does not work for me. I've only used 1 month, but it's only helped the frequency problem.  Side effects for me have been dizziness, dry eyes, stuffy nose at times,  but all are minor and seem to come and go. I usually am not affected by side effects, but this one I am. My sex drive and erections are still o.k. so the drug is o.k.,  Now the doctor wants me to take Avodart in combination with Uroxatral, since I am still not having a good urine flow and my bladder will not empty well.  I am worried about the Avodart, It's not had a lot of good reviews on WEB MD and it seems to reduce your sex drive, and I am a liitle worried about the side effects.

This eliminated my urinary problems but also eliminated ejaculation.  My doctor switched me to Urotraxal several years ago.  This also effectively treats my urinary symptoms, but ejaculations have returned and I am less likely to get dizzy when standing up.Only problem is that my medical insurance classifies Urotraxal as a tier 3 drug. My copay is $65 a month.  I am going to try Doxasin (a tier 1 generic) to see if it will also control my symptoms.

Improved urinary symptoms, but can't stand the head pain at the moment. Headache started about 6-8 hours after taking pill, so though it was a coincidence yesterday, today it happened the same # of hours later, and was much more severe. Don't usually get headaches.

It has greatly improved my urge to pee at night. I generally get through the night without getting up but occasionally I do get up to urinate.  I have always had sinus/allergy problems and I take Zyrtec daily.  Both drugs seem to work well and I can't point to any specific reactions to either one. During the first three days of taking the drug I had some fairly severe but limited in duration dizziness.  That has not occurred since the first week. Sooooo, it is working and I will keep taking it.

Enlarged Prostate with Urination Problems	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	45-54	4/15/2008 10:07:13 PM	Urologist prescribed Uroxatral for descreased urinary flow extending over a long period of time.  Within one day of taking Uroxatral, I am asymptomatic.  My urine flow has greatly increased.  I also noticed that Uroxatral has produced better erections; that the flacid penis is more full, and; the testes hang lower.
Other	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	55-64	4/11/2008 11:09:27 AM	My bladder presses on my prostate urging me to go.  Flomax was limiting my semen discharge.  So my doctor put me on uroxatral.  I have found that with Uroxatral I get up two or three times a night.  With Flomax I would get up once or twice a night.  If I want a sexual encounter I stop using the Flomax.  I am going back to using the Flomas.  The results are better for me.

Enlarged Prostate with Urination Problems	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	55-64	2/18/2008 6:25:36 PM	I was using Flomax. I was able to achieve a good erection and engage in sexual intercourse, but Flomax prevented me from ejaculating  when I climaxed.  My doctor switched me to Uroxatral.  After using Uroxatral for a month, I was able to ejaculate again.  After using Uroxatral for another month, I was NOT able to achieve an erection sufficient to penetrate.  I need to see my doctor again.

My doctor upped the dosage to two tabs daily. One Am and one Pm. Both times with food. It has dramatically improved my condition. It has almost completely eliminated my nightly visits to the bathroom. I no longer get unforefilled urges to urinate. Much stronger stream when urinating.

After just the first use, I urinate much more freely and do empty my bladder more fully, but the burning sensation of needing to urinate is worse. If I use the drug longer, I'm hoping this sympton will lessen.I have tried Flomax and cannot see any difference.
