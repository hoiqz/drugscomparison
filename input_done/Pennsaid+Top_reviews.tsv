Knee Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	Mountainskytop, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male	65-74	5/17/2012 4:47:15 AM	Only using this for a week so far and not very happy. It does not relieve much more than 50% of the intense knee pain. If this continues I will go back to my Dr. for a more effective Rx!
Other	ww, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/18/2012 8:07:23 AM	I was given this drug for plantar fascitis, but the skin in the area around my heal and behind my ankle does not allow Pennsaid to penetrate the skin and was not effective.  Even after rubbing for several minutes it continues to stay liquid on top of the skin and doesn't penetrate.  My doctor gave me another drug that was in gel form and it seems to work better than Pennsaid because it pennetrates the skin better.  Maybe it works better on skin in other areas of the body, I don't know.

I have arthritis in both knees (which was not in the drop down menu)and NOTHING was helping, not even narcotic pain medication. I am allergic to ALL NSAIDS, so I am pretty much screwed in that area. This was just an experiment that turned out to be WONDERFUL for me. I also use it on my low back pain (S-I joint) and L4-5 disc area, and the pain is GONE.

This topical drug seems to stop the pain that oral meds can't seem to touch. Not covered by AARP; terribly expensive.

Knee Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	Moe, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	3	Female		7/19/2011 10:21:35 AM	I can not take NSAID.  Had a Antiflacit reaction.  My mouth broke out in sores.  Healed up in a week when I stopped the Pensaid. It goes to your blood through your skin and if you are alleric to NASIDcauses a reaction which my Dr. did not think it would.
Knee Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	Robinann, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	5/27/2011 11:36:55 AM	After getting an ulcer, I had to stop taking Ibuprofen. My doctor recommended Pennsaid because of osteoarthritis. This product works well. It is a bit messy but I'll take messy over pain. I had right knee replacement in 2009 and recently developed tendonitis in the area right above the knee. My orthopedic surgeon also recommended Pennsaid for this problem and it seems to help. In a couple of months I am having knee replacement in the left knee.

The Ibuprofen caused a bleeding ulcer. My doctor said I should have no problems with this topical application.I have osteoarthritis in my left knee and am scheduled for knee replacement in the summer. This drug works surprisingly fast; it seems within 10 minutes of applying it, the pain has subsided.I use (3) 10 drop applications and rub in on the affected area of my knee and round the knee area. It is a bit messy and you do have to wait for the application to dry before you put any clothes over the area. I find the relief lasts 3-5 hours depending on how active I am.

I have tried lots of topicals. all including Voltaren and Counterpain provided v. little relief, useless.I get Pennsaid from a Canadian friend. This is giving me the best relief from pain. It is recommended for knee pain but I use it on knees, knuckles/fingers and ankles as well. Works on all.

I USED A FEW DROPS ON BACK OF MY NECK, SHOULDERS AND MY HANDS FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS. I USE IT ONCE A DAY JUST BEFORE I GO TO WORK AND IT STOPS THE PAIN COMPLETELY. SO FAR I HAVE NOT HAD ANY SIDE EFFECTS FROM IT. BEFORE I WAS TAKING MOLTRIN BY THE HANDFULS AND STILL HURTING AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS. MY STOMACH WAS GIVING ME PROBLEMS FROM TAKING SO MUCH MEDICATION BY MOUTH, AND NOW IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME ANYMORE SINCE I STARTED USING PENNSAID.I AM SO GLAD I HAVE THIS MEDICATION TO USE AND IT WORKS 100%

Knee Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female		9/11/2010 6:45:46 PM	This is a Nsaid recommended for joint paid caused by osteoartritis.  Topical Nsaids containing diclofenac are Voltaren gel, Flector Patch and Pennsaid, a liquid. The oral version has been linked to liver damage.  The patch should be safe to replace aspirin and other oral Nsaids that could cause stomach problems.  The FDA approved the first topical Nsaid in2007 containing diclofenac.uqtnwk

My knee has bothered me off and on since then. Now I am very overweight and started an exercise plan, I was in constant, terrible pain.  I had to mentally steel myself to the pain before I got up from a chair! I went to see a pain management doctor, who gave me pennsaid to try.  First application reduced pain.  Next day I got out of bed and didn't realize I didn't have pain!!  It's been a week now and I have NO PAIN in my knee for the first time in YEARS (except for times when I had steroid injections in the knee).  This stuff is miraculous!!!

Joint Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	6/22/2010 8:47:07 AM	I've had RA since I was 5. I've had 8 knee surgery's and both shoulders reconstructed from RA. My doctor started me on Pennsaid and it works but only for a short while. I just had knee surgery in Feb. and it's already swollen again from RA. I can't seem to find relief anywhere! :(
