Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/4/2012 7:40:39 PM	I started taking Natazia in march of this year (2012) and after 6 weeks I did not have a period.  I went to the doctor and she confirmed I was not pregnant and my uterine lining looks fine, just thin, which she attributes to the hormones in the pill, and says is a very rare side effect.  I have mild cramping towards the end of the pack and slight breast discomfort but nothing too bothersome. Best of all I never got the nausea and headaches I traditionally had when taking other types of the pill.  I have no complaints about Natazia and after nearly 6 months on it it seems to be working for me great!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/28/2012 11:58:33 AM	I have tried at least 5 different pills all having different side effects such as spotting throughout the month or 2 weeks straight, but I have not experienced this with Natazia at all! The first month I did have a week where I was a complete psycho but that went away in month two. The only thing is that I get a headache a few days before it starts. Now I can pinpoint my periods to almost the minute that I should get it and it lasts about 4 days. Love it! Hope it stays like this! 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	jhm2012, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	25-34	8/16/2012 8:21:33 AM	I was put on Natazia to stop weeks-long heavy bleeding that just wouldn't stop. While that condition was scary, the first two pills of Natazia were worse. I felt like walls were moving around me. The next few were better. But about a week and a half into the month, I started getting insane migraines and regular chest pain. I decided to get off of this pill pretty quickly even though it stopped the bleeding like it was supposed to. There's another issue you should know about. With other pills I've taken, if you miss one, you can generally resume. With this there's a good week where if you miss even one pill by more than 12 hours, you have to stop the entire pack. And of the pills I've taken, this is one of the more expensive -- so you certainly don't want to throw away almost half of an unused pack. I'm having surgery for my underlying issue. And then my husband and I hoping for children. So I won't likely be back on pills anytime soon. But if I ever do, it won't be Natazia.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	PalmerKS, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	8/6/2012 11:23:32 PM	My doctor prescribed me Natazia after trying about 4 other birth controls for continuous bleeding.  I am 22 and bleed for months at a time and then have a few days off then start again.  We have tried various BCs but nothing works.  This like the other BCs didn't work but did stop my cramps.  After a few weeks on this pill I began to become very anxious for no reason and I couldn't figure out why.  About 3 months into the pill I began to have very severe panic attacks, again over nothing.  I finally discovered that all my anxiety problems/panic attacks started after I began taking this pill and immediately stopped taking it.  With my other BCs I rarely had side effects.  After having the panic attacks I completely stopped all BCs out of fear of having such side effects again.  About a week after stopping Natazia, all my anxiety was gone.  I know people react differently to BCs but I would NEVER recommend this to anyone!  The panic attacks and anxiety cause me to have to quit my new job.  Its just not worth it!
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	7/10/2012 8:56:35 PM	I was suffering from excessive bleeding non stop and i mean non stop as in months at a time. the doctors could not find any medication to work. i just kept resisting the meds.  this was my 3rd doctors plan B.  I stopped and the cramping stopped, the 1st time i went the full month toward the time of my period i did get emotional but compared to the emotional stress i was going through before this was nothing.  I'm on my 3rd month of it now and I'm still quite happy with the medication and its effectiveness.  I do have a problem forgetting to take my pill but other than that i'm happy with it.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	7/9/2012 6:40:06 PM	My personal experience with Natazia is amazing. Previously I used Nuvaring, which made me extremely moody and irrational, lowered sex-drive, and gave me leg pain, which made me feel like I was always on the verge of a blood clot. With Natazia I have had no symptoms, and I rarely get my period, even on the white pill days. At the most I get a little spotting and cramping on those days. After my experience with Nuvaring, I was very resistant to try anything else because of how deeply it effected my relationship with my boyfriend. But Natazia seems to be the right pill for me. My advice to everyone out there is to try everything until you find something that works for you. We all have different bodies, so something that works for me may not for you, and vice versa. 
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	NOV1989, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	6/15/2012 10:14:19 AM	I am a Type 1 Diabetic who was prescribed Natazia to treat PCOS.  I took it for just under 2 months @ which point I took myself off of it for the following reasons:1. Extreme Mood Swings: I rarely cry, yet on Natazia, I started crying -in public- for no apparent reason, and I couldn't get it under control.2. High Anxiety: There were times I was so anxious I couldn't sleep and there was no cause for my anxiety, no source.  This isn't the norm for me.3. I started getting migraines even without my period.  **4. Consistently high blood glucose, markedly higher resistance to insulin.**5. Cardiac changes: a fluttering feeling in my chest accompanied by a dropping sensation.  I think the fluttering/change caused a quick drop in blood pressure, causing the falling sensation.And finally...6. I gained 10 lbs. in the 7 or so weeks I was on Natazia.  That's more than a pound a week!  Even with my healthy diet &amp; exercise.  And 1lb/wk is very extreme &amp; unusual, signaling a problem. Because of all of these significant &amp; life-disrupting problems, I took myself off this pill.  The heart fluttering has stopping, as have the mood swings and intense anxiety.  All I'm left with now is the excess weight to drop, but hopefully that will be easier in the pill's absence.  I strongly DO NOT RECOMMEND NATAZIA. 
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	6/4/2012 2:17:49 PM	I began taking Natazia last month as means to deal with ovarian cysts. I've tried other birth control pills (Yaz, Junel, etc) and have gotten extremely sick from them within the first week. At first I only experienced sore/larger boobs. Other than that I felt great. Within the first week of starting a new back I've experienced NO sex drive, NO appetite,fatige, terrible nausea and HORRIBLE headaches lasting as long as 5 hours. Even as I'm writing this my head is THROBBING. I will be stopping this pill IMMEDIATELY. I hate having to choose between pain from a cyst or feeling like crap from birth control pills.

I have been on it for almost a year. It makes my period very short and light. I have had a few instances of light breakthrough bleeding. This pill does give me mild acne on my face. It also made my breasts go up one cup size. The most surprising side effect I have had has been lactation. My breasts will feel sore. If I go to massage them my nipples will lactate a clear, bitter fluid. My gyno said she is not concerned about this.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	5/25/2012 10:53:40 PM	I started taking this pill as a method of birth control, as well as persistent problems I've had with maintaing a regular period..Like I was told, I started the pack of pills on the first day of my period. I was unable to finish a week's worth dosage of this pill..the side effects were unliveable! I cried constantly for absolutely no reason whatsoever, and the smallest and most irrelevant comments made to me by anyone instantly ticked me off. My worst episode happened the day I decided to stop taking the pill..i am NOT a violent person whatsoever and never raise my voice to anyone. I had a major freakout that day, which led me to have a panic attack that lasted about an hour or so (which by the way, has never happened before...) After that, I did not take the pill that night. Within 2 days after stopping the pill, I feel like myself again! I am SO much happier and definitely notice a difference between my personality while on the pill and after. I know every person's body has different reactions to every type of pill, but with the experience I had, I do not recommend this pill to ANYONE (that's how bad of an experience I felt I had...)
Other	Swingkytn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	3	4	Female	25-34	5/22/2012 4:21:23 PM	I am happy with Natazia.. now. The first month was excruciating. I was not advised, however, to wait until after I got my next period to begin the Natazia. Had I done that, I think things would have gone more smoothly. It had been 62 days already, so starting the pill added 28 more to that before I got my period. I am 29 and started Natazia because of cycle irregularity. I could go 28 day or 72 days and never know when I was going to get my period. Now, I am a lesbian. That means the irregularity was not as scary for me as someone in a heterosexual relationship for obvious reasons. However, being so irregular was making me perimenupausal. Dangerous to my bone health, heart health etc. The second month on Natizia was hard, but MUCH better than the first. The only thing that has been a drawback for me on Natazia, was the breast tenderness. It was almost unbearable in the first couple of months, but now it is just a nagging reminder that I am on birth control. I have LOST weight, moods are leveled out, skin is clear, I sleep well and my sex drive is fine. Actually, my sex drive is OUTSTANDING the first couple of pills into the pack and levels out to normal from then on.Hope this helps someone. I read so many reviews before I began taking it and again after. I have not had anything negative at all except the breast tenderness, and than is lessening monthly. 
Birth Control	Tiff, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	5/21/2012 3:21:45 PM	I have been on Natazia for over 2 years. Up until 6 months ago, it was great. however, I now have break-through bleeding constantly, and my periods are getting more irregular, my migraines and HOT FLASHES are getting more constant, I want to cry or kill someone a week before and during my period, my weight has been consistent- but when i have my period, i devour chocolate like there is no tomorrow. This month my hot flashes didnt stop, my period started full throttle again a week into the pack, and my sex drive has definitely gone down in the last 3 months. my bf thinks i dont want to do anything with him anymore. i am going to get my blood tested for hormonal problems next week and im  switching back to NuvoRing. If you get any of these symptoms, go to your OBGYN and ask them for a blood test to see if your own hormones are good- the 4 phase cycle may be ruining your natural flow of hormones.

Does anyone know of a birth control that doesn't change my mood, make me gain weight, cause allergic reaction to the sun and doesn't lower my sex drive? I'm 18 and I switched to this kind about a year or less ago. I'm not happy and want to feel good again. I'd like to not be so sensitive and angry all the time. HELP!

If I am not bawling my eyes out over a leaf falling or a drop of rain on my windshield or even just breathing then I am possessed by a demon and ready to kill my husband and anyone that gets in my way. I cry at the tiniest, most inconsequential thing and if anyone just looks at me wrong I want to scream at them and throw something. I spot all month long and have a headache that will not go away.  It works as far as I am not pregnant but man are these mood swings insane! I only have to take them for another month then I am getting my tubes tied!

Before I would go 3 sometimes 4 months without a period and now I get it every month and it only last a day or two.  I have lost weight on it and actually has suppressed my appetite a bit.  Overall I am very pleased with Natazia and would recommend it to anyone that has PCOS and/or is going on BC pills.

So far, great results. I've increased a cup size, my hair is thicker and healthier, and I feel good! I have not had an increase in acne whatsoever. I have gained a good five pounds, but that's just due to being spoiled by a boyfriend that constantly cooks. My sex drive has not changed at all. It's still extremely high. I have become slightly more emotional. I never used to cry and now little things having me welling up in tears all the time. I have extremely light 2-3 day periods that are very predictable. I highly recommend this for women with PCOS who need a hormone boost like I did. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	25-34	4/24/2012 8:20:34 PM	I'm not sure what I think of this pill. I was put on it because I had extreme monthly migraines. The first month I hated it. I always naturally had a light, short period but this made me bleed for 2 weeks straight and a migraine for about 10 days. My husband urged me to give it a try. For the next 8 months I completely stopped getting my period, stopped getting migraines and had an increased libido.I was happy but gained 25lbs and started getting acne for the first time ever. I didn't know what to do. I didn't want the migraines back. I haven't had relief in 20 years. Then these last 2 months I got my period back and the migraines. I will be switching. I didn't like the monthly pregnancy tests and if you forget a pill you will often have to throw out the pack and start over vs doubling up like other pills.Frustrated I gained all this weight for nothing.

I was on Depo that caused me to add 30 pounds, depressed and irritable but the good news was i di dnot get a period.  On Natazia for over a year now. I love it no   side effects!!  I Have my phone and wallet everywhere i go. so i set an alarm on it everyday at 7pm to remind me to take the  pill. It has worked so far. Alarm goes off at 7pm, even boyfriend makes a joke of it, &quot;pill time&quot;.  It also regulates my mood. I used to PMS like crazy complete with crying fits. Now always steady.  Sex drive the same as before..no weight gain and no acne.  I love it!  It has 5 phases so there are only 2 placebo pills giving you a period for only 3 days!
Birth Control	LovesDogs, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/11/2012 1:52:01 PM	I have taken lots of different oral contraceptives (Tri-Ortho Cyclen, Trivora 28, Yazmin, FemCon, Yaz, and Loestrin).  I stopped taking Loestrin because it gave me terrible breakthrough bleeding mid-cycle. My doctor prescribed Natazia because it was supposed to stop this - and it did!  I still got a very light, 4-day period with Natazia, but I didn't have any weight gain or other problems.  There was a little acne at first, but that eventually subsided.  I am TTC now, so I am off Natazia, and it took me 34 days to ovulate and 46 days to get my &quot;real&quot; period.

Other	morganne, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	4/8/2012 11:08:24 PM	This by far is the worst BC I've ever taken for psychological reasons. I was orginally prescribed this to help with my dysmenorrhea and it did help the unbearable pain of my period, however, it prolongs my period to about 13+ days with a steady normal flow losing blood to the point of constant fatigue and other questionable side effects, causes an increasing sense of rage, anti-social behavior, severe depression all the way to suicidal and homicidal thoughts that are scarily convincing, my first ever panic attacks, sore breasts, and acne. If you're like me with my condition and have tried many BC's and none have worked before and just made you more sick, this isn't the one either. I don't reccomend this at all.

I have not seen any difference than my other birth control.  My periods just start on a different day and they still last 6 days or so- my other birth control actually lasted 4-5 days.  I have had major weight gain since I have changed over to this new birth control also. Not very impressed with this.  I am now changing back to my old birth control.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	2/6/2012 12:31:40 AM	I took Natazia to stop my periods, skipping those sugar pills.

The first one was so bad the nurse at work sent me to the hospital because my bp and heart rate were so high. I loved everything else about the pill. My periods were extremely light and short, no headaches, no breakouts and no weight gain or nausea. It took awhile to figure out that the pill was causing the panic attacks but as soon as i stopped taking them the attacks stopped. I wish i couldve stayed on it but it just wasnt worth feeling like a crazy person.

I kept losing weight like I was off of the pill. Had some breast tenderness but it went away so everything seemed great... Until about 5 months in. I stopped losing weight, gained 5 pounds, I started getting acne and mood swings and my sex drive decreased. Then I started skipping periods. Now I have NO sex drive, can't lose weight, have acne and horrible breast tenderness and mood swings. I'm going to my doctor at the end of the month to switch. Hate it!

I have bad mood swings, weight gain, head aches, pimples and problems with my heart and circulation now. I have only been on the pill for 2 months now and I have passed out once and ended up the the ER last night. I stopped this pill today because I feel terrible being on it. 
Birth Control	19-24 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	3		19-24	1/27/2012 7:57:32 PM	This is the first and only birth control I have ever used so I don't really have anything to compare it to.  My periods are amazing. Short, light, and always the same time.  However, I have a very non-existent sex drive, mood swings, migraines, and cannot seem to lose weight no matter how hard I try.  I thought it might have just been me but after reading some of the other results, it may be my birth control.  Am thinking of switching but seems as though there are negative side effects for every birth control out there :(
Birth Control	BRANDY, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	1/10/2012 1:28:22 PM	Having tried several Oral COntraceptive options before trying Natazia, I have not found it to have made much of a difference for me.  I have been taking it for almost 9 months now, and I feel @ this point, it is what it is.  I was placed on Natazia by my GYN due to continuous irregular bleeding priblems after trying numerous other options.  It has not corrected my irreg bleeding nor has it been anything consistent.  I NEVER know when I am going to spot, bleed or have a period.  If I do spot sometimes it's 1-2 days to 6-9 days, I NEVER know.  So I am highly considering trying yet another method of BC...this just isn't working for me. Hope this helps you.

After one year, however, I am switching to another pill. Natazia gives me terrible headaches, depression, and I've gained 10lbs. It did increase my libido, but the other side effects just aren't worth it. 
Birth Control	Gilette26,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		1/5/2012 12:46:20 PM	I have been on Natazia for about 5 months now and there are things I love, and things I hate. I went on this since it contains estrogen and on any other BC I was having my period every other week!  Weeks 2 and 4, full periods! I am 24 yrs old and very much in shape.  I am an exercise instructor and have no need to lose weight.  Ever since I started taking Natazia I have lost 10 lbs! I have never experienced this with birth control before and cannot explain it.  I've slightly been taking advantage of being able to eat things like nachos now and not gain weight, but it's too thin for me and sadly my D-cup boobies are now a small C.  :(  I seem to skip my period every other month, but haven't been on it long enough to determine a true pattern.  Sometimes I spot during week 2 and it's heavier than my actual scheduled period (when I do get it). The only thing I don't like is that when I miss my period I get nervous that I'm pregnant, so I've spent a ton of money on pregnancy tests!  Thankfully, never positive though (bf and I are not ready for that yet).  I skipped my period this past weekend, and now I am cramping pretty badly and have a decent amount of clear discharge which is worrying me.  My skin has had a few break-outs around the time of my period, but most of the month I'm clear. Other than the constant pregnancy scare and decrease in my breast size (the rest of the weight loss I'll take any day), I love this birth control and do not plan on changing! The only other option I would consider is Mirena.

I started taking it after going on 2 weeks of bleeding on Ortho Try. It stopped that issue immediately and worked awesome for the first few months. The last few months I've had terrible mood swings, spotting starting in the middle of the month that gets worse until I actually have my period and also migraines at the end of every month that make me sick to my stomach. It's been harder for me to lose weight on this BC too and the acne has been a bit worse. On the upside my periods were lighter and I didnt have any cramping. Had things stayed how they were the first few months I would be staying on it. I'm switching to Sprintec which doesnt have awesome reviews, but hopefully my body takes to it.

I only gave it high ratings in effectiveness and easiy to take BC I haven't gotten preg and I don't know how taking a pill daily could be difficult for anyone.  Anyway. Acne def is an effect, was worse at first but still not completely gone after almost a year.  I also have terribly irregular periods. I haven't gotten one since September but did have one instance of spotting in the months of Oct and November. I honestly take pg tests pretty regularly only BC this pill has screwed up my schedule so much. Incredibly annoying.  The mood swings are the worst and almost unbearable. Do i think that it caused depression, not necessarily, but u definitely think that at the very least it severely worsened any emotional lows i had and made it difficult for me to cope in a way i normally would have. I stopped taking it last week and i have felt happier than i have in a long time. Its possible its more of a placebo effect but i honestly feel like a huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulders and based on some of the other reviews it sounds like its entirely possible it was caused by this med. I am going to try to go back onto Ortho tri cyclen (sp?). This med may work for others with no negative effects but be cautious esp if you are having negative/depressed side effects. Good luck!

My OB-GYN prescribed it to me and told me it was like Seasonique, and would allow me to have a period only about once every 3 months. I have been on it now for 6 months, and it is horrible. I have had acne like I haven't had since high school, and horrible moodiness. My periods have been every month, but instead of 6-7 days, they are now 10-12 days long. I kept with it for a few months thinking it might get better but its not. I will be switching.

But after that, this pill has been amazing! It took a few months for my body to get there, but now I have a two day, lighter than ever period! I think it may have taken that many months to transition because I was on LoSeasonique before which I HATED due to crazy spotting that ruined rather than inchanced my sex life.I do notice stil some signs of PMS, just irritation mostly.But overrall, I'd recommend this pill to my friends and to the internet!
Birth Control	ScreenName1, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	10/21/2011 9:44:02 PM	I have been taking Natazia since August of 2010. The first month my breasts were EXTREMELY sore but after that I fell in love with this pill! My period was only 2 days long, very light, and always the same days. However, the past 3 months I have been getting severe acne, which I haven't had since I was 13, and I recently completely missed a period. I started my period when I was 10 years old, I'm 23 now and this is my first completely missed period. Overall I like this pill but I agree, there are times during the month when my sex-drive is low, which has been consistent for me since beginning this pill but never before.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/10/2011 5:15:14 PM	Started Natazia @4months ago after endometriosis laporoscopic surgery. Happy that hormones are balanced now and no longer have heavy bleeding. Take it @same time every nt and only have light period or none at all. Mood is balanced. Have strength to exercise &amp; feel 100% better :) P.S. Have 2buy better sports bra b/c breasts are fuller w/this med.
Birth Control	Kitty, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	9/25/2011 11:36:55 PM	The first few months were ok..then it began. The horrible mood swings where i become a pshyco, dry skin, headaches, bad acne, swollen breasts, bloating, dizziness, bleeding before i should be starting, horrible cramping around day 12-17 feeling like ive been stabbed in the belly..even on the inside..and a weird discharge between day 13-17 too, which I havent seen anyone complain about..anyone else getting this discharge and pain? Needless, I have pieced together through these months that these pills are to blame, and am changing them tomorrow!
Birth Control	Mcd, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/16/2011 4:51:17 PM	This is the only b.c. I have ever used.  It works, I'm not pregnant, and I have had no negative side effects.  In fact, I have lost 20 lbs. since I started taking Natazia.  Everyone's body reacts differently to meds, but I would recommend this birth control.
Birth Control	Sweetazul, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	9/6/2011 5:07:53 PM	After 9 months I have painful acne on my chin &amp; neck and cannot predict my period. I usually don't have a full on period but random spotting on the last week of pills. My sex drive is non existent and I feel apathetic. Not good for acne prone skin.
Other	runnergirl4, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	9/5/2011 6:49:55 PM	I started taking BC because of how heavy and painful my periods were.  The first month I spotted for about 2 weeks, but after that my periods continued to reduce in length, heaviness, and pain.  I haven't gained a pound; in fact, I've lost about 10.  It's a great product but it can be scary with the loss of your period occasionally.  I never skipped a period until i was on this BC. 
Birth Control	Maggie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	9/1/2011 11:10:58 AM	The pill worked because  I am not pregnant...HOWEVER....it put like 10lbs on me.  I feel like a prize freakin heffer!
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female	25-34	8/18/2011 11:14:12 AM	I started taking it for crazy long periods. I have noticed my periods have lightened up, but my cycle is still 7-9 days long and sometimes twice a month as well as occasional break through bleeding. This is the 8th pill I have tried! However, I have not had any bad side effects besides just feeling like crap the week and a half of my period. :(  UGH
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	8/17/2011 12:51:15 PM	I started this pill bc I was having very long, heavy periods. This stopped my period, which was a welcome change. However, after about 8 months I realized I was becoming very sluggish, emotional, depressed. Weight gain has also been an issue, although I run about 30 miles a week! My sex drive is non-existant. I am very dissatisfied and have changed pills. I would not recommend this pill to anyone. 
Birth Control	avn, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	8/16/2011 11:58:32 PM	I was on and off orthotricyclin lo and had to stop because of the price increase. My face started to breakout again terribly, and my gyeno recommended this brand name pill, Natazia. I didn't have any physical problems but in the one month I took it, I was a different person. Irritable, cranky which led to the person I was seeing to dislike me which then led to my depression and crying all day every day. I am naturally a sensitive person, but I was really depressed. I threw the pack out soon after, and my emotions started to normalize. I hate this pill. After a few months, I am now on Tri Sprintec to see if it'll clear my acne.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	8/6/2011 1:34:46 PM	I have been taking this medicine for 9 months now. The fist few months were great, my periods stopped completely except for occasional spotting through the month after about 3 months. The long I was on this the more I notice the extreme mood swings, the decreased sex drive, and I started to have severe cramps for 2-3 weeks each month. I tried going on anti-depressants to help with the mood swings but no success with them. I am seeing my dr to talk about changing my med because I just can't do it any more.   
Birth Control	RainyGirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/21/2011 2:52:18 PM	I switched to this after having 2 weeks straight of break through bleeding. It stopped within 2 days of taking Natazia. The first month my period started on the 13th day and was extremely light, but went for longer than normal. The second month it came much later and had me nervous. After that things have seemed to &quot;normalized.&quot; My periods are shorter (3-4 days instead of 7) and lighter and now they come like clockwork. I haven't noticed an increase of acne like some people have reported, but I definitely get the bloated feeling. This last month I wound up with a pretty solid headache for a day, but am not convinced it was the pill. I still get hormonal the week leading up, but not nearly as bad as when I was on my last pill and the libido increase has been great. The only reason I didnt give 5 stars to the satisfied has to do with cost. Its $25/month with the savings card and there are certain days that if you miss a pill you have to start a new pack that will set you back $25 more. All in all I like this new pill and plan on sticking with it unless the headache becomes a monthly thing.
Birth Control	meganm, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	13-18	7/21/2011 2:36:40 AM	I was previously on Loestrin 24 for 6 months and i would have spotting randomly throughout the entire packet. My doctor than switched me over to Natazia to stop the spotting but it was worse. I would get an actual period the 13th day, and it would last all the way to the placebo pills. When i would take the placebo pill, my period would stop. I did have less acne and no weigh gain, but i did have cramps (but i think that is because i had my period for almost 2 weeks). If you dont have spotting/breakthrough bleeding problem, its a great pill.

I have gained 8 lbs in the five months that I have been on it. I am moody, have irregular bleeding, &amp; feel bloated.  I do not notice any improvement in my sex drive as they like to make claims about. I can not attribute the weight gain to anything else.  I workout 5 days a week and am an avid runner &amp; very clean eater.  
Birth Control	krista, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/26/2011 5:25:10 PM	Been on Natazia for 5 months, I was never able to take the pill before because they caused severe mood swings and very low libido.  This pill is amazing!  No cramping, 2 day light periods that come like clockwork, and no changes in my mood.  I recommend this pill to anyone who like me, has tried EVERYTHING, and thought they couldn't take the pill!
Birth Control	momof2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/26/2011 10:03:56 AM	I am in love, I have been on many BC pills for over 10 years and this product, by far, is my favorite. My sex drive is in high gear which is not common. Slight acne, no weight gain and no bleeding so far. I am in my 2nd month and my husband and I both LOVE the results. I highly recommend trying this if your looking for an alternitive.

Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	Stacy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	6/3/2011 9:24:18 PM	I've been on Natazia for 4 months now and have mixed feeling about this pill. I've been on several different BC pills. On Natazia have mood swings, migraines, and I bleed pretty often. The only plus is I don't seem to hurt as bad with my ovarian cyst and I've lost 12 lbs, which is awesome. I don't have any problems with acne like others reported. My Dr. wants me to remain on the pill to see if my bleeding will slow down because I am still so new to the pill. Hopefully I can catch a break.
Birth Control	lizzzzzzb, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	5/19/2011 1:30:23 PM	I am on my third month of Natazia. I bleed very lightly for about a week and then have my regular 4 day period every month which is annoying. I've had a slight weight gain, light acne, high libido, fuller breasts, sensitive nipples, light headaches and slightly restless sleep. As far as hormones go I am usually a very even keeled person Natazia has caused me to have HORRIBLE mood swings right before my period and a little depression and crying fits after my period. The rise in libido is great and none of the side effects are too unbearable. It is very expensive even with insurance but you can go to the Bayer website or ask your obgyn for a discount card which will make it $25 a month instead of 80.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	35-44	5/9/2011 8:16:20 AM	I went on birthcontol for constant cramping, really bad periods with heavy bleeding and pms. My symtoms were better immediatly after going on birthcontrol but I ended up dealing with side effects, mood swings, depression, and nausea to name a few, and have been on almost every combination trying to find one that works best. Nuva-ring worked the best and I was on it for about a year when I started bloating real bad for the last 2 weeks on it. I have been on Notazia for 3 months now and like the estrogen better, I can think better and am not as tired and don't have the depressed feeling I would get on the other birthcontrols. The problem I have with it is cramping and bleeding. I'm in the middle of my pack and am having a period, not just spotting, and my cramps are bad enough to wake me up. I was hoping this would be the one to get me through to menopause.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	deedeelynn28, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	5/7/2011 10:07:24 PM	I have had nothing but bad experiences taking an oral birth control in previous years and suffered every month with severe pain,cramping and bleeding symptoms untill 6 months ago i was bleeding straight for two days, passing huge clots every 1/2 hour and had to go to the ER ~;/..they and my obgyn recommended hormone pills which sort of disturbed me... I hate to take medicine for anything. But I happened the previous week to see an advertisment for this pill Natazia..I suggested it to my doctor..I was intrigued by the hormone differences vs other pills and the relief it offered for those who suffer with &quot; Hi, I am a pycho @#@#@ right before I get my enemy.&quot; I have been on Natazia for 6 months now...the first fourth months I was in love..my mood was great my bleeding was lessened, my cramping and agony was gone...my relationship with my boyfriend was fabulous...he didnt break up with me once a month(hee hee)....i did suffer with severe migranes initially ,,my boobs went from a C to a DD and as the months go by I find it ironic that others in previous reviews share the 7-10 lbs of weight gain..I have to say that is my only complaint...i am certain that each one of my ta-ta's weighs 2 and 1/2 lbs..but although i have been working out faithfully and sincerely for months now...it doesnt seem to go away..abs are hidden...i am happy with the results except for that...I will continue to work out eat right and see if my summer shape is obtainable....10 lbs sucks when you only ever fluctuate 5lbs at most...or just miss a meal or too...ugg..being a women sucks sometimes....my skin is clearer than ever and my mood is fabulous...so i guess i gotta weigh the pros verses the cons...thanks for listening.....i will keep ya posted ladies~;x 
Other	hopeful, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	5/5/2011 4:14:59 PM	I was on Loestrin to regulate my cycles prior to starting Natazia at my OB's urging in October.  I had problems from the start with migraines for the first 6 weeks.  A few months in I found myself sleeping 5 hours a night at the beginning of a pack &amp; upwards of 10 hours toward the end (excluding naps!).  My mood swings peaked in a 2-day long crying jag at the end of each pack.  Finally, I gained 15 pounds in the first 2 months &amp; 2-3 lbs every month after - all in my midsection.  Positives: clear skin, 2-day periods, &amp; a libido that was through the roof.  Despite several conversations, my OB did not want to take me off this pill.  When I finally got fed up &amp; went to my GP, she found that my blood pressure was insane &amp; ordered me to stop taking Natazia.  I have been off less than a week &amp; have already lost 5 lbs.  Now I am waiting for my bloodwork to come back to see what other damage may have been done &amp; am seeking a new OB.In conclusion, Natazia did what I took it for - there was never any breakthrough bleeding &amp; my periods were like clockwork.  The side effects were cumulative &amp; got worse the longer I was on it.  I did do my research before I went on this pill &amp; had read every review I could - unfortunately, there were only a few months worth at that time as, even now, this pill has been on the market less than a year in the US.  Hope this review aids in your research &amp; that your experience is better than mine.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/27/2011 9:56:42 AM	I used it for one month and started getting episodes of very fast pulse, and high blood pressure, which I've never had before. It sent me to the ER 3 times. I now have to take blood pressure medication daily.
Birth Control	thatgurl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	4/23/2011 5:06:40 PM	I took Natazia for 4 months after taking Levora/Portia for 2 years. My libido went WAY UP, in the first 2 months everything was fine, my period was light, my appetite decreased, and I even lost a little weight. However, in the last 2 months I had bleeding every 2 weeks. I bled in Days 10-15 exactly like a heavy/regular period. I began getting chest and facial acne and headaches (which are not normal for me). So after 4 months, I had to switch. The increase in libido was awesome, but it is not so awesome to be &quot;unavailable&quot; for additional days (beyond period) each month.

I've lost weight that the Ortho-Tri-Cyclen (my previous pill) made me gain... i went from 119 to 112. I had pretty regular periods that were very light and only lasted one day. I do have some stubborn acne, and I seem to be hungry alot (but no weight gain thank goodness!) However, I have not had a period in two months... I always start on a Friday, but now all I get are cramps! My Dr. told me I would not gain weight, I wouldn't have bad acne, and I should have regular periods. He was half right. But this is one of the better birth control pills I have taken.

I had taken a birth control before, but it made me horribly moody. Natazia doesn't cause mood swings, but I've noticed that I have a lot more acne than normal. I've been taking it since October 2010 and I haven't perioded since. Recently, I began to get severe migraines and my horrible cramping is back. I think I will be switching my birth control now.
Other	jpp123, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	13-18	4/8/2011 2:07:21 PM	This BC has been HORRIBLE! I went on it after having problems using Yaz and then Femcon. But now, I'd go back on either of them in a heartbeat. The 1st month on Natazia was terrible. I was dizzy and had breakthrough bleeding almost the whole month. My doctor assured me that by month 3 I'd be like clockwork again but I am now 1 week into month 3 and I just started bleeding so bad it's worse than spotting. I have no period schedule now. I'm just all over the place. And that's not even the worst part. Since I began Natazia, I have had CONSTANT problems. I've had a yeast infection the whole 3 months. As soon as it goes away, It comes back. I also had BV. I am in constant pain because of this. I will be going to the doctor soon and hopefully they can prescribe me something else. I do NOT recommend this medication to ANYONE. 
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts		5	5	2			3/31/2011 3:53:09 PM	I have only been taking it for a week, but so far I have noticed acne on my body, extreme cravings (hungary a lot) I haven't noticed any mood swings but am not fond of acne and hunger... to early to tell if there is any weight gain
Birth Control	dsgt, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/15/2011 4:38:47 AM	I started taking birth control in September of 2010. I was prescribed Septra by my doctor and had no problems with it until just last month (February 2011) I had breakthrough bleeding that lasted for 2 weeks straight and was WAY heavier than my period has ever been without birth control or even while I was on it. There was no reason for it and my doctor couldn't even figure out what the cause of it was. She suggested I use Natazia to regulate my bleeding. Within 12 hours of taking the FIRST pill, my breakthrough bleeding stopped completely and hasn't returned yet. I haven't really gained any weight or gotten any excessive acne. I've also had an increased sex drive. I have no cramps, no moodiness, nothing when it comes to that &quot;time of the month&quot;. I STRONGLY reccommend this pill if you have problems with heavy bleeding or breakthrough bleeding.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	3/10/2011 8:41:50 PM	i was on natazia for about 2 months.  I had break through horrible bleeding that was like a full on period every two weeks.  I was getting really bad migranes at night and chills.  I also noticed I had an increase appetite and i always wanted to just eat.  I gained a few pounds.  Which is crazy because i go to the gym and work out 4 days a week.  This pill did not work for me at all.  Im going on yaz, i like yaz so much better and I havent had a problem.
Birth Control	Lucy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	3/7/2011 9:54:03 PM	I have been using birth control pills since 2004. Most recently, I was on Yaz, but had terrible mood swings, depression, and a loss of libido.  I love Natazia.  I feel normal... my mood is stable and my libido is fine. I did have some break-through bleeding during my first three packs, but that has subsided. My only complaint is the price of $80 (with insurance)! That's ridiculous.

First month I had a 3 week period. Second month, it lasted two days. I have noticed some very strange changes such as frequent headaches, mood swings, dizziness, light headedness, inability to sleep a full night, and weight loss. The bad outweigh the good at this point, and when I have my checkup in March, I might see about a new kind. I was put on this medication because I have uterine fibroids, and my doc thought BC pills would help with it. I must say, I no longer have cramping as bad as it used to be, so that is great. This isn't a terrible medication, but I don't like NOT feeling like myself!
Birth Control	Jenna12, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	2/25/2011 11:04:10 AM	I have been on this pill for three months now... just finishing my third pack. I switched from Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo because I had been on it from 20 years old to now 29 and my body grew out of it.  I loved it, but I had heavy, full 7 day periods... but they came like clock work.  With Natazia, I have a constant bloat of the belly that I never had.  I had abs that you cannot see anymore and I work out 5 days a week.  I also have acne popping up almost everyday.  I am hoping that the symptoms will subside now that the third month is ending. My sex drive is higher.  I am giving this pill this last month to show some improvement.  I have had a lot of light bleeding for weeks at a time.  My last period started on the 12th pill and lasted until the 23rd.  Very light, annoying bleeding the entire time.  Let's wait and see what happens.

Before taking this my periods would only last a couple days. Horrible mood swings and cramps about day 13-14. I haven't noticed any weight gain but a slight increase in cup size. Now switching to Desogen which I'm not so sure about anymore after reading the reviews.
Other	KC, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/12/2011 9:25:30 PM	I have hormonal imbalance, severe cramps and also was looking for a birth control pill. I had tried quite a few other pills and had so many issues with the others. The Natazia has been great for me. I actually only have my period for 4 days now instead of the 8 I used to deal with. I have far less cramps and am not an emotional nutcase during that time of the month. I'm very thankful for Natazia as the hormones are closer to what my body makes and the fact that they WORK for me. :) I've been on them for over 4 months now.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	2/8/2011 4:52:57 PM	I have been on Natazia for about 6 months now. I was givent this drug because they would not refill my Ortho Evra (patch) prescription which I loved. The first month I was on Natazia I did experience headaches. This has since subsided. I have experienced some weight gain (about 8 pounds). The side effect that bothers me is the acne. I have been having breakouts (especially on my body) since I started taking this pill. My formerly heavy and long (7 day) period is now a VERY light and short (2 day) period. I haven't noticed any mood swings. The biggest problem i have is remembering to take it. I'm so used to the patch where I only had to think about it once a week. Overall I like it with the exception of the acne.
Birth Control	kalspenc1, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/6/2011 12:45:14 PM	I was previously on Yaz for 5 years and started having problems with constant bleeding, cramping, horrible mood swings.  Contacted my docotor and they started me on Natazia 5 months ago.  So far it's amazing, I've actually had a weight loss of about 20lbs, my random food cravings throughout the day have stopped.  My period is about 2 days if that and very light, minimal cramping.  No problems with acne breakouts or any sensitivity at all.  The first two months I did have some mood swings, mainly just increased in being agitated.  Now I'm not noticing any mood problems, increased energy.  Overall now that my body seems to have adjusted I'm very happy and have recommended this to friends.  
Birth Control	ascott0099, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	2/3/2011 5:56:12 PM	I had no weight gain. Actually, a slight weight loss. Mood swings (which may or may not have been completely medication related). EXTREME dizziness and migraines. Horrible! Stopped taking after 2 months. Got my refill, but with insurance was $50. I will not take this med. Went back on my previously prescribed pill until I can get back to the doctor. The pill did stop my breakthrough bleeding...completely. I haven't had a single period since Novemeber. Not even a spot. But not pregnant either. I tested...and got negative results. I do NOT recommend this BC to anyone!
Birth Control	alh1290, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	1/30/2011 7:25:36 PM	I have been on Natazia for a month and a half.  Have had breakouts and feeling very tired all the time but more than anything is the mood swings.  I go from crying to really angry.  If this doesn't change will be changing to something new.
Birth Control	ritabell, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/26/2011 4:41:57 PM	I have never been able to take BC pills. I'm hormonally challenged and every pill that I've ever tried made me moody and depressed. Weight gain has also been an issue in the past. So far, I really like this pill. I haven't had any serious side effects and my period is almost non-existant. However...My gums hurt. Is this a possible side effect?
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	13-18	1/22/2011 3:10:08 PM	I started taking natazia because it was supposed to lower my heavy periods. I was very pleased after my first month not having a period or any spotting. However, this month I have had outbreak spotting on and off for two and a half weeks. I know I need to give it some time, but after reading these reviews I'm only giving it another month then switching to nuva ring. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/19/2011 11:42:16 PM	I take Natazia for both birth control and ovarian cysts. I have an anxiety disorder that is very sensitive to hormones, so a pill that mimics natural horomone fluctuations was a must! I really like how I feel mentally -- as other pills have been nightmarish with mood swings and depression. What worries me is the breakthrough spotting during the third week and lack of(or, very light) period during the two placebos. All in all, I enjoy Natazia... but will not be taking it once my Bayer savings card runs out. $88! YIKES!
Birth Control	MissD, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	19-24	1/19/2011 9:38:40 AM	I switched to this BC because I have had A LOT of breakthrough bleeding with every other method.  I am about to start my 4th pack of Natazia and I'm on the fence about it.  I have had breakthrough bleeding on every pill I've ever tried and this one is no different.  The bleeding lasts for about 7 days in the middle of the pack.  I haven't gained any weight or had breakouts on my face though, which is a good thing!  Hopefully the 4th month wont be like the months before... breakthrough bleeding is so annoying!
Birth Control	winterlimbs, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	13-18	1/11/2011 7:26:41 PM	I've tried most of the BCPs on the market and though, I like Natazia, I've stopped my period completely after only a few months of using it, and there's no way I'm pregnant.. I also, like the users above me, get really tender nipples, etc.. 
Birth Control	Dolly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	1/9/2011 3:24:47 PM	I started this pill about 4 months ago and the only pro is I rarely experience any cramping and my period is only 2 days at most. On the flip side, I have gained at least 10 pounds, still have breakthrough spotting, having issues with acne, suffer from dramatic mood swings, extreme irritability, and I am constantly fatigued. I am going to be talking to my doctor this week about going back to YAZ.
Birth Control	Az, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	12/27/2010 10:36:11 AM	Have been on 3 other pills before Natazia (Microgynon 30, Marvelon, and Brevinor). Had many many symptoms with these pills including constant breakthrough bleeding, nausea, vomiting, headaches, increased appetite, bad moods. I thought I would be one of those women who couldn't go on the pill at all. Then I tried this pill (having heard its more &quot;natural&quot; and a four-phase pill) and I cannot believe that I haven't even had any symptoms at all. Nothing, AT ALL! I would seriously recommend this pill if you have had problems with other pills especially regarding breakthrough bleeding.
Birth Control	laurvs09, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	19-24	12/26/2010 9:17:38 PM	I started taking this BC a month ago. I am now on the end of my second pack. I have gotten no period (not preg...tests taken) and am in a constant state of depression. I am never happy and always have the urge to cry. I have never felt this way before in my life! I have recently decided to stop taking Natazia and switch to something else, not sure yet but something.
Birth Control	goodgrades, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	12/19/2010 10:48:54 AM	I have been taking Natazia for 3 months now. I have NEVER had a problem with weight gain, but I have gained 10 lbs over the past 2 months. I also have had problems with random breakouts on my face. One reason I tried this BC was due to lack of sex drive, which has drastically changed with this pill. I would recommend it to anyone, but beware of the possible weight gain, which would be the one reason why I would change back to the generic of Yaz.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	12/16/2010 7:05:28 PM	My doctor switched me to Natazia from Yaz because I was getting pretty serious headaches every month on Yaz.  I'm halfway through my second pack and while the headaches have gotten better, I've had no period (not pregnant, I tested), I'm gaining weight, I'm irritable and incredibly fatigued.  I'm only going to give this one more month, then I'm switching back to Yaz.  
Birth Control	sjx, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	12/16/2010 6:35:35 AM	Every hormonal method I have used works fine for a few months, but then I get a continuous period. I have been on Natazia for 5 months now, and I think my period is finally starting to regulate. I do get it a few days before I the placebo days, and so I have some sort of bleeding/spotting for about a week. Hopefully that stops soon. I did gain about 10 pounds of weight within the first month, which is why I am only somewhat satisfied, and I have noticed the pores on my face are clogged, so I have obnoxious little bumps everywhere I'm trying to eliminate. Yaz previously caused me to feel sick a lot, and I had trouble going to the bathroom/diarrhea, but I don't have that problem with Natazia. I am hoping that the bleeding problem resolves itself completely, and I will be satisfied enough to continue using it.
Birth Control	Gilby730, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/10/2010 6:10:13 PM	I have had lots of problems with different pills on the market.  Most recently, I was on YAZ.  It worked just fine for about 3-4 months and about the 5th month into it I had continuous spotting and bleeding for a month.  I called my doctor and she suggested Natazia.  After about a week of Natazia, the bleeding stopped.  When it was time for my regular period to arrive, I had cramps for about 3-4 days and very light spotting for two.  THAT WAS IT!  I had a bit of acne pop up the first month, but that has since cleared itself up.  My mood is regular-much different than while I as on YAZ-I was a wreck for a while!! HA!  So far, so good.  Let's hope after month 5, I'm not back to complain!!  Only complaint was with it being new-there is no generic-so cost (even with insurance) is pretty high.  But go to the Bayer website and get the savings card.  :-)
Birth Control	pianokeys, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	12/5/2010 6:37:07 PM	I can't decide if I like this medication or not! On 4th pack now. Pros: I get no period, no break through bleeding, no weight gain, increased libido! Cons: I get different pregnant symptoms every month! First month, very swollen breasts lasting weeks. Second and third month, very frequent dizziness and nausea, some days so bad I had to leave work. Forth month (on now), swollen and sore nipples, lasting a week now. I have taken a pregnancy test every month, and negative negative! So I decided to take the Natazia for one more month, then I may switch or go off BC altogether. Previously being on Depo Provera and other BC pills since I was 17, turning 30 soon, I am considering going off birth control for awhile to reset my body.
Birth Control	hooplala, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	11/30/2010 4:09:50 PM	This BC has turned me into a psychopath.  I just started my third pack a week ago and have decided to stop.  I cry all the time, have constant panic attacks, and the mood swings are constant and raging.  It has also stopped my period completely (and no I'm not pregnant...taken tests).
Other	BHpills, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	11/29/2010 8:29:19 PM	I have been on natazia for one week and already have terrible side affects. My breasts are very sore and have gotten slightly bigger after one week and I feel like I have a cloudy feeling in my head all the time. I have been on other birth control pills and some have worked better than others but this is pretty bad. The worst symptom by far is blinding headaches at night. The other night I woke up at 3am because my head was pounding terribly. I have been taking tylenol every night for the headaches. I am done, these pills suck. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	11/26/2010 4:07:34 PM	Been on Natazia for 2 months so far. No weight gain (that I can tell), no mood swings. Period doesn't seem to be lighter. Daily mild headaches and acne is pretty bad, and I've never been one to have an acne problem.  Hoping these problems will go away after taking the pills for a couple more months.  
Birth Control	mzsweetness, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	11/23/2010 5:19:09 PM	I have had a good experience I started taking this pill after a miscarriage and I was bleeding for a month and a half almost two months straight so doc thought this would help so far he's right with this pill no weight gain no headaches no acne soo I'm really statisfied the only down fall is mild insomnia or just wanting to nap out of no where then other days I have too much energy another bad side is crazy dreams every night since I've been taking this pill my dreams have been super strange and inconsistant sometimes its a lifetime movie other times horror and then out of no where something bruce willis would be in...lol but my libido has been off the charts sooo ill take the crazy dreams 
Other	Anonymous, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5		35-44	11/22/2010 7:35:37 PM	I was taking Loestrin 24 Fe for 18 months before switching to Natazia 3 weeks ago.  My main complaint with Loestrin was exhaustion and lethargy.  When I noted this to my doctor, he gave me a sample of Natazia to try.  3 weeks in, and i would normally be very tired, but I am so much happier and energetic than I've been for months.  So far so good for me.  No other ill-side effects.  My weight is steady.  No outbreak of acne.  I do have spotting, but to me that is not negative and anticipated with the change of hormones.  I know this review comes after less than a full cycle on the drug, but I'm so pleased with how I'm feeling already that I wanted to add my experience.
Other	Happy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/21/2010 1:39:03 AM	For me, I had severe cramping and heavy bleeding.  I had tried 4 other pills before discovering this one.  I love this pill, I will never stop using this one.  I have a shorter, lighter period, almost no cramping, and I have a higher libido.  Also, I never had severe acne, but I would have pre-period breakouts, and I have had none, yet.  I've been on the pill for 2 cycles, and have NO complaints.  It even has boosted my mood, and I've gained no weight, if anything, I've been able to lose weight.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts		4	5	3			11/16/2010 10:25:07 AM	While the pill was effective in regulating my period and I did not have any breakthrough bleeding, I had terrible cramps for 2 months, nonstop (I only took if for 2 months.)  I also experienced some pretty severe mood swings and depression, which lead me to switch to another pill.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	11/10/2010 3:16:42 PM	I am in my second pack and switched from Loestrin because of continuous bleeding. So far, I have had no bleeding which has been great. However, I have frequent migrane lasting at least two days, probably about every other week, since starting it, that make me very sick and not able to funciton very well. I've also noticed a 7 lb weight gain which has got to be water weight since I go to the gym daily and had maintained the same weight for two years prior to starting the pill. I'm hopeful this will change as my body adjusts to the pill. I figure I will give it a few months but if things don't improve I will have to look for something else.
Other	FootballFan, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	10/31/2010 1:27:04 AM	I started taking Natazia to shorten the length of my menstrual cycle two months ago. My heavy cycle went from 5 days to a light 2 days and I did experiencing moderate cramping and a mood swing right before I started. The biggest down fall so far has been the daily headaches ranging from a dull ache to sudden and nearly blinding. The first month I did gain 7 pounds but I'm thinking it was water weight because when I started a new pack I lost the 7 pounds plus an additional 3 pounds.
Other	menopause, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/29/2010 10:23:23 PM	Ok this is only my third month on this pill and it was prescribed for heavy bleeding and perimenopause symptoms.  So far so good. It has reduced my bleeding to almost nothing, my mood is wonderful after the first month or so, my acne is improving, and my sex drive is finally back.  I must say the first month was and adjustment, but no real serious side effects. No weight gain either.  I just hope nothing changes I'm really feeling renewed.
