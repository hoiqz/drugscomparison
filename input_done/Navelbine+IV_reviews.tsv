But my CA125 dropped drastically, and my dr. cut the dose in almost half. Still have terrible pain, never ending between treatments. I am now pleased with low CA125, and my schedule is 2 on, 2 off as a result. I expect to stay on this dose until it doesn't work or something new comes out. Have had every symptom described here, some almost unbearable. But I am alive with ovarian cancer, working on 12th year.

The oncologist told me the results are very good but I'm paying a high price: bad taste in my mouth, headache, prostration, loss of memory, intestine doesn't function, and most of all, I feel tired and sleepy all the time.
