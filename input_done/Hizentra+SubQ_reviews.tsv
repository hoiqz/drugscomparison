Primary Immune Deficiency Disorder	Nana, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	45-54	9/5/2012 4:46:14 PM	I was on IVIG for years, but my veins were done. I also wanted to be prooactive about my care. On sub-q since last Christmas. Did have a few troubles, but my dispensing doctor is not very familular with this medication. I am transfering drs. Gained a little weight, but came off. The day of and day after are not good, but can function somewhat if I need to. I have got the infussion sites running well and am overall happy with this treatment.

The side effects are similar however chest discomfort dizziness and fatigue are apparent, I have been administering 7wks now. The soreness at injection site is quite a discomfort for 6 days after - the biggest negative.

I am so tired after infusions that it is not funny. I've had every side effect under the sun dis-like doing this very much I am on 10grams (50ml) per week and use 4 sites. Wish I knew what to do about side effects.

I have been on this med for about a year. I forgot what I infused with before that, but whatever it was, I could eat anything and never gain a pound. With Hyzentra I have gained 20 pounds over the last year. Other than that, I really havent had and side effects from this med.I hate the soreness that comes after I infuse. Doing it twice a week is hard. I have to look for NON bruised areas to inject.

No infections, however severe migrains, chills, fatigue, dizziness.  Wasn't aware other people are having problems w/headaches too.  Does anyone else take something for these migrains, or do we just suffer?  Plan on speaking w/my primary after reading all the reviews that confirm it is not &quot;all in my head&quot;.

I found I had less frequent headaches when I drank lots more liquids 24 hours before and after infusing.  I am now infusing at home with minimal support....very challenging, but a lot more flexible way of infusing.  I had 8-10 months of infection/antibiotics before starting treatment. Now I have 2-3 infections a year that usually respond to one course of one rx.

He is unable to take monthly IV's. His health and IGG levels are better, but there are days he just cries and he can't tell me what is wrong, but he just feels bad. He is clearly sick and doesn't feel good. Some days he seems to get a boost of energy then crashes by 5-6 days after treatment. Thanks to other reviews it better tells me what he is feeling and just can't express it to me. God bless the users of this medication and hope you have better health soon. It has been a challenge for me as a mom to inject the skin and I have a medical degree. I have wound care trainning, and it is hard for me to do it for my son.

I do get head aches but take something before I start . The site does stay soar between injections . No major difficulties . Takes about one hour and twenty minutes and I hav to use longer needles because I have gone an excercise and diet rountine so the hizentra was running back out of the sites . So far my health is better than a couple of years ago when I was having back to back pneumonia .
