Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/24/2010 5:29:20 PM	If I am unable to prevent a migraine by immediately taking 600 mg ibuprofin, this is the only migraine drug that works for me. I wish my insurance would recognize how unique and effective this drug is -- nothing else works, once I have a full-grade migraine. I do feel a bit dizzy after taking it, and my skin is very sensitive to heat (e.g., when washing my hands), but the minor side effects are nothing compared to a migraine! The only concern I have is the fact that it is so powerful, I worry about the long-term effects.

I take it with 500mg.Naproxan, and that's it, once and it is gone within two hrs. I follow up with another dose of the Naproxan. Very $$$$

I cannot take it if I am at work because I have to talk all day and cannot after taking the drug. Other then that it works better than any other i have tried.

This medicine worked very well for me.  I don't seem to have as severe of headaches when I do have them.  The only drawback is the cost.  They are so expensive.

Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/9/2008 11:58:35 PM	If taken when you first feel the migraine come on this drug is wonderful. Just rest for 15-30 minutes (at least for me) and eventually the beginnings of the headache will dissolve away.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	4	5	Female	45-54	1/21/2008 8:18:08 PM	This is is the best medicine for severe headaches.  My only complaint is that it is hard to get out of the package and when you have a bad headache the last thing you want to do is struggle with getting to the medicine.

Only once has it not worked for me. I wish my insurance would cover it.

Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/22/2007 11:07:19 AM	If taken @the 1st onset, very effective. After being on it for 1 year, I noticed an immediate  throbbing headache at the base of my skull during an orgasm. It has happened the last 2 times. Applying an ice pack immediately seems to help but the following day, my head still hurt.
