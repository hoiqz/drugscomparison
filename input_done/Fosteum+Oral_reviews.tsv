My major complaint, is I am having some depression and anxiety which, is unusual for me. Also having tooth pain which someone else said they were having. I'm concerned that it may be related to the soy which has hormones in it and I am also on vagifem 10 mg twice a week. Too much estrogen???

I have been on it only a month and actually don't see any difference yet.  Going to be patient for another month I guess.  Just hoping it kicks in soon.  With summer coming it may be the hottest one I have ever had.  
Other	Beatrice, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	10/19/2009 2:12:52 AM	I have Oseoporosis &amp; taken Fosteum for a year.  I have not had any side effects that I relate to Fosteum.  Since I have been taking 250mg of magnesium I do not have the constipation that may result.  My bone density improved in my pelvis but remained the same in my spine area. I will continue on it for another year and hope for the best.  
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	8/31/2009 8:38:32 AM	I was experiencing a miriad of things beginning with the pain in my upper body almost flu like symptoms.  From there it seemed that the tingling was all over especially in like under my bra area.  It felt like I was gettting nauseated everyday about the same time.  I quit taking it on my own.  I was trying it for the benefits of the bone mass but also the Dr. told me it might help with hot flashes.  Needless to say I got worse hot flashes than ever.

Other	EGG, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female	55-64	4/30/2009 6:48:18 PM	I have been diagnosed with Osteopenia.  My doctor recommended Fosteum since there are less side effects after I had taken Fosomax for 7 years.  I have been on Fosteum for 3 months and it is too early to tell how effective it is in increasing my bone mass.  I have not experienced any side effects that I am aware of, however after reading other reviews on this website regarding upper arm pain I can say I have had this along with lower back pain all on my left side.  I thought it was related to arthritis, but now I will speak to my doctor to see if there could be any relationship. 
Other	offer, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	55-64	3/27/2009 4:03:48 PM	I have been taking Fosteum for 4 months with no symptoms until about 6 weeks ago. I began having pain and weakness in my upper arms, then pain in my lower left back and leg.  I do not know if these symptoms are related to the drug or not. I have a doctor's appointment next week and I'll ask if the drug may be responsible.
Other	Mick, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	3/17/2009 9:18:29 AM	Started taking Foseum twice a day about three months ago.  The first problem was constipation than I started experiencing a pain that ran down the back of my left leg. I thought maybe I pulled a muscle playing tennis so I ignored it.  I don't know how to describe it but I started experiencing shock like sensations down my arms and legs particularly if I bent over.  I reduced my dose to once a day to see what would happen the symptoms subsided but did not go away until I stopped taking the medication.  Any thoughts?
Other	Lynnhabby, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	2/2/2009 7:37:05 PM	I have used Fosteum for 3 months. Today I went back to the Dr that prescribed it. I have had more than normal breast tenderness, swollen breast, very uncomfortable to the point that even a bra hurt to be on and shooting pains in my legs. My T score was 1.1 The Dr said to stop Fosteum right away and in 30 days my symptoms should go away. I hope so.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/2/2009 6:29:44 PM	Easy to use and much safer than Foxamax, Boniva, etc!  Highly recommend it!
Other	Keely, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	3	Female	55-64	10/17/2008 5:59:32 PM	I have Osteopenia.  I have only taken it for a month.  Too early to tell if it's effective. Side effects are constipation and smelly urine.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	9/21/2008 8:02:51 PM	Rx gave me same side effects as I  experienced being on various types/doses of the Pill and Premarin. The shooting pains in my legs went away within a week of stopping Fosteum. Will never know if it helped with slowing bone loss.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/4/2008 10:38:42 PM	Works great on my hot flashes and has shown increased bone mass density according to my doctor.  I could not tolerate bisphosphonates and this was a new option I found.  Only drawback is having to take twice a day, but the benefits far out way that.  No side effect issues and an all natural substance.  Why worry about the risks of the other products when you may not need them yet, or if you get on Fosteum soon enough...may not need at all! Highly recommend it.  I brought the information I found on the Fosteum website to my doctor and she prescribed it after her own research.
Other	zb, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	4/27/2008 8:38:40 PM	The medication has caused tooth pain.  I have checked out all other causes with a dentist.  The pain is directly related to taking the drug. 
Other	duranee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/5/2007 12:46:16 PM	It's too early to tell about bone yet, but Fosteum has significantly reduced my hot flashes.  I've had no side effects.
