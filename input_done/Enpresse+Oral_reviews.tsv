Birth Control	kellykris, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	35-44	9/16/2012 4:17:22 AM	Did not even realize that my prescription had changed until noticing mood swings, weight gain and chemical changes-ie. vaginal foul odor-going off this immediately!
Birth Control	JenC, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	7/26/2012 12:17:46 PM	I have slowly been developing an itchy rash on my face since last fall.  I have been at a loss as to what may have caused it.  Until I read these reviews.  I remembered I had been switched from Trivora to Enpresse around the time the rash started.  Now I am convinced it is due to this drug.  How can I be switched back to Trivora if the pharmacies do not carry it anymore?
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	7/9/2012 3:08:04 PM	Pharmacies should not be permitted to exchange this drug for Trivora. They are not the same. I was on Trivora for 3 years without issue until the pharmacy switched me last year. I have not been myself since - crazy mood swings, depression, itchy rash in the sun, etc...It took me so long to figure out that it was the Enpresse because I have never experienced such terrible side effects from birth control in the 10 years I have been on it. The fact that the pharmacy is allowed to simply switch my prescription without my or my doctors permission should be illegal because Trivora and Enpresse are definitely not the same. 
Birth Control	Sierra, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	7/6/2012 8:57:04 PM	Enpresse works very well for me. I've been on Enpresse for 13 months now,  I have had no strange side effects and I have not gotten pregnant. Very happy :)
Birth Control	AlohaMom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	7/2/2012 7:28:20 PM	I suppose the birth control was effective but I noticed that my hair was thinning very quickly and had to redo my hair part to hide the thinning spots. I chalked the hairloss to getting older but I just saw my hair dresser this week and he said my hair had thinned considerably especially where it framed myface since the last time I saw him six months ago. He had to cutmy hair to add volume and hide the balding spots. I got on Enpresse 4 months ago because the refill center ran out of Trivora and I would have had to wait longer. I didn't link the hair loss to Enpress--my hairdresser brought it up first. When I mentioned my hairloss, he said he had gone to a training where they discussed how birth control pills are contribute to hair loss. I didn't even tell him that I was on birth control but when he mentioned it, I realized I had changed my prescription to Enpresse a few months earlier. My change in birth control was the only thing I could think of regarding changes in my diet, lifestyle or meds. I am a reasonably healthy female who eats healthy nutritious foods daily and am fairly active physically. I take good care of myself and rarely get sick or rarely take over the counter meds. I had been using Trivora --the only prescription med I take--for over 10 years with no problems. Also on Enpresse, I noticed getting cramps which I don't recall getting when on Trivora. I am back on Trivora now and will be watching to see if my hairloss continues or abates. 
Birth Control	rz123123, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	6/20/2012 3:34:05 PM	Have tried a lot of birth control and Enpresse was by far the worst. It made me severely depressed- I thought it was just me until I read other reviews and then stopped taking it and went back to normal! Also definitely killed my libido. I would steer clear...
Birth Control	Doxie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	6/18/2012 9:02:31 AM	Like everyone else, I was switched from Trivora against my will because Walgreens stopped carrying it.  I moved my Rx to Drugstore.com because they carried Trivora, and two months later Walgreens bought them out and I can't get it again!  No pharmacy in town seems to have it.  They should start calling this pill DEPRESSE.  My moods are crazy--thoughts of suicide, lack of energy.  I have constant cramps, hunger, and headaches the entire cycle.  When I was able to switch back to Trivora temporarily it all went away.  This pill is just awful!
Birth Control	josie_q, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	6/16/2012 6:24:45 PM	i was switched to this medication as well and not by choice! i had been on Trivora for 4 years and never had a problem with it, then my pharmacy switched me to this claiming to be the same thing as they are both generics for the same company. well i hated it!! THIS MEDICATION MADE MY HAIR FALL OUT!!! and this was not your normal amount of hair, this was huge gobs of it in the shower, in my brush, on my pillow... i also felt more emotional and bigger mood swings. i hated being on this and only had a few refills left so i had to complete my 3 month prescription before i could order a refill and thank god they gave me my Trivora prescription back!! When i asked the Pharmacy to never put me on it again, they said they could send me generics of the same thing at any time and if i didnt like it to tell my Doctor and have her write the prescription for Trivora only, no other generics. U best believe i did it and now i dont have to worry about getting my birth control mixed up again!!
Birth Control	Megs95, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	13-18	6/11/2012 1:12:40 AM	I had been taking Trivora and then my pharmacy switched me to Enpresse without any warning. when I asked why it was different, they told me it was the same thing. No, it definitely is not. Since taking Enpresse I've been crazy moody. I don't even want to be around me and I know I'm driving my boyfriend insane. I've been hungry all the time. My breast have gotten bigger and tender. I've had trouble sleeping. I'm breaking out. and I've been feeling nauseaus. And from what I've read from the other comments, it sounds like I get to look forward to longer period and spotting. Well that just wont work. I need to switch back immediately!
Absence of Menstrual Periods	Jenna, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	4/27/2012 11:57:28 PM	I have been on Enpresse for 4 months now. I was aware that there would be some side effects, but I didn't know it would be this noticeable. I got an extremely itchy rash on my legs, very swollen ankles, bloating, and pain in my calves. Because of the risk with blood clots, I am having to switch. But this pill has helped regulate my periods (I used to get it once every 90 days) and helped my acne tremendously. I have been less oily and clearer. No cysts. I break out the week before my period but it is nowhere near bad. And I've always struggled with acne-I have the scars to prove it. =( So this has saved my skin, but the rest of my body isn't responding so well. Hope the next kind doesn't make me break out! 
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	Jenna, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	4/25/2012 11:32:40 PM	Every time I look at reviews for Enpresse, I only see negative reviews. I'm afraid I have a negative one as well. I started taking birth control because I had acne and would get my period once every 90 days. Obviously a hormone issue. I've been on Enpresse for 4 months now. While it has cleared my acne up so much, I have very swollen feet and ankles, I feel bloated and heavy, very moody, and I have an insanely itchy rash on my legs. I thought I was allergic to something in my room but after reading a post where someone else got eczema on their legs, I'm beginning to think that's what it is. I have always had acne-used to be severe-and I thought having swollen ankles and a rash was worth it to FINALLY not wake up to 5 huge cysts. But I am becoming miserable on this birth control and I don't recommend it to anyone. I think next month I'm going to try a new kind and hope that it takes care of the acne and regulates my period without huge ankles, bloating, and a rash. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	4/15/2012 9:15:31 PM	I've been taking trivora for about 8 years and my pharmacy also switched me to enpresse claiming it was the same - this was a few months ago - since then, I have developed severe eczema on my legs and continue to gain weight even though I haven't changed any of my habits. I don't know if enpresse is the cause but it might be since everything else has been kept constant.
Birth Control		4	3	1			4/7/2012 3:38:44 PM	So glad I read these reviews... same thing happened to me.  Pharmacy switched my generic to Enpresse without telling me.  When I questioned the change, I was told it was the same thing as Trivora.  My periods have been more challenging since the switch, more cramping &amp; have gained 10 lbs in the past 2 months since the switch, even though I've been eating healthier.  Never made the connection that the medication switch was to blame.  Just got switched to a different birth control again - Lutera.  We'll see how it goes...
Birth Control	mrh2012, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	3/29/2012 3:57:25 PM	My pharmacy is out of Trivora. I have been taking Trivora for over 10 years without any issues or side effects. Since switching to Enpresse two months ago I have had some of the listed side effects...acne on areas of my body which I have never had before, extreme dry skin on face, cramping after menstrual cycle, daily spotting/bleeding a week + after cycle, along with an extended length of cycle. I am convinced that it is not the same exact drug as Trivora, as I was told by the pharmacy. 
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	13-18	3/25/2012 6:08:55 PM	I only took this pill for 2 weeks but I hated it. I was so emotional and it made me so hungry all the time. But it did help with my cramps and my periods were lighter but longer. 
Birth Control	kareno, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	3/10/2012 10:48:29 PM	Well, I haven't gotten pregnant, so I suppose it's worked at that. But, I have been dissatisfied other than that. I've been on Trivora for years but moved and switched pharmacies. Rite Aid filled Trivora as Enpresse without asking or telling me. That happened right after I needed an annual renewal, when m doctor then wrote not to use a generic and they did it again, again not telling me. They claim Trivora is no longer manufactured. I haven't figured out if that's true or not yet. Anyone know? My symptoms haven't been as severe as others, but I either have spotting or a period starting a couple days earlier than usual and very lightly. I generally feel worse during periods on Enpresse, with irritability, fatigue, and increased sensitivity to sound, etc, that I didn't otherwise have. I've also had mild weight gain (a couple pounds after being the same weight for over 5 years). I had no problems with Trivora and was very pleased with it and was very satisfied.
Birth Control	zap, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/7/2012 11:42:40 AM	ENPRESSE WAS HORRIBLE!! I had been taking Trivora for years without ANY issues. Then my pharmacist gave me Enpresse without any consultation, only a sticker noting that this was the same drug. FAR FROM IT!!!  Within 2 weeks my life changed as I woke up one morning thinking I had a stroke.  Numbness, slurred speech, confusion, horrible mood swings, so much irritability, swelling, weight gain, cramping, dizziness, MIGRAINES...the list goes on - almost every side effect experienced. I have never been through something so scary!  MRI, Ultrasound, blood tests, pregnancy tests, several specialist visits all to determine what was wrong with me. I could not work, and barely take care of my kids because I did not have control. I switched back to Trivora the next day after the &quot;stroke&quot; happened and after almost 2 months, can finally say I feel better. DO NOT FIND OUT THE LIFE-CHANGING WAY THAT I DID THAT ENPRESSE HAS HORRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS AND IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR TRIVORA!! 
Birth Control	Adreesa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	3/3/2012 10:11:48 PM	Since 2 weeks after starting this medication as my pharmacy informed me that my ins no longer cover brand prescription drugs I have had HORRIBLE side-affects that included not sleeping but 2 maybe 3 hours a night,  Migraine headaches, excessive bleeding, horrible cramps, nausea and GROUCHY ... MOOD SWINGS that are so bad i can not stand myself.  This was not a good experience at all.  I gain 20 pounds since taking (3 months) this medication and CRAVINGS that were uncontrollable. upon first request on medication change pharmacy stated i would have to pay out of pocket 2nd request they talked to my doctors office 3 request NO QUESTIONS ASKED got &quot;the brand name&quot; Triphasil ... The pharmacist was more than helpful as i described many of these side-affects. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	2/9/2012 7:25:57 PM	I have taken Trivora for years without any issues. I was switched to Enpresse when I was forced to switch pharmacies due to insurance changes. I was guaranteed at the pharmacy they were the same, THEY ARE NOT THE SAME! I have had almost every symptom listed. Horrible depression, anxiety and lack of energy. My face broke out worse than my teens. I gained 5 lbs in two months, couldnt control my appetite. Bloating &amp; irritability. Worst of all had abnormal bleeding and cramps halfway through my cycle. Which had me wondering if there was a serious problem. Switching back to Trivora IMMEDIATELY.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	25-34	2/7/2012 11:20:31 AM	I was put on Trivora in 2002. Somewhere around 2008-2009 I was no longer given Trivora by the pharmacy, but Enpresse. It's hard to tell what came first (chicken or egg) in regards to my chronic anxiety and depression... but only now in 2012 am I beginning to wonder if the original Trivora prescription had a hand in it. I have an MD appt in two days to discuss a possible link between my birth control and half a lifetime's worth of emotional torture. I feel the need to state that in 2002 when given Trivora, there was no investigation into the cause behind my menstruation absence. - &quot;Your mother was irregular when she was your age, it must be genetic. Here, have some pills.&quot; - A woman's hormones change throughout her life. Puberty, childbirth, menopause... yet we're fed a daily dose of regulated hormones without any regard by our health care professionals for our bodies' natural chemistry. For 10 years I've blamed myself. Maybe it's time to start blaming the pill.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	19-24	1/11/2012 9:45:16 PM	Let me just say Enpresse and Trivora are completely different! Empress makes me crazy! I am very emotional. Cry all the time over the dumbest things. I also have no motivation and feel tired. I have also gained about 7 pounds in the last month.I feel like my appetite has increased. I will definitely be going back to Trivora! ENPRESSE IS HORRIBLE!
Birth Control	yayamarie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	12/17/2011 5:52:52 PM	Switched from Trivora to Enpresse. Three days later and I've gotten nausea, splitting headaches, skin breaking out, constant fatigue, super irritable... went to get it switched back IMMEDIATELY
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	12/12/2011 7:35:39 PM	I switched from Ortho Tri-Cyclen because the cost was too high.  I was prescribed tri-levlen by my doctor, but the pharmacy gave me enpresse as the generic.  I took the pill for over five months and I put on 30 lbs, my face was constantly breaking out, I would bleed so heavily during my period that I was concerned I was hemmorraging, I had tenderness in my breast BUT WORST OF ALL  I WAS FEELING SUICIDAL.  I have always been a happy well adjusted woman and while I was on enpresse, I could barely get out of bed to face the day.  Stay away from this stuff!!  I'm back on Ortho now and I've dropped the weight and my mood is back to myself.  Money be damned, no few dollars saved is worth the hell that I went through on that stuff.
Birth Control	Willig34,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female		12/4/2011 12:18:53 AM	I don't like it.  I want my tri-phasil 28 back. Everyone is telling me it's the same but it's not.
Birth Control	wiserandrelieved, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	35-44	11/3/2011 10:55:06 AM	I just began my second month on this medication as my pharmacy stopped carrying Trivora. I have experienced much nausea, especially earlier in the cycle, to the point of vomitting a couple times.  Additionally, I have been struggling with increased irritability, and depression symptoms to include fatigue and horrible thoughts.  I just recently figured out this is the likely culprit -- YIKES. I am switching back to Trivora and my insurance approved to pay for a new prescription this month as a &quot;change in therapy.&quot; I will gladly go to a new pharmacy for this!
Birth Control	bbgg1919, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/17/2011 6:19:04 PM	I've been on this pill for nearly two months and can't really complain. Slight appetite increase, but realizing it's a side effect, I just choose to eat healthier things and not give in to every tummy rumble ( especially if I just ate). So no weight gain. My sex drive is normal and hasn't changed, and my periods are lighter. I was experiencing slight fatigue in the beginning, but thats now gone as well. As for mood, I feel the same (no extra pmsing lol)everyone is different though, you just need to see if it works for you!
Painful Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	9/16/2011 7:20:06 PM	I was switched to Enpresse from Trivora and have since felt more fatigued than I have ever felt. I've been feeling terrible on the emotional end of things.. depressed/down. I'm only on the 1st pack so I'll give this pill a little longer but so far.. not liking it at all.. what a drastic change in moods/feelings.
Birth Control	listenhereyou, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	8/22/2011 7:46:00 AM	I was on Trivora for a year or so and really liked it. I had tried Yaz, Mononessa, and Loestrin, and hadn't been happy with the side effects (weight gain, crazy emotions, lethargy, zero sex drive), but finally I was happy with Trivora. A couple months ago, my pharm stopped carrying it and gave me Enpresse. At first, I had mood swings, random depression spells, mild headaches, and an almost-daily mild stomach ache. I was ready to find a new pharmacy. BUT... I decided to stick it out a few months to see if I adjusted, and I did. I don't get the headaches or stomach aches any more, my moods have gone back to their regular habits, my sex drive hasn't taken a hit, and I haven't gained a pound. So... don't be too hasty to quit if you can stick out your symptoms for a month or two. It might get better.
Birth Control	Kristy , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	8/18/2011 9:09:16 AM	I've been taking Tri-levelin for years without any side effects. Two months ago, my doctor changed my prescription to Enpresse. I should have questioned this but didn't. I've gained ten pounds and my breasts are swollen. I called my doctor this morning to change back to Tri-levelin. I am very disappointed in Enpresse! 
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	8/3/2011 10:55:58 PM	Had an allergic reaction to this pill. Horrible red itchy rash. Went back to Trivora with no problems or side effects. 
Birth Control	36tacos, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	5	1	Female	25-34	8/2/2011 10:08:01 AM	My dr recently switched me from tri-sprintec to triphasil, but I got the generic being enpresse.  I've switched pills a few times over the years and never had problems.  I've been on this for 3 weeks but had to stop.  In 3 weeks I've gained 7lbs with no adjustment to eating habits, awful daily am migraine headaches (feels like a bad hangover - less the drinking), paranoia, crying, cramping, and nausea.  When the nausea got so bad that I spent 3 hours vomiting this morning, I called the dr immediately and advised I just couldn't take it anymore.  After talking to a friend that is a pharmacist I've decided to stop taking any pill for about 2 months and then go back to the tri-sprintec.  It matches orth tricyclen the best, and I loved that one but insurance makes me get generic.  Hopefully it works well for others, unfortunately it didn't work for me.

Birth Control	seekonkgirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	7/5/2011 6:53:40 PM	I was recently switched to Enpresse from Trivora because my pharmacy no longer carried Trivora. I have suffered from anxiety and depression in the past and have to fight it off.  Enpresse has brought back all of my anxiety and depression and I feel awful.  I have also had spottng before my period.  This was very unexpected.  I have found another pharm. that carries Trivora and I am switching next month.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	6/23/2011 1:07:03 PM	I was on Trivora and then was switched to Enpresse because it was cheaper. I was told it was the same thing, but I've been way moodier and depressed than I had ever been on Trivora. I've taken this for almost 2 months and Its even starting to affect my relationship with my boyfriend. Also just started spotting. WORST PILL EVER. Switch back if you are given this.
Birth Control	sarahjg, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	6/22/2011 2:40:59 PM	I was switched to Enpresse from my normal Trivora this past month. I had severe anxiety, depression, lightheadedness and generally feeling terrible. The pharmacy told me this was the same pill as Trivora, but I soon found out this is not the case. I am in the process of getting switched back. What an awful experience! 
Absence of Menstrual Periods	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	5	1	Female	35-44	1/7/2011 10:59:25 AM	I have been taking Trivora for 15 years and never had any side effects, love this pill.  However, I decided to try Enpresse because it was cheaper and my new Health Insurance had not kicked in.  My weight went from 119 to 125 in one week!  I feel lethargic, lazy and always hungry.  I have horrible insomnia and my mouth is always dry.  Thank god I put 2 and 2 together because I was starting to think I was crazy.  I am only a week in but will never take this pill again.  Anyone thinking of switching....do not take Enpresse.  Trivora or Triphasil is worth the extra money!!!

Ever since I was nine years old{this is when I started my cycle}I have had abnormally long and heavy periods.  I forget what kind of bc I was on some years ago.  It seemed to work w/o problems.  I have taken empresse for a week and a half now.  I have experienced nausia, bloating, spotting, headaches, and worst of all, the most scary...Chest pain and intense pain in my left arm.  I am terrified that I will have a heart attack.  I do not recomend this medcine to anyone.  It is dangerous, and I refuse to further risk my life on this pill.  while viewing other comments, I've discovered that only about three ppl went w/o complications..atleast that they knew of.
Other	Alejandra, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	8/22/2010 5:18:27 AM	I am a Trivora user, and my new pharmacist gave me Enpresse instead of my usual Trivora. I am very apprehensive about continuing this medication considering the reviews and I wasn't too thrilled about Enpresse anyway. It is the second day of my cycle and I think I will switch back to Trivora and use Enpresse as an EC. So far, I have noticed a little swellling in my fingers, I am sleepy, and mildly nauseous. I hope that my side effects don't worsen if I continue this drug.

Birth Control	Disappointed, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	8/6/2010 9:23:33 AM	I was on Enpresse for 3 years and I am very healthy, fit, and have never smoked.  I ended up having a TIA (small-stroke).  I was tested and they found absolutely nothing wrong with me.  I can only conclude that my families history with strokes and taking birth control was a bad combo.  If your family has a history of strokes...I don't recommend this from my experience.  I had to go through major and expensive testing and will never be able to take birth control again.  (I was only 23)

Ive been real emotional, moody, and depressed. I was taking Sprintec. Next month when i go to the doctor im going to get a different pill. I do not recomend Enpresse.
Birth Control	briieme, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	5/15/2010 2:38:02 AM	First off, I switched to the pill from Ocella because I was having really bad mood swings the few days before my period. Now that I'm on this pill, I have moodiness, mood swings, and depression all month. I usually get cramps about 4 days a year and on my first period with this pill I had cramps three days. I also had pretty heavy spotting for the first three days after taking the pill and after my first period on the pill. It was more than just a few drops. I have a reduced appetite and enlarged breasts, which isn't too bad, but the mood swings are already wrecking my relationship with my boyfriend and have made me constantly confused with my behavior and stressed. The person that I am on Empresse isn't the real me. That a birth control pill has this much control over my emotions is worrisome. I am going to call my doctor on Monday and ask about switching.
Birth Control	Jules, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	5/10/2010 8:36:16 AM	I am very unhappy with Enpresse. I have had abnormal bleeding, horrible cramps, breast tenderness, increase in appetite and I've gained 4 pounds in 3 weeks. I am talking to my doctor today to switch to something else. I do not recommend this birth control pill.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	5/7/2010 6:16:16 PM	After taking Trivora, I changed to Enpresse after changing pharmacies. I experienced weight gain, swelling, breast tenderness and emotional lability. I've switched back to Trivora
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/4/2010 11:23:57 AM	I've taken this for over two years and have had no noticable side effects. I have very light periods, no cramping, and no headaches. I'm ore concerned with trying to get preganat after I'm married because I've been on some sort of BC for 15 years.

Birth Control	Wendy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	4/7/2010 9:39:21 AM	Two days after taking this medication I started breaking out, and I'm almost 40. My face is dry and chapped and I looked like I gained 5 years in age. I also can't stop eating.
Birth Control	Micky, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	3/30/2010 11:32:55 PM	I am 18 years old. In the past 6 months I have taken 3 different BC pills. For the first four months I took Tri-Lo-Sprintec, a generic for Ortho-Tri-Cylen Lo. I had to switch to the brand name briefly because Tri-lo-sprintec was removed from the market. I was very upset because it was a wonderful pill with minimal side effects for me. I switched to Enpresse this month because I no longer have precription coverage. So far the only side-effects I've encountered are very tender, swollen breasts. I have been able to lose weight on this pill and so far have had no break through bleeding. I have been very nauseated when I wake up this week. I am attributing this to the pill because I am not pregnant. Overall, I can say that I am pleased with my experience so far. I will repost with an update if I am dissatisfied for any reason. BC pills prevent your body's natural processes; sure it's going to be upset with what you're doing.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	3/10/2010 11:26:33 AM	This is the first and only pill I've ever taken and my breasts have been pretty sensitive and a little swollen ever since I started taking Enpresse, which was in December of '09, and I get cramps randomly through out the month. I'm definitely going to talk to my doctor about possibly switching.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	1/19/2010 5:25:14 PM	Since the pharmacy switched me to Enpresse I have put on a few pounds, but the worst side effect is my face is broken out and I am 42 yrs old.  My complexion has NEVER been a problem.  I am back on Trivora 28 and have switched pharmacies.
Birth Control	Jen, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	1/13/2010 8:14:19 AM	My pharmacy switched me from Trivora to Enpresse because it was cheaper. I now have an uncontrollable appetite, cramps all month long, bouts of depression a day or two at a time, and my headaches have increased. All my period symptoms are amplified; cramps, bloating, swollen breasts, moodiness. I rarely had any symptoms at all with Trivora. 
Birth Control	Forty Something, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	35-44	1/8/2010 3:02:06 PM	I took Triphasil for years happily but was switched to Empresse, the generic brand, several years ago.  I went off this drug last month.  I had the nausea, throwing up, bloating, breast pain, and severe headaches (probably migraines but never got it diagnosed) for the past several years at the same time every month which lasted one to two weeks depending on the side effect.  The doctor said my hormones were changing because of my age and some of these symptoms were normal for those entering their forties.  Now I know that these horrible side effects were caused by Empresse.  All of these side effects stopped last month when I stopped taking this drug.   
Birth Control	bikinbabe06, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/6/2010 12:26:48 PM	I received Enpresse in place of my usual Trivora. The Pharmacist says &quot;it's the same thing&quot;. WEll...it's not. I'm only on my 2nd week. I can't stop eating, I've gained 3lbs, my boobs are swollen, stomach bloated, moody-more than the norm, and break through bleeding. I'm not taking it anymore. I'm getting Trivora back. This substitution B-S should be illegal!!!! 
Birth Control	gracie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	1/2/2010 2:05:07 PM	Just started taking this pill for about 3 days and have been getting headaches that feel like migranes. Feeling light headed and wanting to vomit. I've never had side effects with the bc pill but with this one i have. 
Birth Control	none, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	12/17/2009 11:25:25 AM	I had also been on Trivora and received Enpresse when I went to get my refill.  This is my first month taking it and I have experienced a significant increase in appetite as well as extreme moodiness!  I am in the process of trying to get a new prescription from my doctor
Birth Control	froggie21281, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	12/15/2009 4:41:36 PM	I was on trivora 28 for about 3 years. my pharmacy switched me to enpresse as the new generric form. im 4 months i gained almost 20 lbs, and my cup size went up almost 2 sizes due to the pill! I as most women really am unsatasified with this!! I called my doctor and getting it switched immediately!!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	10/24/2009 11:11:44 AM	I've been on trivora-28 for six years and they changed me to enpresse because it's the cheaper generic. I experienced a rapid weight gain, as well as breast tenderness, break through bleeding, unusual tiredness and rapid mood changes. They told me it'd be the same as taking Trivora. I'm very unhappy and am switching back to Trivora at the end of this month.
Birth Control	OLD USER, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	10/14/2009 4:40:23 PM	I HAVE BEEN ON TRI-LEVELIN AND OTHER BCP'S OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS AND WAS NOT OPPOSED TO TRY THIS WHEN SWITCHED TO THIS GENERIC BY THE DRUG PLAN.  UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING HEADAHCES, NAUSEA, VISION CHANGES, MILD DEPRESSION, INCREASED MENSTRUAL PERIODS, LIGHT HEADEDNESS OVER THE PAST 3 MONTHS JUST PRIOR AND DURING MY CYCLES.  I HAVE CALLED MY DOCTORS TO MAKE CHANGES. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS GENERIC HAS SUCH SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS ON ME.
Birth Control	`, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	9/21/2009 9:33:19 AM	With nothing else changing in my diet or general changes except for changing from Trivora, I experienced signficant mood swings and some weight gain.  This is my first month taking this pill and I will not get it again.  
Birth Control	JLO, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1		35-44	9/15/2009 7:35:44 AM	This is my first month using Enpresse because my pharmacist switched manufacturers. I have been on the pill for 20 years and have never had a worse month than this one - horrible mood swings, severe depression and headaches. Did experience some constipation but did not make the connection until reading the other comments. I am switching back to Trivora - which gave me no adverse side affects. I hate when the pharmacy switches meds without warning. 
Birth Control	Leah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	9/12/2009 9:46:12 PM	2 months ago I visited my pharmacy to pick up my prescription. They said that &quot;the manufactorer has changed the colors of the pills, but all else is the same&quot; Since then I've had horrible side effects, (extreme breast sensitivity and swelling). I know they changed something else besides the color and I'm VERY angry that they lied to me about it. After this month's pack, I'm changing pills.
Other	hje03, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	8/15/2009 7:35:59 PM	Very sick to my stomach and very dizzy. Would not recommend.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	8/3/2009 2:52:00 PM	I've been taking Trivora 28 for years. Enpresse is another generic for the same medication. The pharmacy switched me because Enpresse was cheaper.  Although they have the same active ingredients, I got very sick to my stomach while taking Enpresse. Severe abdominal pain, nausea, my bowels were irritated, and horrible cramps. I generally do not have a problem taking differnt generics with other mediations. However, something in Enpresse made me very very sick to my stomach. I am back on Trivora and do not have any problems.
