Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	jencespencer,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female		6/30/2012 9:46:53 PM	Hard to remember to take it on time...cause you never know when you eat. And I had major side effects. I was tired all the time, muscle weakness, sleepy, and jittery. My brain was running 30 miles an hour. cant think straight. Be careful if you noticed any twitches, cause I couldn't stood still.
Nausea and Vomiting	carrie62700, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/14/2012 11:37:51 AM	I had been suffering from Post Infectious Irritable Bowel Syndrom.  After starting this medication along with the probiotic Florasol, I nausea disappeared as if by magic, like a light switch being turned off, or burning out.  I'm not sure if it was only this med, or a combination of the two, but it worked and I finally feel back to normal after a year of feeling constantly sick to my stomach, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting at times, and severe diarrhea.  I have not had any side effects, but will ask the doctor to discontinue after a couple of months to see how I do, and to avoid the precautions that have been described that this drug may cause.  Hope it helps others in a good way as well.

She still cannot drink a lot of water without throwing it up right away, so her meals are 'slurries' of dog food and water --- seems to be working.  We cut her medication in half (to 5mg) taken before a meal, and her 'confusion' factor seems to be subsiding.

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE! Ive been hospitalized TWICE since taking this drug MIGRAINES, SPASMS, NAUSEA, SEVERE DROWSINESS, SEVERE STOMACH PAINS ETC have all occurred since being on this drug. Being pregnant I assumed headaches, nausea, pains were normaly symptoms, however after the nightmares, waking up every hr, hallucinating, mood swings, weight loss, back spasms, body jerking, migraines, loss of vision,  unable to breathe at times, being able to walk for three days straight and finally the last straw being hospitalized for severe pre labor pains, i decided to look up the drug. For a moment i believed it was only me feeling this way due to my pregnancy, however after reading more about this drug i am shocked to see i am not the only one! I WOULD NOT TAKE THIS DRUG ANYMORE!!! I am in fear for the life of my unborn son, This drug needs to be banned IMMEDIATELY. If you know anyone who is taking this drug or are on it yourself, stop taking it, these side effects are PERMANENT!!!

I had a constant feeling of fullness, occaisional heartburn, and periodic episodes of severe stomach cramps.I started by taking on pill per day, then switched to an &quot;as needed&quot; basis.  Within 15-45 minutes of taking the medicine, my stomach cramps are 100% gone and I can sometimes feel and hear it work as it seems to push the food out of my stomach for instant releif of my pain.After only 6 months on this Rx, I began taking them only &quot;as needed&quot; and now, 2+ years later, I take maybe 2 per month.I have been very satisfied with this Rx.  It has done wonders for me.  My previous PCP prescribed Nexium which only made my symptoms worse.  Thank goodness for a PCP who properly diagnosed my problem.I carry my Rx with me all the time and it has made my quality of life so much better.

After taking for one day, he cannot stop coughing and can hardly speak. He cannot walk unassisted, has nightmares, falls asleep while talking, feels bloated, has swelling all over his body and cannot concentrate. He should have gone to the hospital, but didn't think he could make it down the stairs. He stopped taking this drug and within 24 hours - his cough is subsiding and he is more alert. I cannot thank these reviews enough for making me aware of the side-effects of this drug. None of this was mentioned at the pharmacy when I picked this medication up and/or is it mentioned in the paperwork which accompanies this medication from the pharmacy.My husband is also on kidney dialysis, is a severe diabetic and is a post 6 by-pass heart surgery patient. I'm sure this all attributed to his side-effects, but no mention of any of these reactions was noted by the pharmacy. The only side-effect mentioned on the paperwork were &quot;may cause diarrhea, headache, dizziness or drowsiness.&quot;

I went to a specialist and put a scope down to my stomach and they found that my food wasn't digesting properly.  Metoclopramide has helped me greatly.  I only take it twice a day but it has eliminated my upset stomach and feeling of vomiting.  I didn't take it for a day and my upset stomach came back.  The only bad experience I had with this drug is one night I had about 3-4 alcoholic drinks and then I got tunnel vision, light headed, and I passed out (fell to the floor) for a few seconds.  That was my fault though because I was advised not to drink.
