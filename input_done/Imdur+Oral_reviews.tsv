Had triple bypass last year and have had 2 stents with one heart attack at age 34.  I have been very lucky and do not have any side effects except it slowed me down so much and made me kind of foggy.  Hard to work like that.  I recently restarted again after hospitalization with chest pain and unstable angina.  Now I take at night with most of my daily meds and I think it helps me sleep.  I have only taken a few days now but so far so good!

Don't think its more scar tissue so soon but who knows without more angioplasty...I have never had plaque in my arteries.  My heart attack was from dissection only.  11 stents now from scar tissue.  I hate the way this drug makes me feel... but it makes me not have to have angiogram again so soon I will suffer through it.

Was hospitalized in November for angina after having 3 stents implanted in April. I take tylenol to reduce the slight headache, but have noticed I tend to get nausous often.But I am happy with how I feel overall and feel this medication is worth any side effects.I didn't see anyone mention that they felt tired while on this med. I do feel tired a great deal of the time. Has anyone else noticed this or felt this med has this effect on them? I've thought about splitting the pill and taking 1/2 in the a.m. and 1/2 at bedtime. Going to ask cardiologist first.

I had preasure and pain in my chest with exercise and Imdur took care of it. The first heart doctor told me that the only releif I could fine would be with a stent never even mentioning the drug imdur. My second doctor  gave me a choice. Not only did imdur help me with my chest pain it also helped me with the circulation in my feet and my hands. I always had cold hands and cold blue feet. Now both these things are gone. I can not say enough about this medication and wonder why more doctors do not offer this to there patients as a first treatment before  going the stent route whic is still on the iffy list.

After about 3 weeks my MD increased my dose to 120 mg as I had been realizing minor relief. Within a few days at 120mg taken each morning, I began to notice that beginning in early-to mid-afternoon the angina returned. I have just requested my cardiologist to allow me to increase my am dose to 180mg each morning.   My side effects are the predicted dizziness if I stand up abruptly (I am watching this and managing to control the light-headedness by slowing down on standing. Recently I began with back of my head headaches that I manage with tylenol. I am so grateful for the Imdur; it has relieved my worries a great deal. Feel free to email me at jtremb3940@aol.com.
