Bronchospasm Prevention with COPD	CatTexas, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/10/2010 12:44:13 AM	This medicine has literally given me back my life.  I would get COPD flareups which were exacerbated by seasonal allergies.  I was prescribed Advair 50/100 which did seem to help for a while, but after I was diagnosed with some serious eye problems which probably came from the steriod I quit taking them.  I was using the Proair inhaler but it was not effective.  I had an ER visit followed by a visit with a Pulmonolgist.  I had all the lung tests done and he prescribed the Brovana.  It was difficult to find treatment that did not contain steroids so I am very lucky that it works so well.  I have literally zip side effects from it.  I use it in the morning before I go to work and then in the evening.  I rarely use my Proair emergency inhaler.  We live in Texas where there are seasonal allergies all year round and with the brovana I can make it through the whole day.  I've been using it since Nov of 09 and it has been a definite lifesaver.

I rarely use my emergency inhaler.It had to be combined with Pulmicort which took away the moisture.  Life is good again.

She has had far less shortness of breath and very seldom needs to use a rescue inhaler or Xopenex treatment. Brovana is expensive but worth every penny if one can experience the turn-around my 63 year old Mother has.

In the past several years I have only used the treadmill in my bedroom to hang extra clothing. Within two days of using Brovana I was walking on my treadmill for a period of 15 minutes. I have tried various other inhalers including Duoneb, advair, Q-var, and albuterol with only minimal effectiveness. I am now doing a combination of Brovana (this was the drug that made the big difference), Combivent duoneb, and Q-var. The downside of Brovana (if you are not using Medicare Part B) is the cost-- $1000/90 days. Thus far, this drug has given me a new lease on life.

After first day I found that I only needed to use it once every 12 hours with out using any of the any of the previous meds all though the Dr. said to use them if needed. Only problem is it gives me loose bowels often? How long?? But sure beats using meds 4 times a day.

Also it seems easier to inhale, faster for sure. So far I am pleased using it.
