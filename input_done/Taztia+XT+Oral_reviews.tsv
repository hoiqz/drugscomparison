Didn't work very well. Added Quinapril, and BP became controlled. Don't know why DR kept me on it as well. Lost 85 lbs. BP became too low, stopped taking it, take BP daily, BP still below normal 110/70, (Normal - 120/80). Probably time to reduce the Quinapril as well. Initially TAZTIA XT on its own to control BP was not very effective, only slightly.

My BP was really high and it helped although I need additional such as lisinopril and HCT to fix my woes....
