The lymph nodes in my neck were swollen and sore.This medicine made my face swell, ears buzz, hands shake and eyes hurt.  I could not sleep more than 2  hours a night and I lost weight burning extra calories.  I was on the 13 day pack of misery.
Atopic Dermatitis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	1/18/2012 1:21:15 PM	I had a reaction to poison ivy and was severely broke out. This medicine did help. Now I know why athletes like to take steroids. It gave me plenty of energy and little sleep. My sense of taste left me. It all tasted like metal or salt. I have been off of it for 4 days now. Taste has been a little better. I have been really sleepy now. But as bad as my reaction to the poison was I would take it again. I was close to being put in the hospital.
Rash	sarah, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	4	Female	55-64	8/11/2011 3:33:34 AM	I found the pack EXTREMELY difficult to get medication out of it. If I was a senior citizen or had issues with my hand I would not have been able to access it.
Other	lcp012, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	45-54	8/9/2011 3:31:15 PM	I wouldn't take this medication unless absolutely necessary. In most cases, the horrible side effects will outweigh the benefit.    
Other	nozema, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	35-44	7/23/2011 7:00:22 PM	I would not reccommend this because it did nothing for me and for a couple of days after you finish it I was very fatigued and felt sicker than before I was on it.

Rash	Healthy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	55-64	6/11/2011 4:13:39 AM	Itching bug bites turned into a itching red rash of epic proportions which was unbearable itching. Was given the pak to take for 5 days and a local cream. The itching improved on 3rd day but not gone. The zema-pac side effects have been ringing in ears, hunger, sleepless nights, dry skin, nerves, deep tightness in chest when breathing and I still have 1pill left to take. Bug bits are not gone and still iching but I would not take this medication any longer.
Other	Isitworthit, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	5/28/2011 11:32:51 AM	I was given this medication for a severe sinus infection.  Upon taking it, I immediately water lose.  I could not sleep and I felt as though I was taking a stimuli.  I continued to take the medication because I had lost my sense of smell and taste.  After completing the prescribed dosage, I experienced water retention, and an appetite of an elephant.  There have got to be a better solution. I normally do no have a problem with my skin.  I see acne on my chin and shoulders.  Also, today I feel extremely tired and my chest hurts.
Rheumatic Disease causing Pain &amp;amp; Stiffness in Backbone	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	5/17/2011 7:43:34 PM	While the Zemapak helped stop the swelling in my lower back, the side effects were too severe.  I've been recovering from the side effects longer than the back pain itself.  The side effects I experienced were endless hunger, massive weight gain (15 lbs in 10 days), trouble sleeping, extreme muscle and joint ache in everything but my back, stabbing pains in the feet, and acne on my arms and back.  The only thing that didn't hurt was my back, and I felt like I had been in a car accident.  I may have had an allergy to it, but I will not be taking this medication again.
Other	thad, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Male	45-54	5/16/2011 4:49:22 PM	This was prescribed together with an antibiotic for severe sinus and bronchial infection / inflammation. On the day of my visit I received an injection of both. I started the pills the next day. I did feel better rapidly, but the zema-pak side effects were potent and lasted for well over a week after I took the last pill. My wife received exactly the same treatment and had similar effects. We both agreed we would not take this medication again due to the severity of the side effects. I became euphoric, disconnected, couldn't sleep, sweats, racing heart, all sexual function ceased, lost most skin sensation.  My digestion was completely altered - sudden bowel urges, extreme hunger. My face swelled. On the positive side all my arthritic aches and pains disappeared for a while.

My heart raced constantly, couldn't sleep over 2 hours at night, severe sweating, could not stop eating, dizziness, ect.  please be very careful if your doctor precribes this to you.

Asthma	carla, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Male		4/16/2011 3:08:59 PM	The blister pack is impossible to open and dispense pills.

Rapid heartbeat, swelling in my face and body, rapid weight gain (about 4-5 pounds in 5 days), abdominal discomfort, and headache.  Never want to take this again.  Have taken other steroids and no problems.  Will stick to the steroid cream for my feet and forget the oral garb.  Cream is helping just fine.

Rash	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male	25-34	11/2/2010 2:21:37 AM	Cant sleep.  I took two ambien tonight and slept 3 hrs and now I am wide awake.  Been about par for the cours.  Also all i want to do at night is eat amd I have been shaky and very irritable.  My face and neck get really red also about an hour after taking it.  I am really not sure if the doctor gave me this for this rash  I had or  the cough and congestion.  He also gave me azithromycin 3pk and 40mg pilosec.  I am only on day 5 of the meds and so far I still have the damn rash and my cough is still terrible at times but it is overall better.

Now 9 days later I am still having severe side effects.  It was prescribed for a severe sinus infection 6 wks after sinus surgery.  I can only sleep 3 hrs at night, my lymph nodes in my arm are grossly swollen, my arms and legs are in constant pain (feels like icy hot), trembling, profuse sweating, resting pulse of 96 bpm, racing heartbeat, headache, and it's caused me to get thrush infection in my throat and mouth.  I am going back to dr today to try to get some relief.  I'm glad this medicine helps some people but for me it is a nightmare and I wish I'd never heard of it!
