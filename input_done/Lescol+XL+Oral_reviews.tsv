Treatment to Prevent a Heart Attack	GNChicago, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	65-74	2/27/2011 3:00:18 PM	It is more expensive than GOLD (30daysX80mg for about $135 at Target). One oz (28.5g)would cost $1603. The gold price is about 1200/oz.The package is lousy, for a such expensive medication. I expect not to get loose pills in an open container. I DO EXPECT A FACTORY SEALED PACKAGE!!!!AND A LOWER PRICE!Last night, I refused an open container of 100 pills and they promised one for Monday and I tried to buy my medication for three days until they will provide a factory sealed container of 100 pills, but they wanted to charge me $20.99 for three pills of 0.080g and that means $2,400.00 per oz (28.5g) or reported to gold it is twice the price of gold (approx. $1,200/oz).I tried other generics, but were not good for me.

High Cholesterol	Firehair, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	2/21/2009 4:51:09 PM	I was on Lescol 80 XL for years, no side effects, not a problem, ever.  My cholesterol went from the 300 range to 168 in 30 days.    I was on it until 20 mo ago, when my provider refused to pay for it---I was switched to Lipitor.  I had to be taken off the Lipitor last week due to muscle weakness, higher b/p,  etc.    My M.D. and I are hoping Lescol has been put back on the o.k. to pay  list.

High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	55-64	11/21/2008 7:42:28 PM	Lescol XL is the second medication I have taken to control my cholesterol level.  The first was Lipitor (took that for 13 months and could barely walk).  Switched to Lescol XL in 2006 and started developing the same problems as with Lipitor (severe muscle weakness, pain in joints and even hair loss).  I no longer taken any form of statin.  Even though both medications lowered my cholesterol level it was not worth the side effect of not being able to walk without pain.
