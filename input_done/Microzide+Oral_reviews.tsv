High Blood Pressure	anonymous, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	1/1/2011 9:59:23 PM	My Dr. prescribed the 12.5 caps for my consistent borderline high bloodpressure.  at times it seems to work fine at other times, when i'm stressed it does not.  i have had higher readings.  it is also a challenge to keep myself hydrated while taking this as i usually didn't drink alot during the day.  she thought this would be the best start for me and for now my Dr. is satisfied so i guess i should be also.  i take the generic if that matters to anyone.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	7/16/2010 3:14:41 PM	I've been on this medicene for quite a while, 12.5mg. Then needed to increase to 25mg, I noticed my eyes were very dry, went to eye doctor and he said diurectics can dry eyes out. Got off of it, switched to another med that caused weight gain and swelling of ankles, now thinking of trying to go back on water pill but stay at lower dosage.  Others do not seem promising from what i read.

High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/24/2010 8:01:14 AM	My doctor prescribed 12.5 mg of Microzide about 9 months ago for high blood pressure. Initially, the medication worked very well. However, at my last appointment, the doctor informed me that my blood pressure was elevated despite the use of Microzide. The doctor said that she may increase my dosage at my next appointment. There have been no adverse side effects to report. There has been an increase in the amount of urine produced and frequency to eliminate. This is not a problem as I take the medication in the morning so it does not interfere with sleep.

Visible Water Retention	Judy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	2/5/2009 11:03:46 AM	Is it possible to stop taking this medicine after taking it for several years? I feel like I don't need it because I don't retain water only in the summer when it is hot.
