Birth Control	Alexandria, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	6/2/2010 11:15:03 PM	This is my second Mirena inserted, the first time I had alot of bleeding the first 2 months, after that I didn't have periods after the first year,under a Dr's care I was told I could keep it in, and did for 6 1/2 years, a new one was replaced and very little spotting at period time. I have been full of anxiety but have an anxiety problem, I'm not sure if it is the IUD or if it is situational. All in All I am very pleased with it.

I was in my late forties with heavy bleeding every two weeks or so. I was anemic and the bleeding was restricting my activities.  This changed my life.  After three months of daily spotting my period disappeared.  I have just had my second device inserted after the first five years ended.  I recommend this to anyone with heavy bleeding. I have had no weight gain or other side effects.  I have had and continue to have a very positive experience.
Birth Control	big hungry, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	7/22/2009 3:47:54 PM	I have had the mirena iud for 7 months. I feel slugish and tired all the time. I have gained alot of weight. My period is just starting to become regular after being irregular since December. Due to bleeding alot I have had two bacteria affections. I have numbness in my hands alot and very moody at times. I could go on and on. The only good think about this birth control method is that you don't have to worry about taking medication everyday. Once it's in after the first couple of days you forget it's there. 
Birth Control	vall, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	4/1/2009 12:50:48 AM	Lots of side effects the first 2 months. Then my body adapted to it &amp; the issues tapered off &amp; disappeared,I was on the verge of having it taken out &amp; glad I decided to ride it out. Moods,skin blemishes,weight gain at first - then that stopped &amp; weight loss actually started,in particular around my hips/lower body. You do have increased hunger with synthetic progestins so appetite can increase,you may have to eat more carefully,which I soon realized. All the aches,pains,nausea &amp; cramps have gone &amp; I feel tons of energy (first month I was so very tired with low libido. It takes awhile to see if this works for you &amp; after the spotting stopped it became carefree for me.Rocky going at first though,more so than with most BC pills Ive used - but better now than any pill Ive used.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	12/21/2008 2:39:04 AM	First I had a VERY painful and difficult time with the insertion because of a cervical fibroid that I didn't know I had until the time of insertion. Now since I have had the IUD in(for about 3 months), I have gained 18 pounds- with no change in eating/exersize habits, my breasts are always sore, and I have spotted every single day, I don't even know when my periods are supposed to be anymore! I am also extremely moody and depressed-  it probably doesn't help that none of my clothes fit! I am getting this IUD removed, I'll take my chances with non-hormonal birth conrtol methods from now on.

Weight is back to normal and periods are nonexistant. All and all, I think this is a good birth control method.

I hated this contraceptive method.  I would almost rather be pregnant!
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	35-44	3/20/2008 12:49:19 AM	It's apparently effective, as I have not gotten pregnant, but I have nearly every side effect.  I was not told in advance about the possible side effects, and I was told it was safe to use while breast-feeding, and now I've learned it's not recommended.  I'm very angry, and I am getting the iud removed ASAP.
