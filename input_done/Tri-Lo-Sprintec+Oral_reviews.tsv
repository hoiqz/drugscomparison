Birth Control	RW, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/11/2011 1:20:58 AM	I really loved tri-lo-sprintec and found this website searching whether it was still on the market. I used Othro Tricyclen Lo with good results, and when my pharmacy substituted it for Tri-lo I noticed no difference.  When Ortho got more expensive and tri-lo went off the market, I started looking for cheaper alternatives. I'm now on a generic pill with the same level of estrogren but a different type of progestin and I hate it. This is why I started looking for the return of Tri-lo.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/22/2010 11:50:35 PM	I am finishing up my 4th month on Tri-low Sprintec, and my skin is breaking out non stop, headaches all the time, and terrible bloating. I was on Orthro tri cycling lo, and never experienced any of these issues. The worst birth control out there! I would not recommend sprintec-lo to anyone!
Birth Control	Adrienne, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	4/22/2010 11:48:03 AM	My experience with the generic form of Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo was awful. In less than a month I was severely depressed, fatigued, sick, moody, and downright unpleasant. I couldn't do anything, and didn't want to do anything. Having no other medical conditions, or taking no other medicines, I looked it up. It's the medicine. From what I understand, pharmacies are no longer allowed to sell Tri-Lo Sprintec, but if they have extra, they can still give it to people. I have read many reviews from many women suffering the same problems.I've started the original drug, Ortho Tri-Cyclen, only a week in, and I feel incredible. This is the first time in a month I've been able to stay out of bed, and get something done.
Birth Control	shayna, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	4/7/2010 8:19:58 AM	I start taking the this pills first time in my live using birth control. i starter using and two week after i been bleeding irregular period i don't know if tri-lo-sprintec do this 
Birth Control	clarissa727, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	19-24	3/11/2010 11:55:05 AM	I just started taking Tri-Lo Sprintec 3 months ago, and so far I am not happy with the way it has affected me.  My Dr. prescribed Ortho-Tri Cyclen Lo, which I have never taken because the pharmacy put me on the generic form automatically.  I'm not sure if the brand-name stuff would be any better for me, since I was on Loestrin 24 a few years ago, and it made me absolutely crazy!  The tri-lo sprintec has made me extremely moody and depressed, I'm always on the verge of tears for no good reason.  I feel more anxious.  My periods haven't improved in fact they have gotten worse, I have more cramping, and breakthrough bleeding throughout the month.  But the worst part of this pill is that it has KILLED my sex drive!  I started taking birth control because my boyfriend and I had sex often and I worried about getting pregnant, now I don't have to worry because we hardly ever have sex because I am never in the mood.  It sucks!  I feel better knowing that I am not the only one experiencing these issues.  But I would like to stay on birth control, I just don't know if I will ever find a pill that works for me.  Any thoughts?
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	3/2/2010 10:10:23 PM	When I first started taking this, my face started breaking out like crazy. I then had horrible mood swings, which triggered my anxiety to increase. I suffer from anxiety disorder and I had four panic attacks in four days. I do not recommend this to anyone for the simple reason of mood swings and increased acne. 
Other	melissal, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	3/1/2010 7:24:32 PM	I was taking Orthro tri cyclen lo for 3 years no side affects recently given generic pill tri lo sprintec sucks the first few days i have been on it had headaches,backaches,heartburn and gas and nausea. Once finished my pack i'm going back to orthro tri cyclen lo. Is anyone else having these affects as well
Birth Control	jaycee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	2/28/2010 5:49:35 AM	Wow, reading everyone's reviews made me realize how this drug really sucks. I've been battling depression for over two years (thanks to Yaz) and I guess switching to this Tri-Lo-Sprintec was a big mistake. I'm happy 15-20 days out of the month, which is great, but as soon as I get close to my monthly period, I turn into a monster. I'm like Jekyll &amp; Hyde. Thank God for my patient boyfriend! Tri-Lo-Sprintec doesn't help with my cramps. My flow has become heavy and I get terrible PMS. There's occasional spotting too. I'll start spotting before I get my period, start my period a few days later, stop menstruating after 3 days, then start my period again for another 2 days. It's very inconsistent. I'm not a huge fan of Barr Laboratories either. I'm switching for the final time.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	Mischa_, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	2/27/2010 4:13:41 PM	Horrible horrible cramps!!! The first pack I took I had cramps one night for 4 hours straight I kid you not! I have no idea how I fell asleep that night! Also the 1st month of me taking tri lo sprintec I bled for 2 1/2 weeks which I found to be a little odd! Fatigue, low energy, dizzyness, nausea! My doctor gave me a prescription for 6 months, &amp; I am on my 3rd month &amp; I don't know how much more I can take/should take! I'd rather pay more for ortho tri cyclen lo, see how that one works out.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	2/10/2010 10:53:32 PM	This pill turns you into a crazy lady. So moody I think my husband might divorce me... or am I just thinking that because it is also making me depressed and paranoid.  Also it is a libido killer.  My poor husband.
Birth Control	widget, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	2/10/2010 11:02:19 AM	I'm glad to see I am not the only one that is having problems.  I was concerned when my mail order pharmacy called me to say this drug was no longer available.  Since my original rx was for the tri-cyclen lo they will fill my order.  I have only been on the sprintec for a few months but noticed a big change including increased bleeding.  I glad to know that my mail order pharmacy is no longer using this generic drug. I also plan to talk w/ my doctor about this next week at my appt. 
Birth Control	barrettfan1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/27/2010 4:19:33 PM	I'm very happy that I went on this website to review this awful product. My skin started breaking out terribly a few weeks ago. I'm on my 2nd month of tri-lo. I called my dr today, she's going to put me back on orth-tri-cyclen-lo ASAP. I will pay x3 the amount than go through the headaches, acne, and moodiness any day. Thank you ladies for your postings. I'm sorry we had to go through this :( 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Tee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	1/21/2010 10:55:57 PM	I had so anxiety about trying these pills because of all the bad reviews but they are working perfectly for me.  I've had no side effects.  There was a little nausea when I first started but a few crackers do the trick. I haven't had weight gain, mood swings or anything.  I've only been on them for two weeks so far but I'm very happy with them.  
Birth Control	mtandrade, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	1/13/2010 3:39:57 PM	Like all other previous reviews, I have also experienced the same issues. I am going back to my doctor to prescribe me the brand name ortho-tri-cyclen lo since it never gave me any problems.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	1/13/2010 12:46:31 PM	I started taking this med. for the treatment of ovarian cyst. I haven't really experienced any major side effects from it. If I take it in the morning I experience nausea, so I take it at night. I used to have severe pelvic pain which is now a lot less. With the first two packs I would get my period it seemed like every 2 weeks but they are finally regular. I have not gained any weight. I have occasional acne breakouts but have noticed since being on this med. they occur less often. I used to be severely moody and actually think this medicine has helped me stabilize. Its been great so far.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	1/6/2010 1:34:04 PM	I took Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo for years and loved it. When I found out there was a generic that was supposed to be exactly the same, I jumped on it. For the past two months, my face has broken out numerous times with severe pimples. I have never had this problem before. I am also a lot hungrier than normal. I used to love going to the gym and working out and now I dread and have to make myself go. The other major problem (as some people have already stated) is that I have horrible mood swings and depression. One minute I'm fine and the next I want to cry or scream at my boyfriend! I teach and this morning I almost started crying doing the calendar with my kids. What in the world? I would love some answers if anyone is in the medical profession. This never happened to me on the brand name. 
Birth Control	psudodrew, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	1/5/2010 12:25:39 AM	My mail-order pharmicy switched to this generic on me at the same time I quit smoking. I kept dismissing the increased appetite and EXTREME moodiness as nicotine withdrawl. After 2 months I started to wonder what was wrong with me. I realized the week I was on my period taking the placebo pills in my third pack that I felt so much better and decided to look for other people reporting the same symptoms. This put a lot of strain on my relationship!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	5	1	Female	19-24	1/3/2010 8:58:34 PM	I started tri ortho cyclen lo about 6 months ago. I went on the pill bc my boyfriend and i had sex very often and i was constantly worrying about getting pregnant. so the first 2-3 months were fine. my skin got better, my periods were always right on time, and NO MORE CRAMPS!! (best thing the pill did for me) so recently my bf and i noticed that im always angry and always snobby. always in a bad mood and always complaining. we dont even have sex anymore bc im never in the mood. i also gained about 20 pounds, and my diet has not changed. Pleasee someone tell me if i should get off the pill or just switch. im beginning to HATE it
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	bookworm001, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	25-34	1/2/2010 11:57:20 AM	Ladies, please do not take this awful pill!! I would never take Tri-Lo-Sprintec (TLS) pill again!! Ever! As happened to many of you, one day showing up at the pharmacy I found out that my insurance would not cover OTC-Lo (which I have been taking for 5 years) and that I'd have to pay $75 instead of previously paying $0. The pharmacist assured me that the generic TLS is EXACTLY THE SAME as OTC-Lo. Stupid me, I didn't do my homework research and started taking TLS the next week. Almost right away, I started spotting. From day to day, I would experience sharp and dull pain in my lower stomach which I had never experienced on OTC-Lo; at first, I didnt even link it to the new pill. I also started experiencing bad mood swings. I had some on OTC-Lo before but now they became much worse, where out of nowhere I would start crying and screaming. I became negative and mean to people around me; even my friends noticed this awful change in me. I would think such feeling should be controlled by 28. Not on TLS!! Thanks to al of your reviews, I followed another woman's advice: I visited a local Planned Parenthood office (no appointment needed - nice!) I waited for my appointment for about an hour (though I arrived first!! Thanks to our greatest government..), paid $55 for a 'consultation' where I got my blood pressure measured only - afterall, I already knew the reason for my visit anyway so the 'consultation' didn't matter ; $25 per pack on OTC-Lo (so much better than $75 from my regular pharmacist) and got 12 month supply where every 4th pack was free!! Afterall, it was definitely worth going there - I ended up paying $280 for 12 packs including the 'consultation' instead of $900 for the same supply with my current insurance. Also, Planned Parenthood didn't even ask for my proof of employment or a copy of my paycheck. I definitely advise you, ladies, to do the same if you still want to stay on OTC-Lo. Best of luck to all of you!! 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	12/30/2009 12:03:38 PM	Holy cow!!!  I just read through some of these other reviews and I have been experiencing the same EXACT things with this generic version of Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo!!!  I had NO problems with the regular one, but now that I've been taking the sprintec for the last three months I've noticed that I feel less healthy, I never work out anymore, I'm always tired, my face is breaking out, my cramps are 10 times worse and my mood swings are INSANE!!!  I'm so happy to know that I'm not the only experiencing thing!  My pharmacy randomly switched the pills on me after 5 years of taking the regular one.  Not happy!  I called them this morning to make them switch it back to the regular pill that does NOT make me crazy for no reason.  
Birth Control	Bratknee, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	12/30/2009 1:46:58 AM	i was on the NuvaRing for about year and switched to pills because the ring was causing pain where it should NOT be (it was actually eating away behind where it sat, CAUTION BY THE WAY, THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON, as told to me by my gyno AFTER i had been on it for so long); the pills prescribed to me were TOO expensive, so i had my Doc switch me to the Ortho-Tricyclen-Lo (which i had been on for years previously and had NOOO problems), well, when i picked it from my pharmacy, i was STOKED to find out that it was only $7 compared to $50 (i did not realize it was the generic, Sprintec, until later on); come to find out, i would MUCH rather pay the $50 a month with the things that i have been going thru - Needless to say, i am SOOO happy to know that i am not the only one going thru all this - I am sorry to you all who are too - The mood changes, as described in another comment, being compared to bi-polar-ness is the EXACT way i can only think to relate how i am feeling to; i will be fine one minute and the next i am on the verge of tears or at my boyfriends' throat, literally! and the thing that kills me is that i have NO REASON to be! it just triggers from NO WHERE! this birth control is BAD news! i can not WAIT to switch! i am already sensitive to birth controls and i should have known that a generic would not be a good idea for me. i STRONGLY recommend switching if you are having emotional problems, even physical at that.  this stuff is NOT good!! thank you everyone for your comments, they have truly helped me! 
Birth Control	NycA, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/28/2009 3:28:58 PM	I recently switched to this generic brand after being on Yaz for years. I was too paranoid with all the negative news on Yaz/Yasmine.  So far on Tri Lo Sprintec, I had slight headaches the very first week and some nausea the first two days on it.  But these side effects have since subsided....So far, my skin has stayed the same and I dont find myself eating more or gaining weight...I believe I lost some weight...just staying neutral........I hope things remain as is......

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	19-24	12/23/2009 4:47:07 PM	I was on Ortho Lo as most of you.  I've been in Tri-Lo Sprintec for 4 months and having a convo w a girlfriend today made me realize that the issues I'm having are prob related to this birth control because she's experiencing the same things. My side effects are:-Break outs-Head aches-Extra emotional, for no reason and not always around my period-Vomiting when I drink (even just 2 or 3 glasses of wine over a period of hours) -Tired and lack of energy. I used to exercise every day, I might exercise 3 days a week now.-Focus problem probably related to fatigue.I'm switching when my gyno reopens after xmas... I'd recommend the same if you're experiencing any of these issues.
Birth Control	stephii, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	19-24	12/23/2009 3:22:33 AM	So my doctor perscibed me Ortho-Tri-Cyclen-Lo as a use of birth control, to regulate my periods, &amp; to help my acne. The pharmacy gave me this generic Tri-Lo Sprintec. I wasnt too excited at first because i wanted EXACTLY what my doctor perscibed but they said it was the same thing. Ive been on it for 2 Months now going on my 3rd Month &amp; so far i cant really say i am happy with it! My periods are regular but i get really bad cramps the first 2 days. My acne has gotten Worse!! I feel like ive added on a few pounds! im a little moody &amp; get this angry frustration i cant control. I know these are possible side effects but the pill is suppose to help out my acne &amp; hasnt!! Maybe i should have Demanded i got the Ortho-Tri-Cyclen-Lo instead of this generic!!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	12/15/2009 7:40:57 PM	Been on name brand ortho tricyclen lo for YEARS and never had any problem. Now in my 2nd week of the 2nd month after switching, and am having spotting, which I have NEVER had before. Nurse told me that now backup birth control is necessary, b/c the spotting means I'm not totally protected. What's the point of taking it then?! Also had severe headaches in last month, and never had a history of this. Finally, experiencing relentless bloating, despite regular exercise. This generic is a failure!!! Seeing doc tmo to be taken off of it!!!
Birth Control	Looking for something, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	12/2/2009 7:00:07 PM	I have been on and off of Othro tri lo since high school and was very excited to find out that there was a generic. I noticed the spotting, increased appetite, and decrease in sex drive, however the changes were mild to moderate and I attributed it to other medications. I was dismayed when I went to pick up my medication from the pharmacy this week and they had discontinued it. I was not upset because I was so satisfied with the medication, but because the name brand is $60 a month! I'm on a very limited budget and while the price of a baby and acne medication would be much more than the price of the pills I feel like I am back to square one. Does anyone have any solutions?

Birth Control	jesster, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	11/11/2009 1:26:31 PM	I thought I was going crazy until I read other's reviews about this drug. I am currently switching back to Ortho, which never gave me any sort of adverse reaction as I've been experiencing on this generic. I've never had skin issues before, but my skin is broken out and looks horrible, I've gained about 12 pounds, and my current period won't stop. I have been experiencing anxiety and panic attacks, and I feel like I'm always on the verge of tears over every small thing. I've been getting more migraine headaches than usual, my contacts don't feel like they fit anymore (in addition to all my clothes!), and suddenly I've been getting yeast infections before or after every period since I started this drug 5 months ago. I'm not pregnant, so I guess it's sort of effective, but then again, I haven't been able to track my periods since they've now become irregular or perpetual. Sex drive is nil, and that's compounded by the nausea and infections and drastic change in appearance. I am anxiously awaiting my Ortho, non-generic packs that I implored my doctor to re-prescribe. 
Birth Control	ms.becky3, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	4	4	Female	19-24	11/10/2009 3:17:33 PM	Im on the second packet and Im experiencing slitghly breast tenderness, but I gotta admit I felt pretty sick during the first two weeks of the first pack.  I had headaches, exhaustion, nausea, and even vomited once... but i decided to waited out and appearantly so far my body has adjusted to it...and im not pregnant so far either so it does work
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	11/4/2009 10:57:05 PM	I am so relieved to see other postings on here about the same problems that I have encountered.  I switched 2 months ago to this from Ortho-Lo and my life has been thrown upside down.  I have had irregular menstrual cycles, severe mood swings, depression, and weight gain.  While I am sure it is effective for birth control, it is not effective as a life style for me and I am going back to the Ortho-Low ASAP.
Acne	Stavi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	11/3/2009 3:07:55 AM	I've taken this pill for almost 3 months now. For the first 2 months, my skin broke out really bad and I was so upset that I had switched.  But now, it seems like my body has adjusted to it since the break outs went away.  I still have no sex drive, but that was the case with Orthotricyclen-Lo, also.  No breast tenderness or nausea, but definitely irritable.
Birth Control	honley, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	11/1/2009 5:00:37 PM	this generic is really bad. going to call my doctor in the morning and get switched by the name brand!
Birth Control	Rhonda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	10/22/2009 1:33:29 AM	After my 2 month of taking this generic I went to the internet for any clues to what was going on with my self.  Ah, I'm not the only one having anxiety, breast tenderness, bloating, nausea, hair loss, weight gain, spotting,extreme moodiness, heart racing and some dizziness.  The sad news on this pathetic generic made the news on 10/20/09No one should ever take this.  
Birth Control	pharmacy girl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	10/10/2009 12:31:39 PM	I have worked as a pharmacy tech for almost 5 years now and am going to school to be a medical professional. I consider my self to be quite knowledgeable when it comes to medication. I switched to the Tri-Lo-Sprintec 2 weeks ago and have recently experienced dark brown spotting, extreme mood swings, little to no sex drive and pain in the ovarian area. Before I started BC I had painful ovarian cysts and I feel now as I did then. I would normally tell customers that there is no difference between brand and generic but in this case there most definitely is a difference, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!
Birth Control	Kerry, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	10/7/2009 9:44:01 AM	I agree with the other comments that were posted. I am going to speak with my doctor about another birth contraol pill that I can take. I've had severe mood swings, alomst Bi-Polar like where my highs are real high &amp; my lows are real low. I have a short temper, nightmares, sleeplessness, and my urine has been cloudy. I never had any problems with Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo, &amp; I was on that medication for over 5 years. The only reason why I switched was for financial reasons. I will switch back however if it will restore my sanity! I'm usually a very positive person, but since taking this medication I don't feel like myself. I also feel bad for my poor boyfriend having to deal with this! Anyway, long story short, I do not like this medication at all!  
Birth Control	Andrea, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	10/5/2009 11:34:13 AM	I thought I was pregnant during my first pack.  I have dark brown spotting during the second week of active pills, then I started having heart palpitations, anxiety, dizziness, breast tenderness, horrible head aches, mood swings, increased appetite, nausea.  With Ortho I had nothing.  I switched after finishing that horrible first pack and will never ever recommend this pill to anyone.

I have been having to deal with breast tenderness, nausea, headaches, and very depressed moods. i am busy with school, but the mood swings are not normal for me at all. I will finish out this month but plan on changing soon.

I have had horrible mood swings, depression and zero sex drive. When I was taking Ortho-Tri Lo I had NO side effects what-so-ever.

Little by little I began to notice slight mood swings, irritability, sleepyness, a slight lack of sex drive and lack of energy. It's not extreme by definitely not gone unnoticed. Hopefully my body will just have to adjust, and if not, I will have to find another alternative.

I hopefully won't have any weight gain problems. Also, my acne did flare up at first but it was only once, and it is nearly all cleared up. I had one day of tender breasts. It seems like an okay pill, however i've been very moody. It's like up and down I feel a bit like I am bi-polar. Most of the time i'm ecstatic about life, and then i'm angry or crying. I will keep taking it if I don't have weight gain, because it's not so bad. Hopefully the moodiness will level out. Without any insurance ortho triciyclin-lo seems out of the question, with out of pocket monthly cost being almost 65 dollars =(.

Made me a bit moodier than I was on my Ortho as well.  Overall, it does what it's supposed to do (no babies!), but takes some getting used to.  Not nearly as bad as Reclipsen, though!!!
