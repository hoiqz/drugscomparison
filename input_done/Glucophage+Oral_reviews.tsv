My doctor finally told me that weight gain was a MAJOR side effect of this drug.  As I have RA I am trying to stay smaller and now I am stuck with this weigh that does not want to go away.  I will say my sugars have not been as stable with out it but I have gone to strictly insulin now and it is helping.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/18/2011 12:21:18 PM	I've been on this medication for 3 weeks and some of the side effects were awful for me. Had to take 2 doses per day w/food. Talk about nausea, diarrhea, a lil lightheaded, being tired all day long and that was for the first 3 days. Then started 1 dose per day w/meal. Same symptoms, being nausea was the worst. So I started taking it at dinner time so I won't have that nausea feeling all day. Well I was sick before I go to bed and sometimes in the morning. My meds was just changed to Glucotrol so I'll see how that works.

But, the biggest problem was abdominal pain - OK, mild, but permanent and persistent - over the 5 weeks I took it; 2 days after I stopped no further discomfort and actually my fasting (first thing in the morning) glucose levels were back to stable &amp; lower levels.

I take the brand Glucophage as metformin has lactose and I am lactose intolerant. My sinuses are clear for the first time in my life and my period was a breeze. I did get a headache but that went away 3-4 weeks in. I now take 500 mg 3 times a day and the nausea did subside. My hormones are still regulating and I feel like crying just out of the blue sometimes, but I am much more relaxed and not freaking out as was the usual pre Glucophage. Hang in there! This will make a difference.

I've lost 25 pounds in a year mostly due to an abbreviated diet and have about 25 more to go. It's so important to change your diet to a more healthy one.Exercise...I still don't exercise enough, but on days I do, BG goes down to normal ranges. I can't emphasize enough how much this helped.Side effects. No digestive problems for me. The only possible one (and I'm not blaming it on the medication) is it's hard to get moving in the morning.Dosage I take is 500 mg, twice a day.My BG/AIC is not yet where I want it, but I think that's my fault. At least I can see what makes my BG go up and down and monitor it.I know other people that have type II diabetes and ignore all the things they should do. I'll still be alive, after they are gone. Please share your experiences with your friends that might be susceptible to type II diabetes. You may save their life (if they listen to you).Use a self BG tester. Be informed! Don't rely solely upon your occasional doctor visit/lab tests only.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	AKT, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	2	Female	25-34	5/5/2010 6:48:33 PM	I have polycystic ovarian syndrome and my dr prescribed Metformin for 1 month. I've been taking it for 1 week now and so far I have noticed I've been pretty moody and last night around midnight I woke up with very severe cramping and vomiting. The pain was so severe I almost had my husband call 911, but luckily after I vomited the pain subsided but came back very mildly every 10 minutes or so. I am going to keep taking it unless the side effects get worse. I am supposed to work my way up from 1 pill a week to 4 pills a week. Hopefully the side effects wont increase. Wish me luck!

This medication worked well for me - weight started coming off, with some minor dietary changes and continued exercise.  The nausea only occurred with me if I took it on an empty stomach.  I now take it at the end of a meal and there is no nausea.  No other side affects with me.

First the brand name then generic when it became available. It took some adjusting before the GI symptoms went away. I still am careful to take it with plenty of food. My A1C has been wonderful... usually around 5.5. I did switch to the timed release formula when it came out but that let me slip back into bad eating habits... eating whenever I wanted meant two large meals too many hours apart. So I went back to the regular formula to help me control mu behavior. I am confident this drug will help me significantly improve my quality of life as well as my lifespan.

Unfortunately, it is one I sometimes skip, and tho the side effects will diminish with regular use - if I skip a day or two - I get to &quot;readjust&quot;.  As for effectiveness - not much progress yet, tho A1C is stabilizing, currently 1000mg, started at 2000mg - which was too much for me.

While Yaz/Yasmin have been the only pills to help get me on a regular cycle, I was prescribed Metformin to help get my weight down.  Yes, it was easy to use and my weight came down (approx 10 lbs), but I started having serious hair loss.  I am told this is very very rare but have stopped taking it and the weight has crept back on.  After reading other reviews here I may ask about the brand glucophage as some seem to have had very different experiences on brand vs generic.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	3/16/2010 2:09:06 PM	I take this for PCOS. I saw at least a 20 lb. weight loss after taking it. I tried another type of medication (Actos) because it had less side effects, but I gained 25 lbs. If you hang with the drug for at least 2-3 weeks and take it at about the same time every day, you will get used to it. As a teacher it is not easy to deal with the side effects, but I feel better. I do not suffer from fatigue, insomnia and my periods come back. Always keep snacks on hand for the sugar drop and eat often. For PCOS I have found it to be the most effective treatment AND I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING!!

I also have noticed I am very agitated and my pain meds don't seem to be working at all since taking this med. The only way I can describe the feeling I feel when I take this medication is that to hydroxycut ( the weight loss suppressant which I would NEVER recommend nor will I take it again).I am very anxious, jittery,feel like I am crawling out of my skin. I started on 500mg daily for week 1 and this is day 2 of taking 500 mg in am and then again in pm.Blood sugars remain all over the place...145- 333.   I plan on letting the doc know.

Started @ 500mg per day and have now reached the maxof 2500mg/day. I am also on Lantus at night32U/I. While the Metformin does cause some GI irrations it has worked good and I realize that diabetes is progressive so increases are necessary. I have had excessive nasal drainage for a number of years and just recentally (11/09) had nose surgery to hopefully correct this, it didn't.What the surgery did do was turn mu glucose reading upside down! The only constant of the time frame with medications is metformin and I am now wondering if the long trem usage is/has coused my nasal drainage problems. A comment here: Cortosone treatments will cause a significat rise in Glucose readings for 3 to 7 days depending on the dose. Suggestion: See a diabetes educator for helpful information if you have questions and if you have a doctor like mine who's cluless!

Combined with diet it has my A1C right around 125. The only drawback is the occasional bit of listlessness. However, this is no worse than when I cheat and my bg gets up around 185 and I need a doze. All in all I am very satisfied with these results.

Started on 500 mg daily to increase to 1000mg with in a week. I was started while I had a kidney infection. I was nauseated, listless, and had tightness in my chest. I was not sure which was causing the problem, the diabetes medicine or the antibiotic. I stopped the glucophage and felt better. When I finished the antibiotic and started back on the glucophage, the symptoms began again. Now stopped and feel better, but still no control over my sugar.

Even though I have lost about 10 pounds, I am always getting stomach bloating and upset with severe vomiting after I take this medication.  My body feels tired all the time and I don't have any energy. I've noticed that if I take my morning meds with metformin, I feel nauseated and vomits badly.  I eat before taking this medication and I still get sick.  It takes a whole day after taking my first dose, to feel good. Then I regrets the time in the evening or night that I have to take another 1000mg.  I still get nauseated and sick with vomiting.  I am going to request a change of meds when I return to my physician. This medicine has made my life miserable.

Glucophage is very good at regulation my blood sugar and periods, however, metformin is just awfull. It is NOT the same as glucophage. When I was on metformin I was so tired, my muscles ached all the time. Walking and exercising was very painfull. Glucophage is a little expensive, but for me, its what works.

I was diagnosed with pcos in July of this year. My doctor prescribed me Metformin 500mg to take 2x a day for the 1st month and then 3x day the 2nd month. I admit I was nervous from reading some of the bad reviews. Well, this is my second month and I really can tell this drug is working. Most of all it has regulated my cycles and it has helped me to lose some weight as well. I now have more energy than before and also it has helped with acne and facial hair due to having pcos. The only downside or side effect I have is sometimes I have stomach aches accompanied by diarrhea when eating greasy foods. I was told by a nurse the use of Immodium helps while taking this drug when upset stomach and diarrhea occurs which has helped me. So far I haven't had any other complaints or problems with this drug. I plan to contine using this drug and hopefully it will help my infertility issues caused by pcos so I can become a proud mother someday...

I strongly urge people NOT to take this medication and to research ALL drugs thoroughly before use. I ended up hospitalized from both lack of control of my blood sugar from this medication, as well as severe chemical imbalance and dehydration due to it's use. I recommend the book, &quot;Bad Pills, Good Pills&quot; 2007 and internet research for more information against this dangerous medication.
