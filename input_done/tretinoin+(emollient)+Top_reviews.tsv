I have the 0.1% version (which is pretty strong), so I apply it every other night.  My skin looks fresher, feels extremely soft to the touch, and I can see slight improvement in fine lines.  However, I have read that you have to use it for 6 months to really see fine line results.

I use it for acne and have used it daily for 5 years.  The first 3 months were HELL.  I &quot;molted&quot;.  Peeling and burning and red. Fairly extreme facial pain. My doctor had warned me very few people manage to stay on the treatment through the first month because of the side effects. I was 35 and acne ridden.  Accutane was next if this didn't work. Once the molting subsided my skin cleared, my fine lines diminshed (everyone guesses this 40 year old is 30)my skin in smooth and very pretty.  I use the maximum strength (0.1)every night on moist skin (which increases efficacy)I use a very good moistureizer/sunscreen durung the day and do have a chronic faint redness to my face-which common face powder/ tinted moisture cancels out. Love it, Love it, Love it!!!

Had limited side effects, just tingling and mild itchiness during the first 3 weeks.  I'm in my 5th month. Lines lessened a bit, nothing drastic, but overall the skin looks better.

I am very disappointed in this product, however, I have not had any side effects, no redness or peeling or dry skin.  I will not renew this product.
Fine Wrinkling of the Face	tretinoin, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	4		35-44	5/19/2009 1:39:48 AM	I have been using this cream for 3 weeks now and can already tell a difference, I have noticed just applying it twice a week followed with a moisturizer it keeps the skin from feeing iritated, I believe if you use it every day it would be too much drying for the skin if you have sensitive skin like I have

I checked in the mirror and my forehead wrinkles were diminished. I did not burn or peel as others have said. I will keep using it and see how much my skin improves.

He got it to try and help remove flat worts. I tried to put lotion and aloe but he said that it was buring. Aloe burn never heard that before. Some of the worts are gone but some are worse. I did not have him use it last night but Im not sure what to do?

It doesn't feel like anything more than a moisturizer or lotion and there hasn't even been a &quot;drying&quot; result.  I am very disappointed in the results.
