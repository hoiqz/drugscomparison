However, I would like to note that if you do not have insurance or good prescription coverage, you can get these medications as 2 separate pills for MUCH less. The combo pill as listed costs approx $60/30 days, while you can get the separate pills (though you have to eat 2 pills vs just 1 at a time) for $4/30 days each which x2 = $8/30 days vs $60/30 for the exact same medicine. I checked this price at Target / Walmart but may be available elsewhere for similar savings. So be sure to let your Dr know when they are writing the prescription.Just thought this might be helpful to other newly diagnosed diabetics who are counting their pennies like me.

My doctor put me on these pills but the problem was I now have to eat 24/7, hardly get to sleep, and have the worst stomach pains/noxious all the time.  It does it's job, but the affects I don't know if it's worth it.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	SweetBlood, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	3/24/2008 11:43:45 PM	When I was diagnosed with diabetes, I initially had a blood sugar level lof 380.  My doctor prescribed the glipizide/metformin combination because he mentioned it was highly effective with other patients, especially his younger patients like myself.  With proper diet and exercise, it is quite an reliable medication.  It did cause diarrhea, but that side effect only lasted until my body was familiar with the medication.  In my case, the diarrhea lasted for a week or so - off and on . . . not every day.  From my initial blood sugar of 380, I am now able to maintain the levels between 80 and 150.  I have been on the medication for a few months now, and believe it does what it is supposed to.  Anyone who has or have recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should highly consider this option.  But with any prescription medication, talk to your doctor about your concerns.
