Severe Pain	CONNIE, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	8/16/2012 10:27:38 PM	I was given an injection and woke up with a life threatening nosebleed. The blood was so intense that I was choking on my own blood. After packing my nose for the third time, I laid in bed with ice on my face for days. I was constantly viewed day and night until the bleeding let up enough to keep me from choking to death.

Overall,I felt it was good for short term use.

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	6/14/2012 3:16:31 AM	This medication originally worked well for me, but recently I seem to have issues with anxiety when I take it. I typically take the medication with Relpax for my migraines, but tere are times when I am to take Toradol by itself. I seem to have the anxiety whether I take the Toradol in conjunction with the Relpax or not . The only time I every have symptoms of anxiety seem to be when I take Toradol.  My most common symptoms seem to be:&#183;racing heart&#183;not being able to sit still&#183;unable to fall asleep if at night&#183;nauseaThese are just a couple of the most common.

Toradol worked GREAT with no drowsiness. I would recommend it for anyone who does not get any relief from drugs like Naproxin/Aleve.
Severe Lower Back Pain from Kidney Stones	AZNJ, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	65-74	5/29/2012 7:09:44 AM	I was given Toradol for kidney stone pain because I could not tolerate the narcotic alternative. My first dose was given in the ER by injection and I was given a prescription for 20 pills, max 4/day for 5 days. I took a total of 12 pills only as needed until the kidney stone was removed the following week. Two weeks after the injection, i passed out, went to the ER, hemoglobin was 4.5  due to a severe gastro bleed. I spent 13 hrs in the ER and the 5 days in ICU. Received 7 units of blood, had endoscopy to clip off gastro bleeders and the Interventional Radioloqgy to plug the last bleeder.  How do I know it was the Toradol that caused this? When the doctor was taking my history and I told him about the kidney stone, the next words out of his mouth were &quot;Did they give you Toradol for the pain?&quot; 
Severe Pain	Doofus, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/9/2012 12:10:16 PM	I've taken this drug twice, once orally on a short script following arthroscopic knee surgery, and in the ER for severe back pain from disc damage.  Both delivery systems worked well in the respective situations and I got really good relief. I notice some say the injection was painful but the one I had didn't bother me a bit; I guess the pain I already had was a lot worse.

All through the previous night before I could get him to the dentist we tried everything from salt water, ora gel, ibuprofen, tylenol. nothing worked. After taking one 10mg tablet, his pain began to ease within 25 minutes. 2 thumbs up!!
Severe Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/14/2011 6:26:48 PM	Woke up with such extreme back pain,couldn't move, breathe, scared out of my wits! Pain lasted over 12 hours at a 10 on scale of 1 to 10, taken to ER, didn't want an opiate, offered a shot of Toradol, AWESOME! Could feel the pain relief as if coming down an elevator.  I had an important all weekend obligation, Dr. prescribed me the pills as well, fantastic medication!  Little or no side effects, if the med wears off the pain returns pretty bad, take the med to stay ahead of the pain, and I feel such great relief.  Dr. said I sprained the ligaments in my back, could take weeks to heal, my only concern? They said it can't be taken for more than 5 days!  Wish I had known about this medication a long time ago.  Opiates make me feel so sick to my stomach, hate the way my head space feels on them too!  This great medication has none of those effects on me, other than wonderful pain relief!

In less than 15 minutes the pain was gone with no side effects. Now, after severe pain from an abscessed tooth that was extracted with a very painful secondary infection I was again advised to take Toradol 10mg tabs. Again, the pain was gone in just a few minutes and, in combination with 100mg doxycycline BID for 7 days the infection was completely gone.

Severe Lower Back Pain from Kidney Stones	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	35-44	3/27/2011 5:36:46 PM	I was prescribed 10mg/toradol for pain after 2 months of passing fragments of kidney stones. Pharmacist filled the prescription with generic ketorolac. This med has not been effective in relieving the pain. I feel every pulse that goes through this region of my body. This has not reduced the pain at all.

I have never had any bad reactions to it...only relief.

Severe Pain	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	4	Female	19-24	2/16/2011 8:44:13 AM	Did not take this orally, but as an IM injection in the ER for bad kidney infection (not stones although they suspected it might before the CT). The inection hurt SO much and I have no fear or unease about needles (I give blood, have several peircings..), maybe the nurse rushed it or I was just extra sensitive because of the severe lower back pain.It immediately made me drowsy and after 4-10 minutes all pain was completely gone, I had an appetite for the first time in 48 hours - like a miracle. I was taking 2 percocet 10/325 to deal with this pain before heading to the ER and torodol worked much better - also knocked out the headache i had at the time.

Severe Pain	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	12/28/2010 7:15:14 PM	This was not good. I had severe teeth pain, a broken tooth in my mouth with the nerve exposed. I had already taken antibiotics for a week and a half, so there was no infection. My tooth just really hurt, and Toradol did nothing to relieve the pain. It gave me a stomach ache and made my head ache.
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	12/6/2010 5:55:33 PM	I received a shot of Toradol for pain related to endometriosis.

Very painful and the shot was NOT worth it.

I had the tooth pulled and the infection remained and caused a bad headache and pressure. This medication didn't do a lot for the pain - I still have to take Ibuprofen or something else with it. It also caused some stomach pain.

I was drowning in my own blood. I was quickly hooked up to a moniter where it showed my heart rate was at 300 beats a minute! My heart couldn't keep up and it stopped and efforts were made to save my legs. I spent the next week in critical condition sedated with a machine breathing for me. It was the most hellish thing I have ever been through..I'm a 23 year old female with no prior substantial medical conditions..Further tests showed that there was no natural cause of this happening to me meaning It wouldn't have unless I took this drug. We live in an age were these drugs are being pushed on us..know what your taking, ask questions, don't be afraid to say no to the doctors if it's not life threatening...it could save your life.heather_mb21@yahoo.com

Both times toradol has worked so well.  In both of these situations I had up to the limit I could have of morphine and my pain was still over a 7 (1-7 pain scale).  Then, walah toradol... it brought my pain down to a 3!  When I was in the hospital for my hysterectomy I requested it and again it worked very well!

Since I've been taking Toradol I have not had any problems.  As soon as I feel a cramp coming on I take my pill and I'm good to go.  I can feel when it is time to take another dose, so I take my next dose and then I'm good again.  This pill kicks in fast and last a good long time.

If you have a history of peptic ulcers it could cause stomach perforation. Not a safe drug to take.

I was prescribed Percocet, but it did nothing for me except make me sleep for 2 hours.  Toradol worked like a miracle.  I was able to walk and have full mobility after 1.5 hours after taking the first pill. I took two more doses after that just to make sure the pain didn't return, but I never had to take another dose after that day. I normally don't like taking prescribed medicine, but this one is on my favorites list.  It did make my stomach lining a little tender so make sure you take it with food meal if you can.

The symptoms subsided and I was okay.  I will NEVER take it again even if its easy to use and it's effective in alleviating pain.

Pain	depplover3, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	5	3	Female	19-24	6/13/2009 12:02:04 AM	I was prescribed Toradol for my cramps. I suffer from PMDD, and my GYN told me to take this because nothing was working for me. I was told to take one pill everday for 5 days before I started my period. I did for a few months, and I felt nothing. It was like feeding candy to a baby.  I don't take it anymore because it doesn't work on my cramps. I have to take mepergan now and that barely works.  Easy to take, it's a very small circular pill.  If you have light to moderate pain, this should work. But if you have moderate to severe pain, it may not. 
Severe Pain	35-44 Male  (Patient) 	5	1	3	Male	35-44	4/14/2009 9:01:22 AM	I have stenosis so bad in my spine that it wore off the protective coating around the nerves, causing excruciating pain and making me unable to walk.  The hospital gave me Percocet, Delaudid, Vicodin, Morphine...you name it--and nothing helped with the pain as much as Toradol, which is not even narcotic.  Unfortunately, it seems that at least my doctors won't prescribe it outside of the emergency room.

Do NOT drive until you have taken at least 3 or 4 doses. This drug has caused a serious car accident for me. Thank goodness no one was seriously injured. Please be forewarned and consider ALL potential side effects before taking.

Pain	RN as a patient, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/27/2009 12:12:45 AM	I rarely experience side effects, however ...I took this med for the first time before going to bed. Woke up a few hours later with severe stomach cramping, extreme nausea and diarrhea, too dizzy to stand. And so weak from the violent side effects I was unable to work the following day. This medication can also cause serious liver damage.

Severe Pain	Cheryl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/29/2009 9:34:25 AM	This drug was originally given to me for surgical pain, the added benefit was I experienced ZERO arthritic knee pain. This is a terrific drug for short term use, at least in my case. One pill gives me diminished pain for days. My last script for 20 tabs lasted me 6 months. Shame that some have abused it and now it is no longer available to me.

Takes down the severity of my pain. Nothing can totally take it away until the surgery, but this is the closest I've been to pain free since the onset of my condition.

Pain	Elly, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/27/2008 4:34:17 PM	My orthopedic physician gives me toradol injections and they are extremely effect, however the oral medication has no effect whatsoever.  There are no physicians in the town where I live who have toradol medication available.  This is the most effect treament for me in between epidurals.I have rhuematoid, osteo, fibromyalgia, rhuematic fever, sjogren syndrom and number other health problems.  The injections are one of the most effective treatments I have.I have very weak kidneys and this does not appear to affect them.  The last three surguies I have had my kidneys completely shut down.  I am now trying to delay other surguries as long as possible and toradol is a great help.

This stuff worked great with no side effects. It also relieved pain from ruptured disks in my back and tendenitis in my elbow. I don't abuse it, but hope I can get more for when the pain in my back is very bad. I excercise and move around alot , but sometimes pain is hard to bear, espicially at night. I can't hardly move, but this drug takes it all away.

Severe Lower Back Pain from Kidney Stones		5	4	3			3/2/2008 3:04:10 PM	Though it has done a great job of managing my pain from kidney stones, it has caused me to bloat to the point that I look like I've put on 10 pounds in 3 days.  I also get hot flashes and my stomach hurts whenever I eat.  I do feel that it has lessened the inflammation I was dealing with and allowed me to pass stones on my own, but this bloating is a little scary.
