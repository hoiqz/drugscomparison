It is bunk.
Cold Sore	aliciaetal, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	35-44	7/26/2012 12:04:38 AM	I had a small blister, then applied Abreva, which contrary to its description actually seemed to spread the sores to other locations(probably during the application). I kept using it and applied it liberally for a whole day (luckily was at home). It did dry out the blister. I have used Zovirax in the past, and had much better results.
Cold Sore	otto, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	7/9/2012 7:52:05 AM	Abreva does not work. If you think it does; it is all in your head. Best thing to do is ice it as often as you can. This helps keep the cold sore from getting much bigger. Cold sores always last about 10 days whether or not you use Abreva. The one medication that does help is Zovirax. It is quite expensive though and not OCT. This is what I use and it does what Abreva is supposed to but does not. Ironically, made by the same company. I was not going to give it any stars but had to in order to be able to post comment.
Cold Sore	Hatecoldsores, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	7/5/2012 1:12:51 PM	I am 40 and have only recently had any cold sores, just 3.  I cut my lip a few years ago and got a MRSA infection and either got herpes from the same thing that cut my lip or got herpes in the horrible, ulcerated infection that took almost a year to completely heal and left a scar.  I hate it, who gets cold sores that late in their life? anyway, Abreva does work very well if you put it on before the actual blister appears.  I think it still speeds the healing even if you put it on later, by reducing the blistering stage, but seem to make the scabbing stage worse, which looks bad.  Abreva cannot spread the infection, you can only spread the infection.  You are only supposed to put the medication on the immediate area because it can cause problems to healthy skin.  If you already have a sore you need to keep everything very clean, do not use the same applicators, towels or cloths on your sore that you use elsewhere, use only disposable items or wash the items you use and keep your lips very hydrated so you have no small cracks for the virus to enter and keep bandaids on wounds, especially while you sleep, oh and don't touch your eyes.  Herpes spreads very readily during an outbreak.  
Cold Sore	Ineffectiveabreva, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	2/19/2012 6:51:38 PM	The pharmacist recommended using abreva as soon as I noticed the first signs of a cold sore.  I was told that this medication is very good and works quickly.  7 days later it is no better and has not yet healed.  No beneficial results for an expensive drug.  Don't waste your money.

Cold Sore	stacilyne, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	12/6/2011 4:55:44 AM	The Abreva makes sure that the cold sore isn't visible only if you catch it just before you can see it. And even then the cold sore makes my lip huge. It takes about 2 weeks for it to go away. The pump is a huge mess and a waste of money. If my lip is already getting fat and I put a ton of it on, the Abreva makes sure that my lip doesn't get much bigger.
Cold Sore	Pharmacist, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	11/18/2011 12:23:39 AM	I am a pharmacist who has been getting cold sores all of my life and it usually takes 7-10 days to heal with embarrasing blisters/crusting.  Zovirax Ointment never helped and sometimes made it worse.  So I decided to try Abreva with two cold sores about to explode, the I applied it every 2 hours and the colds sore didn't spread, no blisters, no crusting, and best of all, not unsightly.  It's now healing after 6 days.

Cold Sore	old_crank, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	3	1	Male	45-54	11/8/2011 4:47:19 PM	I get small lip cold sores 3-4 times/year.  Abreva was suggested by the local pharmacist.  I tried it at the first sign of my next outbreak, but it had little or no affect.  In fact, I applied it 5 times per instructions, on a single spot, but the next morning I had 5 more spots around the original outbreak.  My outbreaks are usually small, but this time I had multiple outbreaks.  Did the Abreva promote the spreading?  Who knows.  I continued to use it.  Healing still took 2 weeks.  Waste of $20 in my opinion.

Well, I thought 'you must get what you pay for here' so I got the Abreva 'pump'- first of all the pump squirts out more than you can control so you lose it faster this way having to wipe excess from your finger. So you can't control the pump and that equals dollars. Well, I had to buy 3 of $20 dollar tubes of Abreva and still the cold sore wasn't gone? I have now purchased another product but I have used another product that was on the market last year it was a 'brown' ointment.. but I can't remember the name but it 'REALLY' worked. Abreva you are ripping us off at $20 per tube. Please this should be no more than $5.99 at most.

Maybe it was just the one I purchased, but too much product came out each time because the pump was a bit hard to press down on and when you did more came out than you could possibly use.  Considering it's not cheap, I feel it is a waste of money. Try to improve on this!

I take this as soon as i even think im gonna feel a tingle when i wake up. A vast majority of the time it makes it so the sore never shows as long as i put on as they recommend. Im in another outbreak now and instead of using the tube which i have all other times, i got the pump and for some reason the medicine was not very effective. It will not deture me from using the tube stuff next time. 1 out of about 15 outbreaks that it doesnt work isnt going to change my mind.

I usually use Carmex or Blistex with all symptoms going away in about a week.  This time I decided to try Abreva.  I put it on at the first tingling.  The next day I had a huge blister.  It just kept getting bigger.  I now have small itchy blisters all over my lips and the skin surrounding my lips.  The original cold sore is cracking and bleeding and my lips hurt.  I am assuming that I am having an allergic reaction.  If that is not the case, then I now have hundreds of little cold sores covering my lips.  Herpes sucks, but Abreva sucks more.

Cold Sore	Doctaah, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	12/20/2010 9:51:32 PM	You must use this before you develop blisters/oozing. It's effective after that, but works best as preventative option once you begin to feel the sore coming on.After that, it depends on how soon you apply as to whether it works or not.Well worth the price in my opinion.

I just bought some and used it yesterday when some cold sores had popped up.  And today I woke up to a completely swollen and itchy face.  I've never had an allergic reaction before but this is horrible.  Not only does the left side of my face resemble the elephant man but I'm dizzy as well.  I went to the doctor today and he said that while I may have not had an allergic reaction to Abreva before that this is how allergic reactions happen is that you have to have been exposed to the thing causing the reaction before, thus creating an allergy down the road.  None the less there is nothing I can do but take Benadryl 4 times a day and wait for this to get out of my system.  Worst.Pain.Ever.

Cold Sore	Gillian, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	10/10/2010 11:40:08 AM	I decided to try Abreva for my last cold sore. The pharmacist basically pushed me to buy Abreva, and, fool that I am, I listened to him. Well the Abreva kept the cold sore somewhat smaller than I normally get them, but that didn't make it worth the expensive price. The fact it hardly worked was irritating enough, but worst of all I had a side effect of an unbearable rash on my neck &amp; hands, which my doctor said was from the Abreva. I'll never use it again, the rash was just unbearable. So forget all these expensive garbage drugs rushed through FDA approval, I'm going back to an old trick I use of repeated applications of rubbing alcohol (on a cotton square) every few hours - for me the extreme drying effect of it seems to really help. Abreva is awful, I'm staying as far away as possible from it and have added it to my list of &quot;do not take&quot; meds.

I have learned that if I use it once I feel the tingling and the burning it heals the sore in just 2 days. If I use it once the sore has grown and is visible it does not have the same effect. I have had sores of all shapes and sizes and I continue to use it because it works for me. I have had a few times where it got so bad that I had to get a prescripion drug for it but overall I do recommend Abreva.

Abreva on it's own may speed up the healing time by a day or two, but if at the very first tingle of cold sore you take valtrex and the abreva together they should heal right up. I have done Abreva on its own, and I found that it didn't ooze, however the scab took forever to heal.

Just a hint - if your lips get REALLY swollen after using, stop using it!!  It took me a while to figure out that it was due to an allergy, and now my entire face is puffy and I have rashes up and down my face and neck.  NOT FUN.

Now, I have 3 different sores on my bottom lip and below it and the top lip is finally healed. It seems that Abreva made my sores worse and to spread. It also irritated my skin and caused a small &quot;burn&quot; on my top lip where the first cold sore started. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

I think that the abreva is forcing the cold sore to get worse so that it may get better faster.  I have used abreva many times before and sometimes it works better than other times.  Carmex, by the way was what I was using daily while i received the blister.  FYI, if you put a little of abreva on everyday it seems to keep the blister away.  the only problem is the once the blister is gone and the abreva has run out; there's not much motivation to spend $20.  We always seem to rush to the drug store minutes too late. ouch!

Abreva is the ONLY treatment I've used that has reduced the severity of the sore and shortened the healing time. That includes carmex, campho-phenique, and the usual suspects that merely treat discomfort. Money well spent, IMO. The FDA doesn't approve drugs unless they are proven effective. Abreva is effective when used per the instructions.

Wait too long, and it doesn't help.  But if you use it at the right time, and use it diligently, as presecribed, your cold sore will be only a minor annoyance and heal very quickly.  I usually alternate it with Releev and my cold sores are gone in about three days, with little to no pain or oozing.

My jawline &amp; neck itched &amp; my face appeared a little swollen. I quit applying it after 2 days. I've read great reviews on Valtrex, I think I'm going to ask my doctor to write me a scrip for that.

My mother told me about carmex, which only cost $1.00 and the results were fantastic.  You have to put carmex on as soon as you notice tingling, red itchey feeling or bump and the tingling, itchy and bump will go away.  I would like a refund from abreva.   
Cold Sore	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	3/21/2009 9:12:11 PM	I have been using Abreva for over a year, and here's what I have noted:Abreva is incredibly effective, but IT ONLY WORKS IF YOU CATCH THE SORE IMMEDIATELY!!! And I mean immediately. As soon as you get the tingle, apply it! And be vigilant about applications, the first two days are very important. If a visible bump has formed, then it's too late. You might as well not bother using it, as it can actually make the sore worse.My Cold Sores typically occur when I get sick. They usually last 10 days or longer, and are hideous and painful. If I use Abreva in time, the sore never fully forms, and the remaining slight symptoms last up to five days. There is no real bump, and no scabbing!I have gotten into the habit of using Abreva every time I feel something that even resembles a Cold Sore. It's expensive, but well worth the money... if you catch the sores early.I get the feeling that most people who have negative results of this medication are not using it properly. Remeber, YOU MUST APPLY ABREVA AS SOON AS YOU FEEL EVEN THE SLIGHTEST TINGLE!!!

WRONG.. this made my cold sore worse.. and quite frankly I am pretty pissed cause it cost like 20 dollars.

My advice, save your money, buy the 2 dollar Carmex, it actually works better then this so called &quot;FDA&quot; approved Abreva nonsense.
Cold Sore	dontuseabreva, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	3	1	Female	19-24	2/1/2009 2:50:24 AM	i used abreva for treatment of a cold sore about a couple days after onset, and found it to be ineffecive, due to it appearing to cause more neg effects (i.e. appeared to burn into the area of the lip I applied it to, and made the lip swell and appear more red). I stopped after 2 days of using it, due to seeing the neg effects continue. I switched to using carmex lip gel and my lips appeared to react positively to it. carmex numbed the lips to help with pain, provided continious moisture, and appeared to heal it within a couple of days to 1 week. i now use carmex daily to assist with keeping my lips moistured. i personally encourage others to not use abreva and instead use carmex for treatment of cold sores.

I have very minimal fever blisters on occasion, and when I used the product, it burned and one blister spread (never happened before) and another one got much larger (never happened before).

Cold Sore	Dis Appointed, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	12/21/2008 9:20:43 PM	It's clear Abreva doesn't work, and likely contributes to the sores' pain, duration and spread.  It's also clear that the drug company itself is behind the &quot;positive&quot; remarks.  This isn't the first time the FDA has approved a bad drug (Avandia, EPHEDRA, Crestor, Celebrex, Vioxx, etc) not the first time it's been &quot;bought&quot; by a drug company, and likely it's far from the last.

I was always on the search for a medicine that would take them away very quickly.  This medicine, I felt, only made them worse and made the sore break out even more before it would start to take it away.  I was actually able to find a much cheaper and easier product that works wonders!  It is the Blistex Lip Medex (in the blue tub), I had started to get a cold sore on Monday and by Wednesday it was almost completely gone!!!  With the Abreva it took almost a full week for it to go away and then I would get another cold sore within the next week and Abreva is sooo expensive for such small amount of product!  With the Blistex Lip Medex I use it about once an hour or if I eat I'll put it on after.  It not only helps heal the cold sore and the pain but it also makes your lips feel great!! 
Cold Sore	hugo, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	11/11/2008 1:19:11 AM	Completely inefective. I've always used Zovirax and decided to give this over-the-counter a try. Not only blisters did not heal but others appeared while using this product. It's a complete waste of money.
Cold Sore	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	1	2	Male	45-54	12/13/2008 5:49:46 PM	I have used this before and it worked well with the tube. the pump is very wasteful!!! at 16 dollars I want to decide how much to put on.
Cold Sore	disappointed, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	35-44	11/22/2008 10:13:32 AM	I had 4 outbreaks on my top lip .Purchaced the product and used as directed. The following morning my lip was swollen and the blister seemed to be bigger.Abreva doesn't seem to be helping and is a little expensive as far as over the counter remedies are.
Cold Sore	amy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	25-34	11/14/2008 5:58:41 PM	Doesn't really work and is white which makes it visible when you put it on.  
Cold Sore	bob-86, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	45-54	11/8/2008 8:16:36 PM	I have used Abreva in the past according to the directions and found it to reduce the size and udration to heal a cold sore.  I started getting a cold sore 1 1/2 days ago and used Abreva.  After 36  hrs of use, I have gone from a cold sore to what appears to be a chemical burn far worse than any cold sore.  Every place on my upper and lower lip that was exposed to the Abreva.  Don't know why the sudden chemical reaction to a product I've used before but just hoping that the burns won't scar.  
Cold Sore	ARAMIRE1, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	11/4/2008 3:52:27 AM	i HAVE USED THIS MEDICINE BUT IT DOES NOT SEEM TO HELP IT VERY MUCH. MUY COLD SORES STILL LAST AWHILE. THE ONLY THING IT DID HELP WAS A LITTLE WITH THE PAIN. THIS PRODUCT IS SOMEWHAT PRICEY. I WOULD LIKE TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS. 
Cold Sore	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	10/29/2008 5:22:57 AM	I noticed that abreva did shorten my cold sore time from a normal 2 weeks down to about 5-7 days.  My cold sore was still big and weeping.  The best treatment I have found is acyclovir.  My cold sore was gone in 2-3 days.
Cold Sore	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	10/22/2008 11:30:33 AM	I have been useing this for 3 days and i don't see a difference. I started using it not long after i felt the tingle in my lip. I don't think it works any better than other otc treatments. I personally liked the results with the Campho-Phenique which at least seems to dry it up quicker.
Cold Sore	Mrs_Ketch, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	7/31/2008 2:08:38 AM	I have only used Abreva for two days.  (I tried another less expensive product first with no improvement.) I applied the ointment several times a day, admittedly more than the stated '5 times'.  Earlier today I noticed my face was itching (as if I has somehow gotten fiberglass insulation particles on my skin). Tonight my face itches so bad I can't sleep!  I looked up side effects to this med and saw that one side effect can be itching skin, however it seldom occures (guess I'm one of the chosen few).  Anyway, I have to admit that inspite of the itchy face the cold sore looks alot better tonight and most of the swelling is gone.  I've decided to cut back on my applications and see if the itch goes away. Sure hope so! This appears to be a very good product to treat the miserable herpes virus and I would recommend Abreva to anyone who suffers with it.
Cold Sore		4	5	4			6/5/2008 9:16:40 AM	Abreva protects &quot;healthy&quot; cells from becoming infected so the sooner you apply this the less severe your sore should be. I always have some on hand and start applying when i feel a tingle.
Cold Sore	oenomel2003, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	5/9/2008 3:13:08 AM	I've suffered with cold sores for a long time and have been using this product for about two years now. My cold sores used to last almost two weeks and the were big and painful. Now I use this product whenever I feel the burning in my lips the day before and apply it 5 times a day and they go away in 5 to 7 days. It just is a little to pricey.
Cold Sore	Rae, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/1/2008 4:24:35 PM	By the time I started using Abreva my cold-sore was already a week old, huge and painful. I started Abreva on a Saturday and by Thursday most of the cold-sore was gone. Considering what it looked like and the size, I was pretty suprised and happy with the results at that point. 
Cold Sore	achaean, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	19-24	3/27/2008 1:24:07 AM	I used it when I first saw signs of a cold sore, I was not happy about the price however. It turned out that the medicine kept the swelling down and made it barely visible, I would say it is well worth the price. In order for it to work you must stick with it, and apply it at least 5 times a day and don't mess with your cold sore. Also it applies on white and dries clear which makes me quite happy socially. I like it, I will buy it again next time I have one it actually does work.
Cold Sore	oanna74, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/22/2008 3:43:09 PM	I keep abreva on hand so at the first sign of a sore I apply it.  I use a small amount many times a day if I eat I reapply.  In the past I would have sores around my mouth, now I can usually catch it before it gets bad.. Would not be without this drug.  
Cold Sore	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	35-44	2/10/2008 9:53:02 PM	does not help heal the cold sore as far as I am concerned, and it is rather expensive for an over the counter drug. 
Cold Sore	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	1/3/2008 3:51:22 PM	I used it in between 4 and 6 times a day in moderate uses. Once it was gone I still had a cold sore for a few more days. I wouldn't recommend it. Carmex works the best!
Cold Sore	bear, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	12/15/2007 7:54:02 PM	I put it on it made the cold sore to spread and it went all around me mouth. then I developed a small allergic reaction to the medicine my lips swelled up as well as my nasal passages. I would say if used in the very begining of a cold sore then it might the cure.
Cold Sore	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/14/2007 8:40:42 PM	it only works well if used consistantly and as soon as the soar is noticedif used later on it doesnt seem to work as well

Cold Sore	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	11/27/2007 10:59:03 AM	It is a little embarrasing having a cold sore, so I tried Abreva. I applied it 5 times a day and it seemed to prolong the healing. It brought it out and made my lip swell very badly, and it didn't go away any faster.

Cold Sore	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/3/2007 8:48:03 PM	I had the outbreak on a Monday and I went that afternoon to get my abreva. I applied it right after I bought it and I can say it worked immediately. The next morning I could see the difference. If only we could have came up with this years ago and didnt have to use that stinky campho phenique...yuck
