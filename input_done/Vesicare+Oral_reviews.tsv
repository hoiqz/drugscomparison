Needing to Urinate Immediately	Kc, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	7/4/2012 9:00:37 PM	I no longer have to worry if I will be away from a bathroom for longer than 30 minutes.  I love to travel, but would panic not knowing when i would be able to find a bathroom again.  Vesicare has reduced my frquency and urgency to urinate.  I feel &quot;normal&quot; again.

It has helped my problem, even though there are times I still run to the bathroom and I get up at least 1-2 times every night even though I have no liquid after 7:00. It is a very expensive drug and my insurance will not let me use the $25.00 coupon.  I find that insane.  I have tried Detrol LA and it helped, but my insurance refused it.  I do have dry mouth, very dry eyes, memory problems and swollen ankles sometimes.  From reading other reviews I now know the pains/cramps I get at night is from the Vesicare.

The next 2 months, were great, no urgency, and I stopped wearing pads. Unfortuneately my urgency returned, perhaps not as often as prior to Vesicare.
Needing to Urinate Immediately	JudyT, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female		5/11/2012 4:18:37 PM	I took Vesicare for about a week and started having weak feelings in my head.  Thought I was having a stroke or something.  After a week of these symptoms I stopped taking it.  Symptoms continued.  Cardiologist checked with a Holter monitor.  Seems when each episode occurred my heart actually stopped for a few seconds.After a few weeks the &quot;spells&quot; stopped and I have had none since.  The only med change was the Vesicare.Has anyone else had similar symptoms?
Overactive Bladder	serendipity, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	5/11/2012 10:43:11 AM	I've only been on this drug for 2 weeks, and I'm already very pleased. Within a few days, I noticed a reduction in the mild, perpetual leakage, and within a week I no longer had to wear panty liners. My urinary frequency is reduced - and while not perfect - VERY livable, and I have some hopes of even more improvement.Only side effect so far is blurry vision, but the blurry vision seems to be caused by an excretion of some eye discharge, which is much less alarming than what I *thought* the &quot;blurry vision&quot; side effect might be. It's mostly in the morning and I rinse my eyes and rub away the discharge, and problem solved.

Started out on 5mg that was working, but doctor increased to 10mg.  That was just too strong, couldn't take the constant dry mouth &amp; hoarse throat.  Went back down to the 5mg.  Think I am going to cut down on the # of days I take it though.  I am asmtha, and this year has been my worst year ever with my asmtha.  Don't know if the Vesicare is part of my breathing issue this yr???  And my nose is sooo dry.Maybe just going to cut down to 3 days a wk.

Frequent Urination	Lilly, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	3/26/2012 6:28:32 PM	I took Vesicare for five years and it worked great for that time, up until a year ago.  At that time I developed intermittent shortness of breath not related to exercise and chest pain and was admitted to the hospital for several days. In the following year I had every test to determine the cause...cat scans, mri's, vq scans, blood tests, breathing tests, echo cardiograms, stress tests, ekgs, etc costing thousands of dollars...nothing. For a year I searched for answers until one doctor suggested I stop taking vesicare to see if it was a reaction to that.  It was.  I have been off of it for 8 months, and have not had any shortness of breath or chest pain at all. My doctor said it is possible to develop reactions to meds long after you have started taking them. I would like others to know my experience in the event that this happened to them.

I called my doctor, she increased the dosage to 10mg a night. Not only did I wet the bed (using a heavy pad at night) I started completely wetting my pants during the day! Frustrated, I said No More Vesicare!  Did not take any Vesicare last night, to my surprise I woke up day. I still was up at night to urinate but actually made it to the bathroom. Oh Boy, I was worried I was going to be completely incontinent. I am going to go without and see what happens. I see my doctor in 30 days.

Frequent Urination	drknelson, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	12/15/2011 8:26:42 AM	Two weeks ago, sample of 90, 10-mg tabs. Advised to cut in &#189;, which is impossible given the tiny size, lack of a score, and hard shell. Was warned about possible dry mouth; Im already on 4 antidepressants, so I wasnt too concerned. But this level of dry mouth was unbelievable, immediate, and unbearable! Around day 6 noticed skin at the right corner of my mouth was cracking (where top of lip meets the bottom, on the outside of the mouth). Two days later, happened on the left side. Looking really bizarre, no amount of Vaseline or chap stick helps. Last two days, the skin around my left thumb developed a crack, and now the right as well. Bottom line stopped the medication yesterday. Mouth is already looking better and skin around the thumbs too. About the drugs efficacy, frequency decreased somewhat, but not intensity...if anything, intensity became worse. If the drug's offered to you, Id advise trying a lower dose. Personally, I'm switching to a different drug altogether.

Overactive Bladder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	35-44	11/24/2011 10:17:44 AM	I just realized that the Vesicare could have caused my eye issues. Overnight my vision was blurry for close up, leading my eye doctor to believe I needed bifocals. So those have been ordered. But after reading the side effects, the blurred vision is expected and would explain the overnight and instant blurred vision. So, I am not that old afterall, and I am stopping the medication, and will insist an ultrasound of my bladder. I did have a complete hysterectomy a few years back so gravity has to allow something to drop in its place, and i have heard about dropped bladders. Tell your doctor if this causes blurred vision!!

After scope test, urologist believed problem was overactive bladder.   Within a few days of taking Vesicare, night time urination went from 6-8 times a night to 1-2.   Constipation was a problem at the beginning but have adjusted to a higher fiber diet that has relieved problem.

Frequent Urination	Missouri Mom , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	5/24/2011 5:06:04 PM	I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis several years ago and have occasional flare-ups.  My urologist suggested Vesicare for the intense urgency and frequency.  I wondered if it would help the pain too and, luckily, it has.  I have been taking Vesicare (10 mg) for the past five weeks with improvement.  Occasionally I will have pain and burning when urinating, but have been pain-free for the most part.  The side effect of dry mouth is sometimes bothersome, but it has definitely helped me increase my fluid intake during the day.  I experienced constipation the first couple of weeks, but I started eating oat bran hot cereal for breakfast and Cherry Essence prunes as a snack and the constipation has gone away.  I would definitely recommend Vesicare to anyone with interstitial cystitis.  It has definitely increased the quality of my life.

The Ditropan didn't do anything but give me dry mouth. The Vesicare does give me indigestion, dry mouth, constipation and I choke on my food more. I have to drink water with my meals and slow down eatting. I have had 4 UTI's in the past 5 months which I don't usually have. I wear pads all the time for leaks. Could the Vesicare be the reason for the increase in UTI's? I asked my doctor today and she said it could be possible and I could stop taking it and see.

I was fine (besides having to get up three times a night to use the bathroom which that has subsided with the medication) but now I barely get any sleep and I am always dehydrated.  All I drink is water all day long and I never touch caffeine.  Sometimes I get stomach pains too.  I'm at a loss about the sleep issues though.

Went to the Doctor and found out that my blood pressure was high.  He prescribed Blood Pressure Med.  A Beta Blocker for palpitations.  Never had high blood pressure before.  Also dry mouth, dizziness, constipation, and a feeling of being mentally in a fog.  Then I read  the printout from the drugstore with a list of side effects.  Anxiety and a faster heartbeat are a few of the listed side effects.  I am stopping Vesicare.  I am curious to see if my palpitations and anxiety improve.  I have a feeling they will.  Will report back in a few weeks.

Since this was causing a serious quality of life issue my doctor's prescribed this with Rapaflo.  The 2 combined have greatly allowed me to control my urination and I have had no side effects thus far.  I did have to go to the 10mg dose to be most effective.  I also do not have any &quot;leakage&quot; which also was causing problems as I am uncircumsized.

Took for about 6 months then started feeling like I had immense pressure in pelvic area and frequent need to use restroom; even wet my pants a few times. Stopped taking pill and feel like my old self again. Don't recommend this pill at all.

I haven't had any side effects on 10mg.  Don't understand why someone would opt for blur vision over leaking bladder, that could be dangerous

Ever since I began this medicine to help one annoying problem (I am a teacher and I get a 20 minute lunch/break/prepare time a day) therefore, going to the bathroom is pretty much none.  However, I am confused, spacey, no focus, and anxious more than usual.

Frequent Urination	taydatay, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	5	3	Female		11/16/2010 8:18:42 PM	My mother has been taking Vesicare for about 7 weeks -- first 4 weeks 5mg, last 3 weeks 10mg (drug was increased because she still felt the urge to void but bacterial cultures of urine were negative).  She has recently exhibited escalating symptoms of confusion, agitation, short term memory loss, and a marked increase in the swelling of her ankles. Will see the doctor in the near future, following settling in from a move across states.  Initially, we thought the move was what caused her agitation and stress confusion, but now I think it's the Vesicare.

I spent 50 years trying to hide my problem and blaming myself for being lazy and not making it to a bathroom in time.Dr. finally diagnosed a &quot;lead pipe&quot; or &quot;stove pipe&quot; urethra -- nothing I could have resolved on my own. Vesicare plus collagen injections have drastically improved the quality of my life -- I can't believe how much improvement I've seen, and how much more relaxed and confident I am. The drug serves me very well with no side effects at all.

I believe I have acid reflux which I didn't have before, so I am going off the drug to see if symptoms resolve.I do not see that listed as a possible side effect.   The dry mouth side effects during the night cause me to wake up to drink water which of course causes more frequent urination!

My side effects are rubbery legs, nausea, sleeplessness at night. Medicine has helped. I don't flood anymore, but I use pads just in case. I'm not getting anything done around the house because of the way I feel. I intend to call the doctor and hopefully take 1/2 of the 5 mg. pill.

Originally had been on the 5mg.  It gave me some relief, but not enough.  I called my doctor after 3 weeks and asked for the a dosage increase.  He agreed and about 3 weeks after that, I no longer have to wear a brief style diaper.  I use a pull up now and have my life back.  The side effects that I experience are extreme dry mouth and eyes.  Easily remedied by life savers or halls.  As for it being 100%, no, alas I was hoping for a miracle pill.  This is as close as it gets.  Having gone from flooding myself 3 times a day even with bathroom stops in between to only the occasional accident(last month I had 2)I would recommend this medication to anyone seeking relief.  This medication took 2 weeks for me to see good results.  Its not an overnight fix and I am glad I take this once a day.  I can finally go out and not worry about flooding myself.  Like i said, the occasional accident still stinks, but I can feel it coming on and make it 90% of the time to the restroom...My ability to &quot;hold it&quot; aggravates my condition, but compared to 8 months ago is astounding.  Bottom line, I am quite happy.

I have resumed hiking and walking, two activities I had to curtail before taking vesicare. I have been on Vesicare for about 6 weeks and I seem to have better results as time goes by. Worse side effect so far has been mild constipation and some general weakness in my legs. But nothing major and for now, finding the costs were the benefits.

Overactive Bladder	hackwriter, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	3/1/2010 1:54:14 PM	I have MS, and after trying imipramine and Detrol LA for frequent urination and urgency to no avail, 10mg of Vesicare finally quieted the urgency and frequency with no side effects.  However, once I started taking 40mg of Baclofen for muscle spasms, the two drugs together made me retain fluid terribly and I almost stopped peeing all together.  So I stopped Vesicare and began voiding the fluid.  After eliminating Baclofen, I started 10mg of Vesicare again and it's working well.  I now take 10mg of Baclofen as needed along with Vesicare and have no side effects. Drug interaction is a tricky thing, it takes some experimentation to find the dosages that are tolerable.

Needing to Urinate Immediately	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	65-74	12/11/2009 4:28:13 PM	This medication seemed to work at first, however after one week I was plagued with sharp pains behind my eyes.   Not knowing what could cause this, I stopped the Vesicare after two weeks.  The pain stopped. Not being sure if this was the problem with the pains, I started it again. Had to stop, the shooting pains started again.  Since I have been off this medication, no more pains.

This is the first drug that has not only helped but changed my life. For the last 7 years I have suffered 2-6 weeks of misery 4-6 times a year where my bladder was constantly in spasm. This drug has almost completely stopped these symptoms. Since I began using this drug almost a year ago, I have had only one recurrence of my symptoms (when I got a yeast infection) that lasted for 10 days.  I do have some side affects:  dry mouth, and some blurry vision... I have always had some memory issues so I can't blame the Vesicare. So far the minor side affects are a small price to pay for a significantly improved quality of life!

Vesicare first drug tried and it helped, but did not eliminate problem; still need a pad. Noticable dry mouth and severe constipation.  Lower back pain; could that be side effect?  Had/have occasional episodes of throat constriction when eating -- scary!  Also dry eyes and some blurriness when reading.  Vesicare was MD's choice even though we had to get prior approval from insurance before use.

Detrol didn't work, exercise didn't work, nothing seemed to work.  This is the first time I feel like I can take a trip with other people and not panic about the bathroom.The dry mouth is a problem, but the main side effect is the drowsiness.  I am working on dealing with it, because the alternative is much worse.

I had taken a pill before going to sleep, and the doctors said if I had not had a phone call that woke me up, I would have died in my sleep. I was admitted to hospital for 3 days. I would NEVER want someone to take this med. It was given as a sample by a urologist. If I had researched the internet I would have seen (example WebMD and other sites): &quot;Some side effects with VESICARE, while occurring infrequently, are potentially serious and should be reported immediately to your healthcare provider. These include but are not limited to: Severe constipation, Worsening of glaucoma, Difficulty passing urine, Confusion, Depression, Signs of an allergic reaction, such as unexplained rash, hives, itching, wheezing, and unexplained swelling(especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing.&quot; NONE of this was on the insert with the med, or on the TV ads! I almost died from this drug! Take another drug, not Vesicare.

The dry mouth and the constipation are difficult.  It makes me drowsy so I tried it at night, but the dry mouth wakes me up.  I have had these same side effects with other meds too.  So maybe I will just have to live with the OAB.  I cannot take this for the 3 months recommended by my doctor to achieve maximum results.

I practically had a migraine every day.  I had to stop taking it.  I really hated to do that, as it took care of my urgency problem, but it was not worth getting a migraine practically everyday. Dr. has put me on Enablex, I hope that I do not experience the same thing.

At times, it wasn't just leakage, I could completely, well, 'pee' my pants.   It had effected my quality of life, in ALL areas.  Unlike most people, who have described symptoms, I don't suffer from frequent urges to go to bathroom, my problem is just lack of control, with no prior feeling of fullness.  I've taken the medication, once a day, as my doctor prescribed and can feel a difference.  I still 'leak' a bit (laughing, coughing, lifting, etc.) but do not have the complete emptying i had.  My doctor told me to take one a day, for one week, and if not gaining full control, to go to two.  I'm going to try one and a half and see what happens.  All in all, I think it's miraculous that a pill can control bladder muscles!

I have Overactive Bladder and was going to the bathroom up to 20 times a day!  Needless to say, I was exhausted from going back and forth to the bathroom all the time and when I go out always having to go the restroom in every store.  I have been taking Vesicare for a month and half now and I am amazed at how quickly it worked for me.  I only go to the bathroom about 4 or 5 times a day now, if that.  I am so incredibly pleased at how this drug has helped me.

But, I have generalized body aches when I take it.  I've changed dosage to one every 36 hours which helps.  Significant improvement with urinary problem; I actually went to the store without a pad and was still dry when I arrived home - no leaking.  First time in 20 years!

When I went to see my Uriologist a week ago to have a urodynamic test done, I was told that I truely have Overactive Bladder. Then I was explaining that the side effects of the Oxybutynin, so then they perscibed me Vesicare. I have been on it for a week now it is just so wonderful. No more dry mouth..well not as of now but I hope later it won't come back. Just a note to all of you out there that are on the Oxybutynin..GET OFF OF IT..and ask your doctor about Vesicare..it works!!!

I was going to the bathroom a lot. So embarrasing!  At times I felt like my insides were falling out.  This medication has stopped that feeling and has helped with the sudden urges and accidents.  I used to look for a bathroom everywhere I went and now I don't seem to need to do that. I have not had any side effects.  I drink a lot of water anyway so the dry mouth hasn't been a problem for me. One good thing, I also have Irritable Bowel Syndrome so te side effect of constipation hasn't been a problem for me. I actually have been able to cut down on my IBS medication and feel almost normal again.

No problems with constipation or vaginal lubrication.  Mouth, throat and eyes are dry (wear contacts).  Wake up with dry sore throat.  Decreased sweating (good!).  Been on Vesicare for 5-6 weeks and have noticed over the past several weeks that my vision is blurred and distorted.  Went so far as to make an appt. w/an opthamologist - then it dawned on me.  It's the Vesicare causing my vision problems.  I'm 45 and thought it was just &quot;age.&quot;  Now what?  Guess I'll stop taking it for a week and see what happens with my vision...  All the other drugs (Detrol, etc.) make me so sleepy during the day I can't take them.

I was taking 5 mg a day for 2 months then had a change in insurance which increased my cost to $122 for 30 day supply. Quit taking it and noticed no change in trips to bathroom. And my hands don't feel swollen anymore. $122 a month was a waste for me!

My OAB condition appears to the result of the stimulants I take for my sleep disorder.  I started using Vesicare 5mg two years ago, then 1 year ago upped it to 10mg.  Now it seems I may have to up it again, to 15 mg daily.  So it seems for this specific condition, I am building a tolerance to Vesicare.  My Dr has given me samples of a different drug, and we will see if that works instead.  But have not had any trouble with side effects (no constipation or dry mouth), and as I said, when the med works it is WONDERFUL!

I have tried Detrol in the past it didn't work at all just caused me a great deal of constipation resulting in hemmroids from straining. I am already on a high fiber diet and prunes have become my best friend. I thought I would be way older than 40 before I had to start wearing adult diapers and eating prunes. Have a appt to see doctor this week have started to break out in hives constanly worrying about if I will be able to make it to the bathroom on time.

Overactive Bladder	Mig, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/23/2008 12:12:59 PM	Overall I am satisfied with Vesicare. I tried Detrol, that worked for about 1 1/2 yrs. I'm only 48 yrs old and I don't want to have surgery. I've been taking Vesicare for 3 weeks and it is helping a great deal. I have to deal with constipation and dry mouth, but Detrol did the same thing. I just have to eat lots of fiber and fruits. Changing my diet is a good exchange for OAB. Hopefully it will continue to work for me.

But I have pain in my eyes and constipation.Slight dry mouth.I will keep taking it for another week or so to see if the eye pain goes away.If not I think I will stop.

Urine Leakage When there is a Strong Desire to Void	susie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	10/12/2008 5:44:16 AM	after 10 days of taking this I woke up in early hours feeling panicky and this has now continued for 3 days now, despite stopping the drug. I find it hard to eat and have lost 3lbs in 2 days feeling full of fear all the time with stomach churning.  I have now read it interacts with prozac, which I am on, and another reviewer saying she was jittery and nauseas put my mind at rest, this reaction has got to be the tablets.  I will return to consultant to get something else, if this is all there is then I would rather have orginal problem then feel like this.  In the 10 days that I took it I did notice the dry mouth towards the 8th day, but I did not notice any difference to number of times I went to the bathroom, but the tablets insert said it takes 4 weeks to work, so that in itself did not worry me. NEVER AGAIN

Overactive Bladder	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	9/19/2008 2:36:43 PM	I have been taking 10mg Vesicare for over one year and it has made a profound difference in my life - no more pads, disposable underwear etc.  However, I have recently been having trouble with short term memory.  I am 73 and I attributed it to age and dementia but now I read where Vesicare may cause memory loss.  I still work as a bookkeeper at a local business and cannot afford to keep forgetting things - and I don't know whether to quit the Vesicare or not.  Anyone out there have any experience with memory loss as a result of incontinence drugs????
Frequent Urination	almost-died, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	9/15/2008 12:19:55 PM	I nearly died in my sleep taking this med from swelling in my throat called angio-edema which would have made me suffocate in a room full of air similar to an anaphylactic reaction. It was my 2nd night taking the pill. Luckily a noise woke me up and I noticed I was swelling, especially in my neck. My hands and inside my mouth were itching. I took benedryl but did not help, got scared, and rushed to ER where I was given epi shots, high doeses of steroids, put on monitors and immediately admitted for several days. Also caused severe constipation, headaches, and dizziness. I have never had a similar reaction to any other medication. Do not take this med.

I could tell the difference within just a couple days &amp; am very satisfied with the product - have had no side effects whatsoever.

This medicine I took 20 mg at bedtime and it helped me sleep better and overall it did help my need to get in and out of bed numerous times throughout the night.  I went from 5 times to 2 a night!  HOWEVER... I did develope hives from this medicine... red itchy large hives and they were horrible to deal with so I had to discontinue the medicine.  My hives have since gone away! What a pity cuz the medicine was wonderful besides that side effect.

I was put on this medication about 6 months ago and it has been a life changer.  I don't have to worry anymore.  It feels good not to worry about leaking or having to visit the ladies room every 15-30 minutes.  I can actually get through a movie.  It has been well worth it.

As discussed with my doctor in advance, we realized that this might be necessary to &quot;re-train&quot; my bladder to hold longer. I am only 37 years old and between the surgery and Vesicare, it has changed my life dramatically! I noticed a huge improvement within 12-24 hours and no longer do I have to wear panty liners to feel fresh and clean!
