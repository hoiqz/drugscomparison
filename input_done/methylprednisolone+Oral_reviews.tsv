Inflammation of the Tendon	Beth, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	4	4	Female	25-34	8/28/2012 8:12:59 AM	My doctor put me on TWO 6day packs to take at ONCE.  That means 12 tablets the first day 10 the next and so on.  I've had a hard time sleeping.  My mind in ON at night.  I may fall asleep okay but if i wake up to pee, good luck falling back asleep.  I woke at 4am this morning with no hope of turning my mind off to sleep again. Had about 1 minute of very sharp chest pain this morning and at some point yesterday.  I'm on my 3rd day so hopefully as i decrease the dose, this will go away.  It's helped my ankle pain and totally erased my heel pain but i expect that will no longer be the case when I finish. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	8/23/2012 6:15:19 PM	Never again. I went to the ER after not being able to stand up straight. Was told sciatica and given this med. I'm on day 4 and it's been horrible. Yeah the pain is relieved some but the side effects are scary. Really jittery all the time, constant shaking, hot flashes, face is flushed, feeling like I need to be moving around but just don't have the energy for it. It's made my heartburn worse. After about an hour of taking a pill, my throat feels thick for an hour. The first couple days it gave me a cough but thankfully that has stopped. After a few hours of sleeping, I wake up in a sweat even though I have the AC on full blast. Sometimes it feels like my pulse is racing. It says you can take the pills without food but if I don't eat something with them, I get really nauseous. I'll go ahead and finish this since I'm almost done but never taking this again.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	sands, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	8/23/2012 12:32:52 AM	HAd pain in neck for days could not even drive. Took first day of six pills and so far so good. Im also taking percocet to help with any extra pain. this drug seems to help very much with the healing process. 
Other	Mymaemae , 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	8/22/2012 12:16:23 PM	My stomach hurts all the time even to touch. I feel full even when I haven't eaten. Not hungry but know I need to eat. When I take a bite of food my stomach immediately starts hurting. I'm hoping now that I'm through taking the medicine that my stomach will go back to normal. I don't take any meds on a regular basis so I wonder if that effects me more than most. 
Other	jrdiaz00, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	25-34	8/20/2012 6:01:23 AM	I had an allergic reaction to shrimp. The doctor prescribed this to lower inflammation. Im prescribed 4mg 21 tablet dose. I noticed that I could not sleep from the first night. I have taken the pills as prescribed for three days now. I can not be at rest. I have to be constantly moving. My thought process is impaired. My skin all over my body is clammy and I can not feel anything touching my skin. I am extremely thirsty and hungry. I am continuously sweating (normally I dont sweat much). I feel extremely hot and like the inside of me is slowly warming up. At other moments I feel like Im freezing. I find myself thinking extremely hard with nothing on my mind. Im irritable and very easily annoyed. I try not to walk or move as I became dizzy and feel like i am floating. I feel like I have so much energy, am restless but feel tired. I try to sleep but if I do fall asleep im up every thirty or so minutes. The worse part for me is the inability to feel anything. I tried pinching myself and can see that im doing it rather hard but feel nothing. My body is in a numb state. Once the benadryl i took and the steroid they gave me in the ER worked I was drowsy but felt fine. I dont know why I was prescribed this but definitely will not take again. I was going to quit taking the pills but unsure of withdrawals and inability of my body to produce steroids because of the medicine. My advice is if you are in extreme pain or its life and death then the side effects are worth going through. If there is no pain I would avoid this pill at all costs. I hope this helps.     
Inflammation of the Covering of the Heart or Pericardium	debbielynn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	55-64	7/16/2012 8:13:27 PM	Because of the side effects, I rated the ease of use a bit lower. I considered not taking the entire prescription to its completion. The side effects I am experiencing are:extreme sweatingfeel jittery all the timenot sleeping muchtalking constantlyfeel revved uphands are very shakyfeel the need to be doing something all the time but cannot focus on one thing to completion.I feel like I am on speed!My face and chest are very red and hotI feel very happy
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	45-54	7/2/2012 9:33:38 AM	I was prescribed 6 day pack for swelling, inflammation of my left (side) of the jaw possibly from arthritis (from Lyme) and/or TMJ that was painful to my left ear, left eye orbit and left temple.  Gums were slightly swollen and it was difficult to open my mouth or even chew (or have anything touch my back left sided teeth). This surely gave me quick relief, the drug itself had some side effects, I experienced some lightheadedness, dizziness, some motion sickness, slight vertigo, panic attacks but not sure if it was solely the drug or the drug combined with Lyme symptoms, as well. Overall, it helped, gave me relief, but really glad to have it past me. 
Inflammation of the Lining of a Joint	momofthr33, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/30/2012 11:52:48 PM	My Doctor gave me this medication for swollen si joints and knee that caused a lot of pain in back and hips. I could tell a major difference after lunch on the first day. My pain decreased. I am on the second day and the pain is so much better. Plus, I had fluid in my ear and I don't notice that at all. My face and chest are flushed, so it may be increasing my blood pressure or maybe it makes you sensitive to the sun, but I really haven't noticed a side effect. I have been a little more hungry than usual. I am happy with the medicine so far and would recommend it. After 2 months of back, hip, and knee pain, I feel so much better:)

I went into a flare that affected my hips and lower back very badly. After 2 weeks on 12mg of methylprednisolone per day I started to feel better.m I had 4 good days. It is coming back very hard again today. I guess it is time for Embrel.
Other	Rachel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/21/2012 9:10:58 AM	My dentist prescribed this drug because I had swollen gums a month after a root canal and new crown. At first I was scared to get the prescription filled because I didnt think a steroid would do anything for what was possibly a dental infection. However, I am on day 4 and the swelling is totally gone and I can tell my gum tissue is finally healing.Side Effects: I have been waking up at night to pee, and a messed up sleep schedule on this med. But on the positive side, I also have noticed clearer skin/rash cleared up on my face and arms. I now wonder if Ive always had inflammation problems, and that a systemic steroid is exactly what I needed!

Bronchitis	klbwylietx, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/7/2012 10:05:21 AM	Was coughing for two weeks and did not seem to have a cold.  After testing, I was diagnosed with bronchial infection.  Was given the 6 pack and by next day, I was breathing much easier.  I had less energy,I was unable to sleep well and slight muscle soreness, but nothing that I could not get past.  
Other	moi, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/6/2012 7:18:43 PM	I was prescribed this with flonase for inflamed sinuses due to overuse of sudafed. The sinusitis had led to chronic headaches which then led to dependency on Excedrin. I had one 6-day tapered dose pack.The first day I felt great. I could breathe and no headaches and slept well that first night and I was ecstatic. Then on the second day at the lunch dose I got severely nauseous and dizzy to the point where I couldn't function. It got so bad I called the hospital and the nurse said these were known side effects and to call if i had trouble breathing or a rash.Well I don't want to wait until I have trouble breathing or a rash to get help. When I took the dinner dose the nausea and vertigo got even worse and then I did fell tightening in my chest and had coughing fits. I couldn't face two more pills at night! I took none and that night I could not sleep, my sinuses got stuffy again and when I drifted off I had nighmares. So, I got up and used an Ayurvedic cure for stuffy sinuses where you chew on peppercorns. Worked beautifully and that's what I'm doing from now on. No more sudafed. The next day I read these reviews and decided to go cold turkey because it looked like things would only get worse. i was sick and dizzy for most of the day but it gradually wore off and by afternoon I started to feel normal again. I did not experience withdrawal, just residual nausea and dizziness from the day before. My sinuses have remained clear. I think this drug is way too potent for stuffed up sinuses.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	moi, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	1/6/2012 8:05:52 AM	I was prescribed this along with flonase to clear up sinus troubles stemming from dependency on sudafed (not an allergy but that was the closest match).First day I felt fantastic. I could breathe, I slept that night, and had no headache in the morning, hence the two starts for effectiveness. I was totally loopy and silly by evening.Second day I felt horrible. Nauseau and dizziness to the point where I couldn't function. I called the nurse and she said that was a known side effect and to call back if I got hives and had trouble breathing. When I took the pill at dinner I had stomach cramps, dizziness, and then shortness of breath and started coughing. I read the warnings and those are the next worse symptoms. They can continue to get worse until you get things like &quot;vomit that looks like coffee grounds - call your doctor if this happens&quot; Excellent advice, ha. So how did this stuff get through the FDA? I didn't want to wait until the symptoms got that bad so I went cold turkey and didn't take any before bed. My sinuses got stuffy and I tried an Ayurvedic cure which is simply chew on some peppercorns. It worked! So it's day three in the morning and I have not had a pill for 13 hours having gone cold turkey. I feel a little dizzy and a little nauseous but it's an improvement over the side effects. I am also not going to take the flonase anymore.

The relief begins after about three days. I don't know how long it is supposed to last, but I used a packet about a year ago and it lasted for almost two months. Not long enough, but the relief is much appreciated to say the least.

Wasn't able to tell this medicine was doing anything until day 6, I was in the worst pain of my life for 3 weeks straight and then all of sudden on day 6 it stopped. Today, is day 7 and it is coming back. I pray that it just didn't relieve the pain for only one day...but I sure did enjoy that one day pain free.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	11/14/2011 12:13:16 PM	I was given this medicine for treatment of severe allergies. My cough was horrible, and I sounded like I had bronchitis. This medicine made me VERY irritable and combative. I had night sweats, weight gain, swelling of my face, rapid heartbeat, insatiable hunger, and trouble catching my breath. The treatment did not seem to help my symptoms at all.  I have been off the treatment (I was given the 6 day dose pack)for 2 weeks now and am still hungry constantly. I also still have the cough for which I originally sought treatment. While my cough is much less severe, it seems more likely that my illness has run its course rather than the medicine making a difference. I will not take this medicine again.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	25-34	10/24/2011 11:22:22 AM	I had to take this because I had fluid behind my ear drum resulting in a clogged ear.  I can't believe they suggest you take this at bedtime.  The first time I did that I was up all night.  The following days I took 1/2 pills at breakfast and 1/2 pills at lunch.  I was still jittery, very awake all day, but could sleep at night.  The first day I got a horrible headache!  Also, it made me hungry and very thristy the entire dosepack.  Noticed I had a yeast infection after taking.  It did clear my ear problem, but did not like the side effects.

It got to the point that I could barely walk, and I couldn't put on my shoes or pick up my children.  Within 2 days of taking this medication, I am almost completely pain free!  It seems that the problem was inflammation, b/c it's almost gone.  I haven't had any of the reported side effects, except for a little bit of nausea, probably b/c I didn't eat enough with the dose.  I am amazed at what this medication did for my pain.  I can't take pain killers b/c they make me drowsy and I have 2 small children to care for.  I plan on thanking my dr this week!

I have not slept since I started this medication.  I wonder if it starts with METH, if that has anything to do with it. When I breathe on this medicine I can feel every little bit of air filling my lungs to the point where it makes my chest tight. Very uncomfortable.  Gonna stop taking today and just continue with antibiotic.  No sleep is the worst side effect for me. 
Eye Disorder	celeste, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1		45-54	5/6/2011 7:37:37 PM	After the 6 day therapy I feel sick at my stomach and depressed even though I take Effexor and told that to the prescribing doctor.  My eye was traumatized due to a chemical burn and extremely swollen.  I told him I had anxiety issues but he ignored me and did not offer any options or explain possible side effects.   I wonder how long this awful feeling will last.....no energy, nausea, apathetic cannot get comfortable anywhere or in my own skin feeling.    I had a skin reaction today from some HTH (pool disenfectant) which some of the dust happened to blow my way.  I did not even touch it.   Both arms!   This has never happened before.  I felt like my face and stomach make me suddenly look like I have gained weight, but this was apparent just today.  I did not eat more since taking this medicine, so it makes no sense.   I do not know if the few days of taking it can produce side effects or if it made me susceptible to a flu-like bug, or if it is purely coincidental.   So far I cant find a definitive enough answer anywhere on the web.

I took the required dose for the first day.  At 2 in the morning, I felt a really fast heartbeat and then my heart stopped for about 3 seconds, then I had rapid multiple heartbeats for about 30 seconds.  Called the doctor the next morning and was told to stop taking medication immediately which common sense already told me to do.  I found out afterward that this is a listed severe side effect.  2 phone calls later, so far I have not heard back from the podiatrist on how to proceed now for fasciitis pain. I am in overall very good health otherwise but this incident shook me up pretty well.  Lesson learned to be more thorough on checking on medication information before starting to take it.  These side effects were NOT listed on the enclosed medication brochure.

Not sure if the swollen throat is due to allergic reaction or not.  Anyone else experience an allergic reaction?

There is an effect similar to cafine. Otherwise, no problem, but I think Ibuprofen works as well or better. I'm hoping for a longer term result.I took this a year ago also. Hard to determine the results.

Other	Lefty, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/9/2011 11:03:17 AM	I was prescribed this medicine because my middle ear infection did not go away after going through one cycle of tri-pak antibiotics and Nasonex nasal spray. I am now on stronger anti biotics and this horrible drug. It seems that every day that goes by I am experiencing side effects. Day 1 bad headache, Day 2 feeling anxious and irritable, Day 3 skipped breakfast and felt like I was gonna die and was very irritable at work, came back from lunch looking like I had a sunburn, Day 4 came back from lunch feeling like I had a sunburn, felt very fatigued in the morning prior to that, Day 5 (Today) my day off from work I woke up later, felt very dizzy my ear feels full again...it just masked the problem but the problem still exists...I read that you cannot quit this drug cold turkey and I have one day left. I am not going back to that doctor because of his failure to warn me of the side effects and not giving me other options. On top of that if effected my menstrual cycle, I have been spotting without cramps. This is my normal time to have my menstrual cycle but not normal for me to barely have a period like this. I also feel like my head is in the clouds, and having trouble remembering, having trouble sleeping with nightmares. I also forgot to mention that I have had shortness of breath like Ive been running.

It helped to swallow it with food. Medication loosed my mucus in my lungs and caused and increase of coughing.

This medicine is very scary!  I had headache, dizziness, weakness, racing heart, tightening of chest, shoulder pain, numbness in arm, muscle ache, jaw pain, sleeplessness, anxiety, hot/cold flashes, cotton mouth, increased urination, jittery, etc.  I can't wait til this gets out of my system.  I truly thought I was going to die!!!!! DON'T TAKE THIS MEDICINE!! Did not notice much difference in my arthritis/joint pain because I was so side tracked with believing I was going to die from taking this medicine!
Muscle Pain and Stiffness in Shoulder, Neck and Pelvis	GB, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	2/3/2011 5:44:34 PM	Primary condition: Bulging disks in my neck &amp; lower back. Infrequent serious flare-up of my symptoms with my orthopaedic surgeon putting me on the 1-week dosage pack of the oral medication. The Oral Medication has been VERY EFFECTIVE the 3 times I have taken it in the past four years! Increased doses of pain &amp; muscle relaxant medications have not helped. Side effect: will leave a bad taste in your mouth for awhile. (Keep drinking water to get that taste out of your mouth). Otherwise, I have been VERY PLEASED with the results relieving the pain and stiffness in my neck, shoulder, back, and lower back pain.

At c4-5 there is no more spinal fluid and the spurring is right up against the spinal cord.  At c5-6, very little fluid.  Discs have disintegrated.  Severe pain in muscles in shoulders, arms, wrists, hands, groin.  Had seizures with complete loss of muscle control.  Within two days, I can move again and am free from the extreme pain I have been in for over a month.  
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/18/2011 11:14:39 PM	I have taken this medication for asthma, but it also had a side effect that it took away all my muscle &amp; back pains. I have not been diagnosed yet, for the muscle aches. But I was recently prescribed it for another 6 day dose pack for the pain, and it relieved it at almost 200% for those 6 days.
Bronchitis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female	19-24	1/17/2011 2:53:25 PM	I am taking the 6 day dose pack (on day 4 now) for chest congestion/post nasal drip of unknown cause hoping to prevent it turning into bronchitis.  The day 1 dose did help reduce the chest congestion and made it easier to breath comfortably.  After that though the chest congestion returned and my head became more congested.  Went back to the doctor today and was told I had a sinus infection and bronchitis and was put on an antibiotic so the methylprednisolone did not really work.  I haven't had any major side effects although I definitely have to eat more than just a little snack when I take it or I feel nauseous.  
Other	Gwyneth, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	1/13/2011 12:18:23 PM	I was taking this for swelling/pain in my tonsils and was prescribed the 6 day taper pack. I was okay for the most part while I was actually taking the medication aside from the occassional nausea, but I chalked that up to not having enough food in my stomach while taking the pills. Most of the pain has gone away, but swelling still remains. Now that I am off the medication, side effects are starting: numbness in my left arm, neck pain, tightness in chest, bad insomnia and very anxious/paranoid feeling. I have never had anxiety problems before and it's scaring me. I also have GERD which could be part of the tightness in chest, but considering I haven't had problems with it recently, I think it is due to this medicine. I don't trust myself to drive right now with the combination of insomnia and anxiety and am still not back at work. I really hope this passes soon and there are no long term effects.
Rash	BradentonMike, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	1/11/2011 11:27:14 AM	I had a rash that eventually covered most of my body and took this drug. It made me stay up for 2 days straight and didn't really help the rash. Plus I started bruising in places for no reason. Now I have a cold because my immune system was suppressed.

Not sure at this point how long the latter will last.

The worst part is the side effect that causes painful tightening in my chest.  Been drinking more water and that seems to help but the chest pain is still there off and on.  2 more days and treatment will be done.  Also taking benadryl. I doubt that this will take care of my hives since it hasn't done much yet.  I won't be taking this medication again.

I had joint pain, facial swelling, buring, and a rash covering my entire body within 2 hours of taking day 1's 6 pills my rash started to subside and the next morning my face had dramatically improved as well as my joint pain.  This medication saved me from days of waiting for the reaction to go away.  Highly recomend.

She prescribed the 6-day pack, and so far, its been like a heavy dose of birth control pills, with cramping, back/leg pain.  I finished the pack 2 days ago and light bleeding has already started but there's also some &quot;clotting&quot; except it's not bloody.  I didn't see that anyone else was prescribed this medication for the same problem so I was curious if anyone else had similar side effects. But overall it's doing what it's supposed to.

I have not been able to sleep through the night due to pain and numbness in both hands, arms, shoulders and neck, not to mention back pain.  The 4 mg dose pack was a miracle especially the first of the 6 day doseage.  I have not slept this well without pain in years, and more active and pain free during the day.  The only side effect I think was related was a low grade headache the first day.  The last two days of the lower doseage I felt the return of the pain. But need to consult a surgeon for my condition.  This drug is well worth it for pain relief.

I'm still in pain after six days, so I'm not sure if this med worked.  Ibuprophen 800 mg every 6-8 hours works better for the pain and swelling.

I also have multiple spinal disc issues and have been suffering from the for 3 years now, and have to take Vicodin 7.75 daily to enable me to move about. After finishing the pack, I finally experienced waking up without  feeling the chronic pain that I had gotten used to in 'bout 3 yrs. That's why I call this the wonder drug. Not only did it work for my finger but for my spinal issues too. I have not taken my Vicodin ES for 2 days now. I'm praying that this stays forever....

After I finished the first 6 day pack I experienced back spasms w/fever, and rash was not completely gone.  So returned to doctor and was prescribed another 12 day regamine.  During and after finishing the dosage as prescribed I experienced sinus headaches for 3 days, blurred vision, joint pain, dizziness, neck and shoulder pain, and still experiencing irregular heart beat 2 weeks later. Plus numerous visits to doctor, urgent care &amp; emergency room. I am normally very healthy and rarely need to visit the doctor except for an occasional sinus infection or dermatitis. I definately would not take this again!

Have experienced difficulty breathing,face flush, anxiousness and jitters during the day escalating to the point of anxiety panic when waking and not being able to catch my breath. Today, 4 days after completing pack, it feels like a large marble is stuck in my throat making it difficult to swallow. Benadryl was prescribed to take at bedtime to counteract the allergic reaction I must be having but it has not helped. Writing this at 2 am too frightened to fall asleep and wake in a breathing panic again. Doctor said 5-6 days to get it out of my system and at least I wasn't experiencing  psychosis like another patient who was hearing voices. Too many side effects and the arm pain is just as sharp as before. Will put this on my list of meds to NEVER TAKE.

Rash	hoopies, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	7/12/2010 11:01:03 PM	I started taking the 6 day step down pack for a poison ivy reaction.  The day after taking the last pill I end up in the emergency room and then a stay in the hospital from a seizure.  This medicine is horrible if you are allergic to it and have no idea.  I had many of the side effects from the normal to severe.  Not only that my doctor at the hospital informed me that the side effects can affect you for weeks or months to come before your body comes back to normal.  Which it has been three weeks today since I took the last pill and I feel like I am going through the whole issue all over again!  Please make sure that if you feel like this drug is making things worse, talk to you doctor.  It is not worth three days in the hospital!! Best part was that this medicine did nothing for the poison ivy but make it worse!! 
Other	stoneoo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	55-64	7/10/2010 10:11:05 AM	I am a type 1 diabetic and have had surgery to my mouth and teeth extractions. I am currently on the 4mg 6 day course. I had alot of vomiting the following day of starting it but am not sure if it was also related to the hydrocordisone. I called my pharmacy and he instructed me to stop the hydro and my vomiting did stop. I have still a swollen face but not sure if its related to the methylprednislone or my extractions. It also causes my blood sugar to be extremely high and difficulty sleeping. I'll finish the course as I am hopeful the pros outweighs the cons for the drug. good luck

The drug has helped save my life on numerous occasions but even as it has helped it has done just as much damage but that is due to the multiple times I have taken the drug and the amount I have to take. I have gained weight, get the moon face/belly, my mood swings were horible to begin with and still continue, my hair has fallen out, I now am a diabetic, have high blood pressure and just found out I have low bone mass and low potassium due to this drug- real question is would I recommend this to others- yes because it does its job and really works

I would take this drug again.
Asthma	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	55-64	6/20/2010 4:41:17 PM	After a bout with bronchitis, my mild asthma kicked in. Lots of problems with breathing, coughing, tightening of the throat, etc.  After taking z-pack, I still was not feeling well, so my pulminologist put me on this.  I've been on it 3 days and am not feeling much better at all.  I'm investigating a possible allergic reaction to a generic BP medication which after 7-10 days on it, I began with a cough which turned into bronchitis.  I've googled some of the side effects of this generic medicine and they include some of the symptoms I am experiencing.  So I'm wondering how can this drug assist with clearing up my symptoms, if the generic BP medication is in my system?  I just want to feel better soon.

Giant Hives	melissa17, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	6/1/2010 12:24:14 PM	I was given the foil pack and couldn't even finish the first days dosage. I developed extreme anxiety after the 2nd dosage, and found extreme discomfort in the throat. I went to my GP right away and he told me that he never wants me to take that again. Instead, he gave me a prednisone injection, and it cleared my hives up within a day. Major improvements. If you are given the foil pack as treatment, ask for the injection instead. It's a one time thing instead of having to take 21 pills over 6 days. 
Rash	jJudyO7, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	5/30/2010 11:12:55 AM	I was prescribed the 6 day taper pack for poison ivy.  I got to the 4th pill,I was feeling awful.  I had red cheeks and nose, my skin was bright red wherever I had the poison ivy. My heart was racing,I felt like I was jumping out of my body(crying,laughing,pacing etc).I called the pharmacist he said to stop taking this  medicine.The next day I feel much better. I still have the redness and wired feeling. Also I am still itching. Pharm said to use 50 mg of benadryl.This helps with calming the po. Oh yeah I also got a shot of this med.,before taking the pills. I would be very careful taking this drug. It goes right  to your blood stream.This has been a  horrible 2wks between the poison ivy &amp; this drug.

Joint Disease which may include Attacks of Acute Arthritis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/24/2010 10:55:26 AM	I was having pain in my lower back and both hips so much so that I couldn't get comfortable enough to sleep at night. It wasn't exactly the hip joints that hurt, but immediately below in the thigh areas, on the outside of the leg. Very painful to the touch and impossible to sleep on. As a side sleeper, I was miserable. Even sitting in my favorite chair hurt after 15 minutes. I was so stiff, I could harldy move around.  Finally went to the doctor who prescribed this dose pack and as soon as the first day, I had immediate relief. It's like I am a different person and I regret having waited so long to consult my doctor about this condition.

Bronchitis	aj243, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	4/30/2010 12:01:24 AM	Taking this for bronchitis and sinus infection. Did see noticeable improvement of symptoms. However had side effects of night sweats (had to change my shirt twice the first two nights) and inability to sleep.  Taking the 21 pack and I think taking two pills at night the first two nights was the problem.  Disappointed that night sweats were not listed as a side effect on the package since I've noticed numerous other posts with the same side effect.  I prefer the steroid shot.
Joint Disease which may include Attacks of Acute Arthritis	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	65-74	4/25/2010 8:20:46 AM	Iwas diagnosed with two herniated discks in my lower back . Was prescribed 4mg in thedospak 21s. Med has had minimal effect i still have much pain radiating down my right  leg and lots of pain in my right hip. This med also upset my stomach despite using full glasses of water.
Asthma	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	4/23/2010 12:14:06 PM	I was prescribed this med after having persistant asthma like symptoms and I have no underlying health problems (healthy weight, exercise regularly, non-smoker).  I took the dose pack designed for 6 days.  My blook pressure would shoot up very easily.  I had increased anxiety.  When I took a dose I had a tingling feeling in the back of my head.  I also experienced dizziness.  It took me to emotional lows and felt the need to cry easily.  I stopped taking the med after Day 5, with one more dose scheduled for Day 6.  The morning of Day 6 I had a panic attack and experienced rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing and most scary of all, numbness in my hands and mouth (tongue) for a brief period of time.  My husband drove me immediately to the doctor and to be safe, they did an EKG, which was normal.  I will not take this med again.  After the supposed panic attack, the dr. prescribed me a low dose (5mg of Bulspar) of anti-anxiety pills to use as needed, which have helped (I tend to be an anxious person).  2 days after coming off the steriods, I feel a bit mentally numb, but very calm (this could be due to the anti-anxiety med, which I haven't taken for 24 hrs.)  I will never take this drug again.  I am also on birth control pills, so there could have been some interaction there, which the Dr would neither confirm or deny.

I had double knee surgery after five weeks went back to work and tripped on a roll out carpet.  My legs swelled up so bad I could hardly walk.  My low back burned and throbbed with pain.  I personally loved this medication.  Awesome stuff.  This is day four and I can actually see my knee shape.  Haven't been able to do that in so long.  I had not side affects whatsoever.  For those reviews that show there are side affects, not every medication will react the same to every individual.  You'll just have to try it, if it works, great, if it doesn't, stop talking it.  Simple as that.

I had no pain, more energy and my whole outlook on life in general was excellent.  I slept a full 8+ hours per night, woke up feeling great and bounced out of bed looking forward to the day.  My breakouts on my face completely disappeared and my skin felt like I was a very young person again. (I'm 74)  I did have a slight flushing of my face but that was ok.  After I stopped taking it, my symptoms re-appeared.  I will take it again if my doctor approves.  At this point in my life, it's all about quality of life to me.

Skin Condition	wallydee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	45-54	2/25/2010 8:26:17 PM	I am a 51 year old female initially diagnosed with chickenpox.  Two weeks later my blisters continued to get progressively worse.  After 2 weeks the Dr wasn't sure it was chicken pox and suspected a delayed reaction to arimidex prescribed 2 months prior. I stopped the arimidex and I'm on my 2nd day of Methylpred. and am feeling significantly better.  I'm not sure it was this medication or if my chickenpox was winding down.  A positive side effect was ankle joint pain was reduced and have been feeling pretty energetic today.  I haven't received the results from bloodwork performed a few days ago, so the verdict is still out on my diagnosis, though all skin symptoms point to a severe case of chickenpox.

This drug made me extremely hyperactive the first day, with the second day a little less so.  Whoever developed the dosage scheme was sadistic: two at bedtime?  Really?I stayed the course, but probably shouldn't have bothered.  At the end of the 6 days, the pain is back.  This drug didn't help me at all.  I will avoid taking it ever again if I can.

It did seem to help some with the back problem; but, it put me in a dangerous condition.

I have to complete the remaining days of this drug, because I do not know what effect it could have to just stop.  I do not think I would take this drug again if prescribed by a doctor.

My regular Doc told me the second day to discontinue these as they were too strong for what I had. I will not use this drug again as the side effects are not worth the benefits!

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	unaware, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	12/25/2009 10:38:34 PM	I was given this medication for sinus inflamation that had not gone away for months using over the counter anti-inflamation med. It totally helped me with my sinuses but about 5 days after taking the last pill I noticed my breasts became very tender and sore. My nipples also became hard. I was not aware of the classification of this medicine nor did I read the posible side effects. I'm not liking these. I will not take this med. again.
Inflammation of the Tendon	linda, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/23/2009 7:32:54 AM	Had a very sore and burning tendon/muscle under shoulder-blade.  Started 4mg pack yesterday as directed.  No noticable side-affects but this morning my pain and burning is greatly abated!   I also suffer from lichen planus in mouth and it is much better after one day.  will continue full pack (5 more days).  
Allergic Reaction caused by a Drug	franellund, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	12/21/2009 4:23:29 PM	I took this after suffering an allergic reaction to Amoxicillin and was covered from head to toe in a very itchy, red rash.  The instructions are straight-forward, it's a very easy drug to take and took about 2 days before I noticed an improvement in the rash.  I have just finished the last pill (6-day, step-down program) and the rash has gone, although I'm still itching a lot.  The only side-effect I have noticed is it makes my cheeks feel like they're on fire.  I had to keep ice packs on hand to soothe it.  This lessens as as you take less of the drug and is barely noticeable today.  Definitely worth it to get rid of the rash.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	35-44	12/11/2009 11:10:25 AM	I was prescribed this drug for relief of pain due to possible pinched nerve/degenerative disc in the neck.  I did not experience any negative side effects.  I think it may have helped reduce the inflammation that was causing pain but still have numbness in fingertips and down my right arm.  
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	12/11/2009 1:46:42 AM	My doctor perscribed the 6 day pack for me because I had a throat infection, so bad they were afraid I was going to choke on something.  Just after taking the first few pills, my swelling is almost gone.  I am still sick, but the pain is almost gone and I dont feel like I am choking.  I have read other side effects, which I plan on paying close attention to for the remainder of the pills. So far I have only had the sweats, which if this is all I get, I will be greatful, because I feel so much better.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	12/3/2009 3:56:15 PM	Started 6 day taper pack 2 days ago. Treatment for nubmness, burning to lower back/hip region, with loss of sensation persisting over five days. No muscular/skeletal pain or loss of movement.Immediately experienced nausea mid day one, day two heart rate persisting between 120-130 beats per minute. Think this medication was overkill. Supposed to function by boosting bodies natural anti inflamatory response. I agree with other folk that hormones are best avoided whenever possible.Also, kinder gentler way to boost immune system. Am an RN and even I have to remind myself to ASK MORE QUESTIONS! 
Inflammation of Several Cartilages of the Body	Worst Med Ever!!!, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	3	Male	25-34	12/1/2009 5:31:54 PM	The pain definitely goes away, but I recommend taking the 6 day pack when you're going to be away from work for a awhile.  Experienced severe night sweats and I'm still loopy on day 5 (probably from the lack of sleep).  I've never had a cortizone shot, but given the side effects of the Medrol, wish I did that instead!I've just never experienced a drug that worked so well but had just as equal negative side effects.

I was on the 6 day dose pack. By day 4 I was feeling bad and by day 6 I was feeling awful. I finished the dose pack yesterday and I now feel a hundred times worse than before I went on the medication. The side effects I'm experiencing: whole body aches, swelling of the face and gums, confusion, nausea, overly emotional, menstrual problems, exhaustion, dehydration, dizziness, blurred vision, and diarrhea to name a few. I feel drained physically, emotionally, and mentally. I have never felt worse in my life. I will never go on this medication again. 
Other	klumrm, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	11/22/2009 8:06:24 PM	I took the 6 day stepdown treatment for a pinched nerve in my neck with associated pain in shoulder and arm. I didn't experience any of the common negative side affects associated with this drug Within a couple days, my pain subsided though it wasn't gone entirely.  The only side affect I noticed was feeling slightly more tired.
Other	notafanofmethylprednisolone, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	11/15/2009 2:18:03 PM	I was prescribed the 6 day pack for inflammation from a sinus and ear infection along with an antibiotic.  I'm on day 4 days now and feel much worse than before I started taking anything.  I took all 6 pills at once on the first day late in the evening and made sure to take them with plenty of food.  Woke up in the middle of the night from night sweats and felt like I was going to get sick, but didn't.  In the morning, my severe sore throat was completely gone, but I felt dizzy, had mild back pain, headaches, a really bad taste in my mouth, my sense of smell was off, my chest felt tight and was hungry all day.  Every day since, my symptoms are getting more severe.  My back pain is so bad, I can hardly walk or sit, I wake up every night with night sweats, still have the bad taste in my mouth and I can't get full.  Will eat a large meal and feel extremely hungry within 15 minutes so now I'm constantly eating something.  Seems like the back pain also hurts more when I'm hungry.  I feel shaky too, like it's messing with my nervous system.  I'm scared to stop taking it, because I've heard the side effects are worse if you don't finish it.  I will NEVER take this medicine again!  It is definitely not worth the side effects.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	11/14/2009 5:33:22 PM	Used this medicin after sinus surgery. I just had a sinus surgery to treat chronic sinusitis. I often have viral and bacterial infections. The viral infection starts first then the nasal passages get swollen and they close causing a bacterial infection to follow because drainage of the mucus is almost impossible. Therefore Dr often prescribe antibiotics and oral steoroids. However, I am not a fan of either... in any case the surgery was just bound to happen and I finally did it. However, 1 week into recovery I got an infection and I am now on the oral steorid (Methyprednisolone). The good news is that I am not getting a bacterial infection this time (there is no green mucus for example). However, the inflammation is not really going away after my third day on this medecine. I would not to so quick taking it and next time I will try to use a simple Advil to reduce inflammation and the pain in my forehead. My Dr said that this is a strong medecine and would not really want me to take it... however, because of my recent surgery he wants to avoid scaring due to swelling of the sinuses of the healing tissues and that'w why I am taking it. I just wish it would work faster... because so far I am not feeling much better quite frankly. Side effects are not a problem so far.

It helped with the pain but I am anxious, dizzy, out of it, sweating, elevated heart rate, borderline unable to drive, paranoid, have tingling, feel uncoodinated....just to name a few.  This is terrible!!!  I hope it goes away soon.  I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to work.

Two noticeable side effects 1) severe night sweats while sleeping 2) affected immune system so I developed peritonsil abscess for which I am not taking a zpac.
Other	Vivian, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	10/22/2009 12:36:41 AM	Took this medicine 6-day dospak due to severe allergic reaction along with Benadryl at Doc's request. Allergic reaction went away but feeling dizzy, face flush. Finished meds two days ago but got sudden sharp, stabbing pain in adominal area, bloated, feelings of fullness and stomach discomfort, last night tightening of chest but can breath okay. Concerned about affect on immunity (susceptibility to infectious diseases such as colds/flu/virus/bacteria. Due to side effects, I am not sure I would want to take this again. Next time I have a severe allergic reaction (swelling of face, neck, hives), I think I would rather go to the ER and get Benadryl via IV instead.

Other	meliann, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	10/14/2009 9:10:24 AM	I was prescribed this to clear up an ear infection.  Both ears were infected, and the lymph node behind one ear had been swollen for a month. I went through one treatment with an antibiotic, but it didn't clear it up.  Was put on another antibiotic, plus this drug, lymph node returned to normal size and ears felt better within first 3 days of treatment.Side effects were a bit annoying.  I experienced mild anxiousness, irritability, a horrible metal taste in my mouth, and on day 4 and 5, a marked increase in urination.  Was told by dr to not worry unless it was painful.  I wouldn't rule out taking this prescription again if needed, but I would definitely try other options first.
Other	Estherruth, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	10/13/2009 1:16:09 PM	I was given this medication because of severe allergic symtoms to most household allergens, such as dust &amp; dust mites, mold,household products, etc.  I took the medication for 1 week starting with 6 pills a day and reducing  a pill a day until treatment was over. During the treatment, I felt larthargic, and a fullness in my chest with a feeling that all my breathe had been sucked out of my chest area.  At the same time, there was no mucus dripping from my nasal passages and less coughing. Associated with that,I feel very listless in the mornings.

The first 3 nights I sweat so bad I had to pull the sheets off of my bed.  Then I looked at the reviews and others listed similar hormonal interactions.  My husband says I've been moody.  At least its getting rid of the hives.  Night sweats stopped when the dosage amounts decreased to about 3 per day.  I'm still nauseated though.

I then received a horrible rash because I was allergic to one of the antibiotics. They then gave me a steriod shot and had me continue with the oral pills. It has been horrible. I started the pills two days ago and I havent slept since.      It has really interrupted my daily routine of school and work and I am super itchy all over now. So not only am I not sleeping one bit but itching through out the night. Nothing seems to help the itching either. I have taken multiple epsom salt baths, oatmeal baths, benedryl and feel like I am a complete zombie. I wouldn't put this on any of my enemies.

Is 4mg enough 1 x a day enough to ruin my Flu shot effectiveness? Please email me at sunshine2da@gmail.com .  Thank you !

Other	Nevadamom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	8/29/2009 5:15:25 PM	I was prescribed the 6 day (21 tablets) by an ENT (along with amoxicyllin and flonase) to treat fluid in my ear as a result of a bad sinus infection.  The fluid was causing me to have very muffled hearing and pressure in my left ear and it had been over two weeks.  I'm a 41 year old female and normally very healthy. I didn't care for the taste of this medicine and definitely recommend taking it with milk instead of water. My ENT changed the directions and told me to take each days dose all at once first thing in the morning versus throughout the day.  This was to avoid the possible insommnia side effect of the drug (which I didn't have), but told me if I still had sleepimg problems that I could take 50mg of Benadryl to help with that. It worked quickly and effectively for me and my ear cleared within the first 2-3 days of taking it with no side effects.  I happened to have an appointment with my general practitioner the last day of taking this medication for an annual exam and she was concerned with my elevated blood pressure (I am a kidney donor so that may also be why the medicine effected my blood pressure). She requested that I check my blood pressure at home for the next 10 days or so. I am pleased to say that it returned to normal within 1 day of being off this drug so that side effect seems to have been temporary. The only other thing that has bothered me since taking this medicine is that my chest still feels a little tighter than normal when running and it appears to have caused me to miss/delay my regular period.  I've taken two pregnancy tests (both negative) just to be sure.  My husband has also have a vasectomy so I would truly be surprised to find out I was pregnant.  My doctor is not worried about this at this time and believes that my cycle should return to normal next month.

I've been taking the med along with benedryl and it seems to be subsiding slowly but I am still having outbreaks. The only symptoms that I notice is that I feel very sluggish in the mornings, almost as if its letting me know that its time for another dose. I'm afraid to find out if there will be after effects once I finish on day 6!!!!

Yesterday I was fine until evening when I experienced horrendous nausea, cramps and diarrhea. Then I couldn't sleep last night except for a brief 2 hour spell.This morning after my second dose I have the same abdominal pain and runs to the toilet again. So far, the treatment is worse than the bursitis but I know that suddenly stopping this med is not smart.What convinced me to try this med is that I have chronic bursitis in both hips that has not been successfully treated for any length of time. I don't think this drug is the answer but I will keep taking it a day or two longer.
Other	Eric, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	25-34	7/21/2009 10:45:54 PM	The medication worked in less than a day and almost took all of my pain away from my lower back. The only downside is that is made me anxious, and had my head feeling a bit drugged up, and I decided to stop. Other than that it worked.
Rash	trosino, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	35-44	7/21/2009 4:59:54 PM	This cleared up my rash quickly, but the side effects have left me debilatated. I had like a &quot;roid rage&quot; high the first 2 days of the medpack and had complete insomnia which I could live with, but after that I had wild mood swings, suicidal thoughts and extreme anxiety attacks for no apparent logical reason. I have been off the tapper since last tuesday and my mood swings and suicidal thoughts are gone, but I am still suffering intense anxiety attacks. If I didn't work from home I'd be screwed. I am never going to take this drug again unless my life absolutely depended on it. The cure was worse the rash by a landside. Please make sure you really need this Hormone because it supresses your adrenal glands when you take it and then it can take weeks if not months to lose the sideeffects.
Other	still young, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	55-64	7/21/2009 11:08:35 AM	Medication prescribed for Herniated L4-L5 disc that caused foot, ankle, toe and hip pain. Was getting to the point I could hardly take the pain anymore.  Had mild nausea from the start, but nothing I couldn't handle.  Have been on this medication 3 full days now, out of 6.  Woke up this morning at 4 AM and could not get back to sleep.  Feel like a tuning fork.  But my pain has almost completely disappeared.  I hope this is the worst of it because it is helping the pain so much.  I can actually wear closed shoes without experiencing extreme pain in my toes.  My hips have stopped aching and I can actually do some things around the house again.  
Muscle Pain and Stiffness in Shoulder, Neck and Pelvis	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	45-54	7/20/2009 2:59:03 PM	Was prescribed six day pack for pinched nerve in neck with pain &amp; tingling in shoulder, arm and hand. Felt some relief after 2nd day, but side effects were so unbearable I stopped taking after 3rd day.  Side effects were tremendous headache with dizziness.  The headache was so bad even hydrocodone didn't help.  Now it is 2nd day off of med and still can't get rid of headache.  Will not take this again.

This is my second pack in 5 months. Taking it before I go to bed really helped with the side effects, as most were gone by morning. I have a headache only for a couple of hours in the morning. Not having any pain in my neck and hands and having some energy makes the Med worth while.

I am calling the pharmacist today to ask about how to safely stop this drug. Yesterday I missed a dose and while I was out running errands I became very light headed and was afraid I was going to pass out. I have a headache and feel very weak. I think that this drug was an extreme measure for a very minor problem in my case. I will make sure that I never take it again. I am afraid to drive or even get into the shower with no one at home for fear I am going to pass out.

I was in so much pain when I went to the ER, I had to use a walker just to get into the hospital.  After only 2 days I was able to walk, go to work and even do light house cleaning.  It was amazing, I do have to say the only side effect is the neasea.

Other	 Female 	1	2	1	Female		6/21/2009 4:40:30 PM	I was given the 6-day pack as well. First day, I took 6 pills, my cheeks were numb and tingling, had nausea and dizziness, and couldn't sleep well. Called my doctor the following day, he said to stop taking it altogether.Tip for the lady with migraine and nausea:Ginger helps me with nausea (g.candy, g.cookies, g.tea). Migraine is more tricky - I put cold wet towel (or ice pack) on my neck and my forehead, press on acupressure points on my head and my neck, lie down and do abdominal breathing, take a warm (not hot) shower or bath, massage my sculp. One thing helps one day and doesn't help another day. Some people use acupuncture to treat migraines.

I'm halfway into my 3rd day of 6-day pack and it's helping to decongest my sinuses and ears, but not as much or as quickly as I expected and hoped. This is my first time with the oral pills (rather than nasal sprays) and I'm a little paranoid about the possibility of a bacterial infection setting in while this med affects my immune system's ability to fight it off. The upside is that while this med is working on my ears and sinuses, it's also decreasing my arthritis and lumbar disk (herniated) pain so I'm getting multiple benefits. The downside is that I'm a little hazy/foggy, have slight boughts of nausea (equivalent to motion sickness), my face is starting to flush, my coworkers say my face looks puffy, and I'm having difficulty concentrating.

Unless you absolutely need this drug to survive, I would use extreme caution if you are prescribed this drug.  It is a combination steriod/hormone drug.  The first two days after taking this medicine I was in haze and very anxious, for NO REASON AT ALL.  I stop taking all other medications I was on and narrowed it down to this one.  I went to the doctor to get taken off this drug as soon as I possibly could.  PLEASE use CAUTION when deciding to take this medicine.

I started with 15 pills decreasing daily.  Got down to 10 with no effect, doctor told me to go back to 15 and start over.  After 4 weeks I tried Levequin and that did the trick.  I've gone through 250 pills and couldn't wait to get off them.  I've experienced blurred vision and pretty bad leg cramps.  The leg cramps are still there after being off drug for 4 days.  Drinking as much water as possible to wash out of system.  Would not go on this drug again.

Other	Bobbie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	55-64	3/15/2009 6:32:35 PM	My doctor prescribed the 6-day pak with tapering dosage along with Augmentin for a stubborn sinus infection.  The medication seems to be helping, but this is day four (three pills today) and I'm experiencing increased problems with exciteability, mild anxiety, aching in trapezious muscles and base of the neck, a little trouble with concentration, and a sense of increased heart rate.  The first day (six tabs that day) I had trouble with insomnia.  To help with that problem: about one hour before bedtime, I have a cup of Camomile tea with Valerian--two tea bags to a rather large mug--and that helped me a great deal.  I am avoiding caffeine and alcohol while on these meds.  To avoid stomach upset, DO take these meds with food or milk--something with protein is best.  I have 4 tabs left and am not sure I'll finish them.  With each dose, the syptoms seem to be more noticeable.

I seemed to get by the pain initially with ibuprofen 800MG prescribed.  Now, going into my 3rd day of 7 using the tapered dose, the pain has reduced, although I still have the stiffness.  Initially it caused a light-headedness, even a headache at times and a feeling of tension in my stomach.  It doesn't appear based on what I've seen in the posts, that this is a drug I want to be on for a long time.  Hopefully, this will not be a re-occuring problem, otherwise I may have to consider surgery.
Other	artskid, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	45-54	1/26/2009 11:47:26 AM	Methylprednisolone worked for my throat infection, however, it gave me the nausea and light-headedness I get with motion sickness.  I do not get these effects from prednisone.

Other	RDS, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	35-44	1/16/2009 1:17:59 PM	Been on this drug twice for pinched nerve,numbness in arm &amp; hand and shoulder/chest/neck pain.  First time worked wonderfully, no side effects and knocked out ailments.  On it now 1 year later for same issues and by day 2 I'm having terrible side effects this time around: dizziness, flushing/hot flash?, chest tightening, heart pounding, lack of concentration, trouble sleeping.  Also, not knocking out any of my original problems.  I will not take this again as these side effects are pretty scary and concerning. Can't wait to get this stuff out of my system!!!

Im sceduled for surgery in a few months.  Anyway I had to go to the emergency room for the pain in my shoulder and neck, and the Doctor prescribed me this medication, along with Tramadol.  At first I did'nt think any thing but Hydrocordone would work for me, but to my  amazement, this medication along with a few over the counter Ibuprophens, have taken away my pain, except for some stiffnes, which is mostly of my spending to much time on the Computer.  All in All though, it has worked.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	1/3/2009 9:49:07 AM	My oral surgeon prescribed this for my TMJ.  I have been unable to open my mouth more then 1/2 an inch for a month. I was hopeful it would work b/c he was so confident.  I took the 6 day tapered pack exactly as I was supposed to.  Today is the last day.  The methylprednisolone has not helped AT ALL.  I still cannot open my mouth.Also, I had horrid side effects including stomache aches, head aches, fast beating heart, mood swings, nausea, dizziness.  I would hesitate to ever use this for anything again!

My work is physical.  My primary care physician had me try the 6 day pack after giving me an injection in her office.  I can't believe I went almost a full week with hardly any pain and can't report any side effects that caused any problems.I'm very happy with this medicine and plan on reporting this to my doctor to see if there is a dosage that I can use on a daily basis.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	aima, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/15/2008 11:32:02 AM	I have rheumatoid arthritis that I treat daily with another medication.  However, at times I get severe flare ups on my wrist and my doctor prescribed the six day pack. The pain in my wrists is unbearable.  Immediately after starting the medication I see results and get relief from the pain, tenderness and swelling.  I have vere little if any side effects.  However, I do cut down on the other medication except for the Nexxium.  I also have back pain due to a slight herniation.  This medication also helps me with this pain.  When taking this medication my body feels great except that I don't want to take it for long periods of time due to the possible weight gain.

Can we say &quot;roid rage?&quot; Very violent mood swings, flushing and tightening of the face, cotton mouth, dizziness, vomitting, loss of concentration, blurred vision...you name it, lucky me, I got it. I don't think my mood was this unstable during pregnancy. I was given this for my ear having a plugged feeling for 6 weeks. The doc said it would open up the canal. Um, not sure that's working. I am on day 3 of the 6 day, 21 pill course. I am more scared of quitting this in the middle and having the effects get worse. I guess I will finish it out and hope that it leaves my system quickly. 
Bronchitis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/23/2008 6:20:36 PM	After having a cough for nearly 3 weeks my Dr prescribed these to me to treat wheezing in my lungs.  I'm assuming I have bronchitis.  The first dose I took I had some stomach cramping. (of 4 mgs...I think people on here need to put what doseage they're taking!!) The rest of the time, I was just tired.  A friend of mine has been on this before and reassured me that I will be fine.The dose pak was very easy to follow and the pills were easy to swallow.  Halfway thru the pack now, and I'm not coughing at night.  I do have a cold ontop of this, so I'm not sure if it's worked 100% yet.  However, I CAN breathe again!!! :o)

Other	kashmirkat, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	11/16/2008 1:23:27 AM	I have been having hip pain for about a year - it started intermitently and tolerable, but progressively got worse.  this morning I got up and was in tears when I came downstairs, prompting hubby to demand a Dr visit regardless of the extra Saturday fee (I hate going to the Dr).  I have only taken the 6 pills of the 6 day regimen and already have very little pain and am so relieved...  At 38, I was beginning to fear having trouble walking by 40.  So far I have had minimal side effects (took an acid reducer with dinner after reading all the reports of stomach upset and heartburn).  I will post an aditional review later if there is any significant change in my experience of using this medication.

On day 3 after my morning dose, I experienced redness, swelling and burning on my nose and cheeks. I was told not to take any more.  It's been several hours since I've stopped this medication and already my face is getting back to normal.  I also experienced mild dizziness and loss of concentration.

Also have arthritis in neck and upper back. Pills were effective for the pain and &quot;pins and needles&quot; in my arm but side effects are awful. Loss of taste when eating, dizziness, mood swings, hot flashes, increased heartbeat and pain in chest. Not worth it. Will never take this again.
Other	shadow, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	11/6/2008 7:34:47 PM	Was taking this for neck problems, 2 bulging disk and 1 herniated disk. Stopped taking on the third day due to blurring vision, hot flashes, stomach pain, started to doubt myself while driving. It did help to take some of the numbness away in my fingers but not worth all the side effects.It is now day 4 of not taking the medication, and the side effects are going away thank God !!

Took for five days and still no relief and still have swelling in the neck and arm and lots of pain. Hope it works soon! Had mild stomach upset by the 4th day of taking this. Just more headaches to add to this. Will probably have to seek other help if this doesn't help me out soon.

I had taken the 6 pills one day and 5 the next. I started feeling a tightness in my chest and started w/a cough. My throat closed up and my glands were swollen. Cld the Md and he suggested that I stop the meds. It has been 5 days since I have taken any meds and still have a cough and my chest hurts from coughing. Moods swings has disapated and headache has finally gone, but I worry about this cough.. Hopefully it has not damaged my lungs. I am going to wait a few more days, if the cough doesn't go away I will call PCP.

Finally found a Rx that worked in now time after seeing a oral surgeon.  I take the Medrol dose pack at the onset of a breakout, heals the outbreaks very good.  Highly recommend.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	10/3/2008 3:25:45 PM	I took the 6 day pack for neck pain that runs down the left side of my neck and arm.  (xrays don't show any problems).  I had taken once before after auto accident for similar pain.  This time, it seems that it has increased the pain/discomfort and the side effects are terrible.  I feel off balance, like when you have a head cold.  It's very troubling.  I also have pain throughout my shoulders and the puffy/weight gain feeling.  Will not take this again.
Skin Condition	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/27/2008 4:03:40 PM	My foot was swollen to twice its normal size and was red, itched and hurt.  I was prescriped this to help with the swelling and redness.  After the first dose at dinner it was already working by morning.  I am on the 6 days with reducing by one tablet per day.  It tastes terrible and drinking water wont get ride of the taste - you need some food to help.  I can not drink or have any dairy while taking the dose and have to wait about 2 hours before consuming dairy again - otherwise I start to get physically sick.  I just chase it with water and some food and it works great.  Totally worth it!  Only side effect might be tired, but I am on an antibiotic as well so that typical.
Other	Charlie, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	9/27/2008 9:14:15 AM	The 6 Day pack was perscribed after Dental Surgery to reduce swelling. I had an auto accident in 1991 and have had back and neck pain all the time.I have arthritis, lumbar (L-5) area herniated disc's, bulging disc's,degeneration, etc. Also have replacement knee's that stiffen up. Well I couldn't believe it when I awoke the next morning after only the first 6 pills. A MIRACLE drug as I woke up with no stiffness or pain in my back and neck, pain that I have lived with for 20 years. No stiffness in my knee's, I felt like a new Man with plenty of pep, felt 20 years old again. This is my 3rd day of the treatment and I hope the pain never returns. If it does I'll go to my medical Doctor to see if he can perscribe some type of long term treatment using Methylprednisolone. It's amazing it took a Dentist to perscribe this Wonder drug.

Large rash on both arms and stomach. I was given the 21 dose pack. Did not see any significant results from this 21 dose regimen. It did not stop the itching or relieve the rash. I believe the dose should have been higher in order to have been effective. The only side effect I am aware of is getting &quot;goose bumps&quot; on my arms after taking this med. I am going back to the doctor for additional treatment....
Other	Mayella45, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	9/23/2008 10:02:22 AM	Took med for chronic foot pain from plantar facitis and heel spurs. Actually made pain worse and caused many other unpleasant side effects.
Muscle or Bone Disorder	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	4	1	Male	55-64	9/14/2008 4:49:27 AM	i have L-5 S-1 disc bulging with severe pain into the buttocks and down the leg. I can hardly stand and laying down does not relieve the pain. This medicine did nothing to relieve those symptoms and i don't believe it should not be used for this kind of condition.  A muscle relaxant or something else would be better.  This drug is overused by physicians for too many symptoms and should be used for those specific conditions for which it is proven effective. I didn't read any other comments similar to mine that this drug relieved the symptoms. It may work for arthritis and joint disease but not for disc problems. 
Allergic Reaction caused by a Drug	wrsongs, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	45-54	9/13/2008 4:53:27 PM	I took Methylprednisolone tablets for an allergic reaction to a chemicel. A 4 mg 21 tablet pack decreasing the dosage, 6 the first day 5 the second. .  The symptoms left a day later but the side affects started about the same time, and now 3 days after the last dose I still feel grogy at best. Then at times a dizzy feeling equel to the sensation of blowing up a baloon too fast, But the most disturbing part of the side affects are the cycles of altered aleartness, (zoning out then comming back)  It Just seems like I'm there and not there from 20-60 seconds at time.  I try and hold on to the aleartness as it comes back around even as I write this. It's scary and at times my heart races feeling it may get worse. I've been forcing myself to complete tasks and exersize each day while in this fog and I feel better somehow writing this. It also helps to know I'm fearfully and wonderfully made and as it leaves my system these symptoms will pass. Hope it helps, Take Care, Warren

After first day noticed some improvement of the pain, but still have to numbing tingling in my hands and burning sensation between shoulder blades. Side effects from taking this med have been a little blurry vision and things aren't tasting right..especially Mt.Dew...makes beverage almost to sweet to drink and basically doesn't give any pleasure to drink it tasting like this...only a couple of days left of the pak so am hoping the  tingling and numbing sensation in hands start to get better as start the nursing program at school in a few short weeks and can't imagine taking notes with this going on as it hurts just to bend fingers or make a fist especially when first waking up..but have to say did notice some improvement of symptoms the first day of taking this med...just wish the numbing and  tingling go away...will ask Dr. about it or the chiropracter I am seeing along with the regimine...other side effects besides blurry vision and bad taste buds would make it worth taking if it will help...any one having ways to improve condition post a reply and let me know!

After the first day of taking the dose pack the sharp pain went away.  After 3 days I still feel dull pain in my chest and still have tingling down my left arm.  Feels like the meds are just covering the symptoms.  Anxious to see if when I stop the pain will return, definitely hope not.  Side effects felt are some nausea and sleeplisness.

(I believe the lower back pain stems from 2 epidurals but that's another post) The positives of the drug so far on day three I was able to get out of bed with no lower back pain, and I could stand upright while putting on a pair of pants. My energy level has increased dramatically.  Now,  the  negatives are that I have been crying for no reason, very emotional and short tempered. I feel like I have something biting at me all over my lower extremities as well my inner and outer thighs and arms and back.  So I find myself rubbing down with alcohol to soothe the areas which I scratched badly.  I had a slight stomach ache on day two but I made sure that on day three I ate after taking each pill except for at bedtime.  This drug has given me such relief in just a short amount of time.

Shortness of breath has increased, thus making it more difficult and painful to cough. Increased irritability and drowsiness. Developed extremely uncomfortable pain just below my left ribcage after completing Day 3, and can no longer cough without being grounded.

Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	6/17/2008 7:58:18 PM	Only on the second day of a 6 day, 21 pack prescription.  For over a week I couldn't walk without debilitating pain in my left hip. My doctor thinks that it has something to do with my immune system working overtime. Took six pills after 3pm yesterday and this morning I had no pain.  My face is a little flushed today, but I'd trade that for the pain in a heartbeat.  Somewhat anxious to see what happens when I finish the doses.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	etrok, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Male		6/9/2008 5:20:17 PM	At 80 yrs I have a number of arthritic pains.  Never been diagnosed as &quot;Rheumatoid&quot; but the 6 day pack really helped.  Also had a nice boost in energy.  Am aware that one must be careful about continued use.  Wish it were not true because not only pain relief buta real improvement in mood - without feeling &quot;high&quot;.
Other	Stephanie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	6/9/2008 1:31:38 PM	I was put on a six day treatment with this medication. Took 2 weeks for the whole bag of symptoms. I have felt like I have had the stomache flu for 2 weeks and my mood swings are scary violent. To the point where people dont want to be around me. This medication is really scary. I took it for jaw surgery in which I guess my Dr. thought it would help the recovery process. Make sure the good outweighs the bad because right now, I hate everything in my life because this drug screwed me up that badly. 
Inflammation of the Tendon	NorthCarolina, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/7/2008 12:01:07 AM	Wish I had this sooner so my pain would have been gone sooner. Works fantastic, at least, for me. Easy to want to stop taking it after just the first day because it did not long for the pain to stop after nearly a week of sharp pain in left calf whenever I wanted to rest and get off my feet. I can't believe a pill so small could do wonders - so fast. I will take the whole prescription for my 6 days and will look forward to NO more pain even after I stop taking it. Thank you.

I made the mistake of not eating breakfast the first morning of taking these pills and I paid for it the rest of the day.

My Dad has bad allergy's and recomended taking this during the bad season which is now. Zyrtec, Claritin and all other allergy medications were like candy to me. I could not breath at night, sinus congestion, runny nose, coughing!!!. Need I say more. I went to my PCM and told him give me this treatment. I took the 5 day pack and on the first 6 pills I was new man. This drug works and gives me tons of energy. When I am in the gym working out, I never feel pain and work out harder. Side effect? maybe but it's a good one! After the one time treatment I am now on Flownase and workd great! For all those allergy suffers, I highly recommend this combonation. Worked for my dad and worked for me. Bad side is that you might have too much energy.

The medicine has relieved almost all of the stiffness associated with whatever I have,except for my left elbow, which hurts the same. I only wish I could take it daily, because after about a week off the medicine all my symptoms return full force, but doctor has stated that it is dangerous to take this medicine for more than twice a year. That gives me two whole weeks a year with relief.
