Breast Cancer that has Spread to Another Part of the Body	Maggie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	55-64	6/2/2012 3:22:51 PM	After 2 doses of Doxil (given every 4 wks) we reduced the infusion by 20% to help with the mouth sores and skin rashes. We reduced the dose by another 10% for the 4th dose for the mouth sores &amp; Hand/Foot syndrome.The biggest mystery to me was the daily fevers up to 104 degrees.  Now that I realize they are chemo related &amp; not infection, I just do my best to keep them low with aspirin and resisting getting too bundled up in blankets. Night sweats accompany the fevers.I also have joint pain and weakness that parallels the fevers.  The higher the fever, the weaker I am and the more joint pain. The fever goes away, the joint pain/weakness go away. Movement also helps with the joint pain. So when I wake up I lay in bed and bend my knees and pump my ankles before getting up. Later, I walk or ride a stationary bike.I use Orabase to help with the mouth sores to eat and then apply Triamcinolone paste at night to help heal them.  They aren't as bad now that the doses have been reduced.My breast CA has resisted Adriamycin/Cytoxan, Taxol, and 5FU/Cytoxan/Methotrexate. It metastasized to my lung. After 3 infusions the masses haven't really changed... not the greatest, but it could be worse.This breast CA might be a late effect of mantle radiation I received for Hodgkins disease back in 1979.  They don't radiate like that anymore.Otherwise, doing fine. God bless you all and may you feel His presence and comfort!

The lesions in my liver are smaller and no new ones have appeared.  The cancer in my bones has also stabalized.  I wish I could have had more cycles but my oncologist limited the amount I received because of the potential for heart problems.
Cancer of the Ovary	Kathy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	12/9/2009 6:20:10 PM	I have had 7 treatments of Doxil (7 months). CA 125 is rising around 9 or 10 every month. I have had a few side effects (fatigue, low white blood counts, hand-foot syndrome), but the one that I would like to see if anyone else has had, is in the second week (when my counts are actually at their highest due to Neulasta), I run a fever, then develop a cough and end up with Bronchitis (at least that's what the doctor diagnoses me with). I guess the thing that bugs me the most is what if I don't have an infection and take an antibiotic for nothing! The antibiotic always makes me feel better. I'm not feeling too good about the treatment I'm receiving, but oncologists seem to think it's effective.

Cancer of the Ovary	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	2/28/2009 9:49:59 PM	This treatment was completely ineffective against my grandmothers ovarian cancer. The treatment was very harsh and caused severe inflammation of the body. Ask your doctor many questions before starting this treatment. 
Cancer of the Ovary	talbrt16@aol.com, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	8/16/2008 4:56:08 PM	1999-CA125=2700 and scans. Full hysterectomy and debulking.  Started with cisplatin/taxol, switched to carboplatin/taxol due to reaction.  After nine mos. 1st recurrence-started doxil with carboplatin.  Taken prophylatically every 7 weeks for 8 years.  In my 6th yr had a recurrence due to coming off Doxil for about a few months when I went on kidney dialysis due to original cisplatin and we wanted to give kidneys a rest. With recurrence, added carboplatin with doxil.  Now back on doxil only (lower dose) and today CA125 is 5.9. Muga scans are taken and I check in with a cardiologist. No heart  problems.   
Breast Cancer that has Spread to Another Part of the Body	z00ma,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female		4/17/2008 8:43:32 PM	I have metastatic Breast CA to liver and lung.  I have had a lot of prior Chemo drugs. This was fairly easy drug to tolerate. It is bringing down my CA2729 markers after 2nd treatment. No nausea, hair loss, bone pain, constipation or lose stools or low blood counts. It's also on a 4-week cycle instead of 3 for Breast CA patients. I do have to admit I do get heartburn the day of treatment thats treatable with OTC medications. Small drawback compared to some chemo drugs!

She is experiencing very, very minimal side effects and we keep our fingers crossed, knock on wood, and pray to God that this medicine will take her to long, long term remission. Good luck to you all.
