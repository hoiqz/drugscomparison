High Blood Pressure	Susan, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/25/2012 8:55:06 AM	I had uncontrollable high blood pressure, and had tried many combinations of BP meds to try to control.  When Tekturna came on the market, my internist suggested I try it.  Blood pressure immediately dropped and has been under control since.  Prior to Tekturna, I took so much blood pressure medication, in combination, that I had no energy.  Tekturna gave me back my life.

Was totally amazed and quite pleased!  Then, weight gain of 5-pounds within seven days of starting this medication.  (Please note, I actively watch and keep my caloric intake to less than 1000 calories per day and have an exercise regimen that has maintained my ideal weight for the past year.) Legs, arms and face showed signs of swelling on day five.  Lips began swelling on day ten.  Lightheadness and a feeling of disassociation with sporadic blurred vision occured almost daily.  Generally a poor physical feeling (heaviness and bloating) that I am not accustomed to. Have stopped this drug in the last three days and the feeling of bloating and heaviness are diminishing.  A sense of well-being has returned and my scale is showing a reduction in ounces daily.  Was truly amazed and pleased with how quickly my BP lowered...so very sad to have experienced these side effects.  Just not the drug for me.  Am checking my BP daily until I can see my doc again...so far, so good: 148/81 is the highest it has been in the last three days and that's continuing with the other two meds I have been on for years (clonidine &amp; verapamil).

I thought it had to do with another drug i'm taking but i have beeen off of it for 3-4 days and the feeling of the bladder went away not completely but close to it because of the way i felt for the past 6 months

It was kmy LAST resort because everythng else mad me cough uncontrollably. so far, so good.

High Blood Pressure	KEN ROBERTS, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male		5/3/2009 12:40:12 PM	I had lots of erratic bp. Would spike to 190/90 on some days. Tried Tekturna  for 10 days with some benefit. Added Benicar &amp; bp reduced to 135/70 &amp; has stayed down for 9 months. I do have a marked loss of energy, however &amp; wonder if the drugs are the cause? Dosage is 150mg Tekturna &amp; 20 mg Benicar .  
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	4/20/2009 4:16:32 AM	I took this drug in hopes of lowering my bp.After two weeks I suffered bouts of dizziness so severe I coud not stand up.I discontinued use.
High Blood Pressure	 Female  (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female		3/7/2009 4:17:41 AM	I had a severe reaction!  I started itching all over...thought it was nerves.  Then I started turning yellow.  I had to be hospitalized twice.  This stuff is very, very dangerous!  My liver stopped functioning.  It took a while off of this drug for my liver to go back to normal.  Please do not try this drug!! I wish only to  save anyone from going through what I went through.  I missed more than a month of work and don't know if there is any long term damage to my liver or other organs.  Please tell your doctor that you don't want this drug....there are plenty of other medications that control blood pressure...you don't need to take this one.

Main difficulty is that for about 8 hours after I take this drug, if I crouch down and then stand up, I am so dizzy, I can barely keep my balance.  this lasts 30-60 seconds and then goes away.  It is annoying, but manageable.  That is the only time I experience a difficulty.  Getting up from a lying down or sitting down position does not produce the same effect....only getting up from a crouch.
