Inactive Tuberculosis	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	2/17/2012 2:21:13 PM	I tested positive for TB and was put me on this medication for 9 months. the first 8 months, i didn't see any side effects. until my last refills. insomnia, numbness and uncomfortable on my right leg when driving. and it also effect my other medication i was on, including anti depression. now due to the insomnia, my depression got worst. went to see my doc. i told me there is a chance that the isonized can do something to your liver to make the anti depression less effective. now i have to take time of work due to insomnia and depression. My advise to anyone out there taking anti depression med. and want to go on isonized please consult your doc.

I took this drug for 7 months (6 months was the standard protocol then) and it tore me up the whole time. It wreaked havoc with my digestion and I started suffering from mild nerve pain and tingling. That nerve pain became a life-changer after a series of medical procedures a few years later, and I have suffered from this ever since (more than a decade). I also had a huge nerve pain reaction in my spine years later (2007) when I took Levaquin for a post-surgery E Coli infection and I've been told it's in the same antibiotic class. I am very sorry I took this drug and I will avoid any drugs in its class if at all possible in the future.

I just started this medication and was told I had to be on it for 9 months. It became upsetting, becauseI had no clue what I am allowed to eat and my doctor was no help. I spend hours figuring out things and I created a document of foods I can eat also a better view of foods that aren't allowed. It would be very helpful if someone would tell me how I can make it an attachment so others may view it. I hope the short list of foods that are allowed would help.  
Inactive Tuberculosis	Debbie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	9/14/2011 2:57:23 PM	have to take the drug for 9 months I am on month 2.  I already have Lupus it is making it worse.  My stomach is so messed up.  I am losing like 5 lbs. a month on it.  I already had migrains this has only made them worse.  My vision is gone.  By reading all the reviews it sounds like I still have more symptons to come.  I have been on alot of medicine before but never one that had such cruel side effect.  This is a warning this is not a nice drug at all.  If I could get off I sure would.
Inactive Tuberculosis	RoadRacer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	45-54	9/6/2011 5:44:50 PM	I was diagnosed with reactive TB after having the blood work so I could take Cimzia.  Scary thought is I haven't had a TB test since 2008 when it was negative.  I did change jobs where I interact with patients.  I came back with reactive TB.  Medicine just makes me a little sleepy in the dat but I take it at night with B-6 and all the other medications for other issues.  Give it time there are no cures over night. But if you are concerned have you doctor reorder the test to double check.
Inactive Tuberculosis	Granny B, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	8/1/2011 4:09:58 PM	I was diagosed with latent TB and started a 9 month session of this drug. I had tingly fingers, toes, restless legs, couldn't sleep, didn't want to eat, had headaches,blurry vison, and just felt horrible all the time. Then on top of everything else, I developed severe muscle cramping that lead to yet another pill-B6. I got to the point where I just couldn't gag down another pill about 8 months into my treatment, and I quit taking the meds. Now I am experiencing nausea after eating and gas, bloating, and loose stools. Don't know if that's normal or not. Liver was tested often and thankfully all was well. Through the course of the treatment, my skin was prone to breakouts, I developed dark circles under my eyes, insomnia got worse, my hair started to fall out, and I had no appetite. I've lost weight without intending to. If I had to do it over again, I would have said no to the treatment, but since I work in a nursing home and have grandkids, I didn't want to risk passing anything on to them. I'd never put myself through it again. Far too many side effects to deal with that I may never recover from.

The bottle says that it is supposed to be a round white pill yet the ones I was given are long oblong shaped and I am not even sure I am taking the right medication.  I am a healthcare worker and have tested negative for TB for 10 years this year I tested positive. My doctor put me on this med at 300 mg doses once a day, since I am always tired, have black circles under my eyes, itch constantly, have headaches, blurred vision and have trouble concentrating.  I have yet to talk to my doctor as he prescribed the medication then went on vacation.  The pharmacy was less than helpful and I am realy thinking of quiting the medication.

Inactive Tuberculosis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	6/11/2011 12:21:59 AM	I was put on this medication for nine months when i was around nine years old. I noticed sudden, severe hair loss at around eleven years old. After having thinned dramatically then, my hair seems to have possibly thinned  more but gradually over the next nine years. I am now twenty and have extremely thin hair. My dermatologists were never able to discern the cause of my hair loss, and seemed not to be interested in hearing about my having taken isoniazid, but I suspect this medication had something to do with it. 
Inactive Tuberculosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	6/2/2011 10:29:04 AM	I was tested for TB since I was 5 yrs old and my Dr at that time said that I was in the clear. I got test almost every yr until I turn 18. But when I was pregant I tested postive. I heard about all the side effect and was nervous about taking it. I guess I will take my chances and pray that it will stay inactive and hope that my baby is TB free.

(right) I've even drank while taking it, only like 3 or 4 beers and the test came back ok. that's not to say it's ok to drink on it but this drug has been around for 49 years now and on one has died on it.. so if you need to take it to get rid of TB just do it and get it over with.. good luck !

Treatment to Prevent Tuberculosis	nisessis, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	12/7/2010 7:30:56 PM	I took this drug in 1974 at the age of 12 for 30 days to prevent after a relative was diagnosed with TB - later to be corrected to Black Lung disease. Now in 2010, I have had a sevre reaction to Lamisil which the doctor had only heard of in patient with TB and some other medical conditions.  He was just naming cases where the Lamisil was known to cause this problem, one of which was TB and I stopped him and said, that's it.  So, for 36 years this drug was dormant in my system only to have a reaction now.  I was not taking the Lamisil for nail fungus, but a yeast infection of the skin.
Inactive Tuberculosis	Me, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	4	Male	25-34	12/1/2010 12:04:07 PM	It's been 1 and a half months on this drug so far. I had a positive skin test and was recommended this drug to prevent active TB.  The first week I had a slight allergic reaction which consisted of small itchy hives, but they disappeared within a few days.  Since that first week I have had no other side effects. I take vitamin B6 daily with my medication to support nerve health. I rated ease of use low because it is such a long regimen, 9 months of daily pills, and it is easy to forget and miss a day. Otherwise this has been relatively pain free for me. I get my liver checked (normal so far) and watch my diet. I fear active TB more than the possible side effects of this drug, so I will complete the regimen.

I found that if I take it just after work and then wait one hour before dinner, works the best for me. That way the time that I am the time that I am very tird is where I can go to bed if I choose.

I have  been on Isoniazid for less then 2 weeks and boy has is been a bumpy ride. On the 1st day I got so sick after eating lunch from  Deli I thought I was a gonner. I later found out that over 1/2 the food on my sandwhich were No-no items. The food list is very confusing. What are we allowed to eat? I have been sick, tired, hurt to the bone, and my eyes are  blurry.  I also don't feel comfortable leaving my home.  1o months of meds and everything will be great , Right???

As far as folks taking about pain/tingling in fingers/feet. Did your doctors prescribe Vitamin B6? Vit B6 will help prevent peripheral neuropathy, which is the tingling/pain in hangs, fingers, feet.
Inactive Tuberculosis	sunny, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	7/14/2010 1:23:52 PM	I took this drug 18 years ago when I was 19 years old for inactive TB.  I tested positive twice for TB skin test.  I took the drug daily for 9 months.  Of course at such a young age I have no memory of the doctor going over any interactions with me.  I was told to take for 9 months and had no follow up visits with the health department doctor.  Years later, I have since had many random doctor visits, lab tests and other tests and as far as I know I don't have any long term effects of taking the drug.  I only recently started researching inactive TB because I was looking up information on Lupus and Isoniazid was listed as a possible cause of that disease.  It has been surprising to read all the comments on this drug.  It seems that there are still so many unanswered questions as well as uneducated medical professionals to give patients the help they deserve.

Originally i started taking it in the morning but i started to become really drowsy at work.

About 9 months ago i was having my physical at my new job and they told me my blood test came back positive for TB, i was sent to have an x-ray which showed nothing, therfore i was told i have Inactive TB. I had to go to the health building to recieve my treatment of (INS) Isoniazid to cure what i was told i had, i started off with multiple side effects that caused muscle pain, headaches, nerve issues in my hands (B-6 helps!) and mood change. Well 8 months later i find that due to someones error.. i actually was never exposed, they did a PPD (skin test) negative.. they repeated my blood work at the health building.. negative! I have been taking a treatment of a liver damage causing medication for nothing! My advice to those who are told that they have inactive TB.. get tested twice becasue you never know when someone may have made a mistake that could cost you!

I did a mild workout 2 days ago, with push-ups,sit-ups,curls, pull-ups, and a few squats(just 20 to start toning for later workouts). Strangly, my arms,abs and chest hurt very little(unlike before), but my quads have not stopped hurting since the workout. 2 sets of 10 squats??? The pain should have been everywhere but in the quads. I take 1 tablet each morning an hour before breakfast. I'll follow up on this message. Be careful, and read up on these drugs. Be blessed.

I am a paramedic both on 911 response ambulances and in the E.R. I have no side effects and find it very easy to take the drug. Its amazing that 1 in every 3 people have TB. This medication is used to treat nearly all of them and I find that the reviews on here are mostly from parents or others that are not on it themselves. I really think this is a great medication so far. I still do take a multivitamin and B6 with it while having  my liver enzymes checked monthly. I am also in good shape otherwise going to the gym 7 days a week. I think that most people will not have a problem if they take the medication if they stay active and keep healthy habits such as exercise and diet.

My 5 yr old has trouble sleeping and has these huge tantroms. When the tantrom starts he is very hard to get back under control. It is affecting his schooling. My 15 mon old there are nights that he wakes up every hour screaming and nothing will satisfy him. It is said to say that in the 6 mons for the oldest and 3 mons for my youngest they have never once seen a doctor. They have only seen his nurse. The nurse says there is no possible way this medicine can cause all this but this has provide my point. I really don't know what to do about it.

After a while a changed my doctor, I explained to my Dr that I might be expossed to TB and what the prevouis Dr told me che ran a blood test to check my liver, thanks God everything was fine. My Dr. told me that indeed there may be a possiblity that the med may affect the liver but she said that she will monitor it to check for any changes. She aslo recommended to take Vitamin B-6 (100mg) to ease any stffness or pain that may be caused by the med.

Her bottom was so sore she screamed when I rinse it w/ water. Dr. told me it's because it interacted w/ her H1N1 shot she had, so to wait about a week, and then give her only 1/2 the dose (5ml).  I am going to ask if I can hold off giving the meds to her until she's older (4 or 5) so at least she can tell me if there's a problem.  Also since we wait 2 hours after a meal, it means she takes it around 8:30 or 9pm, she should be sleeping at that time. Can't give it to her any other time, as she will be in daycare during the day.

BUT, AS OF TODAY, I HAVE BEEN TAKING THIS RX FOR ALMOST 30 DAYS. I AM EXPERIENCING THE TINGLE OF MY HANDS AND FEET. I HAVE NOTICED MY BIG TOES HAVE AN ACHE. MY FEET ARE SHOWING SIGNS OF SWELLING ALONG WITH MY ANKLES. MY LEFT WRIST IS HAVING EXTREMELY JOINTS ACHES ALONG WITH THOSE 5 FINGERS ON THAT LEFT HAND. I DO NOTICE A BLURR VISION THAT &quot;I&quot; PERSONALLY BELIEVE CAUSES MY HEADACHE. TRYING TO FOCUS. SOMETIMES MY WHOLE &quot;LEFT ARM&quot; JUST ACHES. THE SWEATING &quot;OH MY GOODNESS&quot;. I DIDN'T KNOW A GIRL COULD DO THAT MUCH. I ENJOY THE SUN BUT NOW IT'S MISERABLE TO BE OUT IN IT. WHAT WILL I DO NOW IT IS SUMMER?I HAVE NO STOMACH ACHES THOUGH. THANK GOODNESS OF THAT. AT FIRST, I DID HAVE SOME NAUSEA BUT AS TIME WENT SO DID IT. I AM VERY NERVOUS OF THE SIDE EFFECTS LISTED ON WEB MD AND THOSE THAT CAME WITH MY RX. THE NURSE NEVER WENT OVER THOSE &quot;MAJOR&quot; SIDE EFFECTS. IT AMAZES ME THAT YOU CAN'T FIND SOMEONE IN THE MEDICAL FIELD TO TRULY EXPLAIN THE &quot;INACTIVE TB&quot;. IM SO CONFUSED.WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I STOP THIS RX? IS THERE A DAY THAT I DO BECOME &quot;ACTIVE&quot;. OVERALL, I AM TRYING TO TOLERATE THESE CRAZY SIDE EFFECTS THAT I AM HAVING, BECAUSE, THEN AGAIN I AM SCARED TO NOT TREAT IT FOR THE CONCERN OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS. I AM GOING TO GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE TIME BEFORE I MAKE THE DECISION OF STOPPING IT OR NOT. TO HEAR OTHERS SAY THAT THEY HAVE OR HAD THE SAME WEIRD FEELINGS THAT I AM CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING WAS NICE. (SORRY, BUT NOW IM NOT JUST CRAZY OR OVER-REACTING). THIS IS ALL NEW TO ME AND IM VERY NERVOUS. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR EXPERIENCES.

My bones and joints ache, i have severe headaches, severe abdominal pains, weakness, tired, and just overall hurting. I have been told time and time again that its all worth it, i hope and pray it is. If you have a tolerance for these side affects and i'm not saying that you will get all the side affects but in the end i think it will be worth it. Oh, and do limit yourself on the amount of Advil and Tylenol that you take during this period.

Chest x-rays are clear, blood work normal. Will get results from sputum test in a few more weeks. So obviously, I came in contact with someone who had active TB. God knows who or when. Been on the medication 1 month. Can't sit in one spot (computer) too long and have to keep moving otherwise my finger tips and feet start to tingle.(take Vitamin B-6 faithfully)  I'm Lucky because all my life my menstral cycle use to come like clock work. I ccould log it's arrival down to the hour, but his month it never came. I am so bloated and huge. My clothes won't fit around my waste anymore and my rings won't make it past my knuckles. I am NOT pregnant, unless I'm the Virgin Mary. I'm not very thrilled using safety pins to tie my jeans together at the waiste and I feel very irritable. Actually, more than irritable. I feel like smacking people around. I don't want to take this anymore. Maybe I have a kidney infection. Going to gynocologist next. TB, whether LATENT, OR ACTIVE... JUST SUCKS!!! 
Inactive Tuberculosis	John, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	45-54	4/3/2009 7:02:25 AM	Mild tingling in the hands and some abdominal pain. Given while diagnosed with hepatitis.
Inactive Tuberculosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/1/2009 3:12:51 PM	I took this medication for five days.  At first, I noticed mild indigestion and some fatigue.  I also had decreased appetite.  On the fourth day, I noticed I was feeling more tired and &quot;out of it.&quot;  By the next morning, I had to pull over and call paramedics because I couldn't drive, felt confused and dizzy, and was afraid I was going to pass out.  My doctor looked at me like he coulnd't understand what was going on and that fatigue was the only side effect that could be associated with this medication, although dizziness and confusion are clearly listed on the insert!!  After reading other people's experiences, I will NOT take this.  I can't believe the prescribe this when the nurse who read my skin test said you only have a 10% chance of developing active TB in your life time.  Taking this will not guarantee you never develop active TB.  Plus, lupus and hepatitis are larger risks with this antibiotic.

I don't want to wait that long. I also feel tired all the time but since I have two children I was told that I'm just overworked.  Really was not given option on meds.  I hate having to check in at the dept of health like a criminal monthly.  This whole thing sucks.
Inactive Tuberculosis	worried_mom, 0-2 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	0-2	3/22/2009 3:29:14 PM	My 1 year old has recently started this drug due to a positive skin test, but negative chest xray.  First, I hate that it is a 9 month treatment.  Second, trying to give a little one practically a full syringe full of this stuff is extremely difficult, and a sticky mess when it gets spit back out at me.  I am extremely concerned with all the side affects that comes with this medication.  Although my child has been on the med for a week, I think I am going to go and get a second opinion.  Also, I only get a month of meds at a time, so we have to go and follow-up/check in with the doctor every month for the first few months to check against any counter measures.  I feel unsure of this product.  With all the other complaints on here about this med, my little one isn't going to be able to tell me if there is any cramping, fatigue, ect... How can one feel safe to give this to anyone?  I think this med is too stressful to give to anyone, especially a little one.  I'm going to make a doc appt first thing tomorrow morning!
Inactive Tuberculosis	Concerned pt, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/5/2009 4:29:58 PM	I started taking this drug after a positive ppd. My chest x-rays indicated no presence of disease.  After two weeks of being on this med I developed some unusal symptoms: very tired, drowsy, and very sleepy.  Then extreme numbness in legs and arms.  Followed by frontal head numbness. I almost fainted while driving.  It has been 3 weeks since I have discontinued this med but still am expriencing most of the symptoms, except reduced numbness.  
Other	Sandra, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	12/14/2008 10:58:12 AM	My 5 month baby has been taking this medication for 2 months now. He developed 2 lumps on the left side of his neck area. Doctors have told me that he had a reaction to the BCG vaccine he took when he was born. One lump had to be drained because it got very swollen and red. Now my baby will be on this med for 9 months. I dissolve a pill into 10 ml of water then give him 7.5 ml of the dissolved med. I am really concerned about possible side effects. If my baby is having problems with this medication, I can't tell. I have noticed skin rashes on his face and he scratches his head alot. Could this be the medication???

I have been told to take this drug and I feel very strongly that it's not something I want to subject myself to. I've had pneumonia and not developed TB. Maybe I was just lucky but I'll stick with chest x-rays as long as I can rather than go on this drug. Thanks again.
Inactive Tuberculosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	10/9/2008 6:09:20 PM	I have been on isoniazid for 8 1/2 months of a 9 month treatment.  I had a positive skin test and clear x-ray.  The monthly doctor visits and blood tests are inconvenient but not too bad.  I was nauseated after taking the pill the first month, but that went away.  I had some numbness in my fingers when I forgot to take the B6 that I was also supposed to  be taking daily.  The B6 alleviated the numbness.  I have increased skin sensitivity and constipation - both uncomfortable but not unbearable.
Treatment to Prevent Tuberculosis	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	10/5/2008 9:12:37 PM	What is the medical community thinking? Why would they prescribe something that may cause severe illnesses to possibly prevent a different severe illness? Thank you but I'd rather treat the TB disease than to have liver failure, Lupus or the myriad of other possibilities! My mind was made up for good when I started losing my hair!!!! I already take Lexapro and Lamictal for BP2 which is already hard on my liver. Don't want to up the stakes for liver disease! I'd advise anyone to not take this and just get yearly chest xrays. This med is not 100% effective against getting TB. 
Inactive Tuberculosis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	10/5/2008 4:54:39 PM	so i have been on this drug for a week and i was told to look out for nerve related problems. After two days i felt a wierd pain in my foot by my toes. I thought nothing of it, and thought i stepped on it wrong. Now on the seventh day the pain has increases and is severe. I have read the reviews and no one has commented on the nerve damage possibility, which if it occurs, i was told it could be permanent.
Inactive Tuberculosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	2	2	Female	25-34	9/11/2008 10:02:52 PM	I was exposed to tb through work and tested positive.  I have to take once a day with B6 vitamin, and I don't have any side effects.  I'm on month 4 of 9 and have had bloodwork once, which was fine.  The problem I have is I can't eat cheese, almost all dairy, raisins, bananas, a lot of meats, can't drink alcohol and I can't take tylenol! That is hard to deal with since I have 2 kids and have to make seperate meals for myself.
Inactive Tuberculosis	kp777, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/27/2008 12:39:53 AM	(I have not been on this med, I had to fill in the stars to post.)  After my 3 year old had a positive reaction to his TB test, our entire family was tested, and I also was positive.  His pediatrician prescribed a 9 mo. treatment with this med., and so far, thank God, no bad side effects.  She is monitoring his white cell count and liver enzymes through regular blood tests.  My doctor, however, advised me to simply have the chest xray, which came back clear, and to wait another year to have another xray.  She feels that the risks of the med, due to my age, far outweigh the benefits, and that I am no in danger of it becoming active TB.  I trust her judgement and pray it will stay inactive.  Hope this helps...
Inactive Tuberculosis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	45-54	7/25/2008 10:45:22 PM	I have latent TB and decided to take the meds as I have niece with leukemia and has recently had a transplant.  I did not want to inadvertently infect her so I have been taking this for almost 6 months.  After experiencing fatigue and itching when taking every night, my doc had me take it every other night.  That helped the fatigue and the itching went away after a few weeks.  The one thing that I found out from my pharmacist is to avoid pineapple and raisins.  they contain a certain ingredient that counter-acts the meds.  Also to avoid ibuprofens and tylenol to reduce the risk of liver problems

Inactive Tuberculosis	TB boy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	6/17/2008 11:26:56 AM	I was about to start taking this medication for inactive TB, but I read all the side effects and the comments of many people that had taken this medication and I refused to do it. I believed the medication should be take if become active only. If we take the medication, whatever, we are not 100% immune to develope active TB and the health risks fot taking it are very high. I will suggest anyone with inactive TB and normal to strong immune system to avoid to take it until becomes active. That might never happen. Some patients live with inactive TB all their lives and never notice it. My personal opinion.

He takes 3 tablets on Monday and then 3 on Friday.  The bad part is I have to take him to town to take it.  They will not let me give it to him at home.  He had a positive skin test but &quot;does not have TB&quot; (thier words not mine)and this is suppose to be a &quot;preventive measure.&quot;  Its nothing but a pain in the butt.

I recall severe joint pain/swelling and various other ailments. I still can't get rings over my knuckles. My life/health is still &quot;not right&quot; I also fear lupus, as my recent bloodwork seems to indicate. I've also done some research on ganglion cysts I now have &amp; there may be a link to the INH!?! Thankfully, no other friends/family members have ever had a positive PPD (I still question the when/where I could have picked it up). My xrays were clear &amp; I have no other signs of TB. Because the side-effects were making life pretty miserable and my liver enzymes were beginnig to become affected, my public health nurse gave her &quot;blessing&quot; for me to quit after 4-1/2 months...I'm thinking not soon enough!
Inactive Tuberculosis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	1/31/2008 8:51:06 AM	I have been taking Isoniazid for two weeks now. My joints are painful and I am worried about lupus, it is one of the side effects of this drug. My sister has lupus now that she got from one of her heart medications. I am going to press my Dr for a QuantiFERON-TB Gold blood test before I will continue with this treatment. My sister has undergone two hip replacements and is always off of work because of the lupus.I had the BCG vaccine as a child and am wondering if that is the cause of my positive skin test. My chest xray is clear.

How am I supposed to know if it has worked for me? How am I supposed to know if I am Satisfied with it? I could just say &quot;NO&quot; I'm not freaking happy about catching TB while going about my daily business. It's not like HIV where I at least get the pleasure of &quot;getting some&quot;. no I got it at work from a guy I worked with. WTF? Now I have to take this crap not knowing if it'll work, Chest X-rays anytime I feel ill. anytime there's a TB outbreak I will prolly get to take this crap again. I don't get how people can take TB with such stride, personally, I'm alittle pissed about it. and no it's not like the common cold it's the same disease that killed &quot;Doc&quot; Holiday. It will be with me forever. I am not happy about it. OH, ANDDDDD... how is it that it could be around for so long and still the Experts don't know Squat about it? how I got it (short form)in 2006-2007 where I worked Stream International  ,Beaverton Or, out of 900 employees 70+ ended up TB+ is about 7%, the whole county is normally 8% annually. So for me to just walk away shoulders shrugged?!? I just can't do it.
