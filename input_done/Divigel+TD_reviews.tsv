Low Estrogen After Operation to Remove Ovaries	Shay, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	8/1/2012 12:03:08 PM	My doctor just put me on Divigel therapy twice a day instead of taking Estratest. The Estratest controlled my hot flashes but aftering using the Divigel it felt like my hot flashes were 10 times worse and I started profusely sweating, can't sleep and am very fatiqued. I just wanted to see if anyone else was having these symptoms since I am having a hard time with him allowing me to go back to my original therapy.

I no longer have my period and so I am officially in menopause.My doctor prescribed Divigel 0.1% after we discussed various types of Hormone Therapy and the side effects of each.Divigel has side effects also and after a week of taking Divigel, I am starting to experience these side effects. A, breast tenderness, B, Sinus inflammation and drainage, C, vaginal secretions, D, weight-gain, E, Incresed High Blood pressure,F, overall feelings of stiffness and bloating.I've rated this product effective in removing my hot flashes and cold sweats, however,starting today, I will no longer take Divigel because the side-effects (there are many more listed by the manufacture) I am currently experiencing far outweigh any hot-flash or cold sweats I have had prior to taking this drug.I do not recommend taking this drug, I recommend looking for a more wholistic/natural way to reduce hot flashes and cold sweats.Sincerely, Divassa in Binghamton, NY 11/2011

The divigel was for vaginal dryness and burning. The Rx was to rub gel inside labia and outside vagina. The burning from the gel was almost unbearable, but doc said to stick with it. Symptoms did improve with use and the burning from the gel was not as bad after regular use. Used for about 6 months off and on. Now different doc in same practice recommending vagifem.  Will start this week.

I was experiencing terrible hot flashes and painful intercourse. The hot flashes subsided within 1 month of use. The painful intercourse remains. I have had weight gain on this medicine - although I continue my exercise regiment which includes running 6 miles a day as well as swimmingb 50-75 laps. I am contemplating reducing the medicine as it effects my weight as well as giving me symptoms of depression.

I'm 51 and postmenopausal.  I take the Rx to eliminate unbearable night sweats. The primary side effect, for me, has been lack of energy resulting in slight weight gain.   I'm gradually decreasing my usage from daily to every-other-day or every third day.  I would like to eliminate usage within the third year. (The night sweats return when I stop using completely.) Hopefully the sweats will eventually stop on their own.  In the meantime, I've virtually eliminated alcohol and rich, spicy food from my diet - and I try not to eat any food at all prior to going to bed. This medication combo has been extremly helpful..... however I don't want to rely on it completely.  It's important to learn to manage the sweats on your own while weaning off the medication. &quot;Sweat Management&quot;

Other	suze, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	55-64	8/18/2009 1:08:23 PM	Post menopausal. Been through the patch systems that all seem inconsistent and uneven in the transdermal route over the course of a few days. Tried the daily approach but eventually ran into the same problem. Also, BIG drawback is that it takes a very long time to dry -- like smearing jam on your skin and waiting for it to dry. In addition, blood levels were good to begin with and then eventually tapered off, despite no change it dose, and constant site rotation. More research needed here.

I am using the lowest mg at this time. My hot flashes do not seem so severe as had been. I also take estradiol 1mg daily.  I think this may work along with exercise and nutrition.
