Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Male	45-54	8/28/2012 7:25:15 AM	My doctor switched me to Pristiq to help with energy and mood. At 50 mg a day, my spouse said she saw improvement. At 100 mg a day, it just dragged me down. Diarrhea, dizzy, lack of enery - just didn't work. Plus it is very expensive if you do not have insurance coverage. Switched to generic Effexor (non XR).  Less expensive and doing about the same depending on dosage. I recommend staying away from this if Effexor works for you.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/24/2012 10:53:38 AM	This is my first antidepressant. My doctor diagnosed me with depression, but I don't know if I'd call it that. I have anger issues. I think I believed everyone was out to screw me over. I didn't realize I felt this way until I started taking Pristiq. Pristiq really helped me calm down. My family thinks it's a miracle drug. The first couple of days I was a little dizzy, but ridiculously happy.. giddy. I woke up earlier and felt more active throughout the day. My side effects are decreased libido, headaches, and vivid, bad dreams. Throughout the day I'm happy, but at night my dreams bring back all of my angry feelings to an extreme. I've tried a couple times to wean myself off of Pristiq, but I get incredibly anxious, have terrible headaches, &quot;brain zaps&quot;, feel jittery, and am very intolerant to other people. Anything and everything makes me want to scream when I haven't taken my meds in a couple days. I'm only taking 50 mg a day, but would love to be able to stop. I'm concerned about the long term effects since it's a fairly new drug.

I don't feel anxious anymore but I am so tired. I have no appitite, food taste funny. My tounge has a weird sence with my taste buds almost like a tinny taste. My bones ache a little but probably old age. I will give it a month. I am trying to rebuild my own seratonin so I can get off all meds.

Getting ready to start pristiq again but need some advice  about the time of day to take the medicine. I noticed a positive change within the first two days after taking pristiq.  I took the medicine for two months and then stopped. the withdrawls were bad but i took a pill every other day for a week to wing myself off.   Great medicine and i'm fixing to begin taking it again.

Started out on 50MG, but my doctor upped it to 100MG. I am doing very well on this medication and didn't have any side effects at all. I also take Remron for depression every night a long with Ambien to help me sleep. I take vallium 5MG 3xday a long with Buspar 10MG 3xday and all these combination of medicines have worked very well for me. Tried several medications for my depression, but none of those has worked for me like Pristiq does. For those of you that want to take $15.00 a month off your co-pay go to pristiq.com and order their pristiq card. My insurance co-pay is $64.00 per month and now all I pay is $49.00. Not a huge savings but every little bit helps, because this savings pays for another prescription for me. Give Pristiq a try. It could be the right medication for you, because not everyone's body chemistry is the same. May God Bless You and I hope you find something that works for you like Pristiq has for me.

I had been on Zoloft 50 mg for years but it fizzled out overtime. When I cried all night because someone unfriended me online, I knew I had to do something. I saw my doctor, told him the deal, and he recommended Pristiq.  The first night, i had horrible insomnia. I switched to taking it in the morning and that has helped. I already feel happier with myself and not as irritated with others. It's early yet, but so far, so good.

After trying Zoloft and Celexa, I have found this to be a miracle. I have no problems taking this and no harsh side effects. However, if you do miss a dose, you will get severely dizzy and nauseated. I was on 50 mg at first, went to 100 mg, now back to 50 mg as I am trying to wean off all drugs from my body. It is a great medicine. It does have weight gain along with it. However, some people have no problem with this. All medicines effect people differently. It just happens that way. I have been on this for a year now. I am slowly coming off of it. I would recommend this before I would anything else I have ever taken. :)

Helped with concentration at work &amp; kept me calm. Overtime it stopped working &amp; I gained about 20lbs over a 9 month period which made me more depressed than before. No energy to do active things and it took away my creativity. I make a living as a designer so this was NOT good as it affected my work. Doctor is weaning me off &amp; the withdraw is unbearable!!! Insomnia, nauseated, brain zaps, vertigo, eye twitching, things moving when the are not...LOTS of horrible side effects! Cannot wait to be off of this med!

After a while though, I could get through the day, but anything would upset me. My anxiety sky-rocketed, I've become irritable with everyone and I would get mean and angry all the time. I also never want to get out of bed. No matter how long I sleep, I'm still tired.I didn't get sick from the drug, pretty much everything was mood related.

I'm not depressed but have no motivation to be active. No weight gain, but one side effect is 2 hrs after I take it (which is in the evenings) I get very moody. Makes me tired; however don't always sleep well at night.  Not sure if it's the med or not.

I noticed that my mood and outlook on life got alot better. I have a high stress job and it was starting to get to me. My Doc turned me on to this med and it has been good. Side effects are dry mouth a little constipation, and lots of yawning....

I took it before bed every night, and it helped lessen my anxiety daily.  However, about 7 months after starting it, my husband and I decided to try for baby #2.  Knowing that Pristiq was not the best drug to be on while pregnant, I consulted with my doctor and she suggested to wean off the drug over a few weeks, starting by cutting the pill in half.  Bad idea.  The next 3 months were complete hell.  The withdrawal symptoms made my anxiety worse, resulting in my throat &amp; nasal passages swelling up to the point where I was prescribed an inhaler and flonase to help with the issue - never had to use those in my life before.  Then the dizziness started, and the headaches.  I believe the headaches also helped detach my retina in my right eye, as I suffered the detachment about 2-3 weeks after reducing my dosages.  So, $58,000 later, I am not a happy camper, and would never recommend this drug to anyone who needs temporary help with anxiety.  This medication is definitely for patients with long term needs.

I've been taking Pristiq for almost 2 years and it has been great not crying every day because of my depression. I took Lexapro 20MG for about 2 years, but it wasn't working as well so the doctor added Abilify 15 MG to take with my Lexapro. I also took Xanax 0.5MG for axienty twice daily, which he upped to 4 times a day. That worked for a while, then I got worse again. I was changed to Pristiq50MG and gradually took off of Lexapro and Abiify. 50MG eventualy quit working and he upped it to 100MG. That's what I'm on now and it's working. I still have bad days, but not as frequently. The doctor also took me off of Xanax and added Buspar10MG 3 times a day, Valium5MG 3 times a day, Remeron45MG at bedtime and Ambien10MG at bedtime. The Pristiq wasn't what caused me not to be able to sleep. That's the way my depression affects me. For those of you that has had side effects from Pristiq was probably because it didn't agree with your system. I hope you find something that works for you like Pristiq has worked for me. I was out of Pristiq for a couple of days and I didn't have any withdrawls, but I did cry off and on for 2 days. Once I started back to taking it I was ok. I still have my bad days, but I don't think I will ever find anything that will be 100% effective for me. I just learn to go with the flow and hope that Pristiq will continue to work. For those of you that has to pay a co-pay for your Pristiq go to pristiq.com and they will send you a card to get 15.00 off your co-pay once a month for a year. My co-pay used to be 64.00, but now it's 49.00. I hope for the best for each one of you that goes through depression. May God Bless all of you.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Kira, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	6/11/2012 10:28:21 PM	I moved from 25mg Lexapro to 50mg Pristiq and I loved it. I lost about 10LB that I was unable to lose with Lexapro. The transition wasn't too bad, I had light flu symptoms for about a week. My OCD and recurrent thoughts were still not under control, so my doc up my dose to 100mg. I am in my first week and I am experiencing flu like symptoms, sadness, tiredness and anxiety. I am confident that these are &quot;transition side effects&quot; like the one I have experienced from Lexapro to Pristiq. We are all different. Work in close ocntact w your doc and stay positive, you will find something that works for you. Please do not get scared by online postings. Again, we are all different and medications affect us differently. Good luck to all!

Calmer about failing parents (both have cancer),able to cope with arranging their lives better, no more night sweats or hot flashes, no more PTSD symtoms, which I was dianosed with ten years ago. I can focus on pursuing a happy future now...
Major Depressive Disorder	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/2/2012 9:56:01 AM	I have been on pristiq for about a year. I started out with 50MG and my doctor upped it to 100MG once a day. I do feel better using it, but I also take buspirone, diazepam for anxienty and panic attacks. I take ambien and remeron to help me sleep. Without a combination of all of these I would be a complete mess. I still have a few days where I cry for no reason or if something upseting happens, but it would be worse without this medicine. I would also like to add that for those of you where you have a large co-pay with your insurance or have to pay out of pocket go to Pristq.com and sign for a card to get a discount on it. My insurance co-pay was 64.00 a month. With the 15.00 discount using this card I now pay 49.00 a month. A 15.00 discount on my pristiq has helped me a lot. I hope this review was helpful and good luck to all who goes through depression and anxienty. May God Bless each and everyone who suffers from these things.

I've been on Pristiq for 3 1/2 wks now and I've felt nothing but better. During the first week I did have a moderate (leaning towards severe) panic attack. But the drug has helped my outlook and energy in everday life. May have a slightly decreased interest in sex though. 
Depression	NeverAgainPristiq, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	2	5	1	Female	45-54	5/30/2012 4:56:42 PM	Pristiq is a medication that is extremely dangerous.  Once it is in your system it wraps itself around your brain and holds tight.  I became more depressed the longer I stayed on it.  If I stopped it for a day or two, I would feel better once I got back on it but I never felt physically or emotionally right on it either.  I always felt lightheaded, harder to put my thoughts in order and to actually express myself, had trouble sleeping and was, pressure in my head, nausea, as I said still depressed - even suicidal while on it and with another antidepressant added it was the same.  Awesomely horrific!

I wake up and have energy to face the day, I no longer cry at the drop of a hat.  I was on Wellbutrin for less than a week, I took myself off within 4 days, could not stop shaking, never slept more than 4 hours a day, felt like I was on speed, even if I took it early in am, needed help falling asleep.

At first I thought my prayers had been answered.  I felt so much better for about a month. Then, I started feeling horrible - headaches, nausea, and the depression was worse than it had ever been. My Dr. told me to take it every other day instead of every day. Still felt terrible, and stopped it about 10 days ago. The withdrawal has been just as bad, if not worse: headaches, nausea, diarrhea, constant crying. It has been pure hell!
Other	jlcarrier351, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	3/30/2012 9:00:03 AM	I took Lexapro for 6 years and my physician decided to switch me to Pristiq and I felt the Lexapro wasn't doing anything for me.  Took the Pristiq for 6 months, didn't notice anything different other than super crazy dreams!  I stopped by slowly decreasing my dosage and still feel the same, no withdrawals so far other than a few &quot;brain sparks&quot; but they are manageable.  I'm not impressed, especially for the price!

Bipolar Depression	ntucker99, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/23/2012 4:59:45 PM	With 200mg of Lamictal and 50mg of Pristiq, this is the most stable I have been.  Although not recommended by professionals, I cut the pill in half for the first 6 days.  I am glad I did as I only experienced mild stomach discomfort and a few headaches.  I am now up to fifty and slowly loosing weight.  After using all the recommended mood stabilizers, I packed on 30lbs in 2 years.  Seroquel is the worst.  Before starting Pristiq I was in a terrible mixed state, contemplating suicide everyday for weeks. I was high and low at the same time and irritable beyond belief.  This combination of these two drugs has saved my life so far.  Unfortunately everyone must be patient as you wade through all the drugs that are out there.  What works for one will not for others and sometimes you need combinations.  I have been at this for years now, so I know how frustrating and devastating mental illness and medication trials can be on your life and relationships.  Please don't give up.  I know it's tiring and hopeless at times, but by not giving up you will get there. Pristiq does significantly decrease your appetite, so make what you do eat count.  Fruits, veggies, and lean meats.  Remember to give your medication time to work, and the side effects (except for the decrease in appetite) should subside after a few days or few weeks.  If they don't please reach out to doctor to try something else.  Don't go cold turkey as this could really put you in physical or psychological danger.  I have stupidly gone cold turkey on Paxil and Cymbalta in the past.  I suffered major physical and psychological effects that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.  I would recommend Pristiq to others.  Again, stay strong and keep seeing a therapist.  Whatever you do, don't give up.  Many best wishes to everyone suffering.

Not sure whether or not it increased appetite but sure seemed to do so. Works well to control emotions and anxiety. The only downside would be that quitting this medicine is a holy terror. I quit cold turkey and was always extremely dizzy and zombie like. Of course, I should have known better than to go cold turkey. Scares me that something can affect a person that much which is why I quit taking it. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	3/14/2012 12:17:03 AM	I have been taking Pristiq for the past 7 months, after taking cipralex.  I switched off of cipralex due to high side effects and decreasing effectiveness (I was on this med for roughly 4 years.)  I then started taking  Pristiq at 50mg as my doctor suggested this drug may be very helpful for my anxiety because it is very similar to venflaxine which has numerous side effects.  I found that this switch was helpful and I had a great reduction in side effects.  By the end of roughly 3 months I saw a bit of a decrease in effectiveness so my doctor put me up to 100mg and that has since done the trick.  I am overall side effect free, though i am slightly shaky, however this could be due to my other medication Trazodone which I use as a sleep aid.
Major Depressive Disorder	animalfriend, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	3/12/2012 4:30:07 PM	After trying approximately 20 different meds over the past few years with little to no relief, I was diagnosed as having &quot;severe medication-resistant major depressive disorder.&quot; After hearing about awful options such as shock therapy, I was started on Pristiq 50 mg. once a day 6 weeks ago. It was WONDERFUL, and amazingly helped me within the 1st 2 days of treatment. Sadly, 2 weeks ago, the bottom fell out. I began having horrible headaches which no medication would relieve, nausea, constant crying, irritability, and extreme anger outbursts. I have felt worse than I did before taking ANY med. My supposed &quot;caring&quot; psychiatrist returned my phone call about this and was colder than an ice cube. He said he had never heard such complaints, and I told him about some of the reviews on this site which totally sounded like my experience. He now has me taking one every other day rather than every day. So, I'm still putting that poison into my system and going through withdrawal at the same time. I was offered nothing to help me through this. It has been a MAJOR disappointment since this med seemed to help so much at first, but then caused even worse problems. PLEASE DON'T TRY THIS MED!!!!!!

Bipolar Depression	gruntingtinyspots, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	3/4/2012 10:50:46 AM	I have been on this drug before with no side effects. However, this time I am experiencing severe drowsiness. It sucks! I am exhausted for no reason at all. I have slept for about 36 hours and I still feel the need for more sleep. I have a husband and 3 kids to care for so I will have to put in a call to my Dr. and see what else we can do...Like I said, I was on this before and it worked wonders. I stopped taking it because of the expense. But after being on other meds (cheaper) for a while and experiencing unacceptable side effects (incontinence), I decided that I needed to go back to what worked for me and figure out a way to pay for it. For some reason this time I am so so so tired. I am typing with my eyes closed right now. Why? Because they are burning! Ugh I cant do this! Especially since I am getting ready to start college again. I can't be this exhausted while trying to concentrate at school. When this med works it works well, at least for me it did. Unfortunately this time around I was not so lucky, I should have never stopped the med.

Major Depressive Disorder	abar, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/8/2012 11:19:59 AM	I felt as though I was falling apart, when I looked into the mirror, it had become fragmented and I couldnt put the pieces of myself together. I wasnt functioning, I was severely depressed and it was affecting everyone in my household. I knew in order to put my life back together, i needed help. The dr. prescribed me 50mg of Pristiq for two weeks. I started fo feel better, I had more energy and i was being more productive around the house and happier with my children. Two weeks later I went back and the dr. put me on 100mg of Pristiq. I still have minor anxiety but the depression has all but ceased. It is never easy asking for help, but depression doesnt care how old you are or nationality,or your gender, asking for help is the first phase in recovery. I would highly recommend this medication to someone who is suffering from depression and anxiety. It honestly has helped me pick up the pieces and now when i look in the mirror I see myself glancing back.  It feels good to be whole.

I can work through them now instead of panicking and staying stuck in one spot.I was really nauseous at first, probably for the first month of taking it, though.But coming off of it is really hard, making me dizzy and giving me headaches that only go away once I take the pill again. I have yet to stop taking them.
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	Cinders, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	1/20/2012 10:23:50 PM	I was on Paxil for over a year and was switched over to pristiq. I have been on Pristiq for 35 days now so just a little over a month.  I am stopping it due to severe side effects. I feel like I'm on speed, I cant slow down my energy level is so high I cant stay still and my mind is racing. The worst part is the dizziness that wont stop along with the headaches which start from when I wake up to the time I lay down to sleep at night which requires me to take a sleeping pill.  My anxiety level increased along with irritability, not sure if that was due to me having constant headaches. I cant seem to eat a meal without using the bathroom slightly after and that just started so the longer I am on this different side effects are starting. This is just not for me.  Good luck to the rest of you out there that are doing wonderful.

First 3-4 days made me feel drowsy, but no other side effects. Positive effects were noticed after about 4 weeks, particularly in work which had become a big problem. Lethargy, lack of interest and concentration have all improved a lot. Outside of work, appetite has improved and sleep patterns are starting to improve

I went from 50mg to 100mg within the first six months. After a year of 100mg I started to notice that I was depressed, extremely irritated and anxious. I have recently changed to cymbalta.

It has helped a lot with depression but after about a month I became anxious, especially in the morning.  I tried lowering the dose but then the depression comes back.  Also wake up at 3 am every night.  No other side affects except some loss of libido.

My Dr. prescribed me Wellbutrin to help stop the weight gain, I am praying that it works. The withdrawals from Pristiq are down right awful! Other than that, I have to say it did help with my major depressive symptoms.

I no longer cry over the smallest thing like I use to. I became depressed after having a few surgeries 6 months apart and I felt like I would never get better. I had no side effects at all. I would recommend this to anyone having depression.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	12/22/2011 2:06:27 AM	I definitely do not feel as depressed as I was when I first started taking this. I was on Welbutrin before and it blurred my vision so bad that I couldn't see anything I was looking at. I rarely cry anymore and the &quot;low&quot; days are fewer and farther away from each other than they were. I feel mentally like I can think more clearly (the cloud has lifted). I find humor in more things and have more motivation than I did.     One thing I did notice is that I feel achey sometimes, to the point where after standing for short periods of time, I get alot of pain in my lower back and legs. The only thing I can compare the pains and aches to are &quot;growing pains&quot;. Sometimes I think I have Fibromyalgia.       I am going to make an appt with my primary care doctor early next year and start looking into my symptoms. Another post on here said that they think Pristiq causes these aches and pains because when they stopped taking it, their body felt better. I am scared to stop taking this because it's the only anti-depressant that has somewhat worked for me. Also, if I don't take my dose (50mg) at the right time each day, I start to feel TERRIBLE (irritability, head has pressure, tension headache, can't concentrate). Once I take my dose I feel better within 45min-1hr. It's a love hate relationship right now so good luck to all of you. If you find you start feeling like you have symptoms of Fibromyalgia, it is probably Pristiq causing it.I am only 25 and too young to feel so weak and achey all of the time.

Pristiq has helped me stay calm and I'm very pleased about that! Still, I am reducing myself to just 50 mg a day because of one negative side effect: my hair is breaking and falling out like crazy! I remember this happening with Paxil a few years ago too (which my doc put me on for high blood pressure!) and once I stopped taking it, my hair grew in lush and healthy. I think 50 mg a day will be fine and eventually I'll wean myself off it completely.

I am on day 3 of Pristiq, day 1- moderate nausea more relaxed, day 2 - mild nausea, relaxed, day 3 - mild jittery,but okay. I am going stick this one out and hope for luck. Remember don't think about what you read here, many people put in their minds what they read here. You have to give it a chance, with any of them.

Afew days after taking it I began to have anxiety attacks. After talking to my doctor I went down to 50mg daily. I stopped having the anxiety attacks but i kept feeling more and more depressed. After drinking heavily one night, I woke up having suicidal thoughts. They continued to the next day and I ended up in the emergency room.  I have been off the medication for about 2 weeks and I still don't feel completely better.  If you are thinking about taking this please be careful.

I tried Lexapro at first - didn't do anything for me.  I'm on 150mg/day of pristiq.  I DO NOT like the expense, as my insurance only covers part of the cost. Yet, I hesitate to change because it has been so effective for me.  I missed one dose, one time - this drug has a very short 1/2 life.  Don't miss a dose! By about hour 25 of it not being in my symptoms, my withdrawl began and was horrible!  However, once I realized I missed a dose, I took it &amp; within a few hours I was fine.  I have had an increase in headaches - not sure if it's stress or the drug.  It has worked great for me - but I am considering changing due to the cost.

I just started taking pristiq 50mg and I noticed a complete change after the first day! It's helped me control my emotions enough to think about things more clearly so I can handle everyday problems in life. It's also helped me, to stop thinking about what other people think about me, so I can be myself.

Dr upped dose to 100mg...This sent me into a downward spiral of depression. After 2 weeks on 100mg I lowered my dose back to 50mg and I've leveled out. I'm still not 100% but I'm going to give it time to see if it gets better. Only other side effects were mild nausea for the 1st 2 days on both the 50 and 100mg doses.

I have been having horrible headaches that no medicine will relieve. Most recently I am not sleeping, dizzy, and nauseated. I am diabetic and just beginning a new drug for that that is keeping my sugars in control. I'm thinking my depression could be worsened by my sugar and I may not need the Pristiq.

We tried increasing it and I had anxiety issues. PLEASE, see a psychiatrist and not a family doctor for deression and anxiety. PLEASE find a doctor, a psychiatrist, who knows ALL the mood drugs and knows the crucial things you say to know how to adjust your medicine. GO TO THE PRISTIQ SITE TO GET A DISCOUNT CARD FOR A YEAR.

Then the depression started to return so my Dr raised me to 100 mg.  This did not help the depression.  I became so exhausted and craved carbs badly.  I gained 20 lbs in 4 months on this med.  My DR has now switched me to the new Viibryd which is not suppose to have the weight gain as a side effect. I will believe it when I see the scale not moving.  
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	10/11/2011 6:39:44 PM	This medication gives me an extremely rapid heartbeat, makes me feel more anxious than usual, unusual sweating, very vivid &quot;bad&quot; dreams,  i get dizzy spells and also have a hard time catching my breath. I also experienced a suicide attempt and I feel that this medication is to blame. 
Depression	slumgullian, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	65-74	10/9/2011 8:28:14 PM	This is the worst drug I have ever taken due to weight gain that I cannot loose after discounting the med,  I gained 19 lbs in 5 monthstaking 50mg.  I switched, on the advice of my doctor, to Wellburturn 150mg.  My calorie intake has been 900 per day.  I have NOT loss a pound after two months on Wellburturn.  Never steem to get hungry on this Rx.  Why no weight loss?

I have been on Wellbutrin 150 mg and it works great for depression plus takes away my HUNGER.   I am eating 600 cal. per day and have NOT lost one pound after two months.  Why is that?  How is this problem possiable?
Depression	playdoh447, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	10/8/2011 3:23:10 PM	I started 50mg of Pristiq a little over a month ago and it has helped my depression and anxiety. I feel rested when I get up and I feel over all more positive. I did have headaches almost daily for the first 2 weeks and they have gone away. I also would wake up at weird times at night and be wide awake. That has gone away. My dr just raised my dose to 100mg a day. My only 2 complaints are I have gained some weight. It is making me want to eat everything. And it is expensive. I have been on just about every other antidepressant over the last 15 years and this one is pretty good so far. I have not had the low libido on Pristiq like I have on other antidepressants. So that is a plus. I am overall happy with Pristiq. I just need to get a handle on the weight gain.

However, some of the side effects are very difficult to live with.  I have very little libido and don't really even like for my husband to touch me...I find it annoying now.  I experience alot of sweating, weight gain, and very bad headaches.  It also seems like my temper is worse.  So I feel almost trapped...I'm either paralyzed by panic or kept hostage by the medication...it's so frustrating!

With pristiq, I was able to work, drive, etc and the panic attacks all but ceased. But now I am having a life threatening allergic reactiin to this much needed medication. I broke out in severe hives, became dizzy, and my lips abd tongue began to swell. My psychiatrist told me I should immediatley discontinue taking pristiq. I did as I was told. I ended up in our local delta center. I am currently still fighting to stay &quot;sane&quot;. Pristiq has benefitted me more than it has harmed me. Please trust me when I say that you do not want to ever come off of it like I had to un order to save my life. An allergy can develop at any time with any medication. But I have failed to find a medication that has profitted me as much as this one did.

Besides mild stomach distress once in a while I have not experienced any other adverse effects. I am happier and I have much more energy. The weight I gained when on Cymbalta is slowly decreasing which I am very happy about. Pristiq also has a positive effect on my libido which was almost Zero while on Prozac. Overall this seems to be a great drug for people who react well to this type of AD.
Bipolar Depression	mari5826, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	8/31/2011 1:07:37 AM	I am a female in my late 50's and when I took Pristiq, my hair started falling out a lot.  I didn't notice it until after a few months and realized that it was not just the normal hair loss we should have every day.  The top and sides of my hair have thinned out a lot.  I stopped taking it and went back to Cymbalta and it's been about 3+ weeks now back on Cymbalta and no more hair is falling out, so it definately was the pristiq.  I wanted to be sure before I said this.  I noticed that several other people said the same, that their hair fell out.The medication does have a very bad &quot;chemical&quot; smell to it (the pilldoes).I also use HRT (hormone replacement, but have used that for years without my hair falling out.) It may be that the combination of the two is the problem.  I will never know, but wanted to advise people of what happened to me. Good luck.Also, it did work me for me ok as far as how I was feeling while taking it, but it's not worth loosing all my hair over, while there is other med. I can take, like Cymbalta.

Depression	Butterieflie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/26/2011 5:55:26 PM	First major depressive episode.  Started w/ Lexapro - did not work (stopped the crying, but that is all), psychiatrist put me on 25 mg for 2 weeks, then to 50 mg.  After about 6 weeks, upped it to 100 mg/day....now on 150 mg./day.  Insurance won't cover more than 100mg/day.  Works great for me, considering.... it's a drug, there will be side effects, but nothing major.  I seem to have &quot;slipped&quot; a bit in the feel-good department. I don't know if I've developed a tolerance, or menopause or what (I'm 40) have been on this drug for about a year &amp; 1/2.  Feel like myself most days, but do have some increased anxiety and don't handle stress too well...but all in all, works pretty darn good. 
Major Depressive Disorder	Grateful, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	8/26/2011 9:42:24 AM	It is the only medication that has worked for me longer than  a year.  I have been on it all Prozac, Effexor, etc.   My overall feeling of well being is much greater on Pristiq than anything else.  Recently tried going off and going on Cymbalta and after one month returned to Pristiq.  Took about one week and all of a sudden I found I was actually sleeping all night through and did not have a loggy feeling when I awakened the next morning.  My energy level increased and I could think clearer and even had the concetrative ability to finish a book! You do have to have help if you are going to stop taking it as the side effects can be troublesome for about three days.  Love my Pristiq

Depression	jenn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	35-44	8/24/2011 4:17:50 PM	I have been on and off antidepressants for the past 10 years.. I was put on Pristiq about 4 years ago after suffering from Panic Attacks and feeling a little depressed.  I took 50 mg daily.. I found that if you didn't take it on the 24 hour mark, the withdrawals started immediately.  I gained 10-15 pounds and after four years felt it wasn't working, or could be causing increased agitation.  I also felt that I became a home body which I never was..  I tried to go off the medicine cold turkey.. SICK... I then cut them and weened off slowly over a long period of time.  I found my senses (hearing/smelling) were immediately changed.. Everything was loud. Everything smelled.  The electrical shocks were unbearable.  Nausau.. Acid reflux was painful.  It has been two months since I stopped taking it and I feel better emotionally, but still physically suffering.. Also, after two weeks after taking it I started having chronic pain throughout my body, to the point of tears and not being to function..  I thought this would pass.. I went to the docs and have now been diagnosed with fibromyalgia..  It is horrible and I am in constant pain.  I've never had this much pain and I know for certain that I did not have this before taking PRistiq.

I am extremely happy with this as I have had ZERO side effects.  I dont even feel like I am on anything and that is what you want. I just feel normal, not stressed nor do I feel lazy. Once it is in your system its great. The one thing you have to remember is not to skip a dose, sometimes I run out and take a couple days to fill it and I can literally feel it.  I get very tired, headache and can feel my heartbeat in my fingertips. If you are going to stop this definitely do so gradually.My overall opinion of this is its great when you take it as prescribed, I'm extrememly happy my doctor suggested this for me.

Could not be bothered to do anything important and felt like a zombie that was unable to fell or express emotion. Work quality plummeted. Been taking 100mg for a month now and no longer feel indifferent but it's still hard to stay happy or be excited about much. I've also developed horrible upper stomach aches due to unrelenting gas that is not responding to over-the-counter medicines.

As long as I take my anxiety meds with it like I am supposed to, I get to lead a normal life for the first time in decades. I am 55 and was diagnosised as a Marjor Depressive at 15.

Mild nausea and feeling jittery subsided after a few days. Overall mood is better, more energy and focus. No other side effects so far. Prozac has helped my depression but made me extremely fatigued. Pristiq has been great so far...I actually get out of the bed at 6am... :)
Depression	Bogey5, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/2/2011 5:13:09 PM	Just a little background. I suffered a severe neck injury( 3 surgeries) that rendered me disabled way before my time. Became depressed after I had to resign my job and give up golf and other activities that I loved. I tried several other meds but between the constant pain of my injury and the depression I could barely get out of bed.My Dr. put me on wellbutrin at first and it helped for awhile before I fell back into a rut. Then he suggested 100 mg prestiq ALONG with the wellbutrin and everything just clicked. I know that this may be an strange combo but I also know that it has worked wonders for me ! I have proof every morning as my first hour of the day is still brutal  until the medication takes hold.I now have the energy and resilience to face each day in a positive manor.A little wordy here but if I can help just one person it's worth the extra typing. I now have a renewed and much needed energy level and feel light years better than I had before.
Major Depressive Disorder	Still hopeful, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	35-44	8/1/2011 6:46:59 PM	Pristiq..  If you want a ride you'll never want to experience ever again, try Pristiq. At 50mg I felt terrible, aggitation, skin crawling, uncertain, like I wasn't even in my own self. (Not sure how else to describe, but if you had this feeling, you understand)  Doctor increased dosage to 100mg, you know, maybe more is better?  Following his advice, I increased the dosage.  Within 4 days, I wanted to die.  My head was dizzy, my ability to talk coherently had diminished, my body felt like I was going to just crawl and die within my own skin.  Suicide definetly became an option and I didn't try, but I didn't want to live either.  I'm no longer on Pristiq nor would I recommend it to anyone, not even my worst enemy.  In the past, I've been on Prozac, Effexor (which was almost, but not quite as bad as Pristiq was for me), Wellbutrin, Lexapro, and Paxil.  Have been on anti-depressants now for 14 years.  Lexapro worked best, but couldn't afford, after I had no insurance.  Prozac worked for 7 years and am not sure why I was taken off.  Doctor said it was for my best interest, and like a dumb fool, I didn't question.  I trusted and 7 years later, I'm still on the roller coaster.  But as for Pristiq, make sure you have doctor who knows what they are doing when prescribing.  Pristiq is or was NOT good for me at all.

I felt great with Pristiq, without the lethargy produced by the others.    However, the one side effect I did get has been traumatic and permanent - big bald spots on my scalp, with an irritation that felt like ants crawling over it.   Stopped Pristiq about 6 months ago, after reading a blog with many patients complaining about the same reaction, but still have no hair growth.  As a woman in her 50s, this has been almost worse than the original depression!   This should definitely be listed as a side effect, since so many of us have suffered from it.  Now I get depressed looking at my hair - or rather, scalp!

No reduced libido or other major side effects.  Pristiq was a much better choice than Lexapro (for me) and I wish I had the option to try it sooner.  Losing the weight made me feel better about myself (being overweight perpetuated the depression).
Major Depressive Disorder	vivbellecart, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	7/13/2011 2:35:19 PM	I was taking Effexor for about 2 years and it worked real well until I had a baby and that threw my body chemistry out of order.  My doctor suggested Pristiq because other patients that weren't completely satisfied with Effexor did better on Pristiq.  She started me at 100mg, which to my understanding is higher than average. My experience so far has been very positive.  I am feeling much better and it really helped me with avoiding my Effexor withdrawals.  I like this better to because its still XR, but it's a pill rather than a capsule.  I'm hoping this will continue to become my new &quot;happy pill&quot;.
Major Depressive Disorder	bypolarbear, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	7/13/2011 12:23:42 PM	After completely not tolerating Celexa, my doctor switched me to Pristiq, which I have been taking for 6 days now. I'm still completely exhausted all the time; right after taking the pill in the morning, clear through the night. Already dealing with the effects of Celiac's Disease (gluten free), my stomach pains are more intense, frequent, and disabling than my normal. I've had a headache nearly every minute of it, also more severe than usual. My body aches, and I'm hypersensitive to all light and sound. My brain either feels like it's screaming, or completely zombie-blank. I've been told that I'm extremely quiet, and somewhat non-responsive to conversation.Today, day 6, has been the first day I've noticed any lightening of mood. Getting out of bed this morning for work was, for the first time in a while, actually a pleasant task. I haven't had the usual bombardment of depressive thoughts and emotions that I usually experience throughout the day. However, my brain feels so strange that I can barely focus on the fact that I'm having less negative thoughts.I'm staying on Pristiq for the month trial that my doctor gave me, but then we'll see. I've read too much about the horrible withdrawal symptoms and side effects in general to think this medicine will be worth continuing. 
Depression	Lou44, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	7/13/2011 5:48:58 AM	Have been taking pristiq for a few months now. Started off on 50mg, not too bad. Went up to 100mg, but was still having episodes of severe depression. Now up to 150mg, will see how i go. Have had no side effects, which is good. Other anti-depressants just stopped working for me. Took Zoloft for years, then Cymbalta, now Pristiq.

Depression	Lynn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	55-64	7/11/2011 11:27:03 PM	 This medication has helped with depression.  I want to get up and do housework and other activities. Also I believe it has helpeddecrease some of my pain in my hands and legs.  After taking the Rx I could see a difference in two weeks.
Depression	Depressed, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	7/10/2011 6:31:12 AM	I have taken Zoloft,Prozac and other Antidepressants,the all did not work.I am now taking Pristiq.Starting with 50mg each once a day,then went to 100mg once a day.I did feel better in the beginning,but taking Pristiq now for over one year,the side effects are terrible.Blurry Vision,Weight gain,tired all the time but can not sleep,Horrible Migraines and no Sex drive.My Bones are killing me.Dizziness is also another factor.My Doctor prescribed Cymbalta,but then he said I should not take it since it would interfere with the Pristiq.I am tired of being tired all the time,no energy,can't sleep,getting dizzy,no sex drive,and I can not even remember things anymore.I want to get rid of all this.So I will take a chance on the Cymbalta.Lord only knows if this is the right way to go.No matter what,there will be always some side effects with any medications I think. 
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	SilentArcher, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	13-18	7/8/2011 3:39:47 PM	This was the only anti depression med that worked for a few months and of course, like it always does, it fizzled out for me and doesn't work. I'm going to handle my depression without all these drugs, because I've been on EVERY SSRI and this is the first SNRI and it's time to cut the meds. 
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	6/19/2011 11:45:38 PM	My doctor (family practitioner) prescribed me Pristiq 1 1/2 years ago as I was dealing with anxiety, panic attacks, and depression resulting from an overload of stress. The drug worked pretty well for me during the time I needed it. I started on 50mg for a month and went to 100mg which I've been on for over a year. It seemed while I was taking it I was more angry, had decreased libido, trouble sleeping, and lack of appetite, but I was feeling more like I was in control of my depression. When I moved last year my new doctor (psychiatrist this time) diagnosed me with adult ADHD which is most likely my depression/anxiety culprit. The Focalin I was treated with evened me out, but then the Pristiq made me more anxious. I've been coming off Pristiq for several months, and it's HARD! I've almost kicked it a couple times but then I get weird random twitches, crying spells and mood swings. I've been sleeping a LOT better, and have found more energy. I've gone from 100mg to 50mg, then to 25mg. I've tried taking them every other day, but then it really interfered with my sleep patterns. I'm finding to get off of this drug takes a LOT of time and good pill cutter.

Depression	Lbfluffy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	6/12/2011 8:28:18 PM	I first was on the 50 mg. I felt okay, but still somewhat depressed.I also started getting migraines. After a month my doctor switched me to 100 mg. She said if I continued to get migraines then I would need to be taken off of the medication. Since going up to 100 mg, I have had a headache daily and a migraine at least once a week. I called my dr and she instructed me to get off the meds. I am scheduled to see her in a couple weeks. I have been off the meds for four days, but now I have been dizzy, but my headaches are not as frequent. I have also gained about 15 pounds since starting this medication. Not a good medication for me.
Depression	Jane, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	55-64	6/12/2011 6:39:07 PM	The first two months of taking Pristiq helped and I thought this was the right medication.  Like most people who suffer from depressive orders, I have tried many medications.  I am starting my 3rd month of medication and I am completly lethargic, constantly fighting the desire to sleep while driving and  have gained weight.  I am going to have to switch again, must to my dismay.

I didn't feel like it helped the depression; instead, it left my personality &quot;flat&quot;. Side effects were high blood pressure and extremely high choloesterol. I finally came off this drug which is tough to do. I was completely bed-ridden with flu-like symptoms for 4 days. VERY dizzy, emotional and had &quot;brain zaps&quot;. Felt much better after getting through the 4 days (went off the drug completely-did not wean off). I feel like I am more alive and involved in life now. It was hard, but worth getting off what I think is a terrible drug!!

It has been 5 days at 50mg and I still feel numb, tired, painful.  I am being treated for fibromyalgea, ADD,depression and anxiety.  Has anyone out there found this medication helpful for all these disorders? I have been on many medications over the last twenty years and really am looking for one that could help with all my disorders?
Major Depressive Disorder	kenrn55, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	2	Male	55-64	6/2/2011 9:03:06 AM	I'm a 55 year old man with major depressive disorder and also taking Victoza for my Diabetes Type II.  You all need to be aware that many anti-depressants don't mix well with Victoza.  I tried Cybalta two different times, and both times it caused me to vomit about nine hours after taking a pill.  When I tried Celexa it also made me nauseous, so my Doctor said we'd try Pristiq.  I began taking 50 mg - and fortunately didn't have any reaction with the Victoza.  But I went for two months without much improvement to the depression.  So two weeks ago my Doc upped the dose to 100 mg per day - I'm still depressed; the Pristiq has only numbed me out a bit - that's all.  I hate being this way and I hope my Psych doctor can come up with a better medicine for me to take.  I've been suffering from depression for far too long.  Therapy isn't helping either.  I want my life back.  In the past I've tried just about all other meds - Effexor, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Sertiline (sic), and many others.  They all worked for short periods then became ineffective.  Cymbalta also worked before I began taking Victoza for my Diabetes.  But Victoza really has helped me - I've lost about 50 lbs in the past year and my AC1 has gone down to 5.6 - an amount unheard of for Diabetic patients (it's usually 6.1 or above).  So I don't want to go off Victoza.  There must be something that can treat this insidious disease.  Hopefully, working with my Doctor we'll come up with something.

The drug works very well and has eased my conditions dramatically.  A word of caution - if you go on it, it is VERY hard to go off of.  If I go 36 hours without taking it, I get extremly dizzy to the point of not functioning.  
Depression	harrietwinger@yahoo.com, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female		5/27/2011 10:08:31 PM	I was given some sample packets of Pristiq for a personalproblem.  My experience was ok at first, but I began gaining weight in spite of exercize and dieting on a 1,5oo calorie a day plan.  I gained a total of 35 pounds over the past few years and finally understanding it wasn't old age or a slowing of my metabolism.(i'm a 75 year old female)  I'm now suffering through withdrawal side effects with the help of Wellbutrin.  This drug should be taken off the market or a better warning given in the literature!Even now when I looked up Pristig on WEB MD, large weight gains are not reported and mosr of the bad reviews list &quot;weight gain&quot; as a problem.  I, too, have experienced anger and bad dreams, but never thought it was Pristiq. My blood pressure went up along with leg and ankle swelling.   The reviews have really enlightened me!'

I just wish - i could get some samples since - they are expensive - even with insurance still high.  Right now i am at 100 mg a day.

I have been SOOO happy with the results. The only issue is with sexual side-effects which have not subsided after more than 6 months on Pristiq. My anxiety and social phobia issues are almost completely gone. I have reduced my Xanax use to almost none. I have also been able to reduce my use of Trileptal by 33% (1800 mg to 1200 mg). My goal has been to reduce meds if possible AND improve my condition and Pristiq has allowed me to do that. Thank heavens!
Depression	spuff, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/21/2011 10:23:19 AM	First let me say I do not have any other mental conditions but Major Depressive Disorder since my teens (I am 52). I have been on many different antidepressants including several years on Prozac, then Effexor, also tried Wellbutrin for a time. Each one got a little better in helping my symptoms. But Pristiq has been the best of all. The only complaint I have (I am on 50 mg. for the last two years) is blurry vision, besides some low libido (which is possibly due to menopause or would be there anyway!) I feel very well most days but I believe a tolerance of some sort develops with all meds so am going to ask about 100 mg. I am starting to have what I call &quot;breakthrough&quot; symptoms like I had with all meds: more crying, sleep problems, and low energy/motivation. I know my symptoms well and don't want to wait til it gets to suicidal thoughts. Still, this medication is wonderful. Don't miss the 1970's and the awful tricyclics or other meds that were tried.

I felt like I could concentrate and had tons of energy. Then after approx 2 months I began to feel very irritable and was constantly anger. Told Doc who upped the dose to 100 mg thinking maybe the dose wasn't high enough. This is somewhat better but I am still very irritable and get angry easily. Plus now I am also very anxious to the point of wanting to avoid others, going out, etc. I am not pleased with the overall longterm effect of this drug.

I asked to be switched and was put on Pristiq, which put on another 10+ lbs! I have always been a very slender woman and now am overweight for my height?!!  When I have tried to titrate off of this, I am so sick... dizzy, nauseous, headaches, etc. The side effects are NOT worth ANY of the benefits of this rx!!!
Depression	Tearless, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/12/2011 10:19:47 AM	Depression is the last illness I wanted. No matter how hard I tried to ignore it, counsel it and/or medicate it. Until Pristiq I couldn't control it or stop it from happening,the harder I tried to control it the more depressed I got. Since I started taking Pristiq my life is more normal! I wish it would cost less, maybe more people could afford to appreciate the benefits of taking this product.

Bipolar Depression	sabzzz, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	13-18	5/8/2011 10:17:21 PM	When I first started taking this medication, about 30 minutes after taking it I became dizzy &amp; experienced &quot;tripping&quot; like symptoms. My heart would also feel as though it was beating out of my body &amp; very quickly. So i began taking it at night before i went to sleep. About three weeks after I began use, I noticed I had extreme anger at the simplest things. It was almost uncontrollable. I am still taking Pristiq &amp; If i miss one dose, the following day I have flu like symptoms. I also constantly become over heated &amp; sweat like I never have, being a person whom was always cold. I also now have uncontrollable mood swings &amp; will have crying spells for no apparent reason.I've been on it for 2 months and have yet to find a pro.

I started on 100mg dose and was able to decrease to 50mg. My life situation has not changed so the only thing I can contribute to my improved sense of wellbeing has been this medication. I don't seem to experience anyside effects. I am a 63 yeaar old female and have been on antidepressants since about 35 years of age.If you are considering something to take, at least give Pristiq a try.

My doc prescribed it to boost my Lexapro.  A month or so after taking it I started getting severe pain in my left thigh.  It is a searing, hot, stabbing pain.  But, it only flares up at night while I am sleeping.  At first these episodes were once every 2-3 weeks.  Now it is 2-3 times a week.  And I my left thigh constantly hurts and is tender to the touch.  I am not sure if the Pristq is the cause of this.  I also take Methadone for chronic back pain, and take heart medicine.  It has helped me feel better overall.  I just wish I knew what was causing this terrible pain in my leg.

With this drug, my symptoms are controlled well and the mouth side effects that occurred with other anxiety medications have gone away.  With other medications, I have had either severe dry mouth or uncontrollable tongue twitching.  I do feel more drowsy on Pristiq, but will take that problem over the mouth ones.

I am only on 25mg daily and from what I have read you can go into the 100's for a better turnout-I am wondering why I am being lied to or if they feel that I just do not need to go to that next level???

Anxiety symptoms have substantially decreased since I started Pristiq.Initially took 100mg in morning but was too drowsy to work so my MD changed my dose to bedtime.  My side effects are mild nausea, irritability and drowsiness.  Since dose increase I have had very vivid dreams.  Still taking 0.5mg Ativan up to 2x daily for acute anxiety symptoms.Happy to report that I have not experienced any sexual side effects with Pristiq.

Many side effects hastened my getting off of this one. Side effects included lack of concentration, stomach aches, strange dream, nervousness and strangely enough the lack of clear vision. The effects of getting off this medication are severing. I am know as Mr. Calm and collective but found myself being set off by things that would normally have no effect on me. I recommend not starting it at all, if you do make sure you ask someone who knows you to observe your actions closely.

Been having brain zaps and the second day I didn't take it I was upset to my stomach, so I'm actually happy I didn't increase the dosage.  Seems like there's no anti-Depressant for me I'm better off with nothing at all.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	3/31/2011 11:43:26 PM	I was on pristiq 50mg and it worked somewhat ok for about 6 months, but then it seemed to stop working as effectively so my dr switched me to 100mg. It caused severe panic attacks, which I had never had before, and bad sexual side effects. I would not recommend the 100mg dose.
Depression	delaney, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	3/30/2011 1:03:21 PM	I took this drug with minimal improvement, but relatively speaking, it was a vast improvement over my non-medicated depression when Zoloft stopped working.  However, overall I was not pleased, as it was a crapshoot from day to day how I would feel mentally - good or bad.  Physically, the brain zaps I would get became more and more problematic.  I would encourage anyone who is considering going OFF this drug to do so under the supervision of a doctor and do it gradually.  The brain zaps got to be so bad I honestly thought I might be having an aneurysm (sp?) or something. This drug doesn't mess around, but too bad it didn't help me in the long run.

This was an incredible change for me. After being on Pristiq for 6 months I am trying to slowly stop using it with my Dr's supervision. The changes since taking this medicine are good and bad. Good that it helped with my anxiety but bad when my sleeping went from 8 hours to 12 and 14 hours at a time. On the weekends the only thing I want to do is sleep. The weight gain is not the best either. Six months and I've gained almost 10 LBS. UGH! 
Depression	soonerbaby, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	35-44	3/20/2011 9:09:59 PM	I begain taking this medication almost 2 years ago.  It has made a huge difference in my life.  I was at the point that I was crying every day and feeling so overwhelmed by the smallest tasks such as getting up, deciding what to wear, what to eat.  My hormones felt out of control, my menstrual cycles were irregular, and I was on a rollercoster of emotions.  One minute elated and the next in a deep dark hole.  I finally got to a breaking point and visited my gynocologist to do anything she said if I could just feel normal.  She put me on this.  Within days of starting the medication, my emotions leveled out.  My outlook on life became more stable and upbeat. Within a couple of months, my menstrual cycles became more regular and my severe acne cleared up.  A mother of a young child and stressfull job, this medication has saved me.  So far, I have not had any sife effects that I am aware of.  I did at one point in time miss a dose and was an emotional basket case the next day.  Needless to say, I have not missed any since then.  And life is good.  I would recommend researching and talking to your doctor, but this has been a great thing for me.
Major Depressive Disorder	LKP, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	3/19/2011 8:51:01 PM	Pristiq was a lifesaver for me.  I was previously on Effexor for 3+ years and went off it when it became ineffective.  Within 3 days of starting Pristiq, I felt normal again.  I could get out of bed, function, work....participate in life!  Pristiq allowed me to feel like myself again.  The only side effects I experienced were 1) decreased appetite (only lasted a few weeks), 2) headaches, 3) persistent dry mouth/thirst, 4) major dizziness when I miss a dose or run out (similar to any other antidepressant).  The benefits well outweigh the side effects!  
Depression	cakelady, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	3/17/2011 11:11:03 AM	I started taking this med (as a last resort)about 4 months ago for depression/anxiety. I had also tried Welbutrin, Lexapro, Celexa, Zoloft and a few others that didn't work.  At first, this was a great drug with mild side effects for me. While the depression/anxiety are pretty much gone (this is great news) however, I am completely apathetic. Now I'm to a point where I'm falling asleep while driving to work. My body is constantly aching somewhere different (mostly neck and arms), I have a chronic skin infection on my scalp and genital region, very odd dreams (when I can sleep), night sweats and absolutely NO SEX DRIVE! My memory is a complete mess. Can't remember simple words, what I had for lunch yesterday or pieces of conversations that just happened. I'm afraid this is going to start effecting my job!  I crave every kind of food imagineable...I think I've gained 10 pounds since I started this med. I'm not an overweight person but since starting, everytime I eat my belly gets so distended, I look pregnant! Not sure whether or not to recommend this med to others...

The first few days I felt like I drank a lot of coffee, but after I got through that I've been able to feel &quot;normal.&quot; A consistent happy that was left out with the other drugs and the depression would be back in a few months. I've been very impressed with this drug and I don't have any side effects with it either!
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	mella, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	55-64	3/13/2011 3:07:38 PM	I have been on Pristiq for two weeks now and am experiencing serious anxiety.  Doctor who was on call told me to stop it immediately. I am so tired of trying different meds and not having one work. Thank God for xanax because when I get these bad episodes, I need something to take the edge off.

Major Depressive Disorder	Annette S., 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	3/11/2011 7:19:39 PM	I had tried other antidepressants over the 19 years I've been on them.  Some gave me side effects such as dry mouth and high blood pressure, so to find one that I can use long term took a while. When I was put on Pristiq, I immediately experienced energy and my mind was able to think clearly, as before I could not make decisions. When my dosage was changed, somehow the doctor hadn't reported the change, thus I was taking two at a time. Soon I ran out, and had to use my prior medication for a time, and I was not a happy camper. Now, the dosage is corrected and I find Pristiq works miracles for me. I also have a therapist on a regular basis, and haven't been in the hospital in over five years! Therapy works well along with my medication, so I make sure I get to my appointments! Thanks for making Pristiq!

Depression	nursern59, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/3/2011 12:04:43 PM	I was on Paxil for along time 20 mg then I was increased to 40 mg. I still was feeling depressed and having anxiety and mood swings so my doctor put me on Cymbalta which was horrible for me! I had panic attacks and mood swings it was awfull. So Im on prisiq now which I love it has changed my whole life for the better! It started working so quick!
Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	3/2/2011 2:37:00 PM	My doctor prescribed PRistiq because I was having anxiety attacks and was majorly depressed. At the same time I have ADD, so motivation has always been a problem for me. Before taking Pristiq I had to take another dose of Adderall to help me complete tasks in the afternoon. I stopped needed that extra dose and noticed a significant change in motivation. I was able to finish doing what I needed to do at the end of the day. However, for work requiring heavy concentration, Adderall is still the way to go. Pristiq also did not seem to help with my anxiety. I still feel scared or nervous for no reason, and that just makes my depression worse sometimes. The side effects are also an issue. If I miss a dose I feel extremely light-headed and nauseous, so make sure you always have refills handy. Also, I have absolutely no sex drive, and sometimes my boyfriend and I can't do it because I am just too dry. It hurts. I started going to a psychiatrist instead of my family doctor, and he said Pristiq is the culprit for the sex problem. He's slowly taking me off Pristiq and starting me on Wellbutrin. We'll see how that goes.

Syndrome I believe this is what was happening with my body, I do not recommend taking this drug with ANYTHING ELSE!

Depression	praiseHim, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/23/2011 12:46:42 PM	praise God, after 10 years I finally found an antidepressant that works. I have been on pristiq for 4 months but noticed the difference right away. I have tried many others and none have been this effective. I have noticed that I still can feel emotions on this drug as oppossed to just being drugged out and sleepy on others. I have not cried or been able to be emotional at all on the others. This along with Gods word has saved me from depression that had turned suicidal.

(level my emotions), I found two effects that I was not happy with. 1) I found keeping my weight down very hard and I gained some 5 lbs. with ease. Even with consistent exercise. I still gained. Did this occur with  anyone else? Also, I could not see myself staying on this Rx forever and wanted the ability to stop and start as needed.  The side effects were very dramatic, (tinitus, dizziness) resulted.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/14/2011 11:34:03 AM	Pristiq has really helped my depression and anxiety.

Major Depressive Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	2/13/2011 7:19:24 PM	I have taken 10 pills and I'm not really sure how I feel. I was hoping by this time I would either be in love with it or hate it. I've read so many of the reviews on here and it seems that everyone has an immediate reaction. The first couple of days I was going 100 miles an hour, but in a positive way. I ran 5 miles, cleaned the house, got some studying done and was back to my old self. Gradually since then I have become more anxious but not to the point of an anxiety attack or anything (like I had a year ago). Side effect wise I yawn often and get headaches about an hour before it is time for me to take my medicine. I take it at night and I always wake up ready to go the next morning. My suicidal thoughts are still there but not as constant, but there is definitely not a bright light of hope appearing yet. Maybe it is a good sign that I haven't lost my mind and that the drug will progressively make me feel better? Not sure yet. 
Panic Disorder	morskica,  Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male		2/12/2011 5:15:41 PM	I just started taking this med about four days ago. I would like to know how long does it take to ease panic attacks. I also take klonopin but the combo makes it hard to stay alert in the day.Does anyone take it at night? How long does the effect of drug start working?
Depression	pal, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	35-44	2/11/2011 11:08:58 PM	I started this medication as the efficacy of the antidepressants I have taken in the past has worn off.  At first I really like this medicine despite the numerous side affects because it made such a dent in my depression.  I felt more hopeful than I have felt in months, maybe years. Even after describing the side affects at my 4 week appointment my doctor was perplexed I still wanted to be on it.  But the side affects persisted.  They include HIGH anxiety accompanied by fatigue.  So much so that I feel like I can fall asleep sitting up but have anxiety to the point where I have the &quot;jimmy leg.&quot;  It is a very odd combination.  Other side effects I've experienced severe hand sweating, goose bumps on my legs, dry mouth, foul smelling flatulence, horrible sleeplessness, sexual side effects and skin sensitivity and canker sores.  Because I could not sleep my MD recommended clonopin for the anxiety.  This just accentuated how anxious I was when it wore off.  Some of the symptoms I started experiencing that increased the longer I took it that I have not seen on the website was the complete lack of concern or caring for others.  I started to want to be alone to the point of wanting to hide under my bed.  I did not care if I ever talked to anyone again and preferred not to interact with anyone.I have since gone off the meds as I realized it is kind of ruining my relationships and I was about to impulsively destroy them with my apathy.  On the 5th day of not taking the 50mg and the fatigue from the absence of the anxiety is still persisting but hopefully when my body recovers from the meds my energy will level off.  I highly recommend if going off the meds not to make plans for a lot of activity because you will laid up with the fatigue.

Pristiq seemed to me the best instead of calling it a antidepressant, I would call it a mood stablizer. It helped me with mood swings. I am on different drugs other than this alone. It has helped me more than any I have tried. I still struggle as I know everyone else will. It is the best of all the rest I have tried.

Depression	55-64 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	55-64	1/25/2011 3:48:50 AM	I discontinued Pristiq about a week ago. After taking it for about 8 weeks, I felt better emotionally than I had in years. Major life improvement! However side effects have been, and remain, intolerable. swelling of calves and feet, itching, sores, oozing/weeping/draining, infection, and major PAIN!!! for several weeks now. The strongest Hydrocodone is required, and it is not quite sufficient.I now take Deseryl for depression and Keflex for the infection. I must (painfully) bandage each calf each day.
Depression	Coping, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	35-44	1/24/2011 8:19:59 PM	I was started on this because of chronic illness/pain. It worked pretty good with helping me cope with the chronic illness and definitely helped with PMS. Over all helped brighten my outlook. I was pretty happy with it but new insurance didn't want to pay so decided to try going without it. This is pretty brutal to come off of. Very dizzy, nauseated, irritable,  cannot sleep and and of course the PMS is back with a vengence. I've been slowly weaning off now for 8 weeks, down to 1/2 tab every 4-6 days; when ever the dizziness and nausea get bad again. Anyone know how long this should take?

I stoped taking, and went into a full blown depression. It took all the strength I had to pull myself up and get back into life. I have never been that far down and never want to go back. I now understand why people with, &quot;true depression&quot; have such time.  Faith in GOD kept helped more than anything.

Each time I had the same cholestrol reading.   I hsd not changed my diet in any way and am not a snacker.  After researching the effects of PRISTIC, I found this was an effect of the drug and they even put it in bold letters in PRISTICS OWN SIDE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG.  Obviously I quit the drug 2 weeks ago.  I am trying something different.lyjw

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	1/3/2011 10:48:51 PM	I am writing this to warn others of the life threatening nature of this drug.  My husband cannot write this himself, because he died last year due to an extreme low sodium level caused by taking this drug. In his final hours, he lost the ability to speak, started having severe seizures, and he died within 4 hours of arriving at the hospital.  He had gone to his doctor twice in the preceding 2 weeks and reported his flu-like symptoms, but they just dismissed it as a common virus. Within 3 days of his last doctor visit, he was dead.  PLEASE, if anyone experiences any of the side effects such as body aches, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, headaches, confusion, etc... do not wait...insist that the doctor check your sodium level immediately!  By the way, in the total 3 months that my husband took this drug, it never did make much difference in regards to treating his depression either.

Then it lost its effectiveness. I am now on 100mg and it is better. I can function and work full time and not cry all the time on it, with little to no side effects.

Major Depressive Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	12/28/2010 8:47:03 PM	I was a little nauseus the first couple of days, but nothing major.  I took 50 mg for about 6 weeks and noticed some change, then I upped to 100 mg and noticed a remarkable change.  I had trouble sleeping, I woke up during the night for a few hours.  I am now also on Seroquel and that has helped with the sleeping.

I have no desire to drink due to anxiety. It has also helped me to stop smoking without the nicotine patches.I work as a receptionist for a large corporation and have to be 'on stage'all week.My fears have decreased and am in a good mood most of the time.I don't sleep all weekend any more and am able to go out in public without the panic or anxiety.So far so good!!
Bipolar Depression	JH, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/2/2010 8:02:25 PM	I have had bipolar disorder all of my life, but only diagnosed at age 48 with major hormonal changes that made me bedbound. I was put on Prozac (HORRIBLE HALLUCINATIONS), then quit drinking all alcolol, and settled on Paxil, Welbutrin, Buspar and Adderall for ADD for the last 8 years which SEEMED to be working. After a several month switch to generics 10 months ago, which was an absolute failure, I got back on my brands, but never got my head back above water, because it seemed that something had lost efficacy. Finally exchanged the Paxil for Pristiq (100mg) over the last month, and so far it is a miracle.  I have NEVER wanted to get out of bed in all the years that I can remember - even with what I thought was working! It is an absolute shock to me that I have the ability to feel like living and doing things. So far side-effects seem to be hypertension (100/150) and headache, but I will figure it out and do anything to maintain this new will to finally LIVE instead of just depressively existing and forcing myself to get out of bed.  I'll write again in a few months with an update (because I finally can maintain an interest and remember to!) (All of this is under the care of a psychopharmacologist and psychotherapist.)   . . .though when things don't work, pseudopharmocologist seems more apt . . .

Then it seemed to stop working midday. My doc then increased my dose to 50 mg in the morning and 25 mg in the afternoon. Again this worked for a while but now I am on 100 mg a day and I do not like the way it is starting to make me feel. I have been on 100 mg for 7 months now. I have weird experiences randomly through out the day. I don't feel like myself, and I still come home irritable and exhausted! Asking for a new medication, but now I am worried about the &quot;coming off&quot; the medication.
Depression	Helene, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/25/2010 11:54:14 PM	Pristiq has been an absolute MIRACLE drug for me.  I started taking it in September 2010 and within four weeks I was feeing 100% better.  I have been on antidepressants for almost 20 years and nothing has worked this well for me. I had continued to be somewhat depressed regardess of what I was taking.  I feel so good that I can't believe it's me that is talking and reacting so comfortably with people.  I have had NO SIDE EFFECTS whatsoever.  It is an amazing drug and I hope that it continues to work for me.  I have been on it now for two months and could not be happier with how it is working on me.
Depression	Mascenika, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/24/2010 12:06:47 PM	Been on 50mg of Pristiq about 2 months now and take in AM as my Dr suggested. Weened off Celexa cuz stopped working. Took both meds for 1 month then lowered Celexa to half (20 mg) for another month. Other meds I have taken over the years are Wellbutrin XL, Lexapro &amp; Paxil. They all stopped working eventually. Symptoms always the same: CAN SLEEP 24 HOURS, NO MOTIVATIION TO DO ANYTHING which leads to extreme guilt which makes everything worse NO SOCIALIZING, leaving home or talking on phone. Still fight the tendancy to sleep but it's much better than before. Thankfully, I have had none of the side affects I have read about. Curious as to how long this med work. Thankful for each day it does. My daughter has this problem also.

Besides the severe side effects in the beginning and the constant headaches and all of a sudden now blurred vision (cant read red or blue writing) bit scary and walking in the city on a busy day makes me feel sick.  other than all that it got rid of depression and i have vision for my life again, back at work full time and finished my year out with distinctions and credits at uni. so happy overall.  My concern now is going off it.  do i go one day off one day on and decrease that way???not looking forward to that will be taking two weeks off in february so will do it then.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	11/17/2010 3:17:20 PM	The medicine made me cloudy headed all day long. I would forget conversations I had or errands I needed to run. Coming off the medication was the worst experience. I slowly came off by taking it every other day for 2 weeks and then every 2 days for two weeks then stopped. I had spins all day and terrible mood swings. The nausea was the worst. Overall I wouldn't recommend this drug to anyone. It did more harm than good.
Major Depressive Disorder	jimdandy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	11/17/2010 1:37:56 PM	I was on Effexor XR for about 6 years and was really annoyed by the sexual side effects.  When I quit I was on 150mg/day.  I went directly on to Pristiq 50mg and noticed a difference immediately.  Pristiq is a stereoisomer (specifically rearanged molucule)of Effexor and works the same.. but works without having to take a ton.  My sexual side effects subsided substantially and I feel better on 50mg than I ever did on the 150mg Effexor.  Yes, you have to titrate yourself off if quitting due to the brain shock thing, but that's really the only misgiving I can surmise about this miracle drug.  Very satisfied, and have gotten help paying for it through the manufacturer.  Don't get discouraged... everyones brain chemistry is different.  If this one doesn't work, try another.  Pristiq is for those of us unfortunates with a lack of both seritonin and norepiniphrine.  There are plenty of others that effect one or the other of these levels, and still others that effect dopamine (like wellbutrin).

I have energy, am happier and only experienced slight digestive problems in the one month switch.  Lexapro, Paxil and Wellbutrin never worked for me.  No weight loss as I take Mitazipine (30mg)at night for sleep, which is actually an appetite stimulator.So far so good.

The medication works best if taken in the morning, if i take it in the evening i am unable to sleep. Also if i miss doses I have very emotional mood swings. Keep under doctors care. I was prescribes to high of a dosage and went through a horrible withdraw. Overall helped with the major pain relief and mood.

Supplementing with up to 3 x 0.5mg Ativan per day when needed.  Weaning off Paxil after 11 years.Initial side effects were moderate-severe panic attacks during first 24 hours and then transitioned to moderate drowsiness for next 4 days.  I find this medication is hard on my upper GI system.  I am physically active and this medication has contributed to weight loss.Overall I am pleased with the decrease in generalized anxiety symptoms and find that the low-dose of Ativan helps with the social anxiety symptoms that have developed since I started this treatment.

Pristiq did put on a few lbs. on me, but in all fairness, most anti-depressants will.  I have absolutely NO sex-drive whatsoever, which is completely unlike me and my neuropathic pain is still there?!  I do think it has helped me with some depression, for sure. With that said, I don't know if it's worth staying on pristiq as I am still in constant pain and the headaches and fibromyalgia are so very severe.  I have been on this for well over 6 months+ now and I have given it well enough time for it to work!  I hope this helps.

It helped with my anxiety. After the first few months, i started experiencing weird side effects. They started with heartburn. Within a month, I went through a bottle of tums. My dr gave me an acid reflux prescription to take with it. After a week, I started feeling nauseated. After a month of both symptoms, my dr gave me something for the nausea. Then, I started puking a few hours after eating. Within a couple of weeks, the puking came closer and closer to the time that I ate. After a few weeks, I was puking before I even ate and right after. My dr sent me for test after test because she said it couldn't be the medication. Well, I wasn't allowed to take the medication before the tests so they came back negative. After being constantly dehydrated I finally just stopped taking the medicine. I was better immediately. I could be a rare example, but I would stop if you start experiencing heartburn with this medication.

The first week I was concerned because it calmed my anxieties so much that I felt somewhat stone-faced (no emotion), but that soon subsided.  My side effects are minimal such as dry mouth and drowsiness at times.  I have not had nausea.  My most noticable effect is the sexual side effect.  I also take Tamoxifen, which can cause this side effect.  However, I did not have this problem when only taking Tamoxifen.

Depression	Me, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/2/2010 2:19:22 PM	This med has worked better than others, thus far.  My only advice is to be aware of the side affects before beginning.  I was not.  I got very dizzy while doing house work and thought I was dieing.  I couldn't eat for days (not so bad)at first.  The symptoms will subside eventually, so be patient.  It is worth it.

Nausea, Severe headache, eyes out of focus/blurry, jittery, can't sleep, appetite supressed, my arms felt like they were on fire, severe ringing in the ears.Day 9 and most of the side affects are subsiding. My vision is still not right, still not sleeping well, ringing in the ears is still there, but better. It seems that I wake up in a great mood, take my meds then within a couple hours some of the side affects kick in. I'm hoping within a couple more weeks that there will be no side affects. I like having more energy and feeling better about life.

Panic Disorder	Thankful, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/27/2010 3:50:25 PM	I have been depressed/anxious for years and have tried almost all other antidepressants; too many side effects like weight gain and minimal improvement other than for Paxil.  Pristiq has worked extremely well, as I had almost given up on them.  Got into trouble with Klonopin dependency and am glad I have found something that works other than that class of drugs.  Minimal to no side effects. 
Panic Disorder	Mary, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	9/26/2010 3:10:16 PM	I have been on Prestiq for almost 2 weeks.  Very nervous and am living on Xanix.  Not sure if this is for me.  Took Effexor XR for years but went off - mistake.
Depression	Wilma, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	9/26/2010 2:09:13 AM	I started taking Pristiq in November and noticed my mood changed for the good almost immediately.  That part was great.  Around Thanksgiving I started getting sick and throwing up every time I laid down.  I had 4 EGDs and they wanted me to have surgery on my stomach because my esophagus was closed us.  On my own, I quit taking the pristiq and the vomiting stopped.  As a test, I started it again a month later and it closed up my esophagus.  I guess that's an allergic reaction.  Too bad.  It certainly made me feel better mind and energy wise.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	9/25/2010 1:26:33 AM	I was on Lexapro for nearly 2 years and gained 20 pounds. I have always been a thin person so this was upsetting. I weaned myself off Lexapro and then experienced a family crisis which required me to be back on medication in order to function in my highest degree. My doctor introduced me to Pristiq, which has been great, other than the sweating. No matter the temperature, I have gross underarm sweat. But, considering I was immobilized by anxiety and depression, I would take the embarrassing sweats. Lexapro was great while it lasted. My Dr. told me that if you have any liver disorders (which I don't, but I do enjoy my glass of wine) Pristiq was a better choice. I do have a prescription card my dr. gave me that allows 50% off my meds. That brings my 30 day supply down to $17.  I would certainly love to be medication free, but Pristiq allows me to live without debilitating anxiety and depression.  
Depression	June, 75 or over Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		9/24/2010 2:00:19 PM	It has made such a change in my behavior, going from being tired, sad, feelings of guilt, and isolating myself from other people.
Depression	James, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	9/23/2010 1:13:13 PM	I've been on pristiq for about two years. It works very well. It is easy on my system. It is a strong medicine, so don't run out. I can go for two days without it, but it starts to get a little uncomfortable. This needs to be tapered down to get off of it. I am always surprised by people who write bad experiences. The medicine was very effective in the beginning. After a year I upped it from 50 to 100mg thinking I would have another honeymoon experience on pristiq. There were no major changes in two years, I guess it was more noticeable in the beginning.  My life is stable and I'm not hitting any super lows since pristiq.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	9/21/2010 2:56:54 AM	I was taking Effexor XR (which that worked perfectly fine) but switched to Pristiq to try and minimize my severe night sweats. Since taking the Pristiq the frequency of my night sweats have decreased. I have only been taking it for a few weeks now but I will continue to take this because it is pretty much the same thing as Effexor XR (main ingredient). If someone is currently taking Effexor XR and having issues with the side affects from it I would recommend asking your doctor about taking Pristiq instead. But if you do decide to switch to this make sure you get off the effexor gradually like you did when you first started taking it because I know I had some pretty nasty side affects from just stopping it cold turkey and starting the pristiq right away. Just make sure to talk with your doctor about all of these different things to make sure you do have the best experience possible.

I was a little nauseous the first week but not unbearable.  It only took 4-5 days before I started feeling better.  I do get nauseous if I miss dose (approx 4 or 5 hours after missed dose).  I take 50mg a day with Lamictal.
Depression	zumba gold, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	9/19/2010 11:52:37 PM	Pristiq is a timed released medicine so if you are late taking it,  you will feel like wind is in your head or brain zaps.  I try to take it first thing when I get up each morning.  It seems to give me energy.  I am on 100 mg.  I am always going through a crisis, it seems (LOL),so I still feel discouraged at times and overwhelmed.  I guess it can't take away all those feelings all the time.  Overall,  I feel like it is doing a good job helping me,  but I almost feel like I need something to go with it.  I just retired from teaching and my health insurance is over $2200.00 a month,  My husband just found a tumor in his neck , and my mother in law has moved in with us.  I figure this is why I feel so hopeless.  I don't think they make a pill that can handle too much stress.

All I want to do is cry, not eat and sleep all day... I thought this medication would help me a lot better since the doctor took me off of citalopram (which I did not feel any better with that one either) It really sucks that we as depressed people have to live like this. And lets not to forget that this medication is way too expensive!

Also gave me diarrhea and no motivation at all! Felt better without taking medication and just &quot;dealing&quot; with the anxiety!

I've been on the drug almost one year and things have improved.  I still experience trouble sleeping, itching and weight gain.
Extreme Apprehension or Fear of Social Interaction	Little Aussie Battler, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	9/7/2010 7:59:26 AM	A few years ago, my doctor prescribed me with a medication to treat work related depression. To much dismay, this medication did not work for me. As time went on, my depression became worse and my fear of social situations grew larger. I started to withdraw from society, work, play - my life. After I lost my job, I become a wreck.  Knowing that I had to gain some control over what was happening to me I went to see a new GP this year who prescribed me with Pristiq 50mg. With such a huge stigma attached to medications to treat mental illness, it was hard for me to accept the prescription. I have been seeing a psyhcologist for a month and have been on Pristiq for 2 months. I can tell you that my concentration levels have improved greatly, my thoughts have seemed to slow down and I feel less anxious in social situations. I still feel me, not a zombie walking around in a haze like I felt with other medications. I am having a great night sleep. I am retaining more information too. Which is good because I am doing a university degree :-) I am becoming more involved with study groups and I don't worry as much about being in the group. My weight has stayed around the same too. Which is always good for us women :-) This drug is great, thank you for reading, good luck with your journey. 
Depression	Joy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	9/6/2010 2:40:24 AM	I have been on Pristiq for 6 weeks.I went to my doctor 3 days ago and he is now taking me off as he was &quot;extremely worried&quot; about my worsening depression. It has severely worsened to the point of suicidal thoughts and plans, which my Dr. pointed out that this now put me one step away from being hospitalized. I have all of the side effects, sweating, irritablility, but mostly deepening depression.Can't get out of bed or can't sleep, can't do simple tasks and all this makes a person even more depressed.Cry a lot, and hate my self. The lowest I have ever been in my life. This medication has no right being on the market. The damage it has caused to me and my children, husband and family in the last 6 weeks is unrepairable and unforgivable.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	9/3/2010 4:04:21 PM	This drug is the worst! I was fine on Paxil CR, I changed doctors, was told that Pristiq would be good for me and now after months of hell, my job is suffering and my mariage is about over. The Pristiq made me feel sick and limited my ability to think clearly which affected me doing my job efficiently. I then stopped it &quot;cold turkey&quot; which I know you are not supposed to do, but I had to get off of it. For a week, I could not eat, yelled at my family for everything they did and could not do my job. I even went to my family doctor because I thought that I was going to have a stroke or heart attack because I had pains in my chest and a bad headache. Finally, after about a week and a half, I was &quot;free&quot; of the symptoms of withdrawal. I then could not go back on the Paxil because of another drug this doctor has prescibed for me, Vyvanse, which was crazy because it is for ADHD, and I do not and have never had ADHD. Ever since going off the Paxil, I have been a real bitch to live with, and now my husband is talking divorce and taking the kids. I am now off of Vyvanse also and feel better than ever...thinking more clearly on my job, etc. I am just depressed about how these drugs ruined my life for the past 6 months. I am now trying different things to help with depression and my exploding at every little thing. My husband and I are &quot;trying&quot; to work things out even though I can barely stand him anymore. I am now trying Lexapro, and that is giving me headaches also. I will probably end up going back to Paxil...just haven't yet because I was told that it makes you gain weight, and that is the last thing that I want. I would take Pristiq off the market if I could...heard too many bad things about it as well as experienced its detrimental effects.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	8/30/2010 10:59:31 PM	One dose of this made me weak, dizzy, trouble sleeping, nauseous, and eventually vomited. I am afraid to try it ever again- even though some people say if you can get past the first few weeks of side effects it is a good med. I can't imagine ever subjecting myself to that again.

Depression	altate, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	8/26/2010 10:46:25 AM	After a year on Pristiq I'm feeling that some of the effectiveness may have diminished. I have days when I feel depressed for no reason. And even taking the pill at the same time every day, I have days when the &quot;brain zaps&quot; break through and I feel terribly strange. Out of body.On the other hand, I don't find myself feeling overwhelmed by everyday tasks anymore. I still have some stressful situations to work through - but when they're past I want to try to wean off. 
Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/23/2010 3:48:19 PM	I've been on Pristiq for 3 weeks now, I have noticed a big difference in my moods. I have more energy now. The only thing I don't like about it is, The bad taste in my mouth, but all in all I do like it a lot. I would recommend this to others for sure.
Panic Disorder	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	8/22/2010 9:33:40 PM	Pristiq...just hearing the name makes me cringe. I was put on this medication by an ignorant, stupid doctor trying to promote this horrid medication. He put me on this medication for my anxiety disorder, and guess what?! It did absolutely nothing for me and made me even more depressed and anxious than before I was taking the pill. This medication made me very angry, irritable, moody, and very dull at times. It made me so tired that I slept fourteen hours every single day just to be able to keep my eyes open for more than a couple hours. Pristiq was making me avoid my friends and family. I felt like doing nothing all day long. I just simply didn't care. I finally had to go to a therapist when my depression and anxiety was at it's highest peak and she said she wanted me off of this medication ASAP. I'm currently withdrawing from it after being on it for about three months. I feel like I am going through a living HELL. My head feels like it will explode at any minute, My heart rate is always high, I can't even stand up, i've puked two times today, and I cannot concentrate whatsoever. This is my first week...I can't even get through being without the med for two days without feeling like complete CRAP. I am currently taking it every other day. I'm never seeing that doctor again. Please warn your friends and family to never EVER use this drug. It made me worse and turned me into it's robot. I wouldn't even be writing a review right now if I didn't hate this medication with a fiery passion. WORST DRUG EVER!!!!!! STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!

Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	8/20/2010 9:05:42 PM	well i was hoping that this medicine would work, but for some reason for the first time in my life i had an allergic reaction. Hives from head to toe and dry itchy throat. Doesnt help when u already have panic attacks, so u may want to check that out. I was taking zoloft with it to tapper off my zoloft as that was doctor's orders.  I also had to be on an antin=biotic Bactrim DS would that have caused that reaction with pristiq because I have been on Bactrium before many times.. Hope it works for someone else..

Until a yr. ago I was stable.  Since May, 2010 I have high b.p. (new med. for that) and today my LDL is high.  I just read these are 2 side effects from Pristiq, yet my Psych. dr. or family dr. mentioned it.  I guess we all have to be our own advocate. Pristiq has worked well for me &amp; I don't know for sure if it is THE cause of high b.p. &amp; high LDL.  I don't know how to handle this situation.

I thought it had stopped working until I tried to go off of it. DO NOT TRY TO TAKE YOURSELF OFF THIS MED!! I have been crying for the last 2 days &amp; decided to start back taking it. Sometimes we don't want to be dependent on meds but sometimes we have to. It's great when it's working. Note too that I have peri-menopause working against me.
Depression	Timeless, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	8/16/2010 11:20:38 AM	I have been on this prescription for a little over a year now, I tried *many* different anti-depressants and can say this is the only one that worked *well* for me, I can also say that I noticed a huge difference in a little less than a week. BUT... now that I'm trying to come off of it I am having horrendus nasuea/dizziness and the worst headaches I've ever had a few hours after I would have normally taken this medication (I've had migranes, this is far worse) so beyond having to be very, very careful about not missing a dose and having trouble getting off this stuff I've only occasionally noticed that it would make me fatigued, but not severely so.  I apparently tolerated this better than most.  I did notice that I would get a weird metallic taste regularly in the back of my throat for about the first 6 months... now it's a hit and miss kind of thing, but at least once a week.  Neither my primary nor my psych were concerned with it after I checked out healthy otherwise.  I work in the medical field and am very in tune with my own body and what I'm putting into it, but beyond the weird nausea/headaches/dizziness thing if I missed a dose by mistake or now that I'm working on getting this stuff out of my system I can say this has literally saved my life. 
Depression	hmor, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	8/15/2010 7:49:15 AM	i was prescribed wellbutrin first and the first time i took it i felt like a zombie i did not like the it.so i seen the pristiq commarcial and asked my doctor about it.he gave me a month supply now im on my second month.by the way its 50mg i feel a little better i can actually go out shopping and family functions.where as before i really didnt want to do anything but work and sleep.i guess everyone is differnt and medications effects each one of us different.

Have been on Cipralex since May 2009 by psychologist, now fam doc wants me to use Pristiq.  Today was my first day and it was awful.  Very agitated....felt like running....sweating all day.....very anxious....very nauseous.  Will try again tomorrow and if I feel the same will be contacting my family doctor to explain effects.  Why can't doctors just leave you alone on a certain drug if it is working.  Do not want another day of what I went through today!!!  I hope it goes away..if not back to square one.

I will try something else. Have been suffering with depression since I was a teenager and have tried many drugs - but this one sounds terrifying. If it doesn't work I don't want to go through the withdrawl.

Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	8/12/2010 12:01:49 PM	I had been in denial as a teenager, resisting going onto any medication.  Was on paxil as my first exposure.  Took the edge off.  Have been on Serzone, had realllly bad side effects, Celexa was okay, and most recently Effexor XR 75 mg. for the past 2 years or so.  I didn't feel that it was working well for me.  Instead of working with a doctor, I took myself off the effexor cold turkey. It has been 5 weeks today.  I have gone through such varying degrees of regression and improvement.  Explained how I feel and dr. prescribed Pristiq.  I don't know if I should start back on meds period or see if I am able to cope without being on anything.  I do not like the side effects of these meds.  I don't know if they help or hinder me from being independent from meds.  How do you know if you can deal with your depression after being medicated so many years, going off and dealing with who you are and how to handle your stress and depression with natural/exercise or getting back on meds?  Any of this make sense?
Depression	esther, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	8/9/2010 11:56:24 PM	I am happy with efficacy of drug but am curious if anybody has noticed a difference in their tastebuds. I have a constant metalic taste which started around the time I started this drug (6 weeks) Have seen the dentist and there is no obvious cause there. I note that this has been observed in clinical trials of Pristiq &lt;2% but am wondering if this has been observed more post-marketing. Any Wyeth personel reading this? I don't want to stop using this drug just yet in order to find a cause, as I'm hoping that something else is to blame

I wanted to try this drug b\c I had heard so many success stories... I have been on it for 6 mo. and I feel like Iam alive again. Sex drive is back, I laugh again. My children told me that it was great having their mom again. I wish I had heard about this drug along time ago... Good luck...
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/4/2010 11:11:11 PM	I am SOOOOOOOOOO happy I tried ths miracle med.  I am 32 and was diagnosed with ocd, anxiety, and depression when I was 18.  I have been on and off Zoloft since I was diagnosed. At first Zoloft helped with my diagnosis but I had a lot of side effects including; NO sex drive, being tired all the time, and feeling flat(not happy or sad).  I also tried Paxil, Wellbutrin, and Buspar.  This is the only med for me.  I have only been on Pristiq for 5 days but I already feel happier and best of all hello libido!  I thought I was going to live out the rest of my life on a rollercoaster of being on and then taking myself off of the Zoloft and on no meds just so that I could feel closer to my boyfriend.  You do not have to choose between happiness and a libido!  Thank you Pristiq!!!

NONE help GAD. I believe they make it worse. Starting pristiq was pure hell for the first month, dizzy, nauseous, indigestion, hot feeling, flu like feeling, no decrease in anxiety. Still have the flu feeling all the time, but on a postive note i have lost a few pounds on this med. Am quiting and starting buspar after finally having a good prognosis by phsyc. Beware anxiety sufferers of SSRIS, have been on a few the past five years and there is not one postive that outweighs all the negatives of these drugs. I'll write back on the buspar page and how it's working in a few months.

Depression	annabell, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/31/2010 8:18:02 PM	I think it is a very good safe drug for depression. It is the only one that has ever worked for me. I felt great after 4-5 days. If you can get through the first week you will adjust to it. It makes you a little tired at first but then you get less sleepy. I use to cry 2 hours a day and was very sad. Now I am laughing again and want to do things. I love this drug and it has changed my life.
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	7/29/2010 2:21:42 PM	I have not taken any prior meds. for depression, as my depression has just gotten worse due to personal issues. I took one 50mg two weeks ago and definitly felt lightheaded within an hour and then developed severe upper chest/shoulder pain and face numbness that leasted over a week, even though I only took the one pill, so I thought perhaps it was just a coincidence, but I did not contact my doctor, because I am tired of hearing that &quot;there is nothing wrong&quot; with me.  I took my second pill this morning thinking I would try it again and I am light headed and face is tingling.  So I read the reviews and have decided not to continue with this drug, as I just didn't realize the possible side effects,the weight gain (I have gained weight due to depression anyway)and the drug withdrawals. Thank god I have only taken two total. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	55-64	7/29/2010 1:31:33 PM	I tried to stick it out but after 9 days I had to stop. The side effects were unbearable. Panic attacks, rapid heart rate, horrible nausea, inability to eat, my blood pressure went up, worse anxiety, trouble sleeping, racing thoughts. I have been off of it for three days and I still am experiencing bad feelings of my insides shaking apart. No that I read withdrawal symptoms I am grateful to God that I am off of this now. This is a new hyped med that should be looked at very carefully. I would like to see it off the market.
Depression	APRIL, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	7/28/2010 8:14:14 PM	Pristiq is a miracle worker. I feel as though a weight has been lifted from my shoulders. I feel better everyday than I ever have. It has helped with my depression and anxiety. I am still experiencing lack of motivation and lack of physical activity which is the only real reason I am still feeling depressed. I have not had any side effects, although I have experienced &quot;brain zaps&quot; for several days. I dont have a problem taking this medication with alcohol which is great because I turned 21 this year. Counseling sessions has also helped!  
Depression	cstevens2121, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/28/2010 3:13:06 PM	I am 23 and have been taking Pristiq for almost 6 months and couldn't be happier with the results of treatment. I have experienced little to no side effects. The only down fall of course is the decreased sex drive which is common for most depression/anti-depressant cases. I was not pleased when my doctor wanted me to try an anti-depressant. I didnt think I was depressed! For years I had been experiencing stomache problems, fatigue, headaches, inconsistent sleeping habits. I honestly thought it was from food allergies or some kind of intestinal problem. After trying a gluten free diet, many blood tests, stool tests, etc the conclusion was to try an anti-depressant. My Doctor started me on Pristiq gradually then increased to a full dose.I didnt start to feel a differnece until after the first month of taking Pristiq and it has only gotten better. Not only do I feel better physically I mentally feel like myself again! The clouds have parted! Its like having a cold for years that finally went away. The plan is to take Pritiq for 6 months then gradually decrease the dose to see how I reposnd. If all is good I will eventually be able to stop. If not I will continue taking the medication. My doctor explained to me some people only need treatment for 6 months, 1-2 years. Those who try and get off and experience horrible side effects are meant to stay on treatment...some for the remainder of their life. I am just thankful to have had a great experience with Pristq!

Depression	Chris P, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	19-24	7/27/2010 6:37:25 AM	I am currently at 3 months with pristiq 50mg. First 3-4 days, I experienced slight muscle trimmers in my hands and since that nothing until recently. Today, after about 2 months, I am getting hit by insomnia and extreme thirst. However, i haven't really thought putting a gun in my mouth was such a good idea anymore though. Lets try for 6 months and see where I am at.

Was previously taking 40 mg of Prozac, which worked well but cuased some cognitive clouding.  Pristiq seemed to work well for about first 2 months then took a nose dive into a myriad of symptoms, notably inability to concentrate, headaches, insomnia, and constipation.  Will go back to lower dose of Proazc.  Pristiq, at current, seems like terrible choice. 
Depression	Sarah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	7/25/2010 1:36:48 AM	The medication did help with depression, but also caused me to gain 30 lbs.What upsets me is the level of suffering that I'm going through in getting off of the medication.  At no point in the literature, or from the doctor was I advised of what it would be like to get off of the medication.  It's painful!  It's agonizing! Dizzy, nauseous, headaches, brain zaps (imagine an electrical current in your brain), hypersensitive to sudden sounds.Telling a person of side effects that might happen while on the medication isn't enough.  We need to know what happens if we stop taking the medicine.  These symptoms would happen if I missed a single dose.  I became tethered to my medicine and that's no way to live.I'm on day 5 of withdrawl.  My husband is worried about me.  My kids say I look awful.  I feel like crap.

I have been taking Pristiq for 2 weeks, and now my insurance comp. will not pay for it. I can not afford the medication. This medication is helping me in many ways.I really like it, and now I have to give it up. I am in very much pain. They also don't pay for may R/A medication.
Depression	ArtisteBleue, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	7/19/2010 8:14:46 PM	Initially, it made me nauseated and very, very drowsy.  However after a few weeks, I began feeling much better -- more self-confidence, less depression &amp; anxiety -- like someone turned on the lights.  My mother passed away 7 weeks ago and, had I not been on Pristiq, I don't know that I could have handled the grief as well.  The only side effects I've experienced are:  cold sweats, some insomnia, sleeping longer than normal in the morning, brain 'zaps', and some minor short-term memory problems.  It is important to follow directions EXACTLY as indicated.  Take at precisely the same time every day and DO NOT mix with alcohol, etc.  It was extremely hot outside yesterday and I had a beer later in the evening.  Needless to say, I had some truly horrific dreams!  Oh, and don't watch CSI  before retiring in the evening either.

The only one that continually helped eleviate my depression and give me enough energy to make it through the day is Pristiq. I am currently trying to get back on Pristiq, but my insurance will not cover the cost. I did not lose sleep, nor did I gain weight or suffer from anxiety while taking Pristiq. I felt no negative side effects.  I like that I only had to take one in the morning and not twice daily because I would forget the one later in the day.

First antidepressant that has helped.  Increased to 100mg about 6months ago and it made me way too sleepy.  Tried increase to 100mg about 3 weeks ago and am able to tolerate it.  Increase in appetite but not excessive. I have to take 100mg pristiq with food otherwise it upsets my stomach. Has also helped with hot flashes.

It's been extremely effective with no real side effects. Until about 5 weeks ago I was ok, but then it felt like the bottom fell out as new/additional life stressors started cropping up. Now I'm extremely down, spacey, and unfocused. I'm going back to see my Dr for an adjustment up or an adjunct treatment. I know I can't continue like this. My faith and the love of my wife are the only things keeping me going.

Now I understand why drug addicts cave. I can't go longer than a few hours past schedule without the pills. I can't even do what my doc office said to get off of them. If I had known it would be this hard to come off the pristiq, I would never had started taking them!

Depression	LifeIsGood, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/24/2010 8:28:57 AM	Use of this medication has changed my life.  I have been taking Pristiq 100 mg. for 3 1/2 months now.  I have used numerous antidepressants over the years.  Never found one that I felt I could continue on due to side effects and lack of emotional feelings.  I began to feel better within 1 - 2 weeks of taking it although t took about 2 months of taking this medication daily to eliminate some of the initial side effects such as inability to fall asleep and some crazy dreams.  These side effects were minimal compared to benefits of this drug.  First time I've ever felt I can continue taking a medication to keep myself from the continual ups and downs that depression and anxiety has caused in my life.  My advice to anyone is to not give up taking it too soon.  I am happier and have more energy than I've had in 30 years (since my teens), yet still have the ability to cry when appropriate and has not diminished sexual desire as so many other medications have done in the past.

Depression	Upsidedown, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	6/20/2010 12:26:05 PM	Have been on 50mg for 2 years for depression and plan to get off as soon as possible for these reasons.  Over 30 lbs. weight gain even with regular weekly exercise at a gym 3 times or more a week (cardio and weight controlled exercises), and a daily caloric intake of no more than 1800-2000 calories daily.  Also, periods of extreme and swift onset of sweating, nausea, feeling like I'm going to black out.  Every night my weird and vivid dreams wake me with fear and sadness, often keeping me awake for hours.  In addition to the extreme cost, I'm retaining so much fluid and my blood pressure is always high.  Just too many negatives for me to continue on this drug.  I think these experiences have created more stress than the drug relieves.  I'm sure that it has positive effects for some of the population, but after reading other reviews, it appears that there are more of us who have had negative effects.  Can't wait to be eased completely off this nightmare!!

Felt better at first and was increased to 100mg after 3 mos. Now my mood seems to be regressing and I'm on edge and still quite emotional. I also notice that if I miss even an hour of not taking the pill each day, I begin to feel dizzy and have very weird black out or passing out sensations. I've also noticed that if something makes me very angry, I have the same strange sensations in my head. I tend to want to shake my head as if I'm shaking off the feeling and it goes away. Regardless, I don't like the feeling at all and it's becoming more frequent. Besides, since there is no generic I have to pay $30 every month which is too expensive for a single mom.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	6/17/2010 11:08:25 PM	I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression by a psychiatrist because I was stressed out, mentally exhausted and could not concentrate. I was not sad, but did cry from frustration every once in a while. I was totally happy if I didn't have to think about anything. Took kids ice skating, dining out and spending time with friends. After taking Pristique for about 1 to 2 weeks I did not even want to leave my house or be seen by anyone. All I wanted to do was sleep and eat. I was even uncomfortable walking in to pick up our carry out pizza or buy cigarettes. Not sure if it had anything to do with the fact that I gained 16 pounds in 2 weeks and felt like a big fat cow. Maybe I was misdiagnosed, but Pristique did not work for me.

I was at my lowest point in life and am on my way to be better than ever!  I didn't have any side effects like nausea or headaches...but I have been experiencing very very dry skin on my face and scalp and my hair is shedding A LOT in the shower!  I am pretty sure it is a side effect and I am calling my doc about it today, because that is not at all normal for me.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this medication- I hope that these side effects go away or are being caused by something else.  I wonder if anyone else is having this problem.
Depression	shelbi, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	45-54	6/15/2010 1:48:48 PM	I have been taking Pristiq for about a year.  Before that I had been on Lexapro, which was great except that it made me sleepy, especially during meetings at work.  So I needed to change.  At first Pristiq seemed to work great!  I wasn't sleepy and things seemed to be under control.  After a few months, I seemed to get more irritable with things and felt anxiety.  After my insurance copayment went to $50 for a month of Pristiq, I knew it was time to quit.  I have been off Pristiq for 6 days now and I had no idea about the withdrawals.  I thought a day or two of being dizzy, ahhhh no problem.  Well Saturday I had my kids and grandkids over and that I was gonna die with the dizziness and irritability and my brain not wanting to work.  I haven't been sleeping much and when I do I have been dreaming weird stuff.  I have had headaches and nausea.  I feel like I can't sit still and have had photosensitivity and my dog barked and it sounded 10 times louder than it normally does.  Live and learn I guess.  I will NOT be taking this again.  Good luck going through the withdrawals and hang in there when you do!!!
Depression	Jenna, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/14/2010 1:25:13 PM	I have been on pristiq for 6 months and have loved it until today.  I was on lexapro in college-slept for two weeks and on prozac a few years ago-was clearly suicidal.  Pristiq has greatly helped with the depression, negative thinking, negative outlook-it really changed my world for the better.  The only negative side effects were dilated pupils, infrequent headaches, and vivid, bad dreams.  The benefits were an obviousl lifting of the depression, a better mood, a slight decrease in appetite, and a noticeable decrease in dismenorrhea!!  So, everything was wonderful until today.  I had a horrible period friday-I must have thrown up my pill.  Then yesterday (Sun), I forgot to take it.  This morning I was throwing up, horribly nauseated, had the pins/needles sensation in my whole body when I moved, had a numb tongue and lips, and had little black-outs.  I looked up withdrawl symptoms from pristiq and it looks like these are all par for the course.  I plan on continuing on the med because of the benefits-but I am now aware of how important it is to take the pill every day or taper off when I am ready.

Panic Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	6/8/2010 2:46:03 PM	I have severe Panic Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder.  I absolutely hate the thought of taking medication for them, but these disorders started to take over my life.  I finally went to a Psychiatrist to try therapy and he said a combination of medication and therapy would work best...I agreed to take Pristiq.  Since starting Pristiq I've had severe fatigue, headaches, dizziness, trembling, blurred vision, my blood pressure has raised and my menstrual cycle has stopped.  I've been thoroughly checked for pregnancy and any other underlying medical condition and I'm perfectly healthy.  It's unfortunate because Pristiq seemed to relieve some of the panic and anxiety I had but I couldn't deal with the numerous side effects from the drug.  Good luck to anyone taking it, just keep in mind that just because this happens to some people doesn't mean it'll happen to you, medication effects us all differently.

I had tried other medicines, most of which worsened my symptoms or had no positive effects.  Pristiq, like any other prescriptions has its ups and downs, but the good definitely outweighs the bad.  I will remain on it as well as my other medications because it has given me a different view on life and I am actually enjoying myself again.
Depression	Happy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/2/2010 10:02:54 PM	Within three days of taking Pristiq at 50 mg's I could not believe the change.  After a week I moved up to 100 mg and am enjoying life again.  I've tried celexa and cymbalta in the past and did not feel they worked but took them for a couple of years while I went through therapy.  I could have done the therapy without those drugs as they took so long to kick in that I have always wondered if they were working or if it was all about the talking.I have never encountered a drug like Prostiq before and would take it for the rest of my life if that is possible.
Depression	Diana, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	5/31/2010 2:51:24 AM	I've been on pristiq about 6wks after my baby was born because i have postpartum depression.  Worked well for about 2wks. and then nothing. It gave me energy but it also caused me to have racing thoughts, anger, and for some reason even though I've been dieting and exercising can't lose a single pound. I'm done with-just hope I survive the withdrawals.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	5/30/2010 4:31:01 AM	Was taking lexapro which was uneffective for my depression. Was switched to Pristiq and after about 2 weeks I saw a drastic change in my mood and I feel better than ever. I have been on Pristiq now for about 8 months and my insurance covers it.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	19-24	5/27/2010 4:01:37 AM	After about 2 months Pristiq finally started to imporve my quality of life with Fibromyalgia and depression.  It was Extremely expensive as it is not covered under my insurance plan.  I asked my doctor to discontinue treatment based on the extreme price for a mediocre benefit.

Depression	dpeaster, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	2	Female	25-34	5/19/2010 1:43:15 PM	works great on anxiety/depression but after 3 weeks of no sleep even with taking it in the morning, I am discontinuing taking it. Went to the Dr after 2 day migraine and told pristiq will cause headaches if already prone to them. The side effects outweigh the benefit for me.
Depression	Screenial, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	5/16/2010 10:08:00 PM	The only side efeects I have had is slight constipation and thirst, otherwise Pristiq has worked very well.
Depression	Mommyto2, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	35-44	5/13/2010 8:04:44 PM	I had been on Effexor for almost a year and felt I needed a change since I wasn't doing as well as I had hoped.  My Dr. took me down to 150 mg of Effexor and then had me start a sample pack of Pristiq at 50 mg.  I came down Effexor okay, and only did 4 days of Pristiq before I discontinued it.  I was falling asleep and had a terrible rash ( an uncommon side effect). For two days now my head has been screwed up!!  I feel like my brain is floating around and doesn't keep up if I turn my head too quickly - a weird sort of drugged or drunk.  It is a weird kind of dizzy.  It is definitely affecting my visual perception and sense of connectedness. All this from just 4 days of Pristiq and I suppose some background transition from Effexor.  All I know is this is terrible and I feel like I just need to go somewhere and sleep this off!  Relief please!!!!
Depression	Justsayin',  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female		5/9/2010 12:25:35 PM	This medication has not only helped with my mood, anger/crying/rage/indifferance/stress, but has also controled early onset of menopause. I no longer have night sweats (added bonus) and that went away within the first month.  I did have upset stomache, and headache at first but that went away too. This is a progressive dosage drug so you may start out on 50mg and have to go  up to 100mg so be aware of any mood changes  even if you are feeling better and tell your doctor. I have gained  lots of weight (30 lbs 2 yrs or so on drug) so I recommened adding exercise  program at least 3 times a week as you start to feel better. Two years ago I could hardly get motivated to get out of bed so now being able &amp; wanting to go exercise is a blessing. I am now wanting off the drug due to weight gain and am working toward that goal with my doc. Execise is the transition for me.  I was on lexapro before this med but it wasn't effective for me.  This  med I have had very  few side effects from and I am actually nice to be around now.  
Depression	bluesail2681, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/7/2010 6:05:31 PM	ive been on pristiq for @ 6 months now and it has been great for my depression. i took lexapro for several years and didnt feel it was working anymore.once i started pristiq i felt like a brand new person.it doesnt work for my anxiety as well as the lexapro did. one side effect is that if i miss a dose i begin having flu-like symptoms the next morning. overall its the most effective med ive taken. just please be aware of the side effects of any med u take. be your own advocate and take part in your health care for the best outcome. Educate yourself and dont just rely on your dr to know everything.
Depression	drawhave, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	65-74	5/7/2010 12:34:28 PM	I have just begun Prestiq and am very sleepy.I switched to night time because the day before I took in the morning and was sleepy all day.  My doc said I could take night or day.   Of course I always am sleepy anyway so I don't know if its the drug.  How would tell?
Major Depressive Disorder	Attila the Hen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/6/2010 6:17:52 PM	After several years of decreasing effectiveness and increased doses and side-effects of Zoloft, Lexipro, Effexor, Wellbutrin, and Cymbalta, my doctor switched me to Pristiq shortly after it was released. It was far more effective with my depression without the side-effects than any of the others. No side-effects other than a serious anxiety attack about 6 weeks after starting Pristiq, and less than a 5-lb weight gain the 1st year. 3 wks ago I refilled my  prescription. Since then I have been experiencing a constant metallic taste, severe itching after taking a pill, worsening night vision (I've had cataract surgery), headaches like you get with &quot;caffeine withdrawal&quot;, insomnia, and, despite eating less because the metallic taste makes food, beverages tasteless and even water tastes metallic, I have gained over 10 lbs in 10 days. I noticed that the new batch of pills is lighter pink than previous ones, and I suspect that the mfr has changed the formulation since my previous refill 3 months ago and that the new formula is causing the problems. Wondering if anyone else is having a similar experience with the &quot;new&quot; Pristiq...and going to see my dr. and get my cholesterol checked.   
Depression	jetokdl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	5/6/2010 6:23:54 AM	I have been taking Prestiq for one year. Very good for depression, but am now experiencing extremely sweating palms and soles of feet. Have not had usual weight gain experienced with Zyprexa, EffexorXR,Neurotin, and others. I believe it is time to stop; do not look forward to withdrawal!
Major Depressive Disorder	Lil Jessie, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	5/6/2010 12:56:18 AM	My depression has been severe enough to make a Christmas fruitcake blush I have lost count of how many years I was on wellbutrin after -0- responses to zoloft and lexapro I am amazed that my &quot;hot buttons&quot; are not being triggered now that I am on Pristig This medicine is very unforgiving in that it MUST be taken with food I tried it without food and I begain to feel intoxicated within 3 days This is typical of how I reflect a drug interaction requiring that I cease taking the new medication immediatlely, which I did A chat with the nurse in my neurologist's office convinced me to try again and to follow my therapist's instructions to-the-letter before panicking Sure as shooting all went well and I am all the better for it! This medication has a very good reputation please don't give up on Pristiq Review your symtoms with your doctor again I wish good heath for you all!

Depression	Harris, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	55-64	5/4/2010 8:46:16 PM	After 8 years taking Celexa and then Lexapro at 20mg - and after numerous trials with other drugs and doses over this same time period I am trying Pristiq. I felt normal through about the first week then had a terrible &quot;crash and burn&quot; which included, dizziness, inability to concentrate, extreme anxiety, emotional train wreck,etc. that lasted about 2 weeks. I have been feeling better each week now that I am through the transition. I would recommend to anyone changing over to Pristiq that they be aware of the side effects of this transition, they do it gradually and are closely monitored for by their doctor (also have a bunch of Lorazapan nearby).  However, six weeks into the Pristiq most of the side affects seem to be gone or going away and life looks pretty good again.
Neuropathic Pain	lovespugs, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/4/2010 1:16:48 PM	I love Pristique, I had been on almost every other med for my Fibro pain and this was the only one that has seemed to help and not cause me to be sick or have the strange side effects with.
Depression	lopunk, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	5/4/2010 12:13:57 PM	I started Pristiq 50mg about 5 months ago and my mother noticed how fast I put on weight. So far I have gained 50 lbs. Now I'm taking 100mg. I am calling my doctor to see what they can do for the weight gain because they medicine made a huge difference with my depression, now they have added Abilify and I read it adds weight also. I have not really noticed any other side effects. It really made a difference in my mood now if I can just get off the weight. 
Depression	missruth, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	5/2/2010 10:49:20 AM	  Four days ago I started to take a sample pack of Pristiq that my doctor gave me to help treat depression. After doing research on it, I decided to immediately discontinue the drug.  Along with depression, I also suffer from anxiety and ADD, so I am prescribed Xanax (when needed) and Adderall.  If you aren't aware, Adderall is pretty much a stimulant. Well, Pristiq is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, which also has some stimulatory effects. This now means I have 2 stimulants in my body that can likely cause an overdose of NRI (Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors) which may cause some of these horrible and uncomfortable side effects: high blood pressure, increased heart rate, severe anxiety, paranoia, dilated pupils, muscle tremors, angina, heart attack, heart failure, it can cause a coma or even death!!!!    The first time I took Pristiq was at night and I didn't get any sleep at all! The next day I crashed and slept it off. A few other side effects I have already (after only trying it for 4 days) is high blood pressure, dilated pupils, frequent urination, dry mouth, headache, a mild case of angina, I keep clenching my jaw, insomnia, I'm very hot most of the time, and my body is hurting from staying up so long.     The good side is that I think I feel a little bit happier, my mind is alert and focused, and I have more energy in the daytime if I get enough sleep the night before. All I can say is that I'm glad it was just a sample so I won't feel bad throwing it away.

I had good luck with this med the first month or 2 then went downhill.  Angry, mood swings, weight gain....  I changed back to a med i was previously on and had helped we were just hoping for even more with the Pristiq.  I am now on the other med and have been off Pristiq for 4 days and the withdrawal is AWFUL.  I am in a constant panic attack and I am now nauseated, unable to work today, this is awful.  I will not go bacak to Pristiq.  I have to get through this transition.  I feel horrible, never have had any withdrawal like this with anything I have been on.  Please pray for anyone making the transition off this med.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	4/26/2010 10:43:02 PM	Ive been on this med for a month. My moods were soso,however if I missed a dose I new it. I sleep way to much now, bad nightmars,sweating, sex drive not good. Over all its time to try something else.
Depression	exhausted, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	35-44	4/24/2010 10:15:49 PM	When I first started this medicine I thought I finally found the right one...but after approx 2-3 months I found myself very angry, severe headaches, very tired, no energy and I had gained about 10-15 pounds.  I stopped the Pristiq 2 days ago and am back on what I was on before and will just go to a higher dose of it.  Hoping that I don't have withdrawals-a little worried after reading about the withdrawals others are experiencing.  We will see.  It is very discouraging when these side effects cause you to be more depressed and down on yourself-for example the weight gain and mood swings. 
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/24/2010 12:57:46 PM	I began suffering from severe headaches almost 1 year ago.  After trying several migraine meds, my doctor put me on Pristiq.  My headaches disappeared within 2 days.  The only side effect for me has been loss of appetite.  This is not a bad thing.  I've been trying to lose weight for a long time and this is helping.  I have gotten several friends on it for depression and they love it!
Depression	sunbunny541, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/23/2010 4:41:36 PM	Very satisfied with this medication. First one I have tried, but very happy with the results.. I feel like a new person. Very happy.  Only side effect is dry mouth, but not bad at all. I would highly recommend this medication. It truly has changed my life for the better.

My first review was this is a great medication.  Finding out I was misdiagnosed by my doctor, my new doctor wants to take me off Pristiq.  After reading some of the reviews on here about the withdrawls im not sure I want to go through that but I dont want to stay on meds I dont need, Pristiq &amp; welbutrin.

When I was first put on it, it made me feel suicidal,and I  had to hospitalized for 2 days. When the in-patient &quot;shrink&quot; increased the dosage from 50-100 mg , my mental health started to improve. I've been on it for nearly a year, and now I notice that it's making me feel &quot;just plain numb&quot; and I have no sex drive and I eat too much and I've gained at least 20 pounds! I'm going to ask my doctor to put me on something else. Hopefully, then will I be able to finally feel like myself again.

Although Pristiq is advertized to have no problem with withdrawal, I experienced difficulty that was at least as difficult as when I discontinued Effexor.   I hope others don't have this problem, but if they do, they are not alone.

The Dr increased my dose to 100 for the last three months and now I have had to be put on Bystolic for racing heart rate at 117, and feeling like I was going to pass out after walking for ten minutes, after taking an ativan to slow it. I also have blurred vision and joint pain and swelling with a increase in my Uric Acid and enlarged red blood cells. I have also had a zapping sensation if I didn't take it at the same time daily. While reviewing the reviews I have seen at least 6 - 8 reviews with similar symptons out of maybe 100 that I looked at. Think they need to look at this closer!

Some good things about getting off this med...digestive system has returned to normal (thank God), have a sex drive again, not eating so much (gained 10 to 15 pounds on this med), I am laughing and crying again.

Depression	kronikles , 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	45-54	4/14/2010 7:45:58 PM	I have had Blurred Vision, some hair loss, confusion, ringing in the ears, sexual problems, trouble with comprehension and retaining information.  Problems reading.  It has helped with my depression but it has many more side effects than any other anti-depressant I have ever taken. Unfortunately, I have taken about everything and Pristiq (25mg only, half a pill) has helped with the depression the most.  It is just a tradeoff as far as I can tell.

No side effects for me. Wonderful.

This is the 1st time I've been on medication &amp; take 100 mg prescribed for anxiety. I've gained 40 lbs in 8 months, and feel lazy all the time. You lose motivation &amp; concentration. This is so unlike me-I no longer pay bills on time, don't even open the mail. I was a clean freak, &amp; now cant get enough energy to even pick up after myself &amp; just have a &quot;don't care&quot; or &quot;whatever&quot; attitude. No energy but an insomniac. You'll find yourself napping in the afternoon &amp; walking around in a HAZE, then up all night. So it must have a calming effect-but this is extreme zombie-ism! I'd go back to having anxiety &amp; energy. Cant wait to STOP takin this!
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/10/2010 12:13:15 PM	This medicine has worked better than any of the others I have tried. I have taken Paxil, Zoloft and the others similar to those. Within a short time I was feeling allot better. The only side effect I notice and I am assuming it is from the medicine is when I get a headache it seems my temple area is sore but my overall depression I feel excellent and there seems to be non of the sexual side effects which was one of the reason I switched from the previous kinds.
Depression	terrix2001, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/8/2010 4:02:49 PM	I started Prisiq on 3/22/10. The main side effects were not sleeping well and night sweats. This lasted only about 4 nights. A bit of nausea, not enought that I couldn't handle and that was it. I am now on my 3rd week and I am doing fine. I do feel much better, and have more energy, since before the Pristiq, all I was doing was sleeping. If someone has never taken an antidepressant, the side effects can be alarming. I went cookoo and no sex drive on Zoloft and Cymbalta. Pristiq, whatever is different about this SRNI seems to keep me at an even keel. I will give Pristiq at least 3 months before I give a full report.

Depression	crazymamaof2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	4/6/2010 11:28:43 AM	I have been on Pristiq for almost 2 yrs. After having my son in 2008, whom was born with a heart defect, I became severly depressed. After trying zoloft, and lexapro, both made me feel very sick, doctor said to try Pristiq. I noticed a great difference, I was able to deal with my son being sick, all seemed well, he needed to have open heart surgery at 9mnths. He is doing awesome now, wish I could say the same for myself. After his surgery in 09', I noticed a huge down fall in my health. I started having severe panic attacks. Went to cardiologist, had lots of test done, they found a hole in my heart, personally I think its from Pristiq. I have been healthy my whole life I now feel like I am on my death bed. I had heart surgery in Feb 2010, I'm still having the panic attacks and dizziness, pain all over my body, blurry vision, headacks, terrible brain zapps, sweaty, cold sweats, can't sleep(so I take Ambien), chest pains so bad I can't breathe. Had to goto the hospital last week for chest pains cause I almost passed out, they found Gallstones, so I now have to have my gallbladder removed!! Pristiq may have helped my depression, but I think its killing my body. I want off, but I'm afraid of the withdrawls!

No heart problems, no high blood pressure and no high cholestrol, but 2 months and 2 days after taking this medication I was in the hospital with a heart attack, high blood pressure and high cholestrol. I had to have 2 stents put in due to having a dissecting aneurysm of coronary artery. I believe that the Pristiq was the cause but can not prove this. I will have to be on the Plavix, BP medication and cholerstol medication for the rest of my life.

I needed an increase as my moods got darker and didn't realize it. Now after the increase I am normal again. This is the best medication I have ever taken.

Major Depressive Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	3/31/2010 12:39:11 PM	After being on this medication for almost a year I realized that I was still extremely emotional. I decided that I wanted to stop taking the medication because it wasn't helping me completely.  Why put a drug into your body if it wasn't going to do you any  good? My doctor told me to either just &quot;stop&quot; taking it or she could could put me on a low dose of Prozac for 3 weeks to help relieve the withdrawal symtoms.  I chose to take the Prozac.  It has been 5 days without the Pristiq &amp; I feel like I am losing my mind.  If I was told before hand that I was going to be constantly dizzy, weak, moody and wanting to vomit all the time I would have never put this drug in my body.  When you start taking a new medication your informed of the side effects, but your never warned of what can happen if you try to stop.  I now am very careful as to what I agree to take and I make sure to do my research.  You should do the same...
Major Depressive Disorder	autumnalfall, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/30/2010 9:53:17 AM	I have been on anti-depressants for 12 years. The last 6, i was on effexor XR 225 mg. But i started experiencing zombie-like effects, wanting to sleep all of the time, lack of motivation, and i definitely couldn't keep up with my 4 yr old and i'm only 25! I decided to try Pristiq, since it was similar to effexor xr, which had worked for a good amount of time. I was told i could just stop the effexor, without weaning, and replace it with the 50mg Pristiq. Bad idea. Horrible withdrawal. So i weaned myself off Effexor, while taking Pristiq, and felt much better. Since being on Pristiq alone, i feel more alert, energetic, and easy going. I'm not sleeping 10+ hours. I feel well rested after 7-8 hours. The only side-effects i've had have been slight withdrawal a few hours before my next dose, but i feel that will go away after a few more months. I do get more frequent headaches, but the benefits have outweighed something a dose of Tylenol fixes. Of course, this medication will not work for everyone. It took many different meds before I had success with one. And yes, withdrawal from any SSRI can be horrible, but you need to slowly lower the dose, over several weeks, or even months, to lessen the severity. Never stop cold turkey.

For once in my life, there is an antidepressant thats not causing me to be sluggish or gain weight.  If you can make it past the week, there is a nasty headache and nausea, but it subsides on the 7th day. i took the pill at bedtime and the nauseas and headache were not as bad. after a about three weeks, i woke up from my funk! suddenly everything was clear and my mind was able to focus. and i can tell when i skip a dose.  my friends and family can tell when i miss a dose.  i highly recommend. i cant imagine living with out it. 
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	3/23/2010 10:19:37 PM	Side effects are horrible. Light-headed feeling when I turned my head. Woke up middle of night with heart racing and felt like I couldn't breathe. I was only on it for 12 days, went back to Dr. with these side effects. Had an EKG which showed irregular rythym (skipping heartbeat). Now I have to go back for echocardiogram, stress test and possible heart cath. Don't chance this. It needs more study and more emphasis on these horrible side effects. It should be taken off the market. It also made me sweat so bad like an intensified hot flash and more frequent. 
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	3/23/2010 5:32:35 PM	I have been on Pristiq for several months now, after switching from Lexapro.  I have very few side-effects, and it has helped me feel &quot;normal&quot;.  I don't find that this anti-depressant makes me numb to anything that happens; however, I do feel like it helps me cope better through clear thinking.  I still have emotions (As opposed to the lack of emotion I had with previous drug therapies), but they are not over-taking my life.  I can tell a huge difference when I exercise, too, due to the natural de-stressor that provides.  The one negative I will say is how I feel if I miss a dose.  I wouldn't say that I felt like I was going to &quot;die&quot; as a previous poster had, but there was intense dizziness.  Remember: everyone is different, and it may affect you different than any of us posting.  Be open-minded about the drug therapies, and add a little bit of exercise in somehow, or talk to a therapist.  I believe that the successful treatment of depression comes from a variety of things, not just a drug.
Depression	sick, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	3/22/2010 12:47:47 AM	I had been on pristiq 50mg for about 6 months. Durning this I found that it wasnt working for me so my doctor increased the dose to 100mg a day which was fine for about two weeks. Then it all started to happern. Over the next two months I went through every side effect possiable from sweats,shakes,vomiting, chronic-upper quadrant pain, nausea,headaches,panic attacks,dizziness, fainting, insomina and the list goes on. After 18 times of being taken to the hospital. It just got beyond a joke( no-one beleives you as you have deppression)in the end I just went cold turkey off every thing. After all the medication I was on cause as they did not find a medical problem. So they put it down to in your head.I belive this medication should have more research done on it as it is very dangerous to some people im still going through the withdrawal sympton which are just as bad as being on this. i feel sorry for all the people that have suffered like i have.DANGER STAY AWAY FROM THIS MEDICATION

I am on my 5th day witn prinstiq 50 mg. Felt its effects by the second day. My energy level is great (I could sleep all day for the last 4 years).Was on Effexor XR for a few years.

Dr. increased dose to 100mg still had no real change in depression but after taking 100mg dose for 7 days woke up and couldn't see. everything was a blur, and it felt like I was wearing a hat or had someone squeezing my head. I stopped taking pristiq immediately. Some of my vision has returned but still can't read overhead road signs until I am right under them. also cant distinguish red from orange. Have been off of drug for 23 days, vision still hasn't changed or reverted back. Wonderful drug if you want to feel your way through life.

Depression	lollyo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/18/2010 9:28:54 AM	I have had depression since I was 5 years old. I tried wellbutrin,zoloft, in my teens with no results, prozac worked for me for 10 years then stopped working. I then tried celexa and it worked for 2 yrs then stopped. I have just tried to live with my depression and anxiety for many years. After my hysterectomy a few years ago my depression has been harder to overcome, especially since my husband was recently diagnosed with bipolar and all the problems that come with it, as well as my having a chronically sick child at home. My doctor put me back on prozac which (within 3 days)made my depression 100 times worse than ever! She then suggested I try the Pristiq because so many of her patients were having great results. Within 2 days I was feeling better than I had my whole life! The only side effects were dizziness,slight vivid dreams,mild nausea(all just for the first week)and my appetite is so much easier to control now! I have gained 90 pounds since my hysterectomy and was always starving,with sugar and carb cravings, but on Pristiq I actually forget to eat, and am able to make healthy food choices since the cravings are under control. Hopefully with this I can lose weight and get my newly diagnosed diabetes under control. I feel like I have hope for my depression now and I don't feel as socially anxious, nervous, and withdrawn from people. I have had several mild headaches since taking this but overall I am feeling great! I have temporary Medicaid which (suprise) does cover this medication, but I am concerned about paying for it when my Medicaid runs out. I have been on this medication for just over 4 weeks now.
Neuropathic Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	3/15/2010 2:18:09 PM	I was started on this medication about 3 weeks ago for Fibromyalgia. To my surprise, I'm not having that horrible pain anymore. I'm also not noticing any side effects. The first couple of days I was kind of gassy but that went away. I take it every evening after dinner.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	3/14/2010 1:58:28 PM	I have been on Pristiq for about 2 years now. I have missed doses in the past and it is very frightening. I thought I was dying the first time it happened. Then I called my doctor and looked online, and realized this is normal if you miss a dose. So now I feel like a prisoner. I'm scared to go off the medication because I never want to feel that again! I think the effectiveness of the drug has worn off significantly in the past year or so. Since I have been on it for so long, I don't know if it is just life situations or the meds that are causing me so much grief. I have zero energy all day, I am sore when I wake, I have to fight napping and most of the time I give in. I have had bad days more and more often. I feel like this drug no longer is helping me, but I am scared to go off of it and I am also weary of going back to the routine of trying new antidepressants. It sounds awful.

Depression	half-baked-lasagna, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	35-44	3/12/2010 9:24:14 PM	Wow, reading some of these comments really scares me.  I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 1998, endometriosis in 2001, (for which I've had over two dozen surgeries and due for another), and have degenerative disc disease and a herniated disc since 1994, all causing debilitating pain. The pain in turn has caused severe depression, and I was first prescribed Paxil. After taking it for a few months, I tried to commit suicide by downing a whole bottle.  I didn't take anything for a few years, lost my 2-week-old son (born 15 weeks early, due to endo.)  Shortly after, I was prescribed Effexor, Doxepin, and Xanax.  I felt great until I lost my insurance and had to stop everything at once.  A few months later, I got pregnant with my daughter, so couldn't take anything, but shortly after she was born, new Dr. disagreed with fibro diagnosis and prescribed Prozac, which drove me so nuts I wanted to pull my hair out, then Wellbutrin, same results, then Zyprexa,an anti-psychotic that screwed with my depth perception and caused me to fall and injure myself more than a few times, then Trazadone, Remeron, Ativan, Klonopin,Cymbalta,, which caused severe vomiting.  Finally another drug that, when I told my Dr. I wanted to drive off a bridge, she suggested a 5150/psych evaluation in the hospital for 3 days.  Sorry, I'm a mom and I'm not crazy.  Returned to original Dr. about five months ago and started taking Pristiq.  What a difference.  I felt an overall calmness one day, and so much stress seemed to just fade away.  The only problems I have had are weight gain, (enough for my Dr. to check my thyroid, LOL), and if I don't take it first thing in the morning, I vomit for the rest of the day, even if I take it later in the morning, and I see the full tablet in the vomit.  I know it's gross, but I'm really concerned, tonight I came home with my daughter and had to pee really bad, and as soon as I sat down, I threw up.  No warning, no nausea, headache, nothing.  This has happened twice

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	3/11/2010 12:24:09 AM	I began taking Pristiq around Nov/Dec 09.  I was on Prozac before and wasn't getting results from it.  After discussion with the doctor he decided to change me to Pristiq. He started me on 50 mg then increased to 100 mg and then to 200 mg before I felt 'normal'.  However, Jan 2010 I went from being on 'cloud nine' to planning my suicide and was very depressed.  I went to my monthly psych appt and my doctor was shocked to hear of my drastic change.  After that visit I begged my husband on valentine's day to let me die because the pain (depression) was too overwhelming.  Seeing my husband collapse before me in tears I decided to slowly wein myself off this drug and the other mood stablizer (Lamotrigine 200 mg).  I reduced both to 100 mg for 3 weeks then reduced to 50 mg for two weeks then went 'cold turkey'.  Believe it or not I started feeling better.  I am still off the drugs (all) and I feel better off of them than I was on them.  My problem is that they would work for a month or two then symptoms would get worse. The drug has some major side effects especially if you miss a dosage.  I recommend those struggling with depression and finding the right medication talk to your doctors about possible other hormone imbalances that might be the reason for your depression.  I have thyroid nodules and borderline hypothyrodism (according to my doctor) which can cause mood changes such as depression.  Just FYI!  I pray that each of you find the right answer to your struggle to overcome this illness.  Remember that you are not alone in this struggle and there are so many options for treatment and causes...God bless you and keep you.

This worked very well,but then rather quickly put on twenty pounds.  The Dr. was sure it was the Lexapro so switched me three months to Pristiq.  I switched in one day with a perfect transition.  Then after after about one month started EXTREME fatigue. Literally have slept weekends away.  Can barely get through a workday and have to go to bed before dinner.  I just realized it has to be the Pristiq.  I have appt to make changes yet again.  
Depression	cabogirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	3/10/2010 12:01:06 PM	I initially reviewed this drug after taking it for a couple of months &amp; at that time, other than the initial side effects that I experienced (insomnia, jittery, etc..) I was very satisfied, it lifted me out of my depression and helped me get through a difficult period in my life. Fast forward 6 months and my view of this drug has changed entirely. For me, Pristiq after about 2 months, I became very tired throughout the day, my blood pressure increased, triglycerides &amp; cholesterol increased (which I had never had a problem with prior to taking the drug), and overall - I just didn't feel good. I saw another Dr. who helped me ween off of the drug... and let me just say - what a nightmare! I've never been on any other antidepressant so I have nothing to compare it to, but this has been a truly miserable experience.. so much so that I will never go back on ANY antidepressant. Extreme dizziness/vertigo (which I've learned are brain zaps), nightmarish dreams, insomnia again, headaches, irritability. The list goes on &amp; on. I stopped taking Pristiq nearly 2 months ago &amp; am just now beginning to feel normal again. I still have the occasional zaps &amp; dizzy feeling. For awhile I was scared that they would never go away! I understand this drug works wonders for some people, I just have to caution you about the withdrawal symptoms when you decide to discontinue the med. This is a difficult (if not impossible) drug to taper down as most of us are prescribed the lowest dose to start off with  - 50 mg. I tried the every 36 hours, every other day, every 2 days - and it was like my body was on a roller coaster. Finally decided after 3 weeks to just cold turkey it. And the nightmare began! Anyway - this has been a long review - I apologize... I just would not recommend this drug to anyone if for no other reason that the awful withdrawal symptoms.

This side effect would keep me from taking a larger dose of Pristiq.

I only had about 3 bad days a month. after the 3rd month everything started going down hill. my depression and anxiety have gotten worse. I feel numb most of the time, and the only emotions I feel are anger, depression, and anxiety. I feel so disconnected with everything, I have no motivation to do anything. I lost my ability to love anything/anyone. I feel worse than ever before.
Depression	phxpamm, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	3/2/2010 3:07:01 AM	I changed from Cymbalta to Pristiq about 6 months ago because Cymbalta took away all my energy and made my depression worse. Pristiq works fairly well on the depression. I have had insomnia since I started Pristiq, along with a lot more energy. I lost 40 lbs that I needed to lose since starting this drug. I've just started having blurred vision. It seems to get worse as the day goes on. It's bad enough to keep me from driving at night. I still have &quot;depressed days&quot; but have other health issues that contribute so I'm not sure if it's the medication or something else. If there's a drug that works without so many side effects I'd like to know what it is so I can go out after dark again.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	2/28/2010 2:45:31 AM	I really liked the way this medicine affected my mental state. When I was on it I had the desire to go out and do things again. I switched from Lexapro to this because the Lexapro made me want to veg all day. It completely took away my desire for my husband but about a week after taking Pristiq I started to 'feel' when he kissed me. I have since had to stop taking this medication because I discovered it was giving me a mild form of hives. I ruled out everything else, from bedbugs to fleas (we have a dog.) and the only thing left was the meds because I was getting 'bit' and my husband was not. My doctor told me to stop taking the medicine for a few days. Going off of it cold turkey was a very big mistake. The hives stopped, yes, but I was constantly dizzy. When I got home from work I started crying, laughing and shaking all at the same time and I could not stop. I screamed and kicked things and felt like I had no control over myself at all. I wanted to kill myself. My doctor and I will have a talk about this wonderful idea of hers...but I wanted to warn others about what could happen.

I cannot stay awake, I can sleep for 12-20 hours a day.  wHEN i READ THE COMMENTS OF ONE PERSONS SLEEPINESS, I AM REAL CONCERNED.I need to speak with my doctor.  I have taken Pristiq for months now.  Being so tired has be terrified.  Also I am in a brain fog.
Depression	hmoore76, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/22/2010 5:26:42 PM	I have only been on this medication for 3 weeks and i have noticed a significant change for the better in my depressive mood and behaviors.  I feel better about myself and have more energy.  I do not notice any negative side effects.  I came off of Paxil and went onto this medication and noticed an increase/recovery in my sex drive. I sleep good at night and things that were bothering me before do not seem to be as big of an issue as before.  I am very greatful that my physician gave me a trial on this medication.  I was afraid that I would have to medication hop again, to find the right drug for me once I noticed that my Paxil wasn't working and I couldn't increase the dosage.  I was on Paxil for approximately 2 years.  I haven't known any others on this medication so I am basing my guidelines on my own personal experience.
Major Depressive Disorder	Serenbean, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/22/2010 1:56:15 PM	I started taking Pristiq because of the weight gain that Paxil was causing. I did not get the loss of appetite or weight loss side effects but I stopped feeling like I was starving and empty all the time. Still having times with trouble sleeping but that is getting better. Memory loss is also getting better. All in all I feel normal again...and that is a wonderful thing.

Depression	heartfelt3, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	2/21/2010 12:49:28 PM	i have watched my loved one take pristiq for 2 weeks. The 1st few days were kinda like an energy boost, seemed like medication will help, although, 2 weeks is required before full benefit. By the 5th day, less energy causing more forgetfullness. After one week, memory loss worsens during conversations, headache's &amp; very sleepy during the day. I witnessed an almost passing out, while my loved one was driveing a car, and that is VERY SCAREY TO OBSERVE! My concern level orbited at that moment. The next day, while watching a favorite movie, my loved one passed out. I Thank God we were home.  I would say to Everyone, Please check out your prescribed medication before agreeing to take it. your dr.'s may be educated in your symptom's, but we know our body and mind. Your loved ones can help pay special attention to  side affects, so  before decideing what your going to be dealing with, its in our best interest to talk it over with someone close, and keep dr.'s informed, because so many of us love so much of you, we are there and we care. Learning skills are far more beneficial than relying on a pill, and even when medication is needed, so is therapy, and that does not come in the form of a pill. My loved one say's, i'de rather deal with my depression than feel like this, because i felt better when i woke up, had breakfast. And then, i took my pill, and now i can't stay awake.  Now, we will not give up, but will stop the medication, and continue to be educated. My prayers are with you, and always hold onto something you love in your heart. God bless you all.
Depression	up too late, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/21/2010 3:51:05 AM	Best so far and I've been on and off for 10 years. Not the sexual side effects of lexapro and not the flattening moods. I can still cry when I'm supposed to, which is something i missed. A cry feels good sometimes. Just not all the time.
Other	ilola, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	2/16/2010 9:30:41 PM	Thought I was satisfied until I had to stop taking bc of my insurance.  I am extremely dizzy (which would happen if I forgot a dose) and very very moody.  It was not worth it.
Depression	silver_peach, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	2/15/2010 1:04:11 PM	It works if I don't miss a dose.  I forgot to take it one day, and I thought I was going mad.  My mind was tormented with every sad thought that had occurred it my life.  It didn't dawn on me until around 6 PM that I had missed my morning dosage.  Within 30 minutes of taking the missed dose, I was fine.  This may not be common, but I know now it is important that I not miss a dose. I have never had anything like this happen and it frightened me in a way that I have never known.

In the past I suffered from PMS and took Prozac and it was effective, but after the start of menopause it loss it's effectiveness and or just wasn't the correct med. for this new roller coaster ride. My NP asked to to try Pristiq. And I did and am completely satisfied. The only drawback that I have seen is that if I miss 2 or dosages, then I begin withdrawals and that is uncomfortable. This drug must be titrated to avoid these side effects.

A year later, I'm trying to wein off of it, but have the &quot;zapping&quot;, feelings of mild electric shock.  I don't like side effects.
Depression	Ceejay J., 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	2/5/2010 3:05:00 PM	I have been taking Pristiq for about three months after eight years on Zoloft.  Zoloft worked in the beginning but became ineffective in the recent years.  Pristiq was recommended by my doctor because of its additional energy boost qualities.  It's okay but not great.  I got severe headaches from missing one dose...and feel dizzy routinely.  But I'll continue for a while longer before I search for another suitable anti-anxiety/depression counter.
Depression	Delaney, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	35-44	2/5/2010 2:28:15 PM	I've been using Pristiq for around 6 months after my Zoloft stopped working a year ago.  While it has alleviated my depression somewhat, I find that it's akin to drinking weak coffee: it's better than nothing, but it's a poor substitute for something fully caffinated.  I am still searching for a more effective anti-depressant, as Pristiq does work effectively for me.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	2/5/2010 10:50:43 AM	Been on this almost a year. I'm unhappy with the weight gain. I already had ringing in my ears, but it has increased it tremendously. Now i'm experiencing eye twitching which seems to be getting worse by the week and my vision has changed a great deal. But depression is better,don't know how, the side effects are depressing in themselves. I've tried to get off and I can't stand the withdrawl symptoms, so I just take it and dread it.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	2/3/2010 12:25:52 PM	I was on Zoloft 50 mg and wanted to change to another med because of the affective flattening, apathy and sexual side effects I was having. My doctor switched me to Pristiq 50 mg. I was able to tolerate the medication fine (no surprise because I was on Effexor several years ago). I felt more energetic than I had on Zoloft, but the sexual side effects persisted and even worsened. Also, after about a week, I started experiencing irritability, never-ending hunger and bloating, which I honestly chalked up to PMS. The timing made sense to me. However, after I got my period, the assumed PMS remained and even worsened, as did the weight gain. I was in a rage, swearing at people in cars, breaking things around the house, and so on.  I called my doctor to see if these were transient concerns and he immediately took me off the Pristiq and put me back on Zoloft to get my mood stabilized before coming up with another plan.

Depression	Jo-Ann, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/30/2010 10:52:36 PM	I have tried over 7 or 8 of the top medications for depression and found the best results with the least amount of side effects with Pristiq. I am not bipolar. I have been diagnosed with depression for over 30 years. Prozac was my first medication but life circumstances worsened my depression. Only my faith kept me from ending my life. I pray for all of you reading this who can relate to the tremendous pain of depression. God bless and hope you keep trying these new meds that are out there.

I have been on Pristiq for over a year. Positive effects were apparent immediately; there have been absolutely no side effects. I feel more &quot;OK&quot; and at ease than ever before except childhood. I take the Pristiq each morning. Twice I have missed it without adverse effects. I have had insomnia since puberty, but now I even sleep better.

Depression	RX-jo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	45-54	1/28/2010 2:46:39 PM	I was overwhelmed by how effective this medication is.... and shocked as I had tried almost all other anti-depressives.  However, due to my insurance drug gatekeeper, I could not get my script filled promptly and had to go without this drug for 3-4 days.  Then I experienced a seizure - something I have never encountered before.  This is a known side effect but there is no verbiage that you cannot just 'quit' this drug without adverse effects.  A warning must be included when prescribing this drug to inform the patient.

It has caused severe hypertension for me-being weaned off it it right now and taking 4 pills daily to keep my blood pressure in a range that is almost acceptable until I can get off of it! It has some norepinephrine effect that causes this! Just please monitor your blood pressure-I am a RN and thought I was falling apart. Tachycardia, elevated blood pressure and memory loss are the side effects I have experienced...proceed with caution!
Depression	emilykp, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	1/25/2010 10:57:49 PM	This medication is not the first that I had taken for Depression and GAD.  However, it was almost the last.  While on this medication, I had the most unbearable anxiety and thoughts of suicide.  The suicidal thoughts were so scary.  Plus, I had such strange energy, I didn't know if I wanted to laugh or cry most of the time.  I ended up in the ER after several days of not being able to stop vomiting in the mornings and having no apetite during the day. It was determined that the medication had pushed me into a manic state, something I never experienced before.  So, before I can go back on anti depressants to fix the issues I was having initially, I now have to be on mood stabilizers for a week.  This medication is truly the devil.

Bipolar Depression	BridgetTeacher, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/24/2010 11:35:37 AM	I was quite pleased with Pristiq, I began taking it at 26.  I have definitely felt serious improvement from my depression symptoms.  My side effects:  Definitive decrease in appetite, I lost weight when I started and continue to have less of an appetite than I used to. My appetite has gotten better since the beginning though.  I don't mind that side effect.  The other one is a significant decrease in sex drive.  That part sucks.  It is having a serious effect on my life.  My doctor says it won't change at this point.  That scares me, because now I am afraid to go off of it.

Depression	DAWN6463, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	1/17/2010 8:16:28 PM	I had been so depressed I honestly had not worked in month and was falling behind on all of my bills. I begged my doctor to let me try Pristiq. He did not like the idea because he knew my financial situation and was worried I would get worse if I had to come off the medicine, and that it would cause a worse financial hardship.I wrote a letter to Wythe the maker of Pristiq explaining my situation. Wythe approved me for 1 YEAR FREE, if after 6 weeks with trial packs their Pristiq made me feel better. I have not felt this good in over 8 months! I have been on Pristiq since last October (4 months) and I love it. I have energy. I did notice after a couple months the energy slowed down some...but honestly even though I love having energy, I was running about 90 mph the first couple months so the slow down was fine. My depression is under control. I LOVE this medicine and Wythe Labs for giving me back my life. Dawn

But after that it got much better. This is the first Depression/anxiety drug i have been on, i tend to stay away from xanax and prozac due to see the effects of it on others. The good thing is only taking 50 mg once a day. But when i forget to take it once in a great while, it does give me a nasty headache and i tend to get really irritable.  
Depression	annabella, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/7/2010 1:11:26 PM	What I want to stress is NOT that this is the best drug for depression out there, but rather that it is the best drug for depression FOR ME. I've been on Celexa, Lexapro, and Cymbalta before starting Pristiq, and none of them worked nearly, even half, as well as the Pristiq (plus, they had horrendous side effects). I had no idea before I began taking the Pristiq that the experience of taking an SSRI could even be this satisfying...it is seriously as if I am taking nothing, but I feel normalized after serious and prolonged depression. No side effects (okay, some teeth clenching and foot shaking, but that's nothing compared to the others I tried), works like an amazing charm.The moral of my testimonial is that you SHOULDN'T GIVE UP! Keep trying different antidepressants until you find the one that works FOR YOU! Everyone's brain chemistry is slightly different, so what works for me isn't necessarily the answer for you. But there is hope (I had nearly given up on the whole SSRI thing)! Keep trying!

Depression	can't remember, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	1/3/2010 7:11:45 PM	Been taking Pristiq for about 6 months. First week was pure hell but then seem to be working well....maybe too well.  I didnt get upset when I should have been upset. After about 4 months the permanent side effects started slowly appearing one by one. Severe constipation, memory loss, cant focus, numbness in my arms when I wake up, fatigue especially in the evenings, blurred vision, heart palpitations,  and probably others just cant think of them all. A light bulb went off in my head and I decided to read this blog and guess what...its the Pristiq! I am lowering my dose to &#189; tablet per day for a week and then &#189; every other day for a week and try to get myself off of this stuff. I started a new job and found that I cant remember anything or focus. It will take more than an antidepressant if I lose this job. I didnt realize it would take a few months for some of the bad side effects to start appearing.
Depression	SheriMcNevin, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	1/3/2010 3:09:29 PM	I have taken Pristiq for less than three months so far. As far as treating depressed thoughts and behavior, it has worked wonders. However, in the short time I've been using it, I have been over eating like crazy and gaining weight. When first introduced to Pristiq, there were few side effects known about it yet... but now I'm sitting here ashamed that in less than 3 months I gained 40 pounds! Always had been the 'skinny one' while growing up, I now am unable to fit all but two pairs of jeans and nothing else seems to fit anymore.Be careful when deciding whether or not to use Pristiq. I experienced rapid weight gain and trouble controlling how much I ate. Appetite satisfaction is hard to control and I often find myself eating more and more until my tummy is full and bloated (a few times too full to keep down).  Please think about how much you love wearing those cute pants before trying this, because you might not be able to fit them anymore! :*(

My dosage was upped to 75mg and after a week began causing my normal migraines to increase in number and pain level.  Taking my normal dosage of Excedrine did nothing to alleviate the pain.  Lowering the dosage of Pristiq did nothing to fix this and my depression returned.  Having been off it for three days the migraines persist and my irritability is far worse then before.  Despite the migraines, this medicine has worked the best of the four antidepressants I have tried.

The first thing I notices was a change in my appetite, I could hardly eat a thing.  On the fifth day of taking this medication I came down with a cold.  I couldn't get out of the bed for 2 days. Luckily it was on Saturday and Sunday so, I didn't have to miss work, however I found it very difficult to get up Monday morning and was 2 hours late to work.  Monday and Tuesday night I could only sleep about 30 minutes at a time.  Resulting in about 3-4 hours of sleep each night.  This morning, although I couldn't sleep soundly I found it very hard to get up and come to work.  After being at work for about 1 hour I started experiencing, dizziness, anxiety, shortness of breath, clinching my jaws, etc...  I decided to look up this website and see what people had to say about the medicine.  I was shocked to read some of the side effects people are having with this drug.  Then I started thinking back to the past 9 days I have been taking this drug and realized I have been having way more side effects than I thought would be connected to this drug.  I will NOT take another pill.  I understand there are withdrawl side effects but, I am willing to weather the storm to get back to the calm.

I am very calm and I was a ragging person prior to this medication. It is great I don't let things upset me. Hi bloodpressure and migrains,fatiuge are the side affects. I do not want to increase the doesage of my blood pressure med to lower my blood preasure because of more increased sied affects. What a merry go round. where does it end. Is there a real Doctor in the house? 
Depression	COCO, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	12/28/2009 1:01:05 PM	I started on Pristiq and on the 10th day, I got an allergic reaction to it. My lips, hands and feet swelled up, hives all over my body and constant itching. I'm now on 200 mg/day of Benadryl for seven days before I can try a new anti-depressant. this is not a normal side effect, I just happen to get one of the more severe reactions. I am quite disappointed and upset about it, especially since I had to go thru Christmas with this and now New Year's Eve.

I was on pristiq for about a year and a half, had some feelings of being down but they always subsided.   Because pristiq was costing me $60 a month I asked if the doctor could put me on something similar that would cost $10. He prescribes Wellbutrin XL. 150 mg.  I'm feeling so much more depressed on the Wellbutrin. Maybe it's in my mind or it's the holiday blues, not sure.  I'm going to give it about another week on the Wellbutrin before I ask the dr to switch me back to the Pristiq.  I really feel the Pristiq is a wonderful drug for depression.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	12/27/2009 7:39:53 PM	Getting used to the drug takes a couple of weeks but then I started to not feel like I was &quot;taking something.&quot;  I felt normal and my issue was having horrible periods and being a total jerk and emotional the week before and the week of my period.  I was thinking it wasnt enough to be on a constant medicine but then realized that two weeks out of the month is half a year and would equal to half of my life being irritable and angry.  This medicine has helped me out by chilling me out, not being so paranoid, and having a MUCH happier marriage!  
Depression	sugarshack, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	12/26/2009 11:32:27 PM	This is a horrible medication.  It is very unforgiving if you should skip just one dose.  I have experienced headache, stomach issues, dizziness, sleepiness, increased bp, and fuzzy thinking.  I am currently trying to wean myself off of it...do not take this medication!  IT is nasty!

At first the side effects ( lack of sleep, reslessness, sweating) were quite bothersome but I kept on track and changed to taking it at night. I almost feel normal if there is a &quot;normal&quot; anymore.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	12/23/2009 8:59:14 AM	I was recently given a sample pack of Pristiq for a bout of minor depression and anxiety. I took Zoloft for about 6 months, 10 years ago for the same symptoms. As a former drug rep, I was apprehensive about Pristiq but the doctor raved about the lack of side effects. I took one dose with lunch and I never took it again! I felt like I was in a drug-induced fog. My pupils were completely dialated (a side effect) like I was high. I was up all night, worst night sleep of my life. I woke up with a horrible headache. After reading the withdrawl symptoms, it wasn't a drug I wanted to continue to &quot;try&quot; just to feel crappy and then have to discontinue.Maybe because it is an SNRI, or the constant release form, or no titration, but Pristiq was way too much for me. I couldn't wait for 24 hours to pass so it could get out my system and I could feel &quot;normal&quot; again. Now I'm giving Zoloft a try because it worked for me before.

The side effects got much worse. Blurred vision, extreme fatique, memory issues, headaches, lack of focus (almost zombie like). Now I&quot;m still depressed and feel like crap! Withdrawal is terrible! Weaning myself off, now I have nausea, headaches and have missed days of work. I also think it weakens your immune system. I haven't had a cold in 4 yrs. and now I have one for 5 weeks I can't get rid of! Really horrible drug!!! Good luck if you take this.
Depression	Feelingbetter, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	12/21/2009 4:10:55 PM	I've never posted on my med experiences before but I really love Pristiq. I have problems with anxiety and depression but since I've been taking Pristiq I've notice that those anxious and sad feelings are short lived. They sometimes pop into my thoughts but then I just move past it and don't seem to dwell on things anymore. The main issue has been trouble with having an orgasm, I'm going to wait it out and hope that part becomes easier. Overall I am a lot happier since switching from Wellbutrin XL.

My insurance company denied the prescription until I had tried another drug.  So, Zoloft was next.  It was awful.  The sweating and being unable to concentrate was the worst.  Finally I am back on Pristiq and even after just a few days, I am feeling better and liking life a lot more!

I was on Zoloft, which I LOVED except the sexual side effects.  Not only was I not interested, I could not even feel a thing or orgasm.  I have anxiety, mild depression and anger issues.  I have been a basket case since I quit the Zoloft 3 weeks ago.Can anyone comment on the sexual side effects of this drug?  My doc says it is supposed to be better than Zoloft for this reason.Thanks!!!!
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	12/14/2009 2:04:20 PM	For day to day depression it works fine.  I had a major upset in my life that caused me to enter a very deep state of depression that required more than just Pristiq. Trying to get off the med is hell. I suffer severe head zapping or shivers if I even miss a dose by a few hours. I am planning to become pregnant and have to go off the med completely. My doctor can't recommend anything to do in order to go off the med without the severe side effects.

I've experienced none of the side effects that I've had with others (Zoloft, Cymbalta).   I have more energy during the day;  I'm sleeping better at night; and love having less appetite than I had with the other meds.  The only draw-back for me is the cost.  With this being a fairly new medication, my insurance company will not cover it at all.  I'm sick &amp; tired of the insurance companies controlling my health care.  I'd like to leave that up to my doctor, my pharmacist &amp; me.

A few years ago, I got on Cymbalta.  I felt it worked well so I stayed on Cymbalta 60 for about 3 years.  Im the kind of person that isnt comfortable being tethered to a drug company, so I always knew I wouldnt be on ADs forever.  My job ended up changing, and with it so did my insurance, so I decided it was a good opportunity to drop the Cymbalta.Over the course of about 6 months, I felt myself slowly drifting back into my previous depressive/anxious personality.  So one day I decided it's time to go back to the Dr and get on something else. I was impressed with my progress on Cymbalta, so I wanted to try another SNRI.  Cymbalta made it difficult for me to wake from naps, and most importantly, it killed my libido.My Dr. put me on Pristiq this time.  I probably shouldnt be writing this since I've only been on it for a week, but I have been surprised at how quickly I feel like I'm turning back into &quot;me&quot;.  I mean, the me that I really am; the one that the depression and anxiety without meds would keep under constant lock and chain (cheesy metaphor I know).I give this drug 4, 5, 4 because to me it's completely trivial to take (ease of use), and I don't have enough time on it to give it 5 stars.
Depression	jade989, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	12/4/2009 9:13:10 AM	Before starting Pristiq, my first experience with antidepressants was with Zoloft for a couple of months (increment in dosage from 25 mg to 100 mg over the course of treatment). I felt better with Zoloft, it worked for my anxiety and depression in general terms.  I stopped taking it because i kept experiencing  difficulty to focus and concentrate, which i thought were interfering with work.  I was off it for a couple of months, taking just an ocasional clonazepam to relieve anxiety.  All symptoms resumed, lost that job and oddly enough I found work as a secretary with my psychiatrist.  He put me on Pristiq (don't have insurance and he has plenty of samples).  I started on 50mg Pristiq and the first couple of days i felt some improvement of my symptoms (my Dr. says it's the &quot;placebo&quot; effect cause it takes a couple of weeks for it to work).  Weeks went by and i became worried Pristiq has not been working for me.  He keeps insisting that i stay on it.  He upped my dossage to 100mg (no 100 mg samples, so 2 50mg every morning). Still no improvement.  As someone noted here, i have also been experiencing difficulty losing weight even though i started walking about 2 miles 3 times a week, though no weight gain either.  Anyway, i think im going to stop with Pristiq and go back to zoloft.  What im really concerned about is my problem with focus and concentration that has not improved on either of these meds. Also, my memory is a mess.  Im REALLY forgetful.  For example, i rent a dvd this week and maybe 2 weeks later i completely forget that i saw it (and so on). Sorry for the long post, just wanted to share my experience and also if anyone has any insight on my concerns, they would be greatly appreciated.

I did have a few side effects during the first week of treatment which mainly consisted of feeling extremely fatigued. I did experience loss of appetite in the first couple of months but this was not long term. I eat well and exercise regularly but have found that it is difficult for me to lose weight (though I haven't gained, which is probably due to my healthy lifestyle). I'm in the process of discontinuing the medication because I feel that I no longer need it. The withdrawals are horrible. I feel like I have vertigo and get nauseated while riding in the car. The doctor suggest that I cut my pills in half, take daily for a week, then take half a pill every other day for a week, every two days for a week, etc. If this doesn't work then she will give me Prozac to take for a couple of weeks while the pristiq is getting out of my system. This is a great anti-depressant but beware of the withdrawals if you ever quit taking it.

Within just a couple days, a calm seemed to descend on every aspect of my life -- I had greater peace of mind and was more able to enjoy the small moments.  It's now been 2.5 months, and it's still great.  Anxiety and performance fear also greatly reduced.  I had previously been on Lexapro (1 year) and Zoloft (off and on for 10+ years), and so far Pristiq has been far superior for me.  Great results without feeling &quot;drugged&quot;.  Noticed a decrease in appetite, but not nausea.  Other than that, no discernible side effects.  In fact, sexual side effects seem less than Lexapro and Zoloft.  Don't normally post to these things (never have, in fact), but wanted others to have the benefit of a positive experience.  Thanks.

I find I have energy and i sleep well at night. I haven't had a good nights sleep in so long. I handle stresses better, I actually don't stress as easy as I use to. Even my family has noticed a big change in me. There's so much more that I feel has changed I couldn't fit it all in here. I've read the bad things about this medication. But not all medications are made for all people and to those people, I'm sorry it didn't work for you. All in all I FEEL THE BEST I'VE FELT IN A LONG TIME!!!!!
Depression	Annomily, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	11/20/2009 9:18:52 PM	I was put on Pristiq after the death of my husband a little over a year ago. I have used other anti-depressants the last 20 yrs. of my life. It gave me the energy to go to work, but I was exhausted when I got home. The last day I worked Aug.2nd. I don't remember any of that day. The Doctors said I had a seizure, I'd never had any before. The fall at work broke my skull, ct scans showed I had a spot on my brain. Doctors don't know if the spot was from a stroke [which they have basically ruled out now] or if the spot was from the fall. Either way, my Doctor belives I had a seizure from using the Pristiq. DON'T shruge off any weird feelings, tingleing, or numbness. Call your Doctor or if severe go to your hospital. I was taken off the Pristiq immediatly. I am now on seizure medication, due to the fact the Doctors don't really know what caused my seizure. I am still off from work, and won't tentivly be released to go back to work till after Jan. 2010.I'm only telling my experiance of using Pristiq. Take care of your self, read warning lables and question your Doctors.

They are terrible! I asked to try this drug after 20 lbs. of weight gain on Lexapro. Also, it is considerably less $$ than the Lexapro if you get the card that gives 50% off the co-pay. Overall I am very pleased at this time.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	11/20/2009 3:56:36 PM	I thought that I would write this because I have read so many negative things about this drug. Because of reading all of the negative remarks, I became very reluctant to taking this medication. I just kept putting it off because I was so worried about the side effects that other people had. I have only been on Pristiq for 3 days, but I have not had ANY side effects so far. My mood is pretty positive. I feel way better now than I did on Wellbutrin. Im not sure if this feeling will last or if I will get side effects in the future. I just wanted to write this for everyone out there who might be a little scared of taking it because they fear the worst from what they've read. Everyone reacts differently to medicine. If you really are depressed and need a good AD, then give it a try for a bit. You really dont have much to lose. Also, the first 2 days that I took Pristiq, I made sure that I was around other people and that they knew that I was taking a new medicine. They checked on me throughout the day and made sure I was alright.

Took it at night, woke up the next morning and my pupils were very dialated, then I felt weakness and shakiness, flushed, prickly heat, then excessive sweating, leading to shakiness, dry mouth. I got really scared and called 911, later that day I took myself to the ER just to be safe but I kept getting that dizziness/flushed feeling. I checked out fine with labs ad blood pressure.  I may have had a severe reation to that drug, so I will go it alone for awhile.

Panic Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/16/2009 2:41:52 PM	I have been taking Pristiq for almost a year now.  The anxiety/panic attacks are gone and so is the PMDD/PMS.  I have the night sweats though and haven't had as strong of orgasms.  I thought only men had problems but its not true.  I will try to continue to take the medication because the anxiety/panic attacks sent me to the ER twice.  Never thought it would happen to me.
Depression	kimmyannrn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	11/16/2009 2:36:50 PM	Don't ever, ever take this medicine.  I took 50mg daily for 5 weeks and nearly died.  I developed acute onset serotonin syndrome that took 3 docs to diagnose.  With this syndrome I had a severe headache, vomiting, memory loss, high fever, tremors, shivering, passing out episodes with head injury, black eye and a visit to the hospital for testing and a head CT.  I literally lost a week of my life, couldn't get out of bed, had difficulty staying awake, had hallucinations and was delusional.  Terribly scared my children when they witnessed my 2nd passing out attempt.  My first passing out attempt was unwitnessed and my husband found me with a black eye.  I was texting numbers instead of letters to my friends and recall none of it.  I had to obviously abruptly stop this Rx and the withdrawal symptoms are nearly as bad as the initial syndrome.  Horrible sweating, headache, dizziness, intolerance to light, insomnia, diarrhea, difficulty concentrating and short term memory issues.  After being diagnosed I discovered that I should have been in the hospital for observation and on IV fluids and ativan for the myoclunus.  This syndrome can be fatal and severe cases end up on the ventilator, chemically paralyzed on diprivan.  This med caused me to roam the house at night and wake up all over the place having no idea how I got there and at one point I tried to leave the house at 3AM and the alarm system woke me up.  Right now I feel very lucky to be alive.  Docs miss this diagnosis often, even docs who prescribe this med.  I have been on a few SSRI'S over the years and never had any kind of problem like this.  Don't ever take this medicine, it is poison.
Depression	JerseyCityLady, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/16/2009 12:10:07 PM	I have been taking Pristiq for two weeks, had been on Lexapro (worked fine but made me drowsy 24/7).  So far, so good.  I feel ok, and the only side effect is a decreased appetite, which is a good thing as far as I am concerned.
Depression	Shellguana, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	11/15/2009 5:28:50 PM	I have been on Pristiq for about six months.  I've had so many side effects but did not relate them to the Prisiq until now.  I actually got tested for Lymphoma aftger having swollen lymph nodes and night sweats.  Turns out, it's the the Pristiq.  I have night sweats, headaches, weight gain, unable to lose weight, tinnitus, mood swings, jaw clenching and extreme fatigue.  I quit taking it cold turkey about four days ago and it's been hell.  I'm very dizzy (brain zaps) but I'm hoping it will end soon.
&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	11/14/2009 5:39:45 PM	I was put on this to treat hot flashes and insomnia.  The first day I dozed all day and felt like crap.  After that passed, my husband and I both noticed almost immediately that I didn't get upset near as much.  It took about a week or two to completely stop my hot flashes.  The only side affect I noticed was having my legs twitch to the point that it was keeping my husband awake at night.  After being on this for about 5 months, I decided last week to stop taking it to stop the leg twitching.  My hot flashes have not returned, but I have been dizzy and my stomach has been upset since a couple days after stopping taking it.  I have been depressed and breaking into tears at the drop of a hat.  The withdrawl side effects are horrible and hopefully subside quickly.
Depression	Irishlass99, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/14/2009 3:04:36 PM	I've been on Pristiq for 9 days. Before that I was on Celexa, which quit working after a year. On Pristiq, I'm more focused and not depressed (no circular thoughts over and over, requiring reassurance). Positive side effects: deeper sleep at night; weight loss; no depression; more focus at work. Negative effects: nausea, some diarrhea (but that is mostly over now); headaches; feel like I have a fever, but I could also be fighting off something. Overall, I'm glad I'm on this drug!
Major Depressive Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	11/12/2009 10:08:15 PM	I have been taking Pristiq since December 2008 and it has helped dramatically. I had been off of SSRI/SNRI's since 2006 and considered restarting medication therapy after experiencing an increase in stressors. My PCP started me on Paxil and I was on it for 3 months. Because of side effects (insomnia, agitation) my PCP discontinued it and started me on Pristiq, which helped. The only negative about this medication has been that if I'm late or miss a dose the side effects are immediately noticeable-usually dizziness, lightheadedness and some nausea. 
Depression	Bonnie, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/11/2009 3:30:45 PM	only been on the meds two weeks ...take it aftr lunch and in 45 minutes feel alot better..only problem I am having is that I wake up depressed until I take the meds.
Depression	hawk24, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	11/10/2009 2:54:51 PM	I have been taking this for 1 week and have not experienced any major side effects.  Possibly a slight increase in sweating but I sweat a lot anyways.  I am already noticing a big improvement in my mood and especially in my focus at work.  I had been taking Celexa 40mg for about 5 years and it worked for most of that time, but lately I was finding myself slipping back into that depressive state for no good reason.  There are so many reviews showing examples of extremely bad side effects, I felt it necessary to share my positive experience.  I'm expecting things to get even better, but even if they don't, the improvement I've already seen is definitely worth sticking with Pristiq.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Lunchbox, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Male	25-34	11/10/2009 1:57:23 PM	Pristiq did an OK job of controlling my anxiety, but after about 2 months, I started getting extremely strong cravings for alcohol.  I have always drank, but this started to become excessive, even for me.Pristiq also caused side effects to come out in my Ambien, that have never occurred in 3 years of use.  The main side effect was blacking out and carrying on normal activities (and making me raid the refrigerator) sometimes for up to two hours before finally falling asleep.
Depression	nana, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	11/10/2009 10:14:19 AM	Ever since I have started this medication, I have the dry heaves, dizziness and sweating extremely and awful headaches.

Since being off of this medication I have been more agitated, angry, snapping at people. I go through mood swings more than before
Depression	Farcus, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	11/7/2009 11:33:47 PM	I have been on Pristiq for little under a year. It was about a week before I felt a difference in my mood and general outlook. In September I started becoming depressed and inward again so I am now trying Lomatrigine along with Trazadone for my Insomnia. Long story short, so far Pristiq has made a big difference in my daily outlook.

Depression	tyrega, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	5	1	Female	55-64	11/6/2009 10:16:58 AM	  I took Pristiq for just two days. The side effects were terrible. I even blacked out coming back from store and ended up on street I had never been on before. I turned left instead of right somehow. doin't remember. I had terrible panic attacks while taking it,didn't want to leave the house. My throat felt like it was swelling up,couldn't eat or drink anything. Needless to say after second day did not take any more Pristiq. I really wanted them to work at least thru holidays. Have come to conclusion that I am not that depressed to continue taking them. I do think it is great that they do work for some people. Know a person that is taking them and doing well on them. Since I only planned on taking them for a couple of months, was also concern about the horrible withdrawal people have experienced on these pills.
Depression	ILuvHouse, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	11/6/2009 12:06:52 AM	I have only been taking Prestiq for 5 days so keep that in mind. I also take Celexa, 40mg. I have been taking Celexa for 8yrs &amp; it has appearently lost it's effectiveness since I'm severely depressed. Within the 3rd day of taking Prestique, I actually smiled while waking up in the morning. I have extreme energy, but am also anxious. I hear (not literally) songs playing in my head which creaps me out a little. A few of my co-workers have asked me if I was OK since I seem overly anxious. I am going to stop taking it because it seems like it is changing my personality or something. Like another poster mentioned in their experience, I have EXTREME aggitation while taking it. My concentration (which I desperately need for my line of work) has greatly diminished. The side effects at this point aren't worth it to me. 
Depression	redslytweety, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	11/4/2009 11:58:40 PM	So far so good.  I feel like my normal, confident self.  I have positive mood.  I am concerned with the twitching in my face especially in my cheeks and just below.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	11/4/2009 9:32:03 PM	I think that this has def helped with my depression but I feel like I've been extremely agitated while on it.  I have also had non-stop stomach aches.  It completely helped with the depression but the irritability isn't worth it.  
Other	Viurre, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	35-44	11/3/2009 11:10:21 PM	I began Pristiq for ADD and binge eating. Pros: Appetite was suppressed, thoughts less scattered. Cons: I am neither depressed nor upbeat/I think nothing much at all now/on autopilot. When I do eat, it tastes bad because of dry mouth. The dry mouth is giving me sores. I have constipation, and have had since I have been on it, until last week when the doctor put me on prescription laxatives, which I know I can't stay on forever. I can't orgasm without a lot of work, and even when I do it is fleeting and not very strong. I have vision disturbances (blurry upon waking, rolling lights later at night-every night when I get really tired). I am generally tired all the time, and am not losing weight from not eating, probably because of tiredness and the constipation. Before with ADD I was to busy to exercise, now I just have no opinion or motivation to. Only now I don't feel like doing anything I was doing before instead either, not in a negative way, but in a zombie/no brain like way. I will probably wean off as soon as possible, it is not worth the way I am thinking and the side effects. It might be useful for someone who was depressed or angry before taking it, but it is probably not for everyone. 
Depression	WordDoc, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/3/2009 2:35:44 PM	Pristiq has changed my life dramatically! I'd been on Paxil for years with dimishing effectiveness, so my doc switched me to Pristiq, trying me on samples first. I've been on it for over a year and had no side effects or negative reactions.  Within five days of trying Pristiq, I was like a new person! Depression, fatigue, etc.--gone!  Also, I've had no fibromyalgia flares since being on Pristiq, another wonderful effect of this medication.  I've read the negative comments of other reviewers, and I'm so sorry that they have had such bad experiences.  But for others like me, Pristiq is the answer to years of suffering. I would say that people who've had less than effective results from other meds should try Pristiq and see if they would benefit from it.

Dr suggested trying Pristiq...said he had good results with other patients.  Giving it a try.  On it just about 9 days and my depression is a little manic at times, sleeping OK but think I hear someone calling me and I wake up.  When I fall asleep, good for about 3-4 hours at a time.  Have a little more energy which is nice, but get very nervous over little things and am crying constantly.  Will finish 2 week trial then call my docotor and report side effects and see where he thinks we go from there.

I've often been incapacitated from MIGRAINES that lasted 3-4 days. I've been in therapy for over 30 years and this is the best medication I have ever been administered.

Emotionally as well as physically, I felt much better within a couple of days of taking the medication.  It gave me energy and did not have the weight of the world feeling anymore.  The only side effect that I have, and continue to have, is excessive sweating during physical activities.  A small worry compared to the great benefits I get from taking the 50 mg tablet each day!

Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	10/22/2009 6:56:35 PM	When I first started taking Pristiq, I noticed increased anxiety. My doctor then put me on xanax twice a day. I had trouble sleeping for a month or 2, but that finally went away. I didn't make the connection between the Pristiq and the anxiety and sleeplessness until read other people's experience here. Those symptoms are gone now and I feel really good! I do have more energy and motivation than I did before taking the Pristiq. I am satisfied now.
Bipolar Depression	Fl.Diabetic, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	25-34	10/22/2009 9:33:13 AM	I was on Cymbalta and Serquel before, but these meds locked me into a VERY passive mood. With no joy or anger. I have been on Pristiq for over two months and my energy level has been much higher then with previous pills. Although my neuropathy pain has never been WORSE then with this medication. That has made my anger issues worse, and has almost erased any positives this medication has acheved.
Depression	Ali, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	10/21/2009 9:07:52 PM	I took this medication for depression.  I had a terrible time tolerating 50 mg. of Pristiq.  My side effects were leg cramps, memory loss, dizziness, increased depression, head zapping every time I moved my head (this was not present every day - I experienced this on a few different occasions, sometimes lasting up to two days), and a feeling of agitation.I had been on Effexor XR 150 mg. before but experienced some weight gain so my doctor suggested that we switch to Pristiq.  Other than the weight gain the Effexor was working well for me.  Needless to say I am back on the Effexor as of yesterday.

Depression	DFL2010, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	35-44	10/19/2009 8:39:11 AM	I started Pristiq about 3.5 weeks ago.  It seemed to really work for the first two weeks and I was the happiest person.  But slowly after 2 weeks or so, the irritability, anger and lack of focus came back.  I am still taking it because the energy level is still there so it is having a positive impact.  I am just hoping the mood stuff is temporary and I can go back to feeling positive like when I first started the medication. Suggestions and Feedback welcome.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	10/18/2009 7:45:52 PM	A pharmacist told me that Pristique is the same as Effexor, just made by a different drug company. This kind of scared me because I heard lots of bad things about Effexor. I am on Pristique and am extremely satisfied. It helps control my anger and anxiety. I had vertigo, nausea and trouble sleeping at first but it's all gone now. I haven't noticed a change in my sex drive that i can tell, but one thing is for sure, absolutely NO ALCOHOL for me on this medication! 
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	10/17/2009 1:10:05 AM	Hi, I am on day two of this medication after Effexor stopped working for me after 4 or so years. Loved effexor, was sad when I realized it wasnt working anymore. Dr first put me on welbutrin which made me completely and utterly constipated but worked just fine everywhere else. Every 4 days I was on laxatives because I could not produce a movement AT ALL.  So back on the effexor and mood fell, depression back, so trying this. I am on day two and feeling a bit better but all be god darn, my stomach is distended and bloated and I am having trouble with constipation. I am giving this med a week and if this problem does not resolve I will have to stop taking this because of my history of bowel problems with constipation.  I am scared about all of the negative reviews.  But I am also tired of being a medicine guinea pig, you dont know until you try but the trying takes so long.  I am scared.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	LostieK4, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	10/16/2009 1:58:59 PM	The best medication I've taken since I was diagnosed with mild anxiety and depression (with occasional panic attacks), about 3 years ago. I've tried Celexa and Zoloft but neither worked as well as Pristiq. The only bad thing is the cost. I take this at night (50 mg) and .25 mg of Klonopin in the morning. It's the best combination for me!

Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	10/14/2009 6:38:54 PM	I had been on Pristiq for a year and really liked it.  Other than if you miss a day or even 1/2 day the withdrawels start.  I had to quit using it because of the cost.  My insurance went up on their prescriptions.   The problem I have is the withdrawels from being taken off of it.  I am following doctors directions not doing it alone.  I feel horrible and I am hoping after I start the new meds I will feel better. I have taken many different anti depressants and this is by far the worst to get over.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	10/13/2009 1:31:54 PM	I take 50 mg/day and the first week was horrible with side effects...couldn't sleep, increased anxiety, stomach upset, nightmares, sweating.  Now I have more engery and function normally but the stomach upset comes and goes and I have lost a lot of weight. Night sweats have been a problem lately. 
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	10/13/2009 11:11:01 AM	Went from effexor to pristique; experienced major withdrawal symptoms. My doctor thinks the 50 mg is a one dose fits all, as the drug rep told him.  Going back on Effexor
Depression	blossom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	10/12/2009 1:31:50 PM	After taking only three days I had to stop taking due to the side effects, no appetite, jittery, loss of sleep, over all felt lethargic.  I would rather deal with my depression than live with these side effects.
Depression	against pristiq, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	10/11/2009 10:07:45 PM	While Pristiq helps control the depression it is avery dangerous drug.  If you miss a dose or try to go off it  you will experience severe withdrawl symptoms.  I was on this drug for one month and after missing a dose by three hours started experiencing electric shocks and brain zaps.  I felt that this was too dangerous and have been tapering off for two months, I still have problems with brain zaps, lethargy and spaciness.  This drug is dangerous an should be taken off the market.

My Dr is switching me and even though I am starting a new med, the withdrawl from Pristiq is making my anxiety worse.
Depression	newleaseonlife, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	10/8/2009 3:51:21 PM	I have been taking Pristiq for almost 6 weeks. This is the first antidepressant I have ever been on, and I was worried about the side effects. The first week was brutal, I was already suffering from insomnia &amp; Pristiq seemed to amplify it 10 fold. Was nauseous and really had no appetite. Side effects subsided after about a week and I am noticing a marked increase in my mood. An unexpected improvement was with my food obsession. I have been struggling with bulimia for 20+ years, and honestly, after taking Pristiq, my urges to binge &amp; purge pretty much disappeared. I have also started counseling as part of my therapy. Overall, I'm very satisfied with Pristiq. If you can just get through the initial side effects, the benefits are worth it. 
Bipolar Depression	SV, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	10/8/2009 12:49:24 PM	I have been on Pristiq for about 2 yrs. Best treatment I've ever had for the depression. However, I read on the information not to take it if you have high triglycerides. Mine went to 500 which could be fatal. I'm talking to my doctor about alternatives. Just make sure your doctor is doing a lipid test every so often. It's really a great drug, just not for me anymore.
Depression	Brenda, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	45-54	10/8/2009 11:02:51 AM	The problems I seem to be having is.  Upset stomach, and little weight gain.
Major Depressive Disorder	SamanthaMonroe, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	10/8/2009 4:10:29 AM	I was taking 50mg of Pristiq and it wasn't really working so my doctor upped it to 100mg. I still have to take other meds for anxiety and still get manic episodes and depressed. But no side effects except I have gained a weight instead of loosing weight like most have! Hopefully I will get the dose raised or change to something else.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	lolamo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	10/7/2009 11:48:45 AM	I have just begun taking this medication for anxiety. My first of this type. I was worried about feeling foggy but not too bad. It has only been three days...when will the dizziness subside?
Depression	TAP, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	10/6/2009 3:09:38 PM	Was on Effexor 10+ years.  For some reason, it stopped working for me.  My doctor suggested Pristiq.  It has given me more energy (and I'm very overweight so that's good).  After 2 months I have noticed it takes me longer to fall asleep but once I do, it's for all night.  I guess so far, so good.
Depression	cmw, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	10/5/2009 10:57:37 AM	I have been taking the Pristiq for 1 week and noticed an immediate change. I feel good, although at times the headaches are unbearable. Slightly jittery, and trouble sleeping ( up every 2 hours). I will stick it out until I see my doctor in four weeks, unless side effects worsen.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	10/2/2009 6:08:36 PM	I have only been on Pristiq about 2 months and as far as my depression it has worked but the side effects have been horrible.  My blood pressure has increased and I have had dizzy spells. They have been so bad that my doctor has put me on medication for the vertigo and is considering blood pressure medicine.  I have had pounding headaches that won't go away no matter what I take.  My opinion is that it works for depression but beware of the side effects.

Extreme withdrawal problems when attempting to come off of it - severe headaches, dizziness, after 2 weeks of switching to e/o day.  Now am trying to taper again taking 5 a week for three weeks, then going to e/o day for a month, then every 3 days for another month.  The withdrawl from this drug has been more debilitating than any other I have taken.
Depression	Ruth F., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/2/2009 3:25:43 PM	I have found that this worked for me. Within a few hours of taking Prisiq I snapped back into place. I felt better than I had in years. My depression was felt like it was never ending and I just couldn't deal with anything anymore. I can't recommend this drug enough. 
Depression	Mr. H, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	10/2/2009 2:22:23 PM	After four years with Effexor, lost efficacy, moved to Pristiq after a full month off Effexor. it was like waking to a sunny day.  One week in, and each day is better than the one before. 4 pounds gone, and significant increase in energy.  Time will tell.
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	55-64	10/2/2009 1:08:55 PM	Was taking Lexapro for 2 years prior to Pristiq.  Had weight gain with the Lexapro.  The only side effect with Pristiq is the sweating.  Comes and goes at all different times.  Can go days without the sweating then sweat every day for a week. At first I thought my menopause was returning.  Feel great with this drug except for the sweats.  Any one else having this??? 
Major Depressive Disorder	bevfrombama, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	10/1/2009 11:39:13 AM	This medication was effective for the treatment of my depression, it gave me great energy and motivation for life when I needed it. The only side-effect I encountered was a change in my sleeping habits.
Bipolar Depression	Lil' Miss Priss, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	9/30/2009 5:33:14 PM	Pristiq has dramatically changed my moods. The only side effect that I had was for the first 2 weeks it felt like my throat was closing when I yawned. If I miss a dose 2 days on a row, I start to feel dizzy and &quot;off&quot;. I also have a hard time reaching orgasm now. All in all I feel a million times better!
Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	9/29/2009 4:03:52 PM	For the first 3-5 days this worked pretty well. I was in a bad depression and it brought me right out of it. I missed a dose one day and had terrible effects, exhaustion, nausea,and rash.  I resumed the next dose, as recommended but it seemed to have lost all of its effectiveness. The rash got worse and i've had an allergic type reaction.  Still, i would recommend trying it if you have trouble with meds.  I have tried a lot to varying degrees and certainly know there isn't one magic pill.  Worth trying and make sure to get the pristiq card from your doctor to offset costs!  
Depression	cin2626, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	9/29/2009 2:45:42 PM	I started on Pristiq right after it came out.  It has completely taken away my OCD however, my mood is bad, irritability, no energy have been some of the side affects.  I am now taking 150mg and have not seen any improvements.  It has definitely decreased my appetite with no weight gain, which is a plus.
Depression	Imeldamary, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	9/29/2009 12:37:40 PM	Ask you doctor to put you in Wyeth's Pristiq program where they pay half your copay for the DURATION OF TREATMENT!!

Lexapro and Effexor didn't work either except for decreased sexual drive and dizziness. Pristiq 50mg.is still a question for me.Does anyone have excessive abnormal sweating??? It was like Broadcast News guy! Also weight gain started when I began Pristiq in April 09. Gained 10 pounds and can't stop sweating. Doctor now gave me anti-sweating pills? is this normal? Any help or other recommendations?
Depression	Justme, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	25-34	9/25/2009 10:26:24 PM	I was taking Effexor for many years and it worked great... Then it didn't, so it was time for a change. After a couple months transition I'm now on this drug alone. 100mg daily. The depression is in full force and the ONLY 'emotion' that I have is anger. If I miss a dose (very rare), I'm much happier. I know that this may not be the same effect for others, but maybe the info might help someone.

I've also went from a size 5 to a size 0.  No matter how much I eat, I can't gain weight.  The last time I was a size 0 was in the sixth grade!Anyway, overall I feel better than I have in my life except for those two items.

If i miss one pill i feel sick, like i have the flu and all i want to do is sleep all the time. Besides that, i suppose it works ok.

Depression	sparrow, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	9/24/2009 11:46:54 AM	I would caution anyone trying a new anti-depressant to stay in touch with your doctor for constant monitoring until you see how your body is going to react to the medication.I had extreme shakiness, confusion, EXTREME depression, I've lost 15 lbs, trouble sleeping, anxiety attacks with horrible heart palpitations.  I was on Pristiq for six weeks and during that time had extreme thoughts of suicide.  Thank goodness my family and friends noticed the extreme change in my personality and helped me to get off it.  I would just encourage anyone trying any of the medications to have family and friends &quot;on watch&quot; to notice any adverse effects.  I have only had to take anti-depressants one other time during my divorce and they helped, but Pristiq nearly killed me.  Beware - Be Cautious.  It may be a miracle for some, but there are a few like myself that didn't reap the benefits.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/24/2009 10:55:52 AM	I've been on Pristiq since February and I found it really helped. I've wanted to start coming off of it so I started taking it every other day. I'm experiencing severe motion sickness and nausea. Can anyone relate?
Major Depressive Disorder	ann, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	9/22/2009 2:35:30 PM	Stopped Effexor 300mg and began Pristiq 100mg. Experienced extreme anxiety and jumpiness. Day 3 through Day 5 took only 50mgs daily. I was less anxious than before and was able to accomplish some daily tasks-but unfortunately day 5-7 I developed severe nausea. The nausea would start about 90 minutes after taking the dose and remain through-out the day. By the time I went to bed, it was gone. The next morning no nausea until 90 minutes after taking the dose. The nausea was impossible to deal with, so I stopped the med and resumed the effexor.

Depression	audrey, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	9/17/2009 9:55:04 PM	i truly thought that there was a magic pill out there that would cure my depression and anxiety. i have been on 9 different medications since 1998 most recently Pristiq. NONE of the medications i have been on have helped because there is no magic pill. i am NOT telling anyone to stop their medications but i am saying (for most people out there) you have to face what is depressing you-- figure out what it is and try to make peace with it. i did not deal with problems in my life and let them pile up and in 1998 it hit me like a ton of bricks and i ran to the doctor (which at the time i needed on medication to help) but nothing &quot;fixed&quot; ME. i am still depressed my anxiety is better but i have realized my depression is because of choices/decisions i have made in my life, some from 30yrs ago. i am writing this because if i can make just one person understand that there is no magic pill,i put all my hope in a pill and i was let down time and time again. please talk to someone or a support group to help you identify the source of your depression and anxiety and seek help with dealing with the problem. you might benefit from counseling AND medication. i have not. please take care of yourselves and God Bless you all. i wish you all the best.

However, the one side effect that I experienced was extreme sweating.  I was soaking wet all the time.  I had an appointment with my doctor last week and we decided to switch to Wellbutrin.  If it weren't for the sweating, I'd still be taking Pristiq.
Panic Disorder	binky1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	9/15/2009 1:47:52 PM	I'm glad that this med has helped some people, but would recommend that anyone thinking of going on it read all these reviews first, so you know what to look for if things go wrong.  I had been on Wellbutrin and Lexapro for 6 yrs for depression and ancxiety, but was having some panic attacks.  Weaned of those med, and started Pristiq.  Extreme parinoa,agitation, restlessness. Rapid heartbeat, with skips.  Ablsolutly could not &quot;settle&quot;.   Stopped taking, ( Iknew better than to do that before taking this drug, and I know it now, but at the time I felt it was OK. ) Became suicidal, which has never been an issue for me. Back on the Wellbutrin and Lexapro.  Will live with the panic attacks with help of breathing and coping techniques.  Please be careful, and be aware.
Major Depressive Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	9/13/2009 11:49:07 PM	About 2 wks on 50mg and 2 wks on 100mg.  Appetite seems to vary from not very hungry to extremely hungry.  Motivation and engergy is better.  Mood has improved but not great.  Increase in appetite concerns me.  That is the main side-effect that concerns me.  Noticeable decrease in anxiety but mood still needs to improve. Wish mood would improve.  Overall, I have be able to tolerate drug well which is unusual for me.  Maybe with more time, mood will improve???
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	9/13/2009 9:30:14 PM	I've been on this drug for 2 mo. Was put on it for mild depression, anxiety, and OCD. It seems to help, but not sure if the SE are worth it. Very lethargic, felt like I was zoned out, woke up frequently, dry mouth, headaches and I actually don't think I dream at all anymore. I also had extreme nausea and motion sickness when I missed a couple pills. I feel sleepy all of the time, but only sleep for a coulple hrs at a time. Dr. said to cut the 50mg pill in half, so we shall see if this helps with the SE.

I can't take this.  dr. took me off now i'm dealing with the withdrawl symptoms.  they are just as bad or worse.  been off 10days and still have headaches, achy, dizzy, heart palpitations how long does it take to get this out of your system.

Been taking drug (50mg)for about 2 wks.  Yesterday, felt this medication is really increasing my appetite, making me really tired and not doing enough  to elevate my mood.  Today, I woke up and feel really good. My mood has significantly increased.  I don't know if it's taking time for the meds to reach certain blood level consistently or what.  Yesterday, the pits and today...good.  Today, feel cautiously optomistic that pristiq may lift a very long major depressive episode. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/9/2009 11:10:17 AM	I was on Lexapro for 1 year and gained over 30 pounds. I switched to Pristiq about 7 months ago and my eating finally got back under control. I feel great and rarely have anxiety attacks. I recommend taking it at night, before bed, because it can make you extremely tired. Just don't forget to take it - I missed 2 days and felt like little electric shocks were moving from my feet to my head. Once I took it I was fine within 2 hours. My family can tell a big difference in my attitude and mood since I started it.

Little in way of side effects except increae in appetite (manageable) and some insomnia.  Some improvement in mood. Doc increased Pristiq to 100mg (Been taking 100mg for 4 days now -- very tired, big increase in appetite -- mood -- sort of a &quot;I don't care, blah kinda of  mood...don't think this stuff is going to work on my depression.
Major Depressive Disorder	no longer fatigued, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/7/2009 9:04:40 AM	One month on Pristiq 50mg. Switched from Zoloft (6+ years), after having extreme fatigue for several months that I could not shake. Switch was made after a full physical and blood work, of course (am also hypothyroid). I am back to sleeping 8 hours per day (instead of 16 to 20) and being alert and functioning well. Still can have normal feelings of sadness or happiness (did not kill my moods) and feel the best I have in over a year. It may not be the drug of choice for everyone, but it works well for me.  I take it in the morning with my synthroid.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/6/2009 7:12:06 PM	I was pretty worried about taking this med after reading some of the other reviews.  I have been on Wellbutrin, Lexapro and most recently Celexa, and have been taking Pristiq for 3 days now and I feel really good!  I have had a couple of side effects; feeling loopy, dry mouth, but they are disappearing.  I have had no problem sleeping, but I do feel a little more &quot;buzzy&quot; during the day.  I take it in the morning and that seems to work for me. My guilty feelings and anxiety are SO much better, and it even kinda curbs my appetite.  I hope this helps others as well.

Depression	Grateful1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	9/4/2009 3:42:59 PM	WOW! This medicine made me want to jump out of a window, caused severe anxiety attacks and caused my mind to go places I never knew I could possibly think of! I took it for about 2 weeks and my 1st night, I was all over my house unable to sleep. I went from room to room( even the bathrooms) trying to get comfortable and just could not. Then after a few days, I realized that I was in a daze. I was like a zombie and just always wanted to lay down. And then one morning I woke up with a really, really bad anxiety attack and a family member almost dialed 911. I was vomiting and couldn't stop crying and shaking.And it took me at least 1 hour to calm down and when I actually did, I had to ask what happened. I was so out of it! I will NEVER take this drug again! I am taking Wellbutrin now and LOVE IT! Depression is a serious disorder and I definitely didn't need anything to make it worse.
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	9/4/2009 1:15:56 PM	I have been on this med. for only about 2 weeks, and have experienced none of the side effects others are experiencing. I was on Prozac for over 15 years and after it stopped working was put on Wellbutrin, Zoloft and most recently Cymbalta.  Unless things change drastically, I will continue to use this drug.  Living with severe depression as one patient suggested, is NOT living, and for me, is not an option.
Depression	clamhappy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/3/2009 4:36:00 PM	I've been on AD for 10 years and I know this cant be possible but i SWEAR i felt better after the first dose. I hope it continues this way. And if the positive effects are all in my head - I'll accept that.
Major Depressive Disorder	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	9/2/2009 7:25:09 PM	Day 19 at 50mg Pristiq -- wake up middle of night but fall back to sleep.  Was having unusally vivid and weird dreams, but they have stopped. Definitely a decrease in anxiety and depression, but still not out of the woods. Feeling tired now early evening.  Overall, side effects, minimal. 
Major Depressive Disorder	babydol1228, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	9/2/2009 6:47:30 PM	AI wake up eyes open and I can't move at all. I try to scream out but nothing comes out. lasts about 10 minutes. happened 3 times. constipated. cry all the time. mood up and down. headaches, neck and backaches constant. Sometimes think I see bugs. Blurred vision, tremors. Not feeling any relief at all. Gaining weight or my stomach just may be pooched out because its full of stool. I am a nurse and know this is not normak and my psychiatrist blames alot of this on &quot;nerves&quot;, or &quot;give the medicine a chance to take effect&quot;. He constantly increases the dose. Why? So I know what it feels like to be paralized,hallucinations,blind,fat,constipated,in pain,and maybe eventually suicidal? I think it's time for another Doctor.
Depression	jend, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/2/2009 3:21:58 PM	I have been taking Pristiq for about 6 months now, and have found that it has been quite useful to me. Before this I tried Prozac, Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, and Effexor, the Effexor worked for about 8 years, coming off of it was a nightmare though. I am happy to report that Pristiq seems to be doing great, although it is noticable when I miss a day. It also helps with my pain, which is a total plus.
Depression	MoMo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	9/1/2009 11:30:20 PM	I've been on Pristiq for 10 days and can't stop eating.  At first I felt like I overdosed on cold medicine... very foggy feeling. Went away in a few days.  I can't sleep and can't stop eating, but I have to say I have a lot of energy and feel normal.  I am able to concentrate for the first time in a very long time.  Was on Welbutrin XL for almost 2 years and it just stopped working.  I had no weight gain and even a decreased loss of apetite on Wellbutrin.  I don't want to stop taking because of weight gain, but I certainly don't want to gain any weight.  Just lost 16 lbs prior to going on, certainly don't want to gain that back.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	8/31/2009 9:01:09 PM	Been on Pristiq for four months. It has been fairly effective for the depression, but the weight gain has been terrible. I'm hungry all the time and have gained 25 pounds. 
Major Depressive Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	8/31/2009 6:10:31 PM	Day 17 - 50mg Pristiq.  Tiredness seems to be increasing.  Mood better, but not great.  Seem less anxious though.  Appetite increasse seems to have eased off.  Am wondering if this drug is going to work.  Wish others would write about their experience with Pristiq.

I felt like I have no emotions with the Lexapro and the Cymbalta, although I felt good caused be to gain weight.  I wanted off and now I am trying new medication.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	8/29/2009 9:02:51 PM	Let's just say that I have been EXTREMELY irritable and have been dizzy since I started taking this pill, it's been going on for over three weeks. I am not too happy with this medicine, but if you get a sample pack and the card that goes with it, the medicine won't be extremely expensive. I paid 66 for my pills that I didn't' even use.
Major Depressive Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	8/29/2009 4:20:39 PM	Day 15 at 50mg pristiq.  Definitely improved mood, but not out of the woods.  Increased appetite, tiredness, especially in morning -- need a couple of cups of strong coffee to offset tiredness -- insomnia subsiding, sleep improving but unusually vivid weird dreams.  Definitely feeling more relaxed, less anxious and able to cope -- have more of a &quot;cushion&quot;.  Overall, I'm glad I've taken it.
Bipolar Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	8/29/2009 4:16:21 AM	Made me very suicidal,if I had a gun, very well may have killed myself. My docter took me off from it.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/28/2009 6:58:17 PM	I LOVE this drug!  For the last 18 yrs I have been on a varity of meds.  80mg of Prozac was the most used.  20 mg of Pristiq and I feel great.  I noticed the difference after about 2 weeks and have been on it for 2 months now.  The only side effect was the insomnia was worse than usual.  That went away about a week after starting.  
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Mallydoo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	8/27/2009 6:15:37 PM	Been on Pristiq for 3 months.  Anixiety is gone!  The only side effect I experience is dilated pupils and a bit of unsteadiness from time to time. I am happy now, no sexual side effects, no appetite changes.  I take it at night before bed and sleep just fine, other than i get up twice during the night to use the bathroom.  Love it and would recommend it.  I've also tried Zoloft, and Lexapro - hated both. 
Major Depressive Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	8/25/2009 7:58:23 PM	Day 11 on 50mg pristiq.  Appetite which had increased for the past few days has decreased, thank goodness.  Tiredness experienced upon waking left quickly today.  Find I'm waking up in the middle of the night, but do fall back asleep.  My mood is very inconsistent...it improves and then falls off.  Am hoping that improvement in mood will continue and become more consistent as blood levels of pristiq build up. Very few side-effects.  I usually have so many side-effects with A/Ds and not much improvement in mood.  I don't want to get my hopes up that this medication will work.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	4	4	Female	35-44	8/25/2009 4:54:21 PM	I have been taking pristiq for almost 4 weeks now and have noticed a reduction in my anxiety and my energy is up! I have no bad side effects like I did on Lexapro. I am glad to have found something that works for me. 
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	19-24	8/25/2009 1:25:02 PM	I went on this medication after being on Lexapro, Celexa and having horrible side effects from Effexor.  I started out on 50mg, but have been put to 100mg as over time my irritability has increased.  I will say this is much better than anything else I've tried, so I'm willing to up my dosage, as long as I don't get the side effects.
Bipolar Depression	Leslie620, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	8/25/2009 12:41:53 PM	I wonder if anyone has had my problem with Pristiq.  I use to take Effexor and Wellbutrin but went to see a real psychiatrist (as opposed to my GP) and he suggested some bi-polar meds - Seroquel and Lamictin.   So I started taking those with the Effexor and Wellbutrin.  I felt GREAT and then he wanted to take me off Effexor - which we did very gradually. That was okay - but after two weeks I started feeling weepy and on edge.  So the doc added 50mg of Pristiq  - which he said was the new version of Effexor.  Well I just took the first pill about 7 hours ago and my stomach is very upset, I feel like the floor is tilting below me, and I feel a bit nauseous - and I never ever feel nauseous.I want my effexor back!  I have a call in to his office - has anyone had problems like this swtiching from Effexor to Pristiq?There must be some differences in the two because I never ever reacted this way to Effexor.  Would love to hear from anyone who has thoughts about this.........  I know I&quot;ve only taken one pill but I really don't even want to take one more tomorrow.The Effexor worked so well - and why fix something if it's not broken.Does anyone else take Effexor and the bi-polar meds I&quot;m taking.....?

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	luvbug5, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	8/24/2009 6:16:47 PM	I just got done with my first week on this medication, and i have to say i was pretty nervous after reading all the reviews...but luckily i had very light side effects. My doctor told me to take the meds in the AM, but i would get nauseous and mild headaches, so i started taking it right before i go to bed at around 10pm and i have no side effects. So far, i have not had any real anxiety or any attacks, even though it has only been a week...i hope this helps someone with their decision to take this medication or not, and remember that everyones body is different and will react differently to all medication...so i would take the horror stories that people have posted as a slight warning, not what is for sure going to happen!!
Major Depressive Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	8/24/2009 8:32:35 AM	Day 10 of taking 50mg Pristiq.  Yesterday, was very tired and mood low, but was able to accomplish more than I thought.  This morning, to my amazement, not as tired and mood is better.  Jury still out as to if this A/D will work.  Overall, minimal side-effects. 
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	erin h, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/23/2009 2:39:54 AM	I started this medication in June while I was at a month long stay at a hospital. I have been dx'd with severe PTSD, DID, bipolar, major depression, and borderline personality disorder.  I started pristiq after I was taken off of cymbalta, lithium and trilafon.  I now take wellbutrin and pristiq with no antipsychotic or mood stabilizer.  I am no longer chronically suicidal, I don't feel depressed for the first time in my life and I feel like there are opportunities opening up for me for the first time in my life.  I have noticed some upper digestive issues since starting this drug and a worsening of my irritible bowel but that is taken care of with another medication.  These side effects are minor compared with the benefits of pristiq.

Major Depressive Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	8/21/2009 10:56:00 AM	Day 7 of taking 50mg prestiq.  Woke up very tired, but after a couple of cups of strong coffee, tiredness has decreased.  Mood continuing to improve -- less anxiety noted, but increase in appetite. Food tastes amazing! (not good)  Otherwise, not much in the way of side-effects. 
Major Depressive Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	8/20/2009 8:57:46 AM	Have been battling major depression for years. This is my 6th day taking 50mg of Pristiq. The first 4 days I was agitated and jittery and had insomnia.  5th day, some improvement in mood and starting to feel sleepy.  6th day...feel mood lifting, much more energy, thinking is clearer...not experiencing much in way of side-effects. Have tried so many A/Ds with minimum success.  Am amazed at how much better I feel today. Hope it lasts.  So far, so good.
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	PBJ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	8/20/2009 8:04:31 AM	Today is day 9 for me. My ONLY complaint is that i have a terrible hot burning sensation in my legs and feet when i try to go to sleep. It has kept me awake till 4am most nights. But i am willing to deal with it and hopefully my body will adjust in time. (I also take Adderall 30mg daily, which probably doesnt help.) But otherwise the Pristiq has worked WONDERS for me. I noticed a change on day 5. No more &quot;overthinking&quot; or &quot;dwelling&quot;. Suddenly those thoughts and behaviors were blocked and my mind wont even go there anymore. I LOVE IT!! I can actually function normally and have a focused clear state of mind and thought. Pristiq has also curbed my appetite. Sure i feel a little nausea once in a while, but trying to find clothes that fit makes me feel even sicker! Stick to the program, and think positive. I have taken other meds for this, and have never had such positive results!!
Major Depressive Disorder	momola, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	8/19/2009 1:56:50 PM	I have been taking 50mg of pristiq for 5 days now.  I found that the only side-effect I experienced was some insomnia and some edginess.  On 4th night insomnia subsided.  I also take Strattera 60mg as an adjunct to increases antidepressant effect of pristiq.  First 3 days I also felt sort of wired -- like I had drunk about 20 cups of coffee, but that has now stopped. Also taking Strattera 60mg to boost antidepressant effect of pristiq.  Otherwise, no major side effects to report.  Strattera may be off-setting side-effects to Pristiq??

It is very good at keeping the depression symptoms at bay. *A note of warning, I have become extremely photosensitive since I have been on this drug. Please be careful in the sun, I have found that I am burning quickly from even minimal exposure.

Depression	seekingserenity, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4		35-44	8/7/2009 9:49:42 AM	I have only been on this medication for a week. I don't feel tired as I did while I was taking other meds throught the years..celexa, lexapro, zoloft..etc. Plus-major bonus..the sexual side effects from the last medication I was taking, celexa, are disappearing. THANK GOD. I really do not enjoy having to take medication but I am willing to do it if it can help me maintain my mood. Nothing is perfect..everyone reacts different to drugs...those of us who feel crappy most of the time.. well we have nothing to lose but to give it a try. Never giving up hope that one day I can master this disease and rid myself of all medication. God bless.

Suffered from blurred vision, raised blood pressure, sugar level dropped often, always hot, dizzy, and still had anxiety attacks.  Been off for 2 weeks and still having problems with my vision, went and got that checked out and eye dr said had to be meds. 
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	8/5/2009 4:52:40 PM	I started taking Pristiq about 2-1/2 months ago after trying many different antidepressents that didn't seem to do much for me. The first week was absolute torture. I had never felt so bad before, dizzy, nausous, sleepy and just totally out of it. I actually missed a couple days of work because of it. After I got through the first week the side effects got much better during the second week. By the 3rd week I was feeling very good. I am so glad I stuck out the side effects because I feel the best I've ever felt. No side effects at all, I am so happy now. Everyone I work with and family and friends have commented on the amazing change in me. This drug is awesome once you get past the side effects. 
Depression	tiredone, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	8/5/2009 1:24:05 PM	I recently started Pristiq and I always feel so tired.

I have been on it almost 2 weeks and the flashes slowed in the first few days and are completely gone now.   I was having trouble staying asleep at night but changed to taking Pristiq in the morning instead of night.  I have more energy and feel great now! I do find that when outside in the heat sweat pours off my forehead with little or no exertion. 
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	45-54	8/4/2009 9:48:08 PM	I have taken this drug for six weeks, and not sure if it is helping me (emotionally),to deal with family stresses. And/or perhaps other parties involved are not reacting so severely, therefore, my reactions are less harsh/severe.  I have (and still occasionally have)nausea, dissiness, sweating, and some feelings of sadness (but probably due to on-going situations).  I will remain on this for a period longer, but not sure if I can afford it, or qualify for the assistance program.  All to say - nothing horrible as side effects so far, and nothing &quot;wow&quot;, as far as mood has been improved (but some is situational).

It has been awful. I am on my second week of weening myself off of this medicine and its getting a little better but I am still very dizzy and light headed and its hard to concentrate.. Im now taking 1/2 pill every other day. This is still very hard but hopefully I will be able to completely get off of this medication.. I will never take any medication like this again I have learned my lesson.. Wish Me Luck!
Depression	jog56, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	8/4/2009 4:24:39 AM	I have only been taking the 50 mg for 2 weeks now and 2 days ago my vision has started to be blurry.  Calling my Dr. tomorrow to report this symptom.  As for my depression it is better. But, I am having trouble sleeping at night.  I agree that it does make me feel like I am diet pills, gives me energy and chills sometimes.  And I get that feeling of extreme happiness sometimes.  I might stay on it if my vision improves, if not, it is going in the trash.

My dr. placed me on a trial to see how it works for me. As for myself, it took effect immediatly. But however, it seems to wear off half way through the day. I m presently taking 50mg daily.            This is all I know thus far. I am very grateful for this med. so far I feel more normal than I have in years. YES  I HAVE TO GIVE THIS PARTICULAR MED A BIG THUMBS Up!!!     THANKS PRISTIQ!!

I've tried many other antidepressants and none of them seemed to work for me. So far I've been on it for about a month and noticed I'm not as depressed. I have noticed weight loss and less of an appetite.

Depression	DMAC, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	7/29/2009 5:08:43 PM	Took Effexor XR 75mg for over two years with no side effects. At 150mg I noticed some sweating, trouble sleeping and sex problems. Got some Pristiq samples at 50mg and I am stopping the Effexor. Why not, Weyth will pay for 50% of my co-pay for life and Pristiq is better for the liver and has less side effects. I know that Effexor is loosing its patent and that Pristiq is barely any different. I feel and extra kick with the Pristiq that the Effexor lost. I have lots of energy and I talk-talk-talk which is a good effect for me. I enjoy chit chat with every body now. I also noticed a slight decrease in the pain I have from injurys. I have high energy now and I can still concentrate which is a rarety.
Depression	BikerChic, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	7/29/2009 2:24:59 PM	This was prescribed to my by a NP who felt that this would ease symptoms of depression that recently have gotten worse. I (with hope) took the first pill when I returned to work from my appointment. It started in my spine, and then worked its way out. It was almost an out of body experience - in my opinion. I felt like I was on speed, with the paranoia that I could not control. Also my heart raced and it felt like while I could think clearly - my brain was SPINNING! I took the 2nd dose on day 2, thinking things would get better, and it actually got worse. I felt like I was being choked, couldn't get my breath and was definetly NOT myself. In fact, I don't know who was in charge - but she was not me. I kept asking my husband if I seemed different and he just said quiet. (Normally I am a chatterbox). The only positive thing was I didn't feel like eating all day. I did want to snuggle with my husband that morning, but there was NO way I was going to be very functional at work. I stopped after the 2nd dose because of the choking feeling - I felt as if my trachea was going to close - and I could not relax/rest. I know I may not have given it time, but there was no way I could continue.  I would rather be depressed that feel the way I felt during those 2 days. I was afraid to do ANYTHING. Even getting my hair done (normally very very positive) almost caused a manic feeling outbreak - I just hope there is something out there that helps - but I don't think this is it. Others reported headache, nausea and I didn't really experience any of those. My first reaction was that it was like speed, weed and a little bit of mushrooms. 
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	7/29/2009 7:01:45 AM	Most of the reviews i read for this medicine were negative, so I was a bit skeptical about taking it. But to my suprise, this medication has worked wonders on me!!! I have anger issues linked to depression/anxiety and I no longer go into fits of rage or crying spells or horrible mood swings. I had nausea, loss of appetite and sleeplessness at first, but those side effects have all gone away and I feel like I'm living a healthy and &quot;normal&quot; life again.
Depression	wanttofeelhumanagain, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	7/28/2009 7:39:35 PM	I started Pristiq about 3 months ago and thought it was wonderful.  Now I have gained 10 pounds, for the first 8 hours of my day my head spins and I feel nausea and anxious. I think I would rather be depressed then feel the way I do using this drug.
Depression	nes85, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/27/2009 7:24:20 PM	Before starting Pristiq I had trouble concentrating, I was always tired and I was an emotional eater. Pristiq helped me within a week.  I no longer emotionally eat; I have actually lost 25 pounds because I now have the energy to exercise and I am no longer obsessed with food.  I feel like I am more positive and upbeat. The best part is that I can now focus and complete a task instead of my mind running 100 mph without solving anything. It has changed my life, I would recommend this to anyone that has low energy, trouble concentrating, or if you are an emotional eater.
Depression	lisa42, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	7/26/2009 2:07:47 PM	I was taking Pristiq for three months and had major side effects.  The doctor was weaning me off the drug but was rushed to the emergency room for chest pain.  Was airlifted to another hospital and got the news that my Cholestrol was through the roof and my blood sugar went haywire when taking this drug.  Also had more panic attacks while on the medication.  I will not take this drug again. 
Major Depressive Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	7/26/2009 12:17:04 AM	Because my depression is new and situational, I cannot really rate effectiveness.  I do know missing pills cause serious withdrawal symptoms. 
Depression	MaryShowie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/24/2009 8:09:02 PM	I hate to break it to you folks, but you could not feel better hours after taking this for the first time.  I have tried every kind of antidepressant known to man.  This has worked. No side-effects, it took some time - but IT WORKS.  Don't listen to all the negative reviews.  Everyone has a different chemistry so what is deemed &quot;horrible&quot; for one means in no way, shape, or form that this is the experience you will have.  A definite plus is that Wyeth will pay 50% of your co-pay for the course of your treatment because it can get pretty pricey.  I think there are a lot of drama queens/kings leaving feedback.  It works - if you have tried everything else to no avail, give it a try - after all, what have you got to lose??

I tried Paxil about 5 years ago, only took it about two months, husband wanted me off. I can never tell any difference in my moods, but obviously others can. Pristiq made me sweat more. I have developed oral rashes which I am having biopsed by an oral surgeon. He suggested I stopped taking Pristiq and see if it subsides. Called primary care physician and she said skip every other day for a week and stop taking the med. I hope I can wean off of it okay. She also said Pristiq causes oral rashes. The rashes are very annoying, I hope they go away. I also gained weight, which my doctor said would not happen with Pristiq.

Panic Disorder	Zara, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	7/23/2009 12:39:57 PM	After reading other people's responses to how this drug affected them, I feel less like the only one that it didn't work for. I have panic/anxiety disorder &amp; had been taking Zoloft, but over time (many years), it stopped working, so I reluctantly switched to Pristiq. Oddly enough, I didn't start experiencing the major side effects until almost 1 month into taking the drug &amp; then it was a nightmare. I had to look up the adverse reactions on the Pristiq website to make sure I wasn't havng some unrelated medical problem, but there they were: Irritability (I'm not that type of person at all), unexplained agitation &amp; anger, muscle weakness &amp; nerve tingling in my left foot, hand and side of my face, racing heart rate, hot flashes &amp; an inability to concentrate. Any type of stress caused my heart rate to skyrocket &amp; my blood sugar to soar (I'm a type 2 diabetic, so this side effect is unacceptable). One of the oddest side effects was an odd kind of partial insomnia that caused me to go into a light sleep phase and have very strange dreams where I was actually talking about how Pristiq was making me have these dreams! Also, I couldn't get to sleep without the aid of another medication (Ativan, in my case), so, overall, this drug really caused more anxiety and frustration than it helped ease my anxiety. It may be better for people in need of anti-depressants, but for anxiety suffers, not so much.

I've been taking it for over a year now.  My doctor just keeps increasing the dose, which increases the terrible nausea I get from it.  I have an appointment on Friday, and if she doesn't change my medicine, i'm going to a new doctor!

Depression	Kfalz, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/21/2009 6:47:36 PM	I took Pristiq for 3 months and it has been the worst 3 months of my life!  Side effects started during 3rd week and included severe nausea, dizziness, fatigue, headaches, night sweating, irritability, weight gain (+15 pounds), vivid dreams, head noises (ch ch sound), and confusion/concentration issues.  Have intermittent episodes of these symptoms and have missed lots of work. Withdrawal is even worse (on day 4). If anybody else is experiencing this, please fill out MedWatch form to complain to FDA at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/m edwatch-online.htm  This drug should never have been approved!
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/21/2009 6:14:26 PM	I have been on Pristiq for 2 months and I do feel better, have more energy and enthusiasm. I am not experiencing any of the terrible side effects except sometimes slight difficulty swallowing and only just recently some joint soreness in one finger. I have decided that I want to wean myself off only b/c of the frightening reviews I've read here and elsewhere about the terrible side effects when you try and get off of it. I'm more afraid of what it's going to do to me if I have prolong usage and decide to get off of it at a later date rather than just dealing with the depression without medication; if that makes sense. Overall with so many varied opinions on the drug I would recommend that the patient does extensive research before taking the first pill. I did not. I went on my doctors advice b/c I was so anxious for a quick fix.

Lived in my bed 8 yrs.since the loss of my 18 year old in a car accident.  Dr. asked me to try this, said it was new and talked me into it.  I have a long way to go but I can see a light at the end of my tunnel now.  I pray it continues to help.  Many times I had planned my suicide, written my obituary, etc. but I didn't want to put my family through any more pain. I am so thankful my Doctor heard things I wasn't even saying.  Give it a try!!!

After having a nervous breakdown in my Doctors office, he prescribed 50mg a day. I take in AM with breakfast, never had side effects at all. Makes me a little tired during the day but I do stretching excercises and eat good meals that give me energy. Chewing gum keeps me from yawning all day. I feel better than I have in 2 years.

Depression	dwell, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	7/17/2009 7:13:02 PM	There ARE alternatives to Pristiq. The reason there is no Wyeth information about the real life experiences of this drug is because it is so horrible.  Please believe me - if you think the side effects are bad - wait til you try to get off the medication.  Medical community does not understand the horrible consequences of this drug.  Talk to your doctor.  Ask about their experience prescribing this med. It should be withdrawn from the market.  Wyeth is pushing it as the &quot;new&quot; alternative to strengthen the own finances.  Don't be a victim.

I have been taking this medication for about 4 weeks and I almost stopped after the first week.. I had every side effect and at first was more depressed and anxious than before I started taking medication but all I can say is I'm glad I stuck it out... I feel MUCH better but it did take about 3 weeks or so for the side effects to go away... Also I take it in the morning and sleep like a baby at night..This med has given me the ability to stop overthinking and overanalyzing EVERYTHING which has helped my depression.. I&quot;m going thru a breakup so I think I'm not as happy as I could be but I do believe the time and the Pristiq will help..

I feel so sick...vomiting, POUNDING headache, etc. that I can't even function as a human being. I don't know if I can continue to take this for two weeks to wait for the s/e to stop. I would rather be depressed everyday but living my life THAN be happy and stuck in bed. I keep wondering if this will change and if I can hang in there long enough for it to change.

I had a son who died at the age of two and never seemed to snap out of the depression I was in since 2006.  I have never felt better in my life!  This medication works so well that it brings tears of happiness to my eyes writing about it.  My grades in college have went up and my relationship with my 7 year old son and my boyfriend is so much better than before.  My performance at work is also better with almost no error.  I have been on it for 6 weeks now and the first two weeks I had side effects that were unpleasant but it was so worth it to allow my body time to adjust because the side effects are COMPLETELY gone.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for whoever made Pristiq! You gave my son his mommy back!

I have been on it for over a year and a half now and I have never been happier. When I first started taking it I noticed an immediate decrease in my daily anxiety levels and a noticeable increase in energy levels. It also helps to control my appetite, which is an added bonus. I was reluctant to have to take a daily medication at first, but I now know that I made the right decision. Pristiq has improved my daily outlook on life and my ability to handle stressful situations.

I gradually got such horrible muscle and joint pain that I could barely get out of bed. I was missing work because of the pain and the extreme fatigue. I could only stay awake for 2 hours at a time. It was absolutley horrible. After 3 days of being off of it, my pain completely went away, and I am no longer exhausted.

Could not concentrate, cound not sleep, felt anxious, dizzy, severe migraines, forgetfullness, nervous itch, break out in a cold sweat and just felt &quot;out of it&quot; all of the time. I was only on the medication for 4 days. Doctors should not be perscribing this to any patients and more testing should have been done. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION!!!!

Depression	stacy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	7/2/2009 8:13:23 PM	This medicine from day one made me feel worse, more depressed more like wanting to hurt my self,was more irritable, didnt care about things in life or fun things were more harder to enjoy, got aggitated easier,didnt feel right in the front part of the head most of the time like it was swollen and felt dizzy alot and balance seemed to be off alot more than normal. I did fall once and almost fell a few other times while taking the med. I am off of it now completely for about a week and a half and still feel the head thing and so out of breath and tired and cannot get motivated like if i was still on the med.THe med just didnt seem to do much of anything but make symptoms worse and me to feel like crap, I thought it was just the med so i just kept taking it thinking it would work itself out but the bad symptoms just got worse with numbness to the hands, and face,, concentration is off and in thinking,feels like most of the time too a rush of electricity throughout the body,sometimes even the arms would hurt or you would get sharp quick pains in your heart and chest.This is not a good medicine at all i went from 50 to 100 mg and nothing got better but worse. I felt sick feelings alot, and just the overall depression wasnt good, sayed i wanted to die more but would of never did anything with that. Just need to take this off the market

Bipolar Depression	Rachelle S., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	7/1/2009 7:29:31 PM	In addition to two mood stabilizers (Depakote and Abilify) an anti-psychotic (seroquel) and Klonopin (for anxiety) I take Pristiq for depression associated with Bipolar.  My doctor and I determined that 50 mgs daily was too low, but 100 mgs pushed me into a mania, so I take 50 one day and 100 the next, which is a bit unusual, but seems to be working for me with little or no side effects on this dosage.  I was previously on Effexor XR, which gave me gastrointestinal issues and headaches, but was fairly effective for awhile with my depression.  After several years however, it became ineffective.  Pristiq has improved my mood and sleep quality as well, without the side effects.  It took over a month to notice, but it has been effective.  
Major Depressive Disorder	PristiqLover, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/1/2009 7:20:37 PM	I have only been on 50mg per day for 3 days, but my depression and fatigue lifted instantly! I actually have the energy to get off the couch and function,thrive even. But,it is hard to sleep at night. I've been experimenting by taking it at 5 AM,or even 4:30. If worse comes to worse, I will take prescribed 12.5 mg Ambien CR around 10PM. Also, not as hungry,which is good for me. 
Depression	dgl345, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	7/1/2009 11:21:20 AM	Used to take just Wellbutrin, but stress and depression increased so my doc put me on Pristiq.  It was wonderful at first as I noticed positive changes almost immediately. I thought I was feeling better after about a month, so I tried stopping it. Within a few days, I was in a full blown melt down state.  So, my BF came home and made me take a Pristiq.  It's been about 2.5 months and now I'm starting to have terrible short term memory loss.  I can't remember conversations I had only 5 minutes prior.  I'm starting to feel tired and loopy and just overall stress and tension again.  I don't want to increase and I don't want the trouble of switching, so I'm really at a loss as to what to do. My overall health is very good with a low BP.  I am overweight and I struggle with weight loss, so I don't want anything that'll make me gain. (thereby increasing depression??) Any suggestions? Please...
Depression	lawson42, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	7/1/2009 4:20:36 AM	This drug makes me sleepy all the time. But I still need help going to sleep. I feel disoriented, crying spells, itching, suicidal, crazy. I am tired of feeling so &quot;out of it&quot;.  Constipation is also an issue. I am scared of the withdrawal, because when I have missed a dose, I really feel strange..iritable.  Just get me off this ride. Does anyone know how to get off? My doctor has still not returned my calls for withdrawal.
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/30/2009 10:15:54 PM	I have taken many different antidepressants for the last 16 years but I've had the most success with Pristiq.  I haven't suffered any of the awful side effects that I did with previous meds.  Pristig has been a life saver!

Depression	Valerie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	6/29/2009 3:33:51 AM	I've tried everything but was recently on Effexor XR for several years.  Towards the end I was what my doctor called &quot;hibernation&quot; because all is wanted to do was sleep.  We switched it Pristiq and I feel like my temperature is a constant 103 degrees, I can't sleep (even with kolonopin), my joints ache, I have headaches, nausea and have short term memory loss. I was told it's possibly the side effect of coming off of effexor or the side effects of going on Pristiq.  We won't know for a few more weeks.  I hate switching meds.  I also suffer from anxiety and OCD and my symptoms are definitely coming back.  I don't think I can wait a few more weeks to see what else happens.  
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	6/28/2009 12:43:04 PM	I started on this medication when I told my doctor that I cannot take Celexa for its side effects. When I started taking Pristiq I got worse.  My heart rate was up, had to take Xanax to calm down.  I told the doctor of the side effects and he let me go down a dose for three days.  I will be glad to get off of this drug. I hate it!
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	6/28/2009 9:40:02 AM	I have been on Effexor for a very long time and then the dr. put me on Pristiq. The first few days were great and then I started to progressivly get more depressed almost severve until one night I had to call his ER number for help.  He prescribed some valium and then eventually took me off the pristiq and I am back on the Effexor.  The medication was seriously dangerous for me.

Previously I have tried eight other medications and nothing has worked like Pristiq. Check my story on bipolaroni.com
Depression	Coolia, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	35-44	6/26/2009 4:21:47 PM	I'm on day 4 and the side effects are making me more depressed. I&quot;m sick to my stomach have a throbbing headache and can't sleep without taking an Ambien and then by lunch time I'm like a walking zombie.. I know it takes time to work but I'm not sure I can make it thru the side effects.. I took Prozac years ago and it worked great but I gained 60 lbs.. Lost it all plus more when I came off... Not sure if this med is worth the side effects..
Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	6/26/2009 2:31:41 PM	I have been taking Pristiq for a little over six months, and of all the medications I have taken, it has been the most effective for my depression.  There are some side effects I had not had before.  I had horrible night sweats for the first few months, which have decreased, but are still there sometimes.  I also have trouble sleeping from time to time.  It also seems to make my anxiety a little worse, but I take 1 mg of Klonopin to help with that.  The worst side effect I have noticed is when I missed one dose.  I immediately got flu like symptoms.  I had a headache, was very stuffed up, and felt completley disoriented.  I take this medicine with Lamictal, and the combination of the two have kept my moods pretty steady.  Overall, I am happy with this medicine and would recommend it.  It has some side effects, but not the usual ones I ran into with the other meds like serious bouts of depression, forgetfulness and weight gain.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/26/2009 11:50:34 AM	Greetings, curious readers! My story.. I was truly beginning to believe I was never going to feel better. Keeping positive I kept up with my own research to hopefully find something that would work for my depression and anxiety. Finally! Pristiq!! Don't get me wrong, it's been a long road! There have been a few side effects. A bit of sleeplessness, some hot flashes, but in just a short time these have gone away. Now I feel 100% better. My energy has come back, my outlook is changing, my fibromyalgia symptoms are down and I feel 100% better. Please! Don't give up. I have read allot of less than satisfied results here. But keep in mind, all things take time. Keep yourself positive in your thinking and keep active. Just don't give up! If Pristiq is truly not for you something will lead you to what is. It's a beautiful day, give someone a smile! TJ- Tampa, FL
Depression	sherah, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	6/25/2009 10:24:55 PM	I have been taking Pristiq for one week. The first two days I experinced night sweats,and the last 5 days more anxiety than usual and I take anti-anxiety meds. I have tried all kinds of antidepressants with Celexa working well for several years. When my depression started getting worse the Dr decided to try me on Pristiq. My mood and enery level has dramatically increased. I do feel kind of loopy, but that may be due to the &quot;cocktail&quot; of meds I currenty take (klonipin, abilify and sleep meds). I feel this is really going to work for me,just waiting a few weeks to get the full effects. I did have two episodes where I came home in the afternoon (3-4pm)fell asleep and did not wake until the next morning!This has me worried if it keeps occuring I will have to speak with my Dr. I am afraid of some of the stories of withdrawal from this medicine.If anyone has stopped it without major symptoms, please post so I will know. Otherwise I am very pleased. Thanks.
Major Depressive Disorder	sherah, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	6/25/2009 9:50:55 PM	I have been taking Pristiq for one week. The first two days I had night sweats and one afternoon where I was so sleepy I slept all day and night. I do feel loopy most of the time but I belive this is because of the &quot;cocktail&quot; of other meds I am taking (anti-anxiety,narcotics,sleep aids among others). I have been on many meds for depression and anxiety for many years, but Prestiq really seems to be working well. None of the more frightnening side effects I have read about. I am just afraid that if I have to go off it for some reason I may have some of the withdrawal symptons others have described. Has anyone gone off it with no withdral symptons? Please post if you have. I will be checking site for updates. Thanks.

Depression	Alive again!, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/23/2009 4:04:25 PM	I have been taking this med for almost a month and I love it!  I have taken 5 or 6 other meds most worked ok but i had severe intolerance to heat and living in the south that wasn't good.  With this drug, i feel like i did 15 years ago ready for life. I would highly recommend this drug to others in fact I have told 2 other people they need to talk to their doc about switching because they are having the same side effects from the drug they are taking.  I love this drug.  It has given me my life back!
Depression	drowsy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	6/22/2009 6:48:05 PM	I was on Paxil and Wellbutrin, but doctor wants me to lose weight and said Paxil has a tendancy to gain.  I am on my third pill and seem awfully drowsy - had trouble trying to stay alert and work.  I'm hoping this goes away. Other than that I feel pretty good - doctor also said that this may even help with my fibrymyalga systems - I am hoping so.

Depression	benniesmom, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/19/2009 8:50:00 PM	This medication is wonderful. I've taken everything from Wellbutrin,Zoloft,Remeron,Paxil. All of these helped somewhat. But nothing is a great as the Prestiq! It has completely taken away my depression. The only side effect I can complain about is moderate short term hot flashes.  I went through menopause several years ago and I thought they were gone. But now I get them sometimes but not bad. I can live with them if I can feel this good.  I feel &quot;normal&quot; now which is something I haven't felt in at least 30 yrs. I thought someone should say something good about this medication since it seems that the only people who post are the ones with a bad experience. I say it's great!       
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	6/18/2009 5:58:54 PM	I began this med instead of cymbalta because of Insurance problems.  It has been terrible, I can't sleep, I'm nauseous and have developed a nervous twitch.  Needless to say I'm titrating down.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	6/17/2009 8:47:06 PM	I would not reccomend this medication.  After only taking the medication for a few days it caused extreme problems.  I had one night that, I was NOT able to sleep at all and another night that, I slept about thirty minutes.  I also felt like my heart was racing and my blood pressure went up.  The other side effect was loss of appittite.  I think that, this drug has BAD side effects and that their should have been more testing before prescribing this to patients.  NOT RECOMMENDED!!  
Depression	janisfayeh, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	2	Female	55-64	6/17/2009 1:50:37 PM	Tokk it for a few months for Stress related IBS, GERD some anxiety and depression.Worked very well until the side effects appeared. Extreme hyper-reflexability, invountary jerking movements of arms, legs, whole body at night.Tried lower dose of similar drugs but symptoms continued for a couple of weeks after all drugs were gradually stopped.
Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	25-34	6/16/2009 10:52:15 PM	I have been taking 200mg / day of Pristiq for over a year now. Through samples, I started taking it before it was available at the pharmacy.  I have tried several other anti-depressants including Zoloft, Lexapro, Effexor XR, and Paxil.  The side-effects of this medication are less than that of Effexor XR.  I take Pristiq in conjunction with Lamictal 200mg, Abilify 10mg, and Seroquel 50mg.  I understand that I am on quite a combination of medications but this seems to be the right combination after numerous years of attempts.  I hope that this helps!
Depression	Lady in Red, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	2	5	3	Female	25-34	6/16/2009 9:37:47 PM	I have been on this medication for 6 weeks.  I was formally taking Celexa, but it quit working.  Since taking Pristiq, I feel terrible.  I have lost my &quot;drive.&quot;  I just can't seem to get anything accomplished.  I am dizzy a lot, which I have learned is a side effect.  I cannot sleep at night, and when I do I have terrible nightmares (waking up crying, sweating, and sometimes screaming!)  My endometriosis (which has been a non-issue for a year) has come back in full force.  I have also had a panic attack.  My back also kills me (I think because of depression.)  Everything seems to get on my nerves.  The pill is hard to swallow, and I do not feel it helps.  I need something else and soon!

The dr then switched me, slowly, to pristiq.  I should have known from the beginning it wasn't going to work.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE vertigo and slowly the pristiq was not effective.  Now the dr is trying to wean me off of it and I have been sick for 5 days and I'm sure still counting.  He now wants me to start Cymbalta.  I just want to feel better and am to the point of wanting to take nothing to get all the &quot;sh**&quot; out of my system.  
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	6/15/2009 9:24:08 PM	I started this medication instead of Effexor XR. The third day that I was on Pristiq Oral, I became dizzy, passed out, and fell and broke my collarbone. My blood pressure went to 178/98. I am going back on Effexor. Can't stand anymore side effects.

I hope someone can answer me.I had just read the side efects of Pristiq..., why in the world would any Dr. prescribe a medication with so many side efects?. I have been taking paxil cr for many years, but it was causing me short term memory. To the point I thought i was going crazy . I was diagnose with early signs of Dimentia. Well, I stopped taking Paxil and my memory is almost back to normal.I was seriously freaking out. I feel diferent now that I'm off of it. My Dr. prescribed Pristiq, but it's still in my medicine cabinet. I am really afraid of the short term memory. Can someone tell me  please, if they have experienced this kind of side efects? I know I need an antidepresant but not in exchange of my memory.
Depression	Kim in Iowa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	6/11/2009 1:23:47 PM	Pristiq is not working for me.  I have tried numerous antidepressants over the last 11 years and found that a large dose (650 mg.) of Effexor XR was the only medication that made any difference.  Because Pristiq is basically the same drug in a different form I have slowly been switching from Effexor to Pristiq.  I have steadily noticed a decline in my mood.  Now that I am completely taking Pristiq and no Effexor I am severely depressed again and non-functioning in my daily activities.  For those of you changing meds watch for a decline in mood.  It may be the same drug but something about the delivery has not worked for me.

Depression	Robin, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	5	4	Female	45-54	6/10/2009 10:00:42 AM	I've only taken Pristiq for 2 days, but so far so good. The only thing is sweats and insomnia. I've had Depression for years and no medication actually worked for me. I took 14 of them. You have to look at the drug information after a Dr. gives it to you. You should never go off the med unless the Dr says so. It will give you side effects. The last med I was on was Lexapro 20mg and it gave me irritability and road rage etc. I was told to decrease down to 10 mg of Lexapro for a week and then start the Pristiq. Due to withdrawal symptoms I started on the Pristiq right away. I am taking 50 mg of this one. I feel confident and do have energy bursts. I feel cloudy in the head at times, but can tolerate that. The ones that had bad experiences with Pristiq obviously it was wrong for them. I hope you can find the right one. It is discouraging when they don't work. I took Paxil, Zoloft, Remeron, Effexor, Welbutrin, Prozac, Lexapro, Celexa, Cymbalta, Pamelar, Trazadone, Elavil, and now I'm on the Pristiq. I'm thinking positive thoughts so far... Good luck for everyone else...
Depression	browneyedgirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	6/9/2009 4:11:42 PM	I was just prescribed Prestiq for depression and have taken one dose last night. That was such a bad idea! I didn't take my usual 10mg of Ambien last night for fear of some drug interaction-anxiety and paranoia kicking in-and I was up at 2:30am and couldn't get back to sleep. I also had dirreah but I did eat Burger King for lunch so I'm not 100% sure it wasn't due to the food. The sleeplessness was terrible. I did feel a little 'foggy' when I finally got out of bed but went to work and functioned normally. I'm hoping this drug helps with my depression and anxiety. I will keep checking back and updating my progress. Hope this helps someone else. These messages have sure helped me to know what to expect. Good luck to all!!
Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	6/8/2009 11:15:32 PM	Started taking this medication to try to avoid taking Ativan. The Ativan works but makes me sleepy. The Pristiq was HORRIBLE~! The first day I used it my pulse ran up to the point where I thought my heart was going to come out of my chest andmy blood pressure ran sky high. I was dizzy,bad naseaua and severe headache. I waited it out and took it again the second day when I realized that it was not going to work. The symptoms the second day were twiced as bad as the first day. It was the point where I could not walk from the couch to the kitchen..... When that cleared my system I never took it again. I have since then tried Buspar which was o.k but not getting the result I was looking for. Have been pprescribed Lexapro.. will start that tomorrow but still have my Ativan and that I shall keep . It is the best one so far if I could take it during the day. I have a 6 year old Autistic son so I HAVE to be very alert during the day. This is not somethingI would reccomend to anyone....My spelling is not so great... forgive me but stear clear of this medication.....
Major Depressive Disorder	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	35-44	6/8/2009 5:25:27 PM	Started 50mg Pristiq three days ago and there is a lifting effect although I'm still having trouble motivating.  I'm definately not back to normal, but I'm encouraged by all of the positive reviews.  Previously, I was on Effexor XR 150mg and that worked, but there were sexual side effects and night sweats that ultimately contributed to my weaning off.  I got severely depressed yet again and now know I need a medication to help.  I have hope for this one.
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	6/7/2009 1:37:07 PM	Initially I was started back on Effexor XR, which I had taken for several years, but stopped about a year ago. I developed bruxism and terrible restlessness, which had never occured the first time I was on it. So, my doctor suggested I try Pristiq, the &quot;low side-effect&quot; version of Effexor XR. My symptoms got no better. It was misery - I continued to take it for 1 1/2 months because my mood was so much improved, but ultimately had to stop because of the side effects - my jaw was always sore from the bruxism, I had chronic canker sores from the jaw tightening and tongue movements. The restlessness was horrific, I could not sit still - far worse than my occaisional restless leg syndrome. After quitting my symptoms gradually resolved, but it took about 2 1/2 weeks - longer than the half life of the drug, but then my side-effects weren't even listed as common or rare. However, I most definitely experienced them.

Before I would not want to get out of bed or even leave my house. I felt distant from my family. Since taking this medication I am 100% better. I love getting up in the morning going to the park with my kids. I am so happy my Dr. recommeded this medication. I have no side effects. The only downfall is I dont eat as much which is kinda good! :) 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	kdizzy, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	19-24	6/2/2009 11:56:18 AM	I was always on edge and argued with pretty much everything everyone said. Also suffered from social anxiety when around large groups of people and had a hard time relaxing. Today is my 9th day on pristiq and i can tell a big difference, i am much calmer and am able to listen without being arguementive and defensive..the only side effects i had were mild..some chills, vivid dreams ( isn't a negative effect to me)..and some memory issues..overall a great medication so far..we will see how it continues to work!!

I have used many different anti-depressants and Pristiq has changed my life. I feel like I'm in the clouds and I have nothing to worry about. I am usually stressed out and crying all the time, picking fights with my loved one but everything has been great for me. When I start to think negative, I start to think of all the postive things in my life. I LOVE IT!!!
Depression	deb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/30/2009 12:35:44 PM	Started it 1 week ago. I felt better after the third day. I take it in the morning because it's a mood lifter. I love the time release factor. It helps me feel good all day and tired when it's time for bed. The doctor gave me a 2 week sample. I hope it's not to expensive, as I have no insurance. I have had no side effects and will continue taking this.

I feel really &quot;blah&quot; all the time.  I don't talk much and I'm just not the same person.  I don't feel like it has helped me much.  I will give a couple more weeks, but if I don't feel better, I'm going to have to try something else.

Bipolar Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	5/24/2009 9:19:50 PM	After 2 1/2 weeks on Pristiq, my slight dizziness turned into severe dizziness.  Never ending diahrea also started at this time.  Before the diahrea, I had severe pain in my left side.  Completely opposite to the other reports I've seen of drowsiness, I cannot sleep.  My mind  races.  I also believe that I have had some low level manic episodes which are not common to me.  I began taking Pristiq as a replacement for Lexapro which no longer seemed to be working.  I feel no difference in my level of depression after taking Pristiq for 2 1/2 weeks.  I stopped taking Pristiq yesterday and today the dizziness and diahrea are still awful.  I have taken many anti-depressants in 20 years and this is the worst I have felt.  Gladly I do not work tomorrow so I can stay home and attempt to feel better.
Other	PSJ71, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	5/24/2009 1:20:42 AM	I started Pristiq in February 2009, after it being prescribed by my bariatric doctor to help with appetite.  About 2 weeks into it, I noticed a decrease in appetite and cravings, which was great; however, I didn't have a refill on my prescription and the pharmacy sent a faxed request, which didn't get to the doc in time, so I went 2 days without it.  I have to say this is THE worst I have EVER felt on ANY medication!  I wish I would have found the information regarding the horrible side effects if discontinuing this type of medication! I know what people talk about when they say they have &quot;electric-shock type symptoms&quot;, horrible headaches, and a feeling on going to sleep of being pulled internally into &quot;something&quot; and not being able to move if I let myself drift off slightly.  I am now trying for the second time to stop.  My doc told me there is no &quot;weaning&quot; to this medication and to just stop it if I wanted to stop.  Right now, I feel down, tired and frustrated.  I also noticed while taking it I flew off the handle and stayed angry if something upsetting were to happen.  I just want OFF and never to go back on any of these types of meds no matter how desperate to lose weight! Steer clear of this med.

Pristiq works very quickly for me, but it can be awful if I miss a dose.  Remember to take it at the same time every day since it is a time released tablet.  I am so glad I asked for something.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE.

Depression	Person In Pain, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	5/21/2009 11:08:32 PM	I was on Pristiq for 1.5 months. Initially it helped with my depression, but the side effects started to become intolerable. I felt like I was burning up and sweating bullets at work...not good. I did like the appetite suppression:) I became worried when I began to suffer from nausea and sharp pains and cramping in my abdomen. I started my period on this medicine, and I still have not stopped bleeding. I have NEVER bled for more than a few days, and I've been bleeding for over a month now. I also noticed blood in my stool. Not good. I stopped taking the drug 5 days ago, and I have been suffering horrible withdrawal or &quot;discontinuation syndrome.&quot; I'm still bleeding. I couldn't stand upright today due to the stabbing pains in my abdomen. I'm having a lot of confusion, mood swings...I become angry or tearful for no reason. I'm having nightmares. I feel cold &amp; shiver, even in a warm room. I feel like my insides are shaking. My anxiety has been almost unbearable...I have a constant feeling of impeding doom. I believe I'm having what others have described as &quot;brain zaps.&quot; I have missed an entire week of work, wondering when this horror will end. I'm scared. I've made appts to see my GYN, GI doc, and psychiatrist. I feel dizzy and faint when I stand up. This is worse than the withdrawal I experienced after stopping Effexor XR several years ago. God help me!

I was first prescribed Lexapro, then Effexor and then Zoloft.

And he lost his drive. He has been on the Rx now for about 6mo. Every sence he started the med. He has not been able to sleep. he will stay up until 3 or 4 am. And this does not work because he has to be at work at 8 and has a high strong job. And he feels very droggy. So we added an Rx klonopin to his night time. To help him sleep and a tylenol pm &amp; no help he still can't fall asleep.  &amp; When He does go to sleep he has vilant dreams which causes him to kick himself awake.

I've been very happy, literally, and I feel sane and able to think about the future instead of the past.  Some sleeplessness if I wake up in the middle of the night, then I can't go back to sleep.My hunger has not lessened like it has for some.  I've got a real good apetite.I'm going to continue taking Pristiq as long as I can, hopefully there won't be any long term side effects with this medication as I don't think I can function without it.

I was on zoloft for 2 years and it worked great until the end of those 2 years so I stopped taking it. It's been 8 months since I've been on any medication. I've been on Pristiq for 2 days now and it's terrible. I have constant nausea, dizziness, trouble sleeping at night, and I keep passing out during the day from drowsiness. It's terrible. I'm going to try taking the medicine at night for a few days but if it doesn't improve then I'm going back to zoloft.

Pristiq after the 2nd week began to give me a feeling of wanting to get out and do things I used to avoid (and avoid to the point of Panic.) I felt more optimistic.  The only downside is it is best to take in A.M because it can cause disruption of sleep or waking in the middle of the night.  My psychiatrist, who was getting as discouraged as I was, because so many drugs treating my Manic symptoms were disagreeable, very much so for some such as Depakote which makes me violently ill. Also tried Zyprexa, strange dreams and sexual problems, Cymbalta, head-aches, even asked to try Prozac and it was in the worst category also, I am , in short, grateful for Pristiq.  For me, it's been like walking out of a dark forest...after 9 years.

Better moods, no crying spells, energy levels are improving,have not had any hot flashes since starting this med, but not without some minor s/e, a little nervousness within the first hour of takin my 50mg dose, some blurred vision, bouts of diahrea. Just an FYI, my doctor gave me a packet about Pristiq when he prescribed, it had a card in the packet that you activate on line or by calling a toll free number, that allows you to get this med at a 50% savings off of the copay, would help those with insurance. If you did not get one, ask your Dr.

None has brought me to a place of such alarming despair than Pristiq. Not only did it worsen my depression, but also added the following: extreme fear, crying spells, absolute hopelessness, increased anxiety, confusion, feelings of unreality, hypersensitivity to noise, anger, irritability. I also felt raw, lost, cold, stiffness in neck and shoulders. I had twitches. It was an absolute nightmare. I had no motivation to do anything but sleep and bawl. If you notice these, call your doctor right away. Hydrate, sleep it off. It's been 3 days, and I've finally started to feel somewhat normal again. Clearly, it's worked for some and that's great. But it can have a disastrous effect.

Others make me sweat like a pig but this does not.  First 3 weeks it even helped reduce my appetite and gave me more energy for working out.  Less irritable and able to tolerate more crap.  Only negative is that it's not as effective as it was first month so may need to talk to the doctor about increasing from 50mg to 100mg.
Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	45-54	4/22/2009 9:17:37 PM	This was the 6th try in a list of antidepresssants that havent worked for me. I've been on Pristiq for 7 months and have been miserable since I started.  I've lost 20 lbs which I didnt need to lose, have been extremely tired all day and have been prescribed Ritalin to overcome the tiredness. I've also had short term memory loss and an overall feeling of being in a fog. My overall depression is under control on this drug but I dont feel as good as I have with others.  Starting tomorrow I switch to Zolof which I pray to God works for me.  As with most people with depression, I'm desperately seeking the drug that will work for me and help make me a happy person again along with my weekly psychology visits. I really hope that others have better luck with this drug than I did.  I know each of us have different reactions to different drugs and this one has been the worst for me. Previous drugs I've taken (Prozac, Remeron, Paxil, Wellbutrin, Effexor and a low dose anti psychotic med along with Prozac.  That was a disaster for me.  Good luck to everyone out there trying to beat this disease.  God Bless you all for trying!!!!

Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	13-18	4/22/2009 1:57:36 AM	I have only been on Pristiq for about three weeks, but I am going insane. I am hoping that after a few more weeks things will be better. The anxiety the pill is causing is keeping me from school and living life in general. If things don't get better soon, I'm going to have to give up on this medication because I need to get better, not worse.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	4/21/2009 11:30:48 PM	The first two weeks were horrible. The nausea/vomiting, dizziness was unreal, like the flu. Then suddenly it stopped. 8 weeks later, I am SLOWLY starting to feel less depressed. Maybe thinking about increasing to 100mg. The only other side effect is the hot flashes/sweating which I can deal with as long as I can be less depressed. I have tried everything else. Pristiq is much better than Prozac, for me at least. Hang in there, the side effects do get better!

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	4/20/2009 3:57:32 PM	I was given two 5 day starter packs of 50mg-I was on the drug 5 days, discontinued and had serotonin syndrome withdrawals. The brain zaps, the dizziness.This medication has not really helped at all other than to make me confused during conversations, and feeling like I am out of my body. I am not impressed with this drug. In fact if I am suffering from brain zaps from stopping this med after five days, how bad will be for those who are on it for months or years?

I will now find a doctor that cares about hearing me rather than complaining about a drug that maybe helpful to many others.

This medicine saved my life.  I never knew what it felt like to &quot;feel&quot; normal without anger and mood swings.  I feel wonderful on this medication.  I forgot to take it for 2 days and I was an emotional wreck again, so there is no placebo effect for me.  I have been on prozac and lexapro and never, I mean never had such good results as I have had on pristiq. Thank you thank you for making this.  
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	4/16/2009 7:07:03 PM	My symptoms prior to taking Pristiq included extreme tiredness, anxiety, and mood swings.  All of these symptoms have increasingly diminished over the course of my treatment using Pristiq. However, there are some side effects I have experienced which have been rather difficult to deal with.  First, and foremost, the weight gain and inability to lose weight while on Pristiq has been a challenge.  I went from no exercise at all to jogging 2-4 miles, 4 times per week and have only maintained my weight.  Second, my sex drive had completely depleted.  However, I am now slowly decreasing my dose in order to stop taking Pristiq and my sex drive has been normal again.  Lastly, in order to stop taking this med, you must ween off of it slowly.  This has been very difficult for me.  Nausea, vivid dreams (to the point of night sweats), dizziness, and sensitivity to light have taken place.  Luckily, I have taken a couple of months off of work and have a couple of weeks until I start again.  This has given me the time to be able to stay home and deal with these symptoms.  My therapist warned me of this, therefore, I was somewhat prepared to get off of Pristiq before I start work again.  Pristiq was highly effective in the treatment of my depression symptoms and has aided in my overall therapy.  I am ready for the next step in my life, after all of these side effects decrease!  I recommend Pristiq, however, just know what you are getting into when you want to stop taking it.

I had the best doctor for it. my ins. wouldn't cover it so they help me by giving my samples and a co pay card. I noticed a change within a few days. I have been off for about 2 months and I still feel good. When comming off I had a problem with my sight, but nothing really bad. If I was a doc this would be my choice for all. I told a friend about it and she loves it. I have tryed paxil in the past and I hated the side the way I felt. I was nervous and I couldn't reach orgasm. if I had to take it agian this would be worth paying for.

Depression	Thankful , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/12/2009 12:21:58 AM	So far so good, was experiencing depression, anxiety,extreme fatigue, frequent tearful spells,even thoughts of suicide and isolating. Started taking 1/2 of the 50mg tabs for 1 week, then 50mg a day. I am already feeling a difference, no more tears, better mood, and hot flashes have even subsided. Do have a couple of S/E, a little nervousness right after i take it for about a 1/2 hour, and some blurred vision, both have been tolerable. Hubby has even noticed the difference. Hoping for more improvement, energy level is slowly increasing, and have only been taking it for less than a month. Am going to stick with it hoping things continue to improve.
Depression	CLMW, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/11/2009 12:18:32 PM	I started Pristiq 2 wks ago mostly for anxiety some depression. I felt a difference w/in a few days. I've lost a little weight. No side effects except for nausea the first week which wasn't bad. I was extremely hesitant to take this med because of the neg. reviews &amp; having taken other things in the past that didn't work or the side effects were too much for me. I don't take any other meds - just this &amp; vitamins. I am very glad I tried this. For the first time in a long time I feel normal again.

I was so sad and tearful all the time for no apparent reason. This drug is so effective. I feel normal again.
Depression	shugababy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/8/2009 5:05:32 PM	I have been taking this medication for a month in a half. At first, I didn't feel anything. But after the first 3 weeks I coultd tell the difference.  I have taken Effxor, Lexapro, Zoloft etc. I was either tensed and cranky, or walked around like a zombie. I stayed in the bed all weekend. But now I have so much energy. I get off from work I cook a full meal, clean house and help with homework. Sex drive is back to HIGH drive. I haven't experienced any side effects. This is really a great med. I recommended this to a friend.

Others left me lethargic, sleepy, and unfriendly. This takes care of my depression, best I have felt and I have lost 7 pounds as well. Great new find for users.

I have essential tremors, which are slightly exacerbated with Pristiq, but were as well by Wellbutrin and Cymbalta. I have minimal side effects, and have had my dosage successfully increased without side effects.
Depression	CALI, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/6/2009 1:29:52 PM	I have more of a stressed life and gained weight do to binging, I started pristiq on a saturday everything was ok until about 130am Sunday I woke up feeling like I was on speed my body was tingling I looked in the mirror and my pupils were huge!! I then went into an anxiety attack over what I was experiencing and I felt very dizzy with extreme dry mouth. I could not sleep and all day Sunday I felt like I was on a cloud and felt very nervous my eyes were still dialating all day I tried to go to the grocery store and felt a little impaired to even be driving. I had no appetite either I just kept drinking a lot of water. Now it's Monday and I had to call into work sick because I still feel weird and dizzy I now feel like im coming off an X pill.. I still havent eaten anything I was able to sleep last night but woke up with a horrible headache. I called my Doctor this morning still waiting for her response All this off 1 pill I have not taken anymore I rather deal with the stress than feel like im on a bad acid trip!! Maybe it just isnt for me but this site helped relieve my anxiety about the side effects..

My appetite increased dramatically, causing me to gain about 15 pounds.  I'm struggling not to gain any more.  Also, no matter how long I sleep at night, I wake up feeling dog tired.  I've tried 5 other anti-depressants, and this is the only one that has made me feel like a normal human being, so I'll probably have to stick with it despite the side effects.

I don't have any side effects and my energy level has gone from barely moving around all day to can't stop and I love it. Finally I have the energy and good attitude to deal with everyday stresses that drove me to verge of suicide before discovering this medication,

My doctor recommended Pristiq. I'm up to 200mg a day. It has kept me stable and calm.  I do like it. However it still has the sexual side effects.  Viagra helps but It's like running a marathon and not hitting the tape. Good luck.  
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	EZgoing, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	4/1/2009 4:09:14 PM	I have taken many antidepressants, this seems to be best so far. It has given me or energy a little manic at times. However, if I take klonpin with it, it stables me out. Havent had any sexual issues,but it may be hard to sleep during the beginning..Give it some time! 
Bipolar Depression	southernlady, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/1/2009 2:42:04 PM	This has been the best anti-depressant that I have ever taken.  It's easy for me to use.  My doctor, family and friends have all commented on how much better I am.  I have been on just about every anti-depressant on the market.  My moods are stable, I have energy but do not swing into hypo manias or maniac depression.  This is great because my bipolar is the type that my moods fluctuated daily.  I could experiene lows and highs just hours are part.  I am a rapid cycler.  I am now able to concentrate,focus, get out of the house and have energy to clean, cook.  It has also seemed to help me with my severe anxiety some too.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/30/2009 1:34:20 PM	I started taking Pristiq a month ago and love it.  I no longer have anxiety attacks, it has made my entire outlook in general positive.  At first it made me very energetic but after two weeks, I returned to my normal self.  The only negative thing about the side effects is that it truly does make you sweat alot and headaches can be a bit of a pain, but all in all, has definately been the best so far.  
Depression	Stacy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	3/30/2009 11:57:21 AM	I have tried many diferent medications to help with depression, anxiety and OCD. Pristiq has hands down made a big difference in my attitude towards problems, my children and my responsibilities. I feel confident that this was a good choice.
Major Depressive Disorder	SickOfMeds, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	3/28/2009 5:05:06 PM	I was taking Lexapro but the weight gain was awful. Doc switched me to this - and I hate it. Pristiq has not helped AT ALL and the side effects (outside of just gaining weight) are much worse. It's like it gets in there and just clings to your brain, putting you into a fog or dream. When you try to sleep the real dreams are too real and usually unpleasant. I am about to give up on taking anything. I do know I will NOT be taking anymore Pristiq.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	armywife22, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	3/28/2009 8:51:58 AM	I decided to try an anti depression medication after my husband deployed to Iraq.  It was difficult to deal with the fact that he was gone so I started using Prozac.  It did not work at all so my doctor prescribed Pristiq.  I just started it and I really hope that it helps.  I am a &quot;single&quot; mother right now while my husband is deployed, a full-time student, and I work a full-time job.  I really need something that will help me cope with my overload that I've been experiencing since my husband deployed.  I hope it works!

I almost quit because I was not patient and wanted something else. Boy I'm glad I didn't. It has been about two months and suggest to people to be patient with it and see the outcome like I did.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	shastagirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	3/27/2009 12:40:12 PM	After trying many different anti depressents over the years to control my anxiety, my Dr. prescribed pristiq.  This is my first dose but reading all the negative effects now have me worried.  I was taking Cymbalta and after doubling my dose I was crying all the time with suicidal thoughts.  I hope that this new med helps me with my anxiety and now depression.

This is the only medicine I have tried, and believe me I have tried almoat everyone available, that has not had negative side effects. No paranoia, no suicide attmempts, no sleep affects, it didn't kill my sex drive. I loved this drug, unfortunately i couldn't afford to stay on it, and now i'm back to square one.
Other	John, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	19-24	3/23/2009 12:56:38 AM	I am taking this med for OCD. It is not approved for OCD but my Doctor said its exactly like Effexor. I was taking Effexor but was ALWAYS tired and gained weight. I have been on Pristiq now for two weeks and I am much worse. My anxiety is bad, I am sleeping a lot, and my body hurts. It has always been making me break out. I would not recommend this for OCD. 
Depression	livinglife, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	13-18	3/22/2009 11:00:57 PM	I've been taking this medicing for about 6 months now, and while it's helped in some areas, the side effects are certainly a pain. The vivid dreams, night sweats, and meatallic taste have been a little hard to handle. I can't drink unflavored water anymore because of the metallic taste I get in my mouth. Also, if you miss a dose it's truly a nightmare of a day until you remember to take it. &quot;Brain zaps&quot;, shakiness, fatigue, nausea, and all of that other good stuff. It's very much like withdrawl. However, those symptoms are useful in one way, it's very rare you forget to take the meds, and you always know when you missed a dose!
Depression	KellieB, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	3/21/2009 7:42:47 PM	I was taking Lexapro for depression, anxiety, and PTSD (mild) but the weight gain was too much to handle (45 lbs. in 7 months). My doctor suggested Prisiq which I took &quot;over&quot; my Lexapro as I came off of it. It took 3 weeks to get completely off the Lexapro and totally on the Pristiq and I am not sure I like the change. My head feels like it weighs a ton, I have vivid dreams and night sweats to the point I have had to change sleep clothes in the middle of the night, my sense of taste and smell are totally messed up (everything seems to have a metallic taste and the most insignificant smell - laundry sheets, moisturize, soap - make me physically sick). Please! Does anyone else out there have any of these side effects? On top of that, I've gained another 3 lbs. I've read so many of these reviews, I've researched Pristiq on other sites, I've tried so hard to find something that will work for me. Prozac, Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, Effexor, Lexapro, and now Pristiq. If I didn't think it would put me in the hospital I would just stop taking anything. So, if ANYONE has suggestions please leave a review. I will check back OFTEN. Good luck to all of you.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	3/20/2009 12:47:02 PM	I've been taking it for a month now. Definitely a difference in my mood at work. I dont like the constant vivid dreams. I have nightmares where I wake up crying. I dont feel like I ever get a good nights sleep. Also miss my sex drive. I ended up with a virus that caused vomitting and fever. I dont know if it was related. stopped taking the meds for two days during my illness and experienced severe headaches and very vivid and constant dreams. my dreams while on and going off the meds were people from my past. I dont want to think about them.

I have lost some wight and I no longer look at food for comfort. I also Have been sleeping better and most of the S/E have subsided. However, I do still have blurred vision.

Depression	jd530, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	3/16/2009 5:18:38 PM	I have tried many anti-depresants and have had horrible side effects from them.  I was able to tolerate Welbutrin but had to stop taking it after being diagnosed with bi-polar.  I stopped taking anti-depressants all together and continued on a high dosage of lamictal.  I was o.k. for about 3 months but then the depression kicked in again.  My doctor prescribed pristiq a week ago.  I've had some side effects from this drug-Dizziness, dry mouth, decreased appetite, head ache, trouble staying asleep, night sweat and today blurred vision.  Though many side effects they are minor and my doctor informed me they would subside and encouraged me to hang in there.  I don't feel depressed anymore.  I snapped at one of my good friends last week and now realize it wasn't a big deal and feel horrible about being so mean to her. Please note that in most cases medication alone does not help, regular counseling is a sanity saver, I know from experience.  Do not expect to get better with meds alone. Good luck to you all and hang in there. 
Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/14/2009 8:39:55 AM	I have been on Pristiq about a month now. I used to be on Effexer Xr, with terrible side effects. I was more than happy to try this drug when my dr recommended it to me. This has been a wonder drug for me! I feel happy and alert. Much more rested and no anxiety attacks! I would recomend anyone to try this drug as so many others have failed for me in the past.

Depression	tolbirt, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/13/2009 12:38:51 PM	I have chronic pain issues due to multiple health problems. In addition, I have severe depression that has plagued me severely for 7 years. While going through every medication known to man, therapy, etc. nothing worked for me. Ive been on every antidepressant on the market, as well as the &quot;rider&quot; meds to help them work. This medication has been a Godsend for me. Its helped my severe anxiety and I, for the first time in years feel like I have hope, can see the future with promise again, and enjoy getting out of the bed and spending time with my kids. Hooray to the makers of this medication! If you are new to antidepressants, you may need to try a different route first. But as a sufferer of SEVERE depression for years, it really has worked better than anything. The dark cloudy tunnel is gone!
Depression	LuLu, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	3/13/2009 8:48:27 AM	I am a 25 y/o Female and I have never taken anything before. I talked to my doctor about my feelings of depression, lonliness, anger and anxiety. afterwards, she perscribed this med to me. I am feeling very nervous with anxiety and paranoia. Also I am expereiencing Upset stomache/nausea, a &quot;head fog&quot; and trouble sleeping last night. This is my first day on this medication. I am hoping that the S/E reside as I continue to take it. I just wanted other people to know what I am experiencing. But I will see how I do in the next couple of months. Hopefully this will help me.

Major Depressive Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/7/2009 9:36:57 PM	I have been on Tricycline, Prozac, Paxil, Effexor, Effexor XR, and Cymbalta. I have found Pristiq (along with Klonopin) to be the best thing that has happen to me in years. I have been diagnosed with personality disorder, major depression, panic attacks, anxiety &amp; social issues. I have less side effects than I have had with any of the other medications, that didn't work as well. This medication was recommended to me by a highly noted medical clinic in the U.S. I have more energy, have lost some weight (which took a lot of work on my end) but at least I have the drive to learn to live a new and improved life. I haven't felt this good in years.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	3/7/2009 9:25:23 PM	I've been on Pristiq for approx. 4 months now after trying several others over the past few years. I'm back to myself. It did take about 4 wks. to start &quot;kickin' in&quot;. The only draw back I have has is the sexual side effects, like every other anti-depressant. This med has given me my life back.

I've been extremely tired. I decided to start taking it at night. I'm hoping the fatigue wears off. I have noticed an improvement over the Wellbrution. I had been on Cymbalta prior to the Wellbrution which worked great for 4 mths then all my old symptoms came back.

Bipolar Depression	555, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	25-34	3/5/2009 3:59:41 PM	I have been taking Pristiq for over 4 months now. This did help with anxiety and what some may call a bipolar disorder. I do have a word of caution. This is not a magic pill. This drug can be compared to the various &quot;uppers&quot; that can be found on the market place. This drug is marketed as a treatment for depression but you will find that it can pack a punch that you may not expect. I personally do not mind the jittery feeling because that does go away. But what you will find after taking for an extended period of time is a strange feeling in your brain when you miss a dose. You may want to sit down or get a passing out feeling. You may experience brain zaps (if you do not know what they are keeping taking the med and you will find out). Would I recommend this drug? Not sure. I have stopped taking for two days and have never experienced these withdraw symptoms.

Depression	hopeful, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	2/27/2009 7:17:58 PM	Doc put me on Lexepro after Prozac lost it's punch. The Lexepro worked but ... I gained almost 40 lbs. in just over 6 months. I want to be content and happy with my life but the weight gain was awful. My doctor suggested Pristiq. I took it &quot;over&quot; my Lexapro until we knew the side effects were tolerable. Now, I am down to 10 mg of Lexepro versus the 30 mg I was on. So far, so good. I am still waiting for the Lexepro to be completely out of my system which will take a while. It will be two weeks until I cam completely off and probably another 4-6 weeks until it completely leaves my system. I am hoping - praying, actually - that the Pristiq will cut my serotin munchies and the &quot;decreased appetite&quot; of Pristiq will kick in. As of now, I've been on the Pristiq about 3 weeks but taking it with the Lexepro. I am anxious to see what life on Pristiq alone brings. I do wake at night, I do have some night sweats, and I do have dry mouth. I can easily tolerate these and am hoping this drug works for me. It has been a long time since I felt like living and I want to continue that feeling, just not packing around 40+ pounds!
Bipolar Depression	Amanda, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	2/27/2009 3:40:22 AM	I absolutely hated this medicine, I have tried several antidepressants. I liked Celexa but since I'm bi-polar it sent me into mania, but it was great because I felt good, but it helped nothing else. My doctor switched me to Pristiq, by day four I had a major break down, crying at work and freaking out so bad I couldn't talk. It never helped the depression, anxiety, or anger. I quit taking it after maybe 4 weeks. I have tried two other meds since then trying to find one that will work. Most medicine do work opposite on me or they just don't work at all. Maybe this will help someone who has problems with medicine like I do, it is very annoying trying to find the right mix and mg.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	2/26/2009 10:36:48 PM	I have been battling anxiety and depression for 9 yrs and have tried several different drugs. Effexor and wellbutrin worked for me but I eventually built up an immunity to them. I have been taking Pristiq for 4 weeks and am giving up on it, it made me so very tired and lazy (which is out of character for me) I am also very somber and have no desire to be around any one else, even my kids and husband. My doctor put me back on Wellbutrin and added Lexapro to take at nite. I was instructed to take Pristiq in the morning but it made me even more tired, i had no trouble sleeping on this drug. It just wasn't for me.
Depression	cissiemari, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	2/26/2009 9:45:28 AM	I am going through menopause but have had depression since the birth of my last child, I had severe post partum depression.  I also have been diagnosed with BiPolar Disorder (l999).  I was taking Elavil/Amitriptiline in my 30's and then was switched to Zoloft in my early 40's.  It worked well but after many years taking it, first at dose of 50 mg., then increased to 100mg.  After many years on the Zoloft, it stopped working.  The several Doctors I saw in the past 5 years have tried me on so many other drugs, with unsatisfactory results.  (at times extremely bad side effects)  The Pristiq has been a God send. It was easy to take and I only had a few days of mild side effects.  I am starting my 6th week on it and am very optimistic.

Panic Disorder	steph, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	2/25/2009 2:12:13 PM	I was on 150mg of Effexor for nearly a year and I hated it so I switched to 50mg Pristiq. I love the fact that I had very mild side-effects: nausea, some sleeplessness, and it has helped me so much, a lot less irritability, panic attacks, etc. I stopped taking it three days ago and the withdrawl is AWFUL! Not as bad as with the Effexor but still...weepiness, vertigo-like symptoms. Hopefully it will go away quickly, if not, I'm willing to go back on it just to keep calm! But other than that I've been pretty happy with it.
Depression	george, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	2/23/2009 7:24:41 PM	So far this is the best med I've tried for depression in the past 20 years. As a bonus, I've had chonic pain from a few conditions and now I don't hurt. Occasionally I'll be a bit achy but overall, I'm me again.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/22/2009 12:56:53 PM	I started taking this medication after the loss of my daddy. I had several anxiety episodes that landed me in the ER. I love this med it really helps with my depression also. 
Depression	flowergirl07, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/22/2009 12:49:51 PM	I had never taken any med. for depression until now. The first week or so I felt like I was in a dream, but after that I have felt great!  Even my family and husband has noticed a difference.  I have more energy than before and my sex drive has increased. I never thought anything would help with that after my historectamy.  My insurance will not cover this so my doctor has changed it to Celexa.  I just hope it works as well as this has!

Depression	merri, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	2/21/2009 1:04:46 PM	I began taking Pristiq after being on Lexapro for 2 years.  The Lexapro caused weight gain, so I switched.  Been on Pristiq for 2 months and so far I lost 4 pounds.  I have been feeling okay with my anxiety/depression also.  I take it at dinnertime so I do not get nauseated.

I suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,  causing serious anxiety attacks.  The anxiety attacks are completely gone. I did have nausea for about 2 wks, but that too has gone.  I love this medication and hope it continues to do the job. I'm so glad my doctor suggested it's use...

I'm myself again. I had some nausea the first week and some sleep problems. I have been on it for 3 weeks and the side effects have gone away. My friends have noticed that I'm happy go lucky me again. I also had some anxiety issues my whole life, POOF they are gone! I never knew life could be this wonderful. Now my friends what to take this pill instead of theirs! 
Depression	happygolucky, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	2/18/2009 12:46:25 AM	I have been using this med for one week. I noticed a lessen of the depressive feelings right away. Although it hasn't completely gotten rid of the anxiety yet. The side effects I have experienced is mild nausea, some loss of appetite, sleepiness, increase in angry feelings at times, waking up in the middle of the night and unable to go back to sleep, increased urination. I think the anger was hiding under the depression. These side effects are very tolerable. So far I think this med is a good match for me and I hope things just keep getting better.
Depression	andyamp, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	2/17/2009 12:45:26 PM	This is a wonderful drug and has changed my mood and outlook to a positive one. only 3 weeks in but i had to cut (tablet spitter) the 50mg pills because a whole tablet the first few days had me feeling like i was in a fog and paronoid. They say that will go away as your body adjust and I have since taken the full 50mg (in morning) and feel fine. Wow... lost 7 lbs in 2 weeks. Lot's more energy, more social and able to handle problems or people easier. I was on Wellbutrin for about 6 months which did nothing like Pristiq. However, Wellbutrin kept me calm and stable (no real highs, lows) but did not do what Pristiq does for my mood. Vivid dreams yes, sexual depression somewhat yes, old memories and faces coming back.... nice to look at life this way. Thank you Pristiq!

Depression	LilTexLady, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	2/15/2009 11:47:00 PM	This script was to replace lexapro, since I began to gain a lot of weight after being on it for 2 1/2 years.  I have been on Pristiq for 4 days.  Took 50 mg in the morning and had headaches in the afternoon.  Like most medications, I know side effects should be temporary.  But, I forgot to take the 5th dose and by noon was out of control with crying and irratible. I had some lexapro meds left, so took 10 mg and going to call the doc in the morning. Did lose 5 pounds during the small amout of time I was on them, but I can't have this withdrawal of being out of control after missing one days dose.

I took my last pill on Friday and can't get the refill till this afternoon..My question is, is it normal to begin crying and terrible sadness on the following Sunday? I am sick to my stomach all the time. Is this normal? I feel terrible.
Depression	ram381, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	2/8/2009 9:28:40 PM	I have been on dozens of antidepressants over the years. This one has made me feel better than I have in a long time. BUT, I sweat profusely all night lomg, and I don't sleep very long. I wake up every 2 or 3 hrs. But I do fall back to sleep. I also have been EXTREMELY hungry all the time. I think it might be this med. I put back all the weight I lost on Topamax. I'm tapering off this med. And since it's a form of Effexor I know it'll take a while....with Effexor I had major withdrawal. I'm at my wits end with all these meds. it's a shame for the negative side effects....because my mood was pretty darn good.

Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	55-64	2/7/2009 1:57:02 PM	I took Pristiq 50 mg/daily in addition to taking Wellbutrin, which I've taken for several years.  I felt the best I have in years: more energy, more able to focus, better sense of well-being.  However, after two months I developed dizziness/light-headedness, which became serious enough that I discontinued the Pristiq.  My brain felt scrambled.  Many years ago I had the same reaction to Effexor (also venlafaxene) so I could immediately identify the cause of the dizziness and mental confusion.  All of this went away within a week of stopping the Pristiq.  In addition, I had been experiencing a strange intermittent pain on one side of the top of my head, but I hadn't made any connection to the Pristiq.  My doctor actually wondered if I had a brain tumor.  However, after 7-10 days off of Pristiq, all these symptoms disappeared totally.  My psychopharmacologist agreed with my analysis of my symptoms --- and said no more drugs with Venlafaxene for me!  Too bad because I thought I had discovered my wonder drug.

I spent most of the day in the ER. I have a blood clot disorder among other things. This drug made my fingers, toes, and legs icy cold and black and purple. Awful charlie horses, severe headache, upset stomach, shaky. It goes on. This drug needs 2 be recalled!!!!!! BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	2/6/2009 2:15:19 AM	Iwas on Cymbalta 60 mg for over 1 year and a half when my husband and I noticed I was getting unnecessarily irritable and tired again. Doctor switched me to this a little over a month ago and I am not sure if I like it. I am still irritable and tired a lot. I have no ambition to do anything. It has worked to keep away the sadness, thoughts of suicide, hopelessness, and constant crying, but I am not happy and productive like I was before the Cymbalta stopped working. Maybe a higher dose will work, but I am not sure because I read on Pristiqs site that there were not many changes in patients when the dosage was increased and that the 50mg dose is just as effective as the higher doses.

I've been on 50mg per day for about 4 months and have experienced some of the side effects that were discomforting since I also have panic and anxiety problems. Dr put me on new meds and I'm trying to taper off and the pain in my back is awful and I feel so so nauseas. I'm thinking about just taking them full time again because of the discomfort?

Not forgetful but has intense mood changes.  At times it even seems like a total opposite personality (very arrogant)than how sweet she is when there's clarity.

I have expirienced some strange side effects, excessive sweating, sore jaw, vivid dreams, decreased appetite, and I have found myself unable to have an orgasim.The side effects listed above are pretty mild and hope that most will subside. I am curious if anyone else has experienced the last effect as far as I could tell no one mentioned it. Over all I am pretty satisfied so far I am really happy for the first time in many months. I have noticed improvments in current relationships. I hope it continues to work as well.

It is a great relief.  I still have pain but, to me taking away feeling like I had the flu everyday was hard.  So for now this drug is helping those symotons.

I was on it for 4 months, And coming off this is the worst!!!! People call them brain shocks, but with me it was like my vision and brain would jump or those added with my heart would skip. I noticed nothing good of this drug, It is just another word for Effexor. I Sooo do not advise people to take this drug!
Depression	Jeff1818, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	1/31/2009 8:44:08 AM	Be careful with antidepressants. My doctor thought I could benefit from this medication and frankly I did too. But, this medication worsened my mood, made me feel numb, made it difficult to think straight, I lost my appetite entirely, lost sexual functionality, and had me seriously thinking about suicide for the first time in my life. I stopped the medication 2 days ago. So far I haven't had to many negative side effects from the withdrawal. I was only on the med for 4 days though. I still feel a little nervous, and irratable but my appetite and mood improved almost immediately after stopping. I know this drug has been great for many people, but I would just caution anyone who is new to antidepressants to make sure you truely need something this strong before taking the plunge.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Nico35, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/27/2009 1:25:57 PM	I love this medication. I was switched from 225 mg Effexor to 50 mg Pristiq at my request. The first two weeks were awful with brain zaps and sleepiness. Suddenly, right at the two week mark the effexor discontinuation symptoms just disappeared. Then I noticed that I have possibly never been as anxiety free and full of energy as I am now! This is a great drug, far superior to Effexor in my opinion. If you switch, try to hang in there for a couple weeks. It is so worth it!

Withdrawal was far worse than side effects. Due to hair loss, uncontrolable shaking, crying spells, fever, disorientation, phobia of leaving home, etc, I was taken to a mental hospital for an emergency evaluation. Drug stays in system 14 days after discontinuation. Will never use again.

Constant singing by a chorus, woke up with that before remembering that I had had it the previous day.  This reaction caused me great anxiety.  Dr. told me to stop cold turkey, and although I had experienced withdrawl (horrilbe!) before and did again I was thrilled when the side effects and withdrawl finally ended.

I think the Pristiq is the best. It is very expensive but worth every penny. I have been on it about 2 months. NO Side effects for me.

I quit taking em all months ago cuz I wasn't feeling to bad &amp; was having problems with shaking. I was prescribed Pristiq a week go for &quot;Essential Tremors&quot; &amp; I am feeling better mentally than I have been in while but I have felt like this before when I would start trying a new med &amp; after a while they would quit helping or cause severe side-effects. I'm not having major problems from Pristiq but I'm having a nasty taste in my mouth &amp; my legs are constantly itching. I do have skin excema but the itching flared up when I started Pristiq. I researched the itching &amp; it mite be an allergic reaction so I'm going to talk to my neurologist about it. It's to soon to say if it's helping my tremors or not cuz their sporadic at times

Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/6/2009 3:57:29 PM	I have been taking Pristiq for 2 months i have seen major changes. I no longer have my panic attacks like I used to.  The only side effect I have noticed is the occasional headache. I have mentioned the medication to a few friends currently taking Zoloft.
Depression	StaR, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/6/2009 3:13:04 PM	I am on my 5th week using this drug and it is wonderful.  At times I feel sleepy/ lazy but most of the time I am just happy.  I sleep through the night and I really have no side effects besides the occasional headache and the loss of appetite.  I also do not obsess about food like I used to.  I have lost 7 pounds in just about 3/4 weeks.  I have more motivation to do things that I did not before.  I have noticed I am more sensitive.  I do not want to take this for very long, but I am scared to get off this drug.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	marestuff, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	1/5/2009 1:40:25 PM	I HAVE NEVER TAKEN AN ANXIETY DRUG BEFORE THIS.  MY HUSBAND AND I RETIRED AND SOLD OUR BUSINESS, AND OUR HOUSE FROM CALIFORNIA WHERE WE HAD LIVED FOR 61 YEARS TO MOVE TO MS. WHERE OUR DAUGHTER LIVES.  WE LEFT TWO SONS AND GRANDSONS THERE.  I WAS TERRIBLY ANXIOUS UPON MOVING, THE CULTURE IS SO DIFFERENT, I AM DIFFERENT, IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT AND I STARTED HAVING ANXIETY ATTACKS.   THIS DRUG IS HELPING ME THO I AM STILL SOMETIMES WEEPY WHICH COULD BE NORMAL CONSIDERING WE HAVE ONLY BEEN HERE LESS THAN A YEAR.   MY LEFT TOE HAS BEEN NUMB AND SOMETIMES HOT - THAT'S THE ONLY SIDE EFFECT.  I HAVE BEEN TAKING IT FOR 4 WEEKS.    WE'LL SEE.

I am amazed at how great I feel - very much like &quot;my old self&quot;. I had been on Zoloft for 14 yrs and it eventually lost it's effectiveness. Pristiq has been a Godsend !!!!
Bipolar Depression	eric, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	12/30/2008 10:41:39 PM	I have experienced very little side effects with Pristiq.  Sometimes I feel a little more nervous than I think I should, but I also take .5 Ativan to settle the nerves.  My overall depression is gone, so I feel this is the right med for me.
Depression	Friend, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	12/30/2008 2:51:52 PM	This was the worst med I have ever tried.  I was only on it for 3 weeks and when I got off of it, I thought I was going to die.  I had never had a migraine before then, but that was the first of many horrible side effects of this drug.  I'm back to Effexor and will stay with that.  New shmew - there IS a difference in the pharmacology of this drug.  User beware!
Depression	piperpilot691, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	12/29/2008 2:27:50 PM	I have been taking 50MG for about 3 weeks now.  This stuff is horrible.  I have a constant tingling sensation, unable to concentrate, and have had some of the worst panic attacks.  I am currently taking 1 MG of Xanax twice daily to prevent axiety, and panic attacks.  I also lost all sex drive after about the 3rd day of taking it.  Being a 33 year old male, I find that to be extreemly frustrating too.  I will never take Presiq again.

Major Depressive Disorder	tamiya920, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/25/2008 9:08:35 AM	Had taken other meds before but did not see any significant benefits. With this I can say there has been a huge difference, seem more motivated and focused and easier to stay in that mode. The only side effect I have noticed is maybe a bigger appetite but I have Crohns Disease so a few more pounds are actually welcome :-)I do take it with food even knowing thats optional but do so if it would cause nausea but it has not. Also seem to be sleeping better at night, possibly because my mind is not racing with concerns and other troublesome thoughts.Very pleased with it and worth checking with your doctor to see if they can give you a co-pay discount card, it limits the amount to $25 and is valid for 6 uses. 
Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	12/24/2008 8:10:16 AM	Pristiq is Effexor with a new shiny name and a new shiny patent to go with it so the drug company could continue to make large profits.  It has all of the same awful side effects as Effexor and only succeeded in making me manic and sick with side effects.  Take caution and talk to your doctor about the risks of this drug before you agree to try it!
Depression	SicklyChick, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	12/23/2008 9:42:21 PM	I had a motorcycle wreck in 2007 and suffered severe brain trauma.  My neurologist prescribed Lexapro initially and I told him that it was not strong enough.  He changed it to Effexor and I was pleased, but my libido was very depressed and weight gain was an issue!  Pristiq was suggested by my OBGYN but she did not want to prescribe medication without checking with my neurologist.  He agreed and scheduled monthly check ups.  I have enjoyed certain aspects of this drug but one that has made me reconsider treatment was nausea.  It is SO bad!  It's only been periodically and at night.  My libido is &quot;back to its old self&quot; again, but I haven't decided if I WANT to feel sick all the time.  I'm going to continue treatment until it climaxes and see if side effects change.

But I noticed that this medicine made me feel really nasuated. It has made me so sick. I get really bad headaches also. All this happens even when I take it at bedtime. I just really didn't care for all the symptoms and the tiredness so my Dr has changed my meds again:( Now she wants me to take Symbyax and hopefully it will work better and the side effects won't be as bad.

Within 3 days I could tell I am back to my old happy self. This medication helps with changing your mood so that you are a much happier person. So far I recommend this medication to anyone.

I am 57 years old and have an awful lot of stress in my life...which caused me to have a  breakdown&quot; in June 08. As soon as the Pristiq was started...the lights began to come on and I started coming out of it.  but now for the last 3 months I am jittery all the time with severe insomnia and losing interest in most things I once enjoyed.  I am afraid of psychiatric care..it seems all they do is push drugs.  What am I going to do...I can't live with this tense jittery feeling. I am sleeping better since started taking trazadone, melatonin, ambien cr. I   have  been on Respirdal, seroquel...both of which I felt cut off from the world.  The doctor in Feb. 08 originally weaned me off Effexor, put me on Lamicatal....then after a while, I had so many racing thoughts.  I felt like my anxiety level was so high and had the feeling of leaving my body.  Putting me back on an SNRI helped alot...but now I have this jittery feeling.  I am really getting scared...I wish I could get off all this stuff, but I am scared to try.
Depression	whooha, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/9/2008 9:02:30 AM	I began taking it yesterday and when I woke up today I actually felt like getting out of bed.  I hope the results remain positive.  I take it at night to avoid the nausea.
Major Depressive Disorder	BabyStars, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	12/8/2008 1:18:03 AM	This medication was my worst nightmare.First couple weeks major depression and crying episodes.Upped to 100mg and less than a week later was in phych ward for trying to kill myself on overdose of sleeping pills!!!!!
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	12/5/2008 5:51:25 PM	Pristiq gave me severe nausea, which improved a bit after 10 days of use.  However, other side effects started occuring such as: irregular heartbeat, itching, and anxiety.  I'm no longer on Pristiq.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	12/7/2008 9:25:08 PM	I was on Lexapro, but got off that because I had absolutely no libido and I found that if I missed a day or two of it, I was at my lowest low very quickly. I've been taking 50 mg Pristiq for four months and I really like it. At first there are a few side effects...night sweats, vivid dreams, and drowsiness. I slept a lot for the first month and a half but now it is great. My sex drive is back and it works really well. I feel great. Hang in there for the first month...it's worth it!
Depression	no thank you, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	12/7/2008 5:50:01 PM	Within a couple of days of starting, creeping increase in insomnia, rapid change in mood to irritable, anger and then mania, loss of appetite, itching.  It was odd, I had taken effexor in the past for depression, and it never triggered mania.  Filed a Medwatch report.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/7/2008 3:51:48 PM	I was taking Lexapro and Vyvanse together and had such bad side effects from the Vyvanse such as tics and mania in the first two weeks. My insurance would not pay for the Lexapro so my doctor gave me samples of Pristiq and after just one 50mg dose I felt like a million bucks!! The side effects from the Vyvanse almost completely went away and all the worry too. I have  adult ADHD and that is why I am taking this and I have suffered for over 40 years and I have never ever felt relaxed until now. To me this is a miricle drug!! I fell great!!!
Major Depressive Disorder	Lizabe, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/7/2008 11:50:17 AM	I take 100 mg and I was suicidal and had anxiety. It is amazing! I am my old self. The only downside is delayed orgasm. It takes longer to have an orgasm but when I have them they are incredible. I have lost a lot of weight to which is great since I'm overweight. This has been a lifesaver for me! I have been on it for 3.5 mo.s
Panic Disorder	kristenbeth1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/5/2008 1:20:01 PM	I was very afraid to try this drug, as I am of all drugs.  Was on Lexapro for almost 1 year and gained 10-15 lbs and could not tolerate the weight, also was quite lethargic and low sex drive.  NO side effects with Pristiq!  NONE!  I was amazed!  I feel more awake and alert, sex drive returning, lets hope the weight comes off!  My opinion, I know some of these drugs have horrible side effects, but they also can work wery well, this has been good to me :)
Depression	Feeling Better, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/4/2008 9:54:10 PM	Excellent drug!  I've been depressed for years.  I tried taking Cymbalta, and it was a disaster.  The nausea was terrible &amp; I didn't feel any different  My doctor gave me some Pristiq samples to try.  Within in a week I felt better than I have in years.  I had to call my insurance plan to get the drug covered.  If you are having good results with the drug and your insurance company is rejecting the medication - call them.  After I talked with them and told them of my results they approved it immediatly.  Pristiq has been a great fit for my depression.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	12/3/2008 5:29:37 PM	I experienced some relief from depression following 10 days of bizzare side effects (crazy dreams, not sleeping, not eating, dizziness). Once my body got used to the medication, I began to notice that I was extremely exhausted all the time, requiring 10-14 hrs of sleep a night, which is not typical for me. I took it every other day and then stopped and the withdrawls are horrible. I agree with other comments about withdrawal syptoms such as anxiety, suicidal thoughts, dizziness, and generalized feeling of going crazy!!!  This drug did not work for me, but coming off of it was even worse than some of my depressive symptoms.

Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	13-18	11/29/2008 3:34:21 PM	Pristiq for me has been a different experience. It didnt have the nausea and cramping side effect for me like Lexapro and Cymbalta did, but it had some other interesting ones. My appetite has largely decreased, sleeping is difficult because I wake up constantly, my energy spikes and falls, and it's really put a buffer on some stronger emotions. It reduced my emotional span to a teaspoon for a while. It definately takes a few weeks to get used too. Don't quit because it feels wierd at first, after two months of taking it I feel a LOT better than I ever have with any other drug. Good Luck!

So many of them do not treat my depression or I have become immune to them so the do not work at all.  I have been very low at times, and have not had that happen with pristiq.

My doctor changed it to Pristiq, the following day I felt with a lot of energy. I like it. I've been taking it over a week, but I'm getting these electric shocks in my head, is this one of the side effects? If anyone had the same side effect please let me know, in the meantime I'm gonna talk to my doctor and see what he says. 
Depression	itnavell, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	45-54	11/25/2008 6:14:41 AM	When Pristiq was prescribed I was told it would not have severe withdrawal side effects in contrast to effexor, due to its formulation. After weeks of e.o.d. weaning I have not taken Pristiq for three days.  I am experiencing dizziness, brain zaps, lack of balance, fogginess in my thinking, and some anxiety, restlessness and suicidal thoughts (which was never a problem, even when I was depressed and not on meds)!  I am finding the withdrawal from this drug to be far more difficult than the withdrawals I experienced from effexor. Part of me wants to go back to using Pristiq even though I don't believe I need it any longer just to stop these miserable side effects.  I'm not even willing to drive the car right now because my head is such a mess.  Any suggestions for relief?
Major Depressive Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/25/2008 3:20:52 AM	I had gone to my doctor last week explaining that the antidepressant medication that I had been taking on and off for 9 years was not taking care of the anxiety and fibromyalgia pain I had been experiencing.  She introduced me to Pristiq and gave me several weeks of samples.  I really had hoped it would work with the holidays coming and having kids at home, etc.  I also feared changing my antidepressant at this time because I didn't want to be more messed up than I already was, especially over the holidays.  The next morning I didn't take my normal celexa dose (40 mg) and I started the pristiq (50 mg).  I could not believe the difference in how I felt and almost wondered if it was all in my head since I had felt so bad for so long because of chronic pain issues, migraines, daily headaches, TMJ jaw pain along with facial and head pain, fibromyalgia symptoms and chronic cervical and shoulder pain.  I felt like doing something for the first time in a long time!!  I felt like life was worth living again and that I do have alot to look forward to in life.  I felt like I used to feel and I truly never thought I would &quot;feel&quot; that way again because of the 25 years of pain issues I had been experiencing.  I have only taken pristiq for 5 days now, but I have only ever had a negative reaction to an antidepressant change in the past.  Because this is a &quot;brand&quot; prescription I am hoping my insurance pays decent, otherwise I will what the pristiq has that the generic brand effexor XR does not have since effexor is also an SNRI.  I am sorry to be so lengthly, but to feel so well is definitely something I want to share with others in depressive states with pain, depression, and anxiety issues.  Good luck to you all!!

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/19/2008 10:48:54 AM	I used to take Zoloft and it didnt work for me and had many side effects, my dr switched me to Pristiq about a month ago and it works great!  There are side effects in the beginning but they wear off after a week or so (so stick with it).  The first week had the tiredness, blurred vision, constipation...by the 2nd week, felt much better and was sleeping great, wake up feeling energized and happy and felt like myself for the first time in years!  Had more energy to go to the gym, less appetite to eat, and ended up losing 5lbs within 3 weeks.  3rd week experienced waking up at 3am, that stopped and constipation went away, and 4th week in the sweating faze.  Overall though I feel great and would recommend it to anyone feeling over anxious and depressed!

Almost an extreme manic experience the first day I took it. It took 48 hours to pass the medication though my body.  I am now back on Wellburtin and have been prescribed Deplin as a supplement.  I feel very hopeful about Deplin, but have only starting taking the Folic supplement yesterday.

I can think clearly, make better decision consciously.This has also decreased my appetite, for I dont eat as much as I have done before in the past.

Depression	NYC girl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/15/2008 3:37:35 PM	I love this medication. Before I was on prozac for 12 yrs and tried lexapro too. The prozac stopped working and the lexapro did nothing. This new drug not only helped my depression but it took away my food obsession. i used to eat nonstop and now i eat my meal and dont even think of food anymore. Instead of living to eat, im eating to live. I only had mild nasea in my first couple days, now no side effects other then loss of appetite. I sleep great and the depresssion is gone. I dont obsess over things like i did either. taking 50 mgs currently once per day. 
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	11/12/2008 5:26:40 PM	For over a year I had been feeling &quot;heavy&quot;. I do not like to take medicine so I tried: keeping a gratitude journal, vitamins, meditation/prayer, diet change, and exercise. None of which took the &quot;heavyness&quot; of life away. I finally gave in to my Dr.'s request and have felt much much better (about 2-1/2 months). Side effects of headache and nausea were over in the first week (Dr. warned me about that). Life isn't as hard as I was feeling it to be! 
Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	2	Male	25-34	11/12/2008 9:18:14 AM	I took this med for two weeks and got off as fast as I could.  The side effects were too great.  I experienced frequent intense headaches, decreased libido, increased racing thoughts, insomnia, and changes in behavior.
Depression	Aloha, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/11/2008 3:51:55 PM	Lost my mom to a brain tumor and brother in the Trade Center, became depressed.  Was on Lexapro, too many s/e.  Love this drug.  I can sleep at night, awaken easily in the am, have energy (before couldn't go to gym, now go every day) Only side effect I see is this intense caffeine craving (barely drank caffeine at all before) Otherwise it's great.  Lost those pesky 7 pounds I was trying to lose, mood is good and I feel calm.  Helping me with perimenopause sx as well.

I have been on numerous anti-depression medications and out of all of them this one has had the least amount of side effects.

I am only on day 10... I am thinking so far so good..... BUT going off of the 150mg Effexor to 50 mg of Pristiq, the doctor said I shouldn't experience withdrawal,, WRONG IT HAS SUCKED, BUT I AM BOUND AND DETERMINED TO GET THRU IT...I read another guys review about havingWEIRD DREAMS, THEY ALMOST SEEM LIKE HALLUCINATIONS... what is this about,, I am having them too,,, do they stop????
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/10/2008 1:37:52 PM	I have been taking Pristiq for 5 weeks and it has been a miracle for me!  My niece was murdered December 2007 and I have been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress, Major Depression and Anxiety.  Before going on this medication..my life was a living nightmare.  I could not function at all.  I would experience panic episodes, horrible moods, depression and overall feelings of hopelessness.  I can't say enough about how this medicine has really helped me feel better.  I did have a few side effects during the first 2 weeks:  rapid heartbeat, nausea and agitation.  It has gotten much better now and the side effects have gone away.  I still have a bit of agitation, but my primary care doc prescribed Xanex for those times.  Overall, I have been satisfied with my experience.

However, it did stop the hot flashes somewhat.

I have had very little side effects &amp; the ones I did have (nausea, dizzy) were gone after the first week. I have lost about 20 lbs being on this medicine, but it hasn't really changed my appetite I just want to go out more and I feel like actually going to the gym more. 
Panic Disorder	Jen, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	11/6/2008 9:50:02 PM	I have only been taking this for 2 months, I started on 50mg but had 2 severe panic attacks after now @ 100mg. At first I was very jittery and felt strange but now after 2 weeks @ 100mg I think my body is getting used to it. My sex drive is down and I have trouble sleeping though :(
Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	11/6/2008 12:44:13 PM	I have been on 50mg Pristiq for 3 weeks (23 days to be exact).  I have not had horrible S/E nor have I had problems with insomnia.  I can tell a difference in my mood and I feel weight being lifted every day.  The only problems I have had is that I am hungry which is an opposite S/E of what I should experience and I am still tired with no energy.  I believe this will just take a little more time and effort to get over.  My recommendation is to just stick with it because it has been great for me so far.

Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	19-24	11/3/2008 10:01:26 PM	The reason I was taking this medication was for depression. I took a look at the side effects on web.md and reviews and decided to give it a try with my hopes high. On Days 1-3 I experianced insomnia, loss of appetite, and extreame dizzy spells. Day 4 ( thankfully a day off of work) I thought i was going to have a panic attack, my heart was racing, I was afraid to leave the house, and even feared talking on the phone. When i called my dr. to figure out if the symptoms would subside and go away, or if i should just stop the medication periode, he told me not to continue and not to stop taking this medication but to see a thearapist!!!! I hope some of you have a dr. that at least cares about your well being. None the less i stoped the use of the medication and started taking st. johns wort after hearing about from a friend, and i have found the otc med to be a life saver!!
Depression	maggie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	55-64	11/2/2008 1:59:55 PM	After five weeks of using Pristiq, I still have occasional nausea, not much energy and a not-quite-right feeling in general.  I'd like to wean off but am not sure of the right technique.  I did stop abruptly a few days ago and was an absolute mess by the second day.Those of you who have gotten off Pristiq - what is the best way to go about it?  Many thanks.

Depression	dana, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	11/1/2008 12:38:38 AM	I started my prescription two weeks ago and stuck with it despite the negative side effects I experienced the first two days - nausea and headaches. Those symptoms subsided after two days, and for the next two days I felt pretty good. However, this past week I've felt very tired, come home from work early and sleep for several hours. I wake up to take my dosage and then fall back to sleep for the night. Don't feel like leaving the house most days, and feel lethargic. I don't see how this will change, so decided to go off my treatment.

I was also having mood swings and sleeping difficulty due to the hot flashes.  Pristique definitely helped with the hot flashes, they reduced greatly, however I had major weight gain, and struggled with severe fatigue.  I then became depressed because of the weight gain.  I decided to go off of the medicine because I am unable to get the weight off while taking the meds.  Also, originally tried to go off abruptly, NO NOT do that, I was a mess.

Had huge weight gain (90 lbs. to 135 lbs.!!) and slept a lot. Switched a few months ago to Pristiq upon advice of doctor. My latest side effect is joint pain and exhaustion. I plan to wean off this medication, too.

I hae been on Pristiq for 6 weeks.  No weight gain worries...I have stomach cramps and diarrhea soon after taking it.  I'm a little more hostile I think, but more active than on Paxil.  I am not yet sure if I will stay on it.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	A, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	10/27/2008 2:41:55 PM	I had exteme side effects with this drug. I only took it for two days and my muscles started twitching. Wasn't able to take long enough to know if would help the anxiety. Make sure to read all the side effects before taking this drug, just in case your body does not agree to the drug.

For the first time since I was diagnosed with depression 13 years ago, I felt suicidal.I don't like Lexapro for the weight gain but I'm switching back to that.  I'd rather have weight gain and be ALIVE.  Lexapro worked great for my depression..
Depression	butterfli, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	10/26/2008 5:05:16 PM	NO headaches or sleeplessness.  Although I am taking with 300 mg of Wellbutrin - taking 50 mg - have noticed weight gain..can't seem to loose.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	10/24/2008 3:00:01 PM	Granted I am only on day 2, I have been having terrible side effects.  I take it in the morning, and starting about an hour after taking it for the next 4 or so hours I cannot stop vomiting.  I'm dizzy all day and tired, of course until I lay down and try to sleep.  The worst part is the hallucination.  I have never had a problem with that or self mutilation prior to taking the medication, but when I do i hear voices that tell me to self mutilate.  I have NEVER experienced anything like this.  I;m afraid to stop because I heard the side effects of stopping are worse.  use caution when you take this drug, especially if youre a smaller person (im 110 pounds)

I STARTED WITH LEXAPRO AND AFTER USING IT FOR 8 WEEKS, I NOTICED NO CHANGE IN MY SITUATION.   AFTER MY DOCTOR PRESCRIBED PRISTIQ, I ALMOST IMMEDIATELY FELT A SENSE OF RELIEF AND UNDER CONTROL OF THINGS.   FOR THE FIRST TIME IN QUITE SOME TIME, I FEEL IN CONTROL OF MY LIFE AND AM ABLE TO DEAL WITH DEVASTATING SITUATIONS WITH MUCH MORE EASE.   I CAN ACTUALLY ENJOY LIFE WITHOUT THE WORRY AND ANXIETY!!

No crying non-stop, less anxiety, beter moods.  The only thing I'm having a hard time with is sleeping.  I've gone from falling asleep in seconds to taking 30 to 60 mins.  I am tired!  My previous bed time was around 10:30 but now it's usually close to midnight.  If it keeps up I may have to change again.

It pooped out on me after MANY MANY great years but this one seems so 'light' - no brutal side effects beyond the transient dull headache and dyspepsia.  It's only week 5 but a huge difference is apparent.  That beiong said, I've noticed a lot of you other people with major depression have been experiencing sleep disturbances - me, too...what IS that?  I relate to one guy who spoke of a half-dream-like-sleep&quot;ish&quot; state, others who sleep short periods (usually not enough for REM, right - maybe 2, MAYBE 3 hours?) then are WIDE awake, sometimes bouncing back and forth between 2 hrs sleep, 2 hrs awake AND WEIRD DREAMS!  Anyone else awake panicky for no reason?DOES THIS GO AWAY WITH TIMW??? PLEASE bear some good news, anyone!  Good luck 2 u all!

DO NOT STOP THIS MEDICATION ABRUPTLY!  I am having severe paranoia, sobbing, nausea, insomnia, hellish nightmares, worst anxiety ever, feel like my head is going to explode from pressure.  My psychiatrist said this is normal when stopping abruptly, withdrawal peaking at 3 days.  I nearly ended up at the ER.  You MUST taper off slowly when stopping this med.  Work with your doctor or therapist/psychiatrist before just stopping!!!!!

Having tightness in the chest, pressure in my head and ears, heavy eyelids, worsening depression, severe anxiety, panic.   However, everyone is different.  I used to take Celexa (loved it), but switched to Cymbalta then Pristiq for MDD and Fibromyalgia.  Remember to not only talk to your doctor about this med, but research it! Read the reviews!  Be prepared.  Ask questions.  I have stopped Pristiq and will go back to Celexa. God Bless.

As everyone knows though, every medication works different on different people....you have to experiment and talk to your MD......there's something out there for everyone..you don't have to suffer!!

Depression	jc2jd, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/14/2008 9:11:11 PM	I was on 300 MG Effexor for past 3+ years. My doctor changed me to this and the results were amazing. I had to continue taking 1 effexor a day for a few days since my dosage was so high. This medicine did have bad effects the first couple days until my doctor informed me to stay on the Effexor with it. I'm on the 100MG pill now taken once a day. I have more energy, more enthusiasm, and just overall have alot of aspects of my life back. My doctor did not tell me of the interactions that can take place however. Never take any new prescription without reading up on it!! The doctors and the pharmicies don't do it for you!!

I am having major effects for past 2 days-head &amp; eyelids feel heavy, hard to breath, a sense of being overwhelmed, sobbing.  Has anyone else felt this?  I do not know at this point to suggest this medicine or not.  I certainly hope it will work and the effects I feel will go away soon.

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/13/2008 10:17:43 PM	This medication has brought me back to normal.  I have never felt so good in my life.  I have not had any manic episodes or any thought of hurting myself.  I have been on this med less than a month - it is a God send.  I have tried many meds over the years, and this is the best one for me by far.  I also take Geodon and Ambien.  I have a script for xanax, but I don't need them anymore.  I still feel a full range of emotions but not as extreme as they use to be.  I wish I had taken this drug 15 years ago.  My husband is also very happy with the results.
Bipolar Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/13/2008 2:05:16 PM	I have been on a variety of anti-depressants and mood stablizers for 20 years.  Pristiq is the best by far.  It not only diminished the depression, but does so with very little side effects.  I am not in a fog like I was with many other anti-deperessants.  I was a bit concerned because so many reviewers said it worked so quickly (in days), so if it hasn't kicked in yet, hang in there.  I woke up as a new person after about 2 1/2 weeks.  I highly recommend this drug!!
Panic Disorder	snackbarchic, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	10/12/2008 11:07:41 PM	i have been off and on different meds for the past few years for my panic disorder. I have to admit that I feel great about 85% of the time now. My anxiety still gets me about one week a month; but other than when my horomones knock me off kilter, it works great. My only complaint is that if you miss a dose for more that a couple of days it reallyy starts to mess you up. I have head shocks and dizziness. I would like to try a higher dose to see if that would ease the panic when I am hormonal.
Depression	lora5020, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/12/2008 9:42:21 AM	I had been on Zoloft for about 15 yrs and it eventually lost it's effectiveness. My MD switched me to Pristiq and the difference has been amazing!! I have a great deal of energy, feel positive and happy about life again and in general feel &quot;back to normal&quot;. I have been on it for approx 3.5 weeks. The only side effect I am experiencing is the insomnia. I have difficulty falling asleep, and then when I do, I end up waking up at around 3:00AM. At that point sleep becomes futile. I am hoping this will eventually pass. 
Depression	rosie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/12/2008 12:27:41 AM	I have been on and off different depression meds for years.  Typically I quite taking them due to the weight gain associated with them.  Pristiq! is the first antidepreseent I have found that not only makes me feel better, it also has actually decreased my appetite. I am actually trying to avoid my doctor because I am loosing weight so quickly, I don't want him to take me off it.  The only bad side effect I have noticed is dry mouth. No complaints. :)
Major Depressive Disorder	wammers, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	10/11/2008 5:31:25 AM	I have not been able to sleep, and since I have not been able to sleep all night for 36-48 hrs, I sit in the chair fall asleep for a minute, and I seem to be dreaming, and I am using my hand and pointing up.  I have never done anything like this before.  I know it is from the sleep deprivation, but will the Pristiq cause this kind of unusual behavior as well?
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/10/2008 11:25:08 AM	This is the first drug that I have taken to help with my depression and I love it. I noticed a change within the first week. I don't feel like crying all the time any more, I am excited to go out and do things and the change has been very noticable to not just me but with my family as well. The only side effect that I experienced was waking up every morning the first two weeks at 3am and not being able to fall back to sleep...that has since gone away and I have not expereinced any more side-effects!
Neuropathic Pain	debetude, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	10/9/2008 5:04:27 PM	I suffered from pain, depression, and mild bipolar. I do feel Pristiq has helped because I'm no longer crying, and can remain in control during the sad painful thoughts. Although, I cant seem to get to sleep and when I finally do, I stay in bed for up to 10 hours. I wished Pristiq helped with motovation. I'v tryed numberious antidepressants: Wellbutrin caused anxiety, had a &quot;melt down&quot; on Effxor (when I couldnt get a refill for a few days). Several people I know have recommended Cymbalta to me but my Doc wanted me to try Pristiq. I'v also noticed I have a mild cough with some conngestion that has'nt gone away. &quot;All I am saying...is give PILLS a chance&quot;. At least I have my humor! Hope this info helps.

Neuropathic Pain	MaryL, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/7/2008 9:57:18 AM	I had been on cymbalta for 2 1/2 months for fibromyalgia with no results and increased pain and brain fog. My doctor started me on Pristiq on Thursday. Within just a few days I was starting to feel like my old self. The pain is not gone but greatly decreased, and my brain fog has been clearing. I have now taken Pristiq for 5 days, and today I even put on makeup before going to work.  Every medication does not work for every person, but for anyone who has tried the other medications for fibromyalgia with no improvement I would recommend speaking with your physician to see if he/she thinks this may work for you.  It has been working for me and I am very thankful for this medication. It is nice to feel like me again and to be able function much closer to NORMAL! 
Depression	amyrele, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/3/2008 9:36:30 PM	After 10+ years being happy with Prozac and Wellbutrin, menopause (or some unknown reason) reduced me to the lifelong depressed person I had been as a young adult.  My doctor switched me to Pristiq which seemed to restore a greater level of happiness and sociability.  After a couple weeks though, I &quot;snapped&quot; for a couple days with an irritability I had never known and I was appalled at how mean-spirited my mood was. The doctor explained the manic phase of depression and added zyprexa.  After just a few days, I'm thrilled with my clarity of thought, focus, compassion for others, level of interest in life, ability to enjoy my work, and being able to sleep without worry.  Aside from headaches and more vivid dreams (both of which are acceptable side effects), I am thrilled with the results and wouldn't stop taking it for anything!

Major Depressive Disorder	glassgirl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	9/30/2008 9:30:09 PM	I suffer with both anxiety and major depression. Was put on Cymbalta a few years ago and that was a disaster. Pristiq has stopped the racing thoughts and most of the anxiety. No weight gain, but I am so very tired also no desire to do ANYTHING.  Dr has changed me from 50mg to 100mg I haven't felt any difference.  Would be happy if I had a little more energy. I would appreciate any help on the matter.
Depression	55-64 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	9/27/2008 7:05:29 PM	in four weeks I went from being unable to sleep and extream depression, even crying . I could not even be around my grand chrildren. It is wonderful. It also has, much to my suprise and excitement, it has no sexual side effects for me..I was on Cymbalta 3 years ago for pain management from back surgery and I was difficult to have an errection and impossible to have climax.

Depression	Tessa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/25/2008 11:37:52 AM	I have only been on this medicine for three days but noticed a change in how I felt after only two hours.  I asked to change meds because the Cymbalta I was on made me want to sleep all the time.  After over a month you would expect that to wear off some but, NO!!! I almost fell asleep behind the wheel twice, decided it was time for a change.  The doctor prescribed Pristiq.  After two hours on it I got a burst of energy and actually felt like doing something.  The next day I felt very bubbly and happy for the first time in months and MOST important of all is my sex drive came back.  Mind you I was not on the cymbalta for years either so that may also be a reason I had a change so soon, mabey not.  Yes I have side efects.  I have the ocasional dizzy spell and slight insomnia but, considering all the other side effects I have had to deal with, I am more than willing, and happy to soilder on and see if I continue to feel as good as I do now,even though it is so very early on in the treatment.  My family deserves a happy person, not a mean, snappy grouch.

Depression	Duke, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1		45-54	9/22/2008 12:12:18 PM	I took 50mg. a day for 30 days. It was HORRIBLE. While I did not notice any difference in my depression, it made my ANGER/HOSTILITY issues worse than they have ever been. It caused me to lose my patience and quit one of my jobs.  I had extreme sweating and the &quot;cold chills.&quot;  No thanks to my dr., I researched and found out it made my already high BP higher, did not interact with two of my other drugs, etc. My dr. took me off and replaced with Ativan. I have been 4 days without it and withdrawal symptoms are HORRIBLE. I am experiencing brain zaps--feels like the top of my head is going to explode; dizziness; nausea. 
Depression	tammy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	9/22/2008 1:51:25 AM	I began taking this drug at the adivice from my doctor because it was suppose the be the same as effexor but a lower dose and easier on the liver but the medication has not worked for me at all causing me to become more deppressed as if I was on no anti-deppressant at all and the anxiety is so bad now that I can't hardly make it out of the house again. I pray that no one else has been effected like this and that special precautions will be taken in prescribing this drug to anyone that is on effexor now. I tried it for 7weeks and am now back to where I was before the effexor and am searching for a new treatment. I pray this review reaches people.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	psychostudent, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	9/20/2008 9:05:23 PM	Anxiety treatment was changed from Lexapro 20mg to Pristiq 50mg. After 4 weeks on this medication, I became very anxious, could not control my anger and had suicidal thoughts. I pretty much alienated myself from family &amp; co-workers during that time.  Needless to say, I ended the treatment and started Lexapro again!

It doesn't work as well as Zoloft did, but for the most part, I am satisfied with it. If I miss it for even one day, I can tell my emotions aren't good, I could cry easily. Also, even one day missed causes withdrawals. Frequently when my heartbeats I can feel it in my eardrums and my vision &quot;jolts&quot;. I have to make sure I take it everyday. It's definitely better than the experiences I had with Wellbutrin, Cymbalta, and many others.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	fgth, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	35-44	9/19/2008 11:25:07 AM	I was prescribed pristiq for anxiety and since it takes 2 to 3 weeks to kick in I stayed with it. The first 10 days were good then the side effects started. I got 3/4 of them. Nassea, vomiting, sweats, chills etc. Had to miss work one day because of this. The pill was worse than the problem it was suppose to help
Depression	Jeffrie Ann, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	45-54	9/18/2008 5:16:53 PM	I have been taking Pristiq for 3.5 weeks, my depression is getting better. side effects minimul, but I don't loke the blurred vision so far. The person who reviewed this drug and said B Cross/B Shield doesn't cover should check again. I have the Anthem version of BC/BS and they did start to cover as of 9/1/08. I just hope I keep getting better and the vision improves!
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/16/2008 10:18:28 PM	The first 2 days all I did was sleep.  After that, no sleepiness.  I do have a dry mouth but other than that, no side effects at all.  I really do feel different since taking the drug - a very good different.  My family has also commented on the change in me.  I was on Lexapro previously and I'm much happier with Pristiq both because of the less side effects and the overall change in me.
Bipolar Depression	Depressednomore, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/12/2008 9:27:29 PM	I was diagnosed with chronic depression in 1978 and three years ago with bipolar disorder.  I've taken more antipressants than I could possibly count, none of which have had more than a  minimal effect until I started taking PRISTIQ! About 5 weeks ago my doctor took me off a combination of EffexorXR and Wellbutrin and prescribed Pristiq in their place. He continued my use of Lamictal. The change has been dramatic.  I just woke up one morning suddenly realizing  that I wasn't depressed and I remember thinking &quot;Oh my God, is this was normal people feel like?!&quot; It happened quite suddenly. I'm still feeling some of the confusion and disorientation associated with major depression however my doctor says that these symptoms should subside. I've also noticed a decrease in my need for Xanax and my insomnia has all but stopped. I only wish is that something like Pristiq had been available 40 years ago! 
Major Depressive Disorder	Dana, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/10/2008 10:43:05 PM	I have taken Pristiq for 4 months now. It took about a month to work through switching from 6 years of taking Effexor XR 150mg to 50mg of Prstiq. I am happy with the less side effects and my depression has dissappeared. I still suffer from anxiety, but even that is much less. Overall I am pretty happy with this medication, if you can be happy with one?

I would like to say they have been helpful but come on, a report on how you are feeling after being on the medication for 2, 6, 7 days! A report after a month would be good feedback.  My experience with Pristiq after one month was I may have felt a little benefit but this was offset by side effects including upset stomach/diarrhea, constant itching and similar sexual side effects with effexor.

I have fibromylgia and my husband has P.T.S.D. from Nam, lots of problems in our lives. After 6 weeks as an out patient at a behavioral center, I was diagnosed with bipolar. I've been on Pristiq for 9 wks. now. The only symptom I recognize is terrible terrible nausea. Effects me all day long, everyday. I am going off it! Not worth it to me.

My husband suddenly died in March and I became very depressed. The Dr. game me the Pristiq and it worked the quickest of any I've ever taken. I've been on it for 3 mos. I haven't had any side effects. I am so thankful for this new drug.

I have trouble sleeping now, I have TERRIBLE headaches on a daily basis, and horrible nausea.  Dr told me to take it every other day until I get used to it and the nausea goes away, but it has only gotten worse.  DO NOT TRUST NEW DRUGS!!!

Headache, jittery, eyes feel buggy,eyes dilated, just want to close my eyes, shortness of breath, stiff neck, uncoordinated, dizzy, burpy, difficulty urinating, moments of severe fatigue. Would rather cry all day than experience these side effects. 
Major Depressive Disorder	AM, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	25-34	8/27/2008 3:01:07 PM	I took Pristiq for a week about 2 and a half months ago.  I was feeling out of control in the sense that I was smiling awkwardly, somewhat abnormally. I figured that I was in a transition period, however, after a week I stopped taking it because I feel agitated and a little paranoid about how I was talking, I felt I was talking too fast.  Last night I started again, my mood has been fairly normal today although I have an accented feeling in my chest. I also woke up with diarrhea but I can't say that is for sure a result of the drug. I took another one this morning and I am not feeling the anxiety I felt all day yesterday. I feel that depression can be beat buy fighting to focus on good. I hoping this drup will give me the boost I need. 
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	8/26/2008 10:08:06 PM	I previously reviewed this drug last month, and here to update. Turns out many, or all of the side effects I was having WERE related to Pristiq 50-100mg: Daily- severe headaches, Vomiting, Dizziness, Numbness in one foot, fast irregular heartbeat (HR 99-110), Blurred Vision, very little (and concentrated) urine, nearly fainted when standing up, low grade temp (99-100), &amp; difficulty concentrating. Would not recommend anyone take 100mgs.

My doctor suggested changing to Pristiq.  I've taken it for 3 weeks and and cannot take it anymore!! My blood pressure is higher, I have a headache everyday, I'm depressed now, and feel like my brain is scrambled. I do NOT need the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. I feel like I'm getting a shot of adrenaline, which I definitely DO NOT need. I'm jumpy enough.  I'm going back tothe SSRIs. Be very careful with this medication if you're anxious or panicky.

I have been taking Pristiq for 5 days and it is working well.  There are side effects - nausea, dry mouth and major loss of appetite (I've lost 4 pounds in 5 days).  I feel like I'm taking ephedrine, but I hope the weight loss continues.  I am very pleased with this medication, but one of my complaints was that I have problems sleeping.  This medication made that worse, but my doctor gave me Xanax to help me fall asleep.  
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	8/16/2008 1:11:52 AM	The reason I got put on this medication was because I was very angry all the time. I was afraid I was going to take it out on my children (which I hadn't) But I was still afraid it was going to come to that...I have a 2 year old and they are a BIG challenge, on top of that I just had a baby and my husband was deployed to Iraq....The first day I took it I was just OUT OF IT. Nothing bothered me... After a while I got ack to &quot;normal&quot; which is the way I wanna be...not getting mad all the time but knowing when to correctly punish my child. I love this drug and it has been a god send to me.
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	MetalGoddess, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	25-34	8/15/2008 8:54:39 AM	I began taking this medication replacing Cellexa in the treatment of my PTSD. I have found that my excitability (which was why my Doc switched meds), has stayed the same. Being one of the millions of the un-insured, I also find it more than a little insulting that the same compound I am taking now would be a by-product of Effexor XR,  which would cost me over $100.00 less a month. The fact that drug manufacturers get over on us the way they do is shameful. I don't feel this drug treated me better than any SSRI I have taken. I will be renewing my old prescription, until the next &quot;next best thing&quot; comes along.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	8/13/2008 11:09:45 AM	Changed to Pristiq 50 mg from 150mg of Effexor. It seems to be controlling symptoms of depression. I have experienced symptoms of moodiness. The Dr. prescribed 25mg of Lamictal at bedtime for moodiness. I am doing great now. My insurance covers both meds.
Depression	ktbugg1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	8/12/2008 1:24:29 PM	No side effects only been taking for a week.  Hopeful it will help my long term depression which has not been helped by about 30 different antidepressants over the years.
Depression	Tim O., 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	3	Male	45-54	8/10/2008 3:47:58 PM	I have been taking this medication for 2 weeks now. It seems to be helping with my severe days of depression. I feel however that it is keeping my blood pressure high. I am taking Lotril 5/10mg for my blood pressure and it is not working.

Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	45-54	8/3/2008 10:34:58 PM	It caused me to be very tired no matter what time of day I took the medication. It also caused an increase in irritability and anziety. I could not function at work on this due to the fatigue.
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	8/3/2008 3:37:16 PM	Had a horrible anaphylactic (allergic) reaction with the first dose which, 4 days later, I'm still trying to recover from.  Signs: nausea, mini-seizures.  In the ER, I was given Solu-Medrol and Ativan to counteract it, but I don't feel much better yet.  Wish I knew what was in it that I'm allergic to.  I've taken almost all of the other anti-depressants at one time or another with no reaction except to the dyes in them to which I already know I'm allergic.  This was the worst experience I've ever had with an anti-depressant.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	8/2/2008 7:52:46 PM	Have been on Pristiq 50mg for about 5 weeks. No improvement w/O.C.D. Then, Dr increased dose to 100mg about a week ago. Symptoms greatly improved, however having some serious side effects: dizziness, feeling faint when standing up, blurred vision, nausea, insomnia, and moderate daily headaches. Dr. advised stay on med at 100mg, maybe drug interaction? Will update you if that's the case. I suspect s/e really due to Pristiq.
Major Depressive Disorder	Shawn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	45-54	7/30/2008 2:24:35 PM	I just started this medication two days ago. I have such racing thoughts I cannot focus on any one thing. I need to know the side effects involved in taking this medication.
Depression	TroubleInParadise, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	7/29/2008 8:30:42 PM	After taking Celexa, Lexapro, Zoloft and others for 10 years, I felt my depression and overall health getting worse, so I asked for something new. My psychiatrist suggested Pristiq. After only 4 days, I decided to stop taking it because of unbearable night sweats, as well as some daytime sweating. One night, I had to change my sweat-soaked PJs three times and then try to sleep wrapped in a towel. This was MUCH worse then the occasional night sweats I experienced with other antidepressants. Now that I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, I am on Cymbalta, and feeling better with only minor side effects. 
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/27/2008 10:12:47 AM	after being on zoloft,effexor,prozac...I see a difference...it is a great drug for my depression...and my ins covers it unlike when effexor first came out.
Depression		2	4	1			7/27/2008 3:03:41 AM	I have noticed a terrible headache with this drug.  Switched from effexor after almost 8 years.  I do not like it.  I am irritable and can not sleep without sleeping meds.  I don't want to cycle my life around a medicine.
Depression	kathy60158, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	7/26/2008 12:27:03 AM	I was put on this medicine after 8 years on Effexor XR.  After taking this for two weeks I noticed that my depression is getting worse.  I have started back crying and beginning to think of sucide again.  I plan to talk to my doctor as soon as possible and get another medicine since it appears this one is not helping at all.
Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	7/24/2008 6:44:52 PM	I switched to this from EffexorXR.  I was taking a very high dose of effexor and don't quit understand how cutting back to just 50mg can justify my symptoms.  I have also had the sleepless night, and increase hostility at times.  I tried to increase to 100mg, but I felt aweful.  I still have my moments, but i will stick to the 50mg once a day.
Depression	suzanne3, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	7/20/2008 8:43:51 PM	I was on 100 mg. for 1 month and did not feel much emotion &amp; couldn't get out of bed Down to 50mg. for 6 days and so emotional about everything.  Cry, which I haven't been able to do when on 100 mg. Is this normal?
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	7/18/2008 4:59:45 PM	only on it for 2 1/2 weeks so far.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/17/2008 10:24:10 PM	I have ADHD with comorbid bipolar and was put on this by a doctor when I had asked for stimulants. The doctor was really pushy about me taking an anti-depressant for my ADHD symptoms, even though I was adamant that it would not help. I am now having manic problems and go for days on end without sleeping. I have since found out that people with bipolar disorder should not take Pristiq as it can lead to manic problems. I now am having to take another psychotropic to try to counter the effects the Pristiq. No matter how much a doctor pushes drugs, always do the research first and don't take anything you are not sure about
Depression	Kim, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	7/16/2008 7:39:43 PM	After 5 days, had severe reaction. Difficulty breathing, hands and feet flushed, so with Dr's advice, I stopped taking it. Now I am wondering , how long will I have these side effects?
Depression	Janet, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	7/14/2008 6:45:04 PM	I have been on Effexor XR for about 2 yrs.  I was at a dosage where I had to pay for 2 prescriptions - one 150mg dose and one 37.5 mg dose.  The cost became too much to bear and when I asked about a way to avoid paying for 2 prescriptions my dr. switched me to Pristiq.  I am on day 6 of the medication.  I haven't noticed any difference in the treatment of depression seems to work just as well as the effexor.  I am not sure how my current dose of pristiq compares to my prior dose of Effexor XR.  The main complaint that I have at this point is insomnia.  Night before last I slept WAY too much and last night I slept hardly any at all.   We shall see how tonight goes.  I guess only time will tell.  So far I am on samples of this and do not know if my insurance will cover or not after the samples run out.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	7/14/2008 1:47:55 PM	Pristiq has calmed me down alot. I can think of other things besides bills and cleaning. It has made me able to slow down a little and enjoy my everyday life. I've only been on it for about 6 weeks now, but so far so good! 
Depression	MassHope, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	7/10/2008 4:06:39 PM	I have been dealing with General Anxiety Disorder and Depression,this drug was prescribed to me just recently.  Although I am experiencing some side effects: panic attacks, headache, stomach ache I have been able to get through them and they have not lasted for long periods of time.  I am willing to stick with this in order to see if it helps.  After feeling ALONE and so desperately sad for so long it is worth a shot! 
Major Depressive Disorder	CGB, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	7/9/2008 7:31:13 PM	I was taking Effexor XR.  My Dr wanted me to try this med.  I felt better on days 1-7.  By the end of my 1st week, I started to feel numbness and tingling on hands/feet; my blood pressure is higher than usual; and my heart rate is always over 100 (even at rest!).  I am calling my Dr next week -- I think I want my &quot;old&quot; medicine back.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	7/9/2008 6:09:46 PM	I was prescribed this medication for repeated episodes of anxiety.  I took my first dose at noon, right after I returned home from the pharmacy.  That very night, I experienced my worst series of panic attacks.  Needless to say, I called my doctor first thing the next morning.  I don't plan on ever taking this drug again.If anyone has a success story with this, or a follow-up to a post below, I would love to hear it. 
Major Depressive Disorder	Janet, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	7/9/2008 3:43:26 PM	I also have generalized anxiety disorder and this only made me feel more anxious and irritated. I thought I was the only one until I read these reviews. I feel more sure now that I wasn't alone and can honestly report to Dr. these symptoms. I will stay on my 4 yr. treatment of EffexorXR. I want to also, tell all of you who have severe depression to never feel alone and others are thinking of you. I will be. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	7/9/2008 2:52:03 PM	I noticed side effects from the start.  Stomach was very upset, dizzy, and I couldn't fall asleep at night. Side effects might have gotten better with time but I wasn't able to function enough to stick with it.
Bipolar Depression	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female		7/8/2008 9:13:35 PM	After taking Effexor XR for 2 years, I have now switched over to this medicine. I have only been taking it for 3 weeks and so far, I haven't really noticed anything except I have been more agitated and very sleepy in the morning after a decent night of sleep.  I'm hoping this will get better.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/8/2008 6:37:02 PM	The first week was very angry, went away!

Neuropathic Pain	celena128, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	6/30/2008 2:41:31 PM	I was perscribed Pristiq for neurological pain from fibromyalgia and treatment of depression from years of pain. Starting SECOND day of use I had much restlessness with a manic episode and along with insomnia.THIRD day of use I had a SEVERE reaction called SERENTONIN SYNDROM and felt like I was going to DIE! Pristiq is AWEFUL medicine... needs to be taken off of the market! On my 3rd day on this medication I had serious mania, restlessness, clamy sweats, extremely fast hearbeat as if heart would burst, dizziness, loss of coordination, shakiness, blacking out lightheadedness, tingling &amp; burning internally of chest... felt as if I was going to die! I'm not one to jump to any conclusions, however I was so terrified and never felt anything like this in my life. I am the 2nd patient in my doc's practice to have a serious reaction... STAY AWAY FROM PRISTIQ, request alternatives!!!
Other	MM, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	35-44	6/25/2008 12:31:59 PM	Been on for 7 days - - my &quot;OTHER&quot; category is side effects.  This definitely reduced my symptom of 'unable to ejaculate' with my prior drug.  However, I don't feel much of a change, and can semi-relate to a couple other reviews about 'being more aggressive'.  I didn't have that with the other med, HOWEVER, the other med reduced my 'libido' (interest) a bit as well . . . Tough call at this point!!!  
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	6/25/2008 12:05:14 PM	Been on this medication for 4 weeks now.  Switched from Effexor XR and seeing much more favorable results with Pristiq.  Swithed from the Effexor because it was upsetting my stomach in an extreme manner.  The only major side effect I've experienced has been insomnia.  Did notice mild irritability within the first week of taking it, but it went away quickly.  If what you're taking isn't working, I'd highly recommend giving this one a try.
Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	6/23/2008 12:37:24 AM	I have been on this med for 10 days and at first it made my brain feel really weird as if it was beinging stimulated. I had my arm and toes feel num with a tingle sensation. I d get moody, but compared to the other 3 meds I have tried this one seems to be working for me.

Unfortunately now I have to be switched to something else, hopefully it works just as well.
