Acne	CL2010, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	8/29/2012 2:56:15 PM	I started to take Ortho Cyclen when my acne started to act up. I was on Ortho Cyclen for about 1.5 years, then noticed no vaginal discharge or lubrication. My OBGYN decided to put my on Ortho Tri Cylcen, I was on this for 6 months. Both helped with the acne, but I still had vaginal discomfort. I wouldn't suggest this pill to anyone. It took a toll on my three year relationship, and threatened my new one. I have been off birth control for about 2 weeks, and already have see a huge difference. My discharge is starting to come back and so is my desire for sex.

Birth Control	Taybee, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	2	Female	13-18	7/1/2012 1:01:22 AM	Ive been on the pill for almost a month now. At first it wasn't so bad, then about a week later I started experiencing constant nausea, stomach cramping, and definite mood swings. I would go from the happy loving girlfriend I usually am to a depressed sleepy lunatic that would cry for no reason. This pill made my acne 10 times worse, and the 2nd week of taking the blue pills I started my period which has been going on for the past week and a half. Before the pill my periods were 5 days. Although the pill does have some good side effects like the fact that I gained a whole cup size, the bad outweigh the good. I think I'll wait a month and start up again.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	2	5	1	Female	19-24	6/27/2012 1:34:35 PM	I was taking this as a form of contraception, I started taking it in August and was experiencing random morning sickness, i would be on the road driving and would get nauseous out of no where. This pill made me lose my appetite quite often. I switched the times i took the pill three times, and was still experiencing side effects up until i stopped taking them in March.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	6/24/2012 11:59:45 AM	I was on Yaz for 2 years and had TERRIBLE migraines but other then that was pleased. Changed doctors and decided to try something else to avoid migraines and was prescriped ortho-cyclen. i only took it for 1 month. every morning i would wake up incredibily nauseous. i gained 12 lbs. ive never had acne in my life, on ortho cyclen, my acne was out of control. like huge painful pimples. and i would have multiple days of migraines. to the point where i was throwing up. i have prescribed migraine medicine and it wouldn't take away these migraines. i finally had to take percocet i was prescribed from a shoulder surgery in december. terrible terrible. my doctor switched me to lutera now because it has low estrogen levels. she said is lutera doesn't help me, i just wont be able to take birth control pills. comforting. not ideal for a 21 year old, but migraines are no joke. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	6/16/2012 9:44:43 PM	I've been on this pill for over 6 years now. It was great! No side effects at all, I actually lost weight without special diet or exercises. No vaginal dryness or low sex drive. However, after I turned 31 I noticed changes in my face expression like I got older many years, and feeling slow/dump sometime along with mild depression and anxiety. I just got married, all other dreams came true, my life is great, and I should be happy like a clam. I don't know if this is a pill fault or something else. Maybe I'm taking them for too long? Recently my doctor changed it into Tri-Syntec for insurance reasons and supposly be better for the women body. Will see...

Birth Control	cupsizecases, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/20/2012 8:38:17 AM	I have been off birth control for about 1 1/2 years now. My periods were so out of wack that I didn't have a period for 10 straight months,not even spotting! Then recently I started bleeding very heavily and with very large (lemon sized) blood clots. I went to the hospital and was diagnosed with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. I have now been on this pill for one week and the bleeding has stopped entirely. I have no more abdominal pain and my other symptoms have subsided. The first 2 days on orthi tri cyclen I had a slight upset stomach, but i've been fine since. I have also noticed my &quot;always craving something&quot; appetite is diminished. I feel great! 
Birth Control	Khloey_, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	4/20/2012 10:04:08 PM	I've had little issues with this pill, this is my first time using Birthcontrol, but so far I've been extremely happy with it. The only thing that it has done that is a negative affect is it has made me slightly more sensitive, like I cry during movies or a sad picture way easier. But other than that I have nooooooo other side affects, no blotting, no sensitivity out of the norm, no bad acne, no depression.. I'm rather happy about it. :)

It made my skin break out bad! I have been taking it for 3 months.  I still get cramps (I got on the pill to prevent pain and to regulate).  My periods are still heavy.  There is an increase in hunger but I haven't gained weight from the pill.  I prefer lo ovral.

Birth Control	Jess, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	3/18/2012 12:18:28 AM	This is the first birth control I've ever taken, and overall I've been pleased. My side effects were minimal despite being overweight. I did have pretty bad nausea during the first week of a new pack. I also felt more emotional, had tender breasts, and ocassional headaches, but these were all mild. Nausea was my biggest issue.Despite that, this pill actually cleared up my skin. It's very easy to take, and I'm pleased overall with this pill.

Birth Control	ConfusedInKY, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	2/9/2012 9:30:07 AM	Don't know what to think about this drug yet. Besides the mood swings the first couple of days not really had an issues with it, however, Dr tells me to start this med 10 days into a new cycle. (Prbably should have waited like package says but Doc knows best, right?) OK so I did but now I'm late. (Based on my normal cycle) Hoping this drug is the reason! This was suppose to be a stepping stone to get me to an appointment for the IUD to be inserted. (I have 7 children and the last two times I have tried to get this inserted, God had other plans for me. Pregnant before it could be done.) Hopefully this drug can cause this issue, both pregnancy test say negative but wonder also if pill could cause false negatives too due to hormones. So confused!
Birth Control	timeforachange, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	2/3/2012 9:53:15 PM	I'd like to start by saying I'm a non-smoker who eats healthy and exercises regularly.  This is the only prescription med I'm on.  I have been on Ortho Cyclen for just over a decade.  I just turned 30 this year, and I've started to put two and two together, in terms of realizing that something was not quite right.  In terms of effectiveness as birth control, I've never had a problem; in terms of effects on other elements of my life, I'm starting to see evidence of problems.  Maybe it's in part due to my own changing chemistry as I age, or the length of time I've been on this med, but I'm finding myself to be moodier, having trouble sleeping through the night (it's not unusual to wake up around 2am...3am...4am...sometimes, with whacked out, vivid, frightening dreams...then I'm exhausted when my alarm actually goes off, of course...mind you, I was the college kid who used to sleep to 2pm on a weekend without issue), and showing signs of depression (which was never a problem for me).  I can't point to a problem in my life looming big enough to make me so quick to cry and so depressed, so that has me worried.  On top of that, I'm a competitive athlete, and my season is in the summer--guess what that means?  My skin gets a lovely mottled effect when I tan (especially on my thighs).  I used to consistently turn a nice, golden brown on account of my Mediterranean heritage.  Now I'm pretty sure I could match a leopard for camouflage.  In short, I think it's time for me and Ortho Cyclen to part ways.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	19-24	1/21/2012 10:55:25 AM	I have only been taking ortho-cyclen for a month but so far I hate it. I have been bleeding or spotting every day since I began taking it. I switched from Yaz because of the price. I had absolutely no problems with Yaz/Beyaz/Gianvi and would recommend those if you don't mind paying $30/month. Please let me know if anyone know of a cheaper oral birth control that is better than ortho-cyclen. Thanks 
Birth Control	Amy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/20/2012 8:07:14 PM	I was originally on this pill 15 years ago- I was switched for insurance reasons to OrthoTriCyclen and then OrthoTriCyclen-Lo.  I just got back on the OrthoCyclen because I loved the way my body felt while I was on it at age 25. The first 2 days I had mild stomach upset, nothing major, and a mild funny headache.  Those symptoms are gone and I have noticed a huge improvement in my very acne-prone skin:  no breakouts at all and my scarring has lightened!  Also it is difficult for me to maintain a healthy weight; I have been underweight with lack of energy on my previous pills but now my appetite has increased and I have gained about 3 lbs in the past week.  Most women would consider this a bad side effect but I am very pleased- also my breasts feel and look fuller but not tender. Every woman's chemistry is different, but for me this pill is fantastic!
Birth Control	bc4u, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	12/24/2011 10:18:25 PM	Pros: no pregnancy, no overwhelming desire to eat anything in sight. Able to lose weight easily. Steady stream of hormones so I'm more calm except come placebo time. Cons: Extremely itchy skin (rashes),  mild acne. Stretch marks on my arms (bicep area), thighs and love handles. Frequent burping and mild heartburn for first few months. The overall experience has been better than with Ortho TRI cyclen and Sronyx. If it wasn't for these horrid rashes I would stay on it.

My periods were semi-bad before and i had horrible cramps. While taking this pill i have had major mood swings. I cry spontaneously, i get severely ill for no reason, and I usually feel down and out. I have no sex drive whatsoever, on average I have sex twice a week and I live with my boyfriend. I get horrible migraines and I rarely get the opportunity to sleep at night. My appetite varies, sometimes i'm hungry but most times i'm not. Since I began taking this pill I have became nauseous and I puke randomly. I have also gained almost ten pounds. My period for the month of october lasted two weeks and was an immortal hell, that included heavier bleeding with blood clots and more severe cramps than I was already having. I do not recommend this bcp to anyone it has been a truly horrible experience for me and i plan to get off of it as soon as possible.

A minute of bad pain and ten minutes of ease... Other than that I have had no side affects. It has made my periods much lighter and I am pretty satisfied.
Birth Control	Justanotherreviewer, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	10/27/2011 4:34:45 PM	This is the first form of birth control I have ever used and it's been a great experience so far. I've been on it for about a year and the only real symptom I've had is occasional nausea - it's really manageable and I nothing I can't handle. Also, I used to have a terribly heavy period that was super irregular and now it's great knowing exactly when it's coming. It's also made my period WAYY lighter to where I never ever have to worry about it leaking through my clothing (which I used to worry about). All in all it's been great for me.

Other then that...BAD TERRIBLE acne, nausea, HEADACHES ALL THE TIME, SUPER tender breasts. I'm going back to my other pill !

Other	NicoleY, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/28/2011 11:49:14 PM	I have suffered from PMDD for as long as I can remember as many other women in my family also have.  I took Yaz for many years and while it helped, it really only took the edge off, I still suffered from being tired, irritable, swings in my appetite, etc.  I was advised to discontinue Yaz by my OB and so I opted to try a few different anit-depressants, those were a huge mistake. I've tried herbal supplements, change in diet etc, nothing worked. Then I read an article about how estrogen begins to decline in your 30's.  Since progesterone is what makes PMDD bad I realized I needed more estrogen.  I paid a visit to my OB/Gyn who put me on Ortho-Cyclen.  It has the highest level of estrogen you can get along with the lowest level of progestin, exactly what I needed.  I'm into my second month and my PMDD has been better than I can ever remember it.  My skin is adjusting, my boobs have grown 2 cups sizes, since my appetite is more consistent I've put on 8 pounds but the hubby likes it so that's not all bad.  I went through IVF with one of my kids so I know what higher levels of hormones can do and that it will take some time to adjust.  My cervix was definitely sensitive the first month; any time we had sex and he would bump into it I'd have a good bit of spotting.  That has stopped though.  This med is absolutely not right for everyone, given the high level of estrogen and really low level of progestin I imagine that most would have issues with it.  For me its great and although I hate taking a pill everyday it is 100% worth not having to deal with moderate PMDD symptoms.  I think if you suffer from estrogen deficiency or PMDD Ortho-Cyclen would be something to consider.
Birth Control	JC, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/17/2011 11:21:38 PM	I tied the today sponge and I gotten tired of spending $16.00 every few weeks for protection. So late last summer, I decided to go to the clinic(insurance was out) and to be put on birth control. Thank to the man upstairs, I just realizing realize that I've been taking the pill backwards. lol I been taking the 21 blue pills with no period and having my period on the last green pills. Yeah, I should of know that but I', learning. lol Plus I played around with it and it stretch my cyclen out to about 2 weeks. Yeah, I wasn't a happy camper but I got back on my schedule until last month. The side affect I had was mood swings and craving. That's why I change it from the morning to the evening. Other then that this birth control was pretty good to me. It also help me with my cramps so that was a great bonus! Since I now have Insurance, I had to leave the clinic and find a OB/GYN. I found one and she suggested  Sprintec 28 since it's a cheaper brand with the same ingrendants.

At first i had no symptoms, but within two months i started getting nausea,and tender breasts. What i like about the pills is that it does not affect my mood so I'm not going psycho on people like other birth control pills make me feel.

After taking it for two months, I have a decreased discharge and almost no lubrication for intercourse. It was kind of putting a damper on my sex life. I am switching immediately!

Birth Control	 Female 	5	4	5	Female		4/1/2011 3:50:35 PM	Orthocyclen, just like any other method of oral birth control , is a pain to take.  HOwever, if taken as recommended, it should be effective.  Additionally, it helped improve my acne and scarring, as well as, made for lighter periods that only last tops 4 days.  It is amazing!

Birth Control	 (Patient) 	5	1	1			3/19/2011 10:32:27 PM	I'm actually only three weeks into the first pack, but I have been dealing with light headedness, stomach aches and nausea on a daily basis, and have a hard time getting to sleep at night (typically as a result of the stomach issues). Hope these side effects go away with time.

I have had some experiences with acne, but it wasn't much and I have had mood swings like crazy. I have become impatient, emotional, very irrative and somewhat depressed. I don't know what to do most of the time. I'm starting to feel cramps here and there, but no sign of my cycle yet. I hope I'm not experiencing the side effects and this pill doesn't work.

Other	justme, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	1/27/2011 2:31:07 PM	I switched from a levonorgestrel/ progestin pill to this one due to spotting. I have had better moods and no problems. I have lost weight on this pill in abdominal areas, but I find it more difficult (slightly) to build muscle. I have also lost weight on Depo Provera, but it did not affect my muscle strength.  Not sure if it is the pill or other factors that my skin is a little drier. I have less breaking out on this pill than the previous one. I have very little stress in my life, eat healthy, workout moderately before I started this pill. I also consume very little sugar or processed foods.  The estrogen doesnt affect me like it may others, I never had problems with cramping on or off any birth control. I think that the user's lifestyle has some effect on how she may react to the medication.

The spotting stopped pretty quickly, but I have a lot of side effects from it.  I've never had a lot of acne before, but now I have the most I've ever had.  My period is much worse (cramping, heavier).  I've had yeast infections that are nearly impossible to cure (pill and 2 one day doses of the insert didn't fully cure it this past time) and keep coming back.  I've been more anxious than usual (which is bad enough), and just generally feel run down.  I hate being on the pill so much that I'm getting an IUD in 2 days.
Birth Control	Jill, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	12/29/2010 3:17:00 PM	I switched from ortho tri-cyclen to this pill because once my body gets used to a pill, I start spotting and not wanting sex which is abnormal for me. This pill has made me break out in patches on my face, which is not my norm. I am starting to beleive it's the cause of my bad moods and heart palpitations also, but that could just be a health issue of my own. Reading some of these reviews scare me, wondering if I may get a clot also. But any bcp can do that! Only real complaint is the face breakouts, other than that, it has proven affective! no more babies for us we are happy with one! Oh and just take it before bed, right before you brush your teeth and you won't get sick. If I take mine in the morning, I feel sick to my stomach all day. Also, try eating something small before you take it. Empty stomachs don't like bcp's! trust me this is the 5th kind of bcp I've taken in 14 years, so I've learned...common sense,really girls!!!Thank you!!! :-)

I do get tender boobs around the week before my period starts, sometimes they are really really tender to touch but, it goes away a few days later. I do get a little moody but, thats the day before I usually start my period. I had 0 dizziness, nausea, cramps,heavy bleeding. My period last sometimes 3-5 days. Not very heavy but, every once in a while it will be heavy. I enjoy this pill. I have 0 complaints other than the boobs getting sore ( doesnt happen every mth). I love it. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	11/9/2010 5:32:55 PM	I hated this pill.  I used it for the 3 months I was prescribed but the side effects didn't let up.  My mood swings were extreme.  It felt like I was in constant pms.  I was depressed and anxious... cried daily and for no reason.  I even had trouble sleeping.  The only plus was a very light, short period.  It only took a few days on a new pill to feel like myself again.  Every body is different.  Don't be afraid to try different pills until you find one that works for you.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	8/26/2010 10:08:22 AM	I have been a regular user of Ortho Tri-Cyclen for over 15 years.  I never had any major problems, however, when I tried to take the pills continuously (w/out taking the placebo pill) to stop my periods, I was having continuous spotting.  My doctor recommended that I try Ortho Cyclen to see if my spotting would stop.  Well, the spotting has gotten worse -- I have even seen blood clots.  In addition, I developed a yeast infection which I haven't had in years.  The yeast infection was treated but I still have soreness and mild itching.  My breast size increased and is very sore and tender.  I have also experienced bloating --I thought that it would go away but it hasn't. Plus acne on my forehead,which I never get.  Finally, and this is probably the worse side effect that I have experienced, are major mood swings.  For the past few days I have felt on the verge of tears and I have flown off the handle at the smallest things.  My boyfriend has noticed a change in my behavior as well.  Based on my experience with this pill, I am definitely going to go back to my old pill.  I was hoping that I could minimize the amount of periods I have, but I would rather deal with a few days of seeing my period than to deal with these side effects again.

But every woman is different. Even a womans body is constantly changing. It's important to discuss with your doctor first. All contraceptives have side effects that can be mild to severe (like clots). You just have to see what works for you. Also, you should not smoke while on any OC pill.
Birth Control	Colorado , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	8/10/2010 6:53:09 PM	As soon as I started using the generic drug &quot;Spintec 28&quot; I was a litte sick to my stomach for a few days, but that went away. I noticed in my third week I feel a little moody and my breasts are sore, but I am a week away from starting my cycle. No weight gain, no hair loss, or acne issues for me. I like this drug so far. I will be sure to visit my doctor within the first six months of taking this to make sure everything is going well with my health especially after reading other people's health problems on this drug. Yikes.  
Painful Periods	steezypz, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/16/2010 5:56:48 PM	ve been on yaz and lo-ogestrel in the past. i still had bad cramps and i couldnt get rid of the 5-10 pounds i gained since i started birth control. i just started ortho cyclen 13 days ago and ive already lost 5 pounds (im a small girl so it makes a big difference). my mood also doesnt feel any different. and i have had no adverse side affects. ill update again if anything goes wrong. but so far this is a great birth control!

Birth Control	tummy troubles, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	6/26/2010 7:15:14 PM	I switched pills bc my provider no longer provided loestrin 24 which I loved. I have been taking Ortho cyclen 28 for about 3 months and it is working as far as keeping me from getting pregnant but it gives me a stomach ache everyday. I thought it was from food, but I cant even take vitamins while on this bc bc I get nauseous. Today it made me really sick and even after vomiting and now an empty stomach it hurts so much still. I am discontinuing my use of this pill. Also, my breast increased in size and my weight fluctuates. I get headaches and terrible mood swings. I just had a horrible time with this pill.

Ortho clyclen lessened my cramping during periods. I noticed no negative side effects for years. I got off birth control when my husband and I were trying to conceive. Now that my daughter is born, and i'm back on the pill, I've noticed some negative side effects: vomiting the first 2 days I start taking my pill, and severe wild mood swings. My doctor has switched me to Nuvaring, and we'll see if this works better for me post-baby.  
Birth Control	Katie, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/13/2010 12:00:23 AM	I have been on Ortho-Cyclen for about 2.5 years now. I switched for a few months to Seasonale because the option of only 4 periods a year appealed to me. I wish I never switched. Ortho-Cyclen is a GREAT BCP to be on. I never had ANY problems, and plan on switching back in a few weeks.
Other	Myszka, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	1/6/2010 5:57:14 AM	I have not started this pill yet, just had it perscribed and am a little hesitant. I've been on BC for 15 years, the last 10 Lo-Ogesterol but in the past year have been experiancing severe PMS. I opted for this one becauseI'm 33 and I'm thinking that it's time to increase my estrogen level. Does anyone experiance moodiness to the point of severe depression and aggression. Any feed back is appreciated. I'm thinking of trying soy milk first and vitamins but I'm up in the air. I also smoke and am trying to quite by blood is usually very thin but I'm afraid of the clotting factor that some people are mentioning. Thanks for feedback. Will be checking in if I decide to go for it. I do highly recommend Lo-Ogesterol. Up until now I've been great with it. Oh the darn aging!!!
Birth Control	Dawn H., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	11/5/2009 11:22:39 AM	I was on Ortho Cyclen for 17 years, and was very satisfied.  I never became pregnant, and I liked the regularity of my cycle.  My skin improved and it was easy to use.  HOWEVER, now that I am in my mid 30's, a serious health condition appeared.  I have developed over 10 blood clots in my abdominal region which was almost fatal.  I spent time in the hospital, and am now on blood thinners for the next 6 months.  Please take the blood clot warning seriously!!!  I can never take a hormone again for the rest of my life.  Blood tests proved that the clots were not hereditary or genetic, but simply a side effect of the birth control.  During my annual exams, I always asked if I should stop and was encouraged to stay on the pill.  I wish I would have stopped much sooner, and avoided this potentially life threatening condition.  Since this happened to me, many women have told me about clots in their legs and lungs as a result of being on the pill.  I just want the public to be aware of the risk.  I have no complaint against Ortho-Cyclen, this is simply my experience.  Thank you.
Acne	Veronica, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	10/30/2009 10:41:05 AM	I began taking Cyclen in July 2009. I have acne - not mild not severe. I took this pill to kill 2 birds with 1 stone. - PREGNANCY: It worked to prevent pregnancy.  -ACNE: my acne worstened. I stayed on it for 3 months thinking that it would eventually get better. But no luck. I'm off of it and i am currently trying tri-cyclen lo.- SIDE EFFECTS: close to the end of the 1st month going into the 2nd month of using this I couldnt stand up in one spot for too long, i was starting to get headaches more frequently, and i was tired quite often. I became very depressed, I was very dramatic- crying all the time for no reason. My sex drive wasnt gone, but it did slightly decrease.CONCLUSION: My friend is using this BC and it works great for her, her boobs got bigger her skin is great. On the other hand this pill was a nightmare! I did a detox right after to cleanse my body of it. Everybody is different what works for one individual may not work for another. And what stinks about BC is that you wont actually know until you try it and see how your body reacts! Good luck!

Birth Control	something_new, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	1	2		25-34	10/13/2009 12:15:16 AM	I'm trying not to get pregnant for a very long time. I've just started the pill &amp; sleep has been an issue so far.I can almost go a whole day without sleep. My biggest complaint is the severe mood swings that I've been experiencing. One minute I'm on cloud nine the next I can't stand the sight of anyone. In one day I can go through a series of moods,...irritated, loving, happy, sad, lonely &amp; extremely mad. I'm hoping this is a side affect that will end shortly.

I was on lo-ovral before and am going to be switching back! don't take this!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	10/5/2009 4:37:01 PM	Works great I used to have the worse cramps and bleeding and the pain was so bad I couldn't even go to school sometimes. Since been on this pill no cramps at all sometimes just a little discomfort like 5 minutes before it comes so now its very pradictable same time same day every month...And I never take it at the exact time everyday just sometime at night. And Very effective contraceptive. only real side effects I would say sometimes cramping in my legs but not as bad as the back and abdomen pains before using!
Birth Control	Twig51, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	9/21/2009 1:16:09 PM	I was switched to Ortho-Cyclen when I began spotting on my old pill. I've been on it for about 2 months now and wouldn't recommend it, but every person reacts differently. I had numerous side effects: Acne worsened, increased insomnia, increased headaches, nausea, vaginal dryness and therefore painful intercourse, long period (lasted 9 days instead of the 7 you would think from the &quot;off&quot; week) and loss of mental clarity. This is the first non-low dose BC pill I've taken. I'm not sure if it was just too much for me or if the drug itself just was not a good fit for me. The generic Sprintec is nicely priced, though, compared to Loestrin 24, which I used to take and has no generics yet. I'm hoping to switch back to my old pill - loved it! 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Rubywrist, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	8/19/2009 7:20:28 PM	I have been using Ortho-Cyclen for almost 10 years now. I initially started taking it because my periods would come very irregularly, and I had pretty bad cramping. Once on this pill, my periods have become very regular and I rarely get cramps. Having to take it at the same time every day can be a pain, but I picked a time when I knew I would be up, and set a daily reminder on my cell phone. In general, I'm very happy with this pill!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	3	4	Female	19-24	8/5/2009 12:36:11 AM	This is the first time for me on birth control. I've only been on this pill for a little over a month and so far have had No serious side effects. The only side effect has been that at the beginning of the first and now the second pack, I've felt my breasts a little swollen. And I think they're slightly bigger... but thats fine with me :) I guess side effects will vary from person to person.

Birth Control	sickofbeingsick, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	7/9/2009 7:00:37 PM	I used Ortho Cyclen for a little over a month and never recevied a period. Although I had cramps and the normal feeling of having a period. Around week 5 I started havine severe nausea everyday and always felt sick. Would not recommend.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	6/18/2009 9:25:13 PM	I have had my period for 2 weeks, and it will not go away.  I take my medicine at the same time everyday.  I have also had weight gain, acne, and my mood has been a little unstable (crying, sadness, anxiousness).
Birth Control	Housewife01, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	6/6/2009 3:33:54 AM	I have had hormonal issues since I was 13 and my ob/gyn has changed my pills quite a few times already due to them not being a high enough dosage. I have only been taking Ortho-cyclen for about a month or so. I have noticed that my migraines have worsened a bit, I have experienced horrible cramping all month long even when not on my period, I have gained a few pounds or at least I feel really bloated,I have noticed a significant increase in vaginal fluids, increased breast sensitivity (which I enjoy most of the time and my husband does as well ;) ), swelling in my breasts (which once again my husband does not mind ;) )but the most annoying side effect of all is the fact that I start to bleed heavily while having sex with my husband. We have began using lubricant to ease the friction and ease the bleeding, but it doesn't always work. I am planning on sticking it out for another month or so and seeing if things improve, since I know if I go to my ob/gyn she will tell me the same thing.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	5/31/2009 2:09:58 AM	I recently switched off of this birth control because I was getting my period twice a month for 6 straight months. I've always had very regular periods, so this was pretty unusual for me. I've recently started taking a new birth control and my period is back to normal
Birth Control	blue*eyes, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	5/18/2009 7:27:59 PM	This is a good birth control option. No bad side effects for me. It has also cleared my skin up and caused my periods to be much less painful. I just wish you didn't have to take it at the same time every day.

And my doctor's told me this was caused by this birth control pill. Please don't use it.

Birth Control	DearPrudence, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	4/20/2009 1:00:16 AM	Absolutely no side effects (besides the perks of lighter periods and clearer skin).I switched to this pill after a couple of years on the birth control patch and I'm really glad I did.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	3/2/2009 4:03:30 AM	I have been taking Ortho-Cyclen for 2 1/2 years after switching off of Yasmine (which I hated) Its been a very effective pill, but this month I started spotting and it seems that it happens sometimes after taking this pill for a few years. 
Acne	hadtoquit, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	2/5/2009 7:03:52 PM	To tell the truth this has been hell on me. I can't stop vomiting, I have constant headaches and depression. I can't eat (and keep it down), I can't sleep, my heart won't stop racing. Frankly for me this has been pure evil in pill form. I'm glad to see this isn't true for some people, but almost every other site I have been to there are tons of women who are reporting the same symptoms. I would suggest having a long talk with your doctor if they prescribed it to you and I am reviewing this to warn others to be careful about this stuff.
Acne	beautifuldisaster, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	2/2/2009 11:33:17 AM	I am generally happy with this BCP. I started taking this when I was 16 to help with my acne, and although it has helped, I still have to be religious with my skin care routine. I have noticed that over the years I have started to get migranes the first day of my period. I have not experienced any weight gain on this pill. I have started spotting mid month for a few days in about the past 6 months or so, some months are worse than others. I did get EXTREMELY moody when i first started it, and I am still pretty bitchy before my period. I had zero cramps when I started this pill, but have since started getting mild to moderate cramps every month. I would definitely recommend this pill, although I am starting to question it's ability to be a long term pill choice.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	19-24	11/13/2008 6:52:41 PM	i get sick every morning just as i did when i was pregnant 3 years ago.  it started about 4 weeks after i started taking the pill and  that was 6 weeks after i had my son.  at first i was freaking out and thought i was already pregnant again but thats not it i have puked every morning for the past 2 and a half years so its pretty obvious im not pregant i just want to know what i do to not get sick like that every morning 
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	10/19/2008 3:22:12 PM	I took this to have fewer and less painful cramps, I've been taking it for almost a year now and whenever I have my period I still have to take my 3 advil, 3 times a day, the week before, during, and after my period. I've also gained a lot of weight and have an extremely difficult time losing it when it was something I didn't even have to think about when I wasn't on it. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	6/10/2008 5:46:46 AM	YIKES!!! Severe, I mean SEVERE emotional problems after 3 months of use. Cycle became longer and heavier and &quot;clottier&quot; [disgusting] each time as well. Atleast I did not end up with any unwanted zygotes!!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/28/2008 1:12:19 PM	This is a great form of birth control to use. I haven't relly experienced any side effects, and any I have weren't bad and never lasted long. My periods are also very light, short and involve less severe cramping. I love it. :-)
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/3/2008 4:20:03 PM	Great birth control pill to take. Slight side effects only lasted a few days. I totally recommend this.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/31/2007 11:52:16 PM	I have been taking this medication for about six months now and have really liked it.  The side effects are minimal, just some light spotting in the first few months, and headaches every once in awhile.  It has reduced my period from 5 days to 3 days, and it has also cleared up my acne.
