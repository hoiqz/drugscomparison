I used it as directed only to find out that i was allergic to it. It covered my face and neck with a rash and it was very itchy. Am seeking a different form of acne treatment.

My face swelled, my skin turned rough and scaly-like some sort of reptile! I was completely disfigured for 5-7 days and was forced to miss work for a week. Use with extreme caution!!

Now,  at 30, my dermatologist still combined it with other products to treat my acne and rosacea and after 5 months of treatment, I still feel like it worsens my symptoms.

Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	19-24	9/13/2010 9:14:55 PM	i started using benzoyl peroxide gel 10% about a week and 1/2 ago after talking to my dr. about my acne. i was using it 1-2 times a day as directed for the first few days but notice dryness and flaking on my face, i stopped using it for a couple days and then tried again. this time i experienced a burning sensation right after application, i rinsed my face with cold water, and the burning sensation quickly went away.

I only dabbed it on when I have acne, not on a daily basis. It helps clear up the acne faster. However, it dried up my skin tremendously. I rarely put on makeup, don't use toner or cleanser so it wasn't because of cosmetic overuse. It was the BP that left my face so dry that it turned red and very scaly. The areas where I used to apply BP now kook red like I have a mild burn and there's scaly, peeling skin on my face. I apply lotion and Vaseline but to no avail.My face seems too dry to be absorbed so a layer of lotion just sat there, dried on my face. I rarely use makeup but with my face as hideous like that, I tried to cover it up. Still, because it's so scaly and dry, no matter what type of foundation I use, it shows the scaly, peeling skin.BP cleared my acne but it ruined my skin. That was definitely not worth it.
Acne	donniestyme, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	6/26/2010 7:55:25 PM	I used 10% Benzoyl Peroxide on a problem area on my shoulder where a recurring boil kept appearing. after 1 week the boil was gone and has not returned since. I did have very mild reaction to B.P. (dryness) but results far outweigh the side effect.

Acne	sad customer, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	2/17/2010 2:21:01 AM	I used 5% benzoyl peroxide from the pharmacy in combination with clydamicin gel, as recommended by my doctor and after 4-5 weeks my skin glowed, I looked younger and very fresh and had no pimples whatsoever, it was amazing! It is the product with best results I have ever seen. However, after 3 months of using it with no change in regiment, and for no apparent reason, I got very bad rash. To ease the itch, I used a store brand Cortisone, which helped, and discontinued use of the acne treatment for 1 week. The first time I used it again the rash returned. I really hate to stop using this since it worked so wonderfully, but I guess I have no choice..

After using this product for a week,and even after 2 days I saw instant results. i woke up one morning to overly dry red blotchy itchy burning skin. I basically look like I got a severe wind burn around my mouth. As a result I've stopped using the product (for now) until my skin heals.

Because this dangerous anti-acne drug is not approved by the FDA I wonder how many other drugs are on the market without approval
Acne	5mnumh, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/25/2009 4:18:27 PM	I have used many many different acne medications, and this one is the BEST by far.  I use 10% B/Peroxide, twice; every night and morning before applying makeup!  It's the best thing.  I am very prone to acne and i have been using this for 2-3 years with the best results. This particular one is purchased over the counter at any Kaiser pharmacy counters. Other BP do not compare to this! Must use this regular for best results, and must clean face properly first of course for the medication to work! 
Acne	strwbry3 , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	2/2/2009 12:26:46 PM	I have an area on my face that is extremely prone to break outs. I will get up to five or six large zits at one time in this one area. Someone recommended I use something with 10%BP in it so I got Clearasil Ultra rapid action treatment cream. First I rubbed it into my skin on the infected area, then I dabbed it on the area (w/out rubbing in) and let it dry. I slept with it on and woke up in the morning with an irritated, red, itchy, very swollen face. I have to say though, the pimples in that area are basically entirely gone besides a few light marks and my skin feels really smooth. I think BP works very well on acne, however I think I used it incorrectly (and used WAY to much). I'd like to try to use again in a month or so and just use a very small amount on an affected area and see how I react. I'm hoping this reaction was due to misuse and that BP is not something I'm allergic to as I cannot believe how much clearer this area of my skin is and would love to continue use if possible! The only advice I'd give is to take your time with this product and test it out first to see how your skin reacts. Don't go overboard on your first application!! BP seems to be much stronger than I thought! 
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/10/2009 11:16:32 PM	i started using this stuff once a day at first to let my skin get used to it then bumped it up to twice a day. it cleared up my acne better and faster than ProActiv. my skin feels smoother and i have a significant reduction in bumps and redness. this happened after the first few days. great acne med.
Acne	sadler, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	12/29/2008 8:11:18 PM	I used the Mary Kay Acne Cream which is basically BP.  2 days later I broke out in a rach all over my face with little bumps and blisters. I never thought I had sensitive skin, but apparently I am allergic to this medication. Be careful using BP. You may experience redness, swelling, puffiness, and rash. I'm experiencing all the above unfortunately.
Acne	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	11/13/2008 11:13:46 PM	Used for acne and developed red hives on face after using it.  I lasted about a day, but very, uncomortable.  Did NOT work for me.
Acne	13-18 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5		13-18	7/2/2008 7:43:20 PM	Worry not, most people are not allergic to bp. If you use too much, your skin will be VERY VERY dry and uber sensitive, so start out with 2.5%. be careful though, bp bleaches clothes and sheets! After a few weeks, your skin will clear-guaranteed. My skin is about 90% clear and getting better everyday :)
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	25-34	3/12/2008 2:50:38 PM	if you use the cream on your face Don't expose your face to the sun for more than 1 - 2 hrs unless you are wearing sunblock.or your face will hurt and feel like burning, nothing can stop the feeling until you go under a shadow for about 30min or just stay inside the whole day.
Acne	 Female 	1	5	1	Female		10/16/2007 8:33:34 PM	Be VERY careful using this product!  I have fair, combination skin and devloped a painful rash when I used Banzoyl peroxide on my acne.
