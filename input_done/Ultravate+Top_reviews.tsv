I have just been told that the Brand Name Ultravate has been taken off the market.  Can you tell me if this is true.  I am sorry if this does not match the picture, which I haven't seen.

Other	quilter, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	55-64	2/19/2010 3:28:00 PM	I used this ointment for over 7 years in the treatment of severe pustular psoriasis on my feet.  I was not very impressed with its efficacy.  Applying it twice a day &amp; wearing socks year-round was not pleasant for a woman in the professional field, but I was told that it was the best option for my condition.  The condition never cleared up &amp; worsened each time that I missed an application.  I now have a new MD recommending other options- Vectical, Clobex and laser-light therapy.  It's too soon to know if these are working yet, but I have high hopes.

With Ultravate,  Within 2 days the painful itching was gone and within a week, the skin looked and felt perfectly normal. I am following a schedule, reducing the application (titrating) over the course of 3 weeks...similar to oral steroids such as Prednisone.  No side effects.
