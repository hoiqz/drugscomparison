Overweight	Ari, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/13/2012 2:14:09 AM	The only problem was finding someone in MS to prescribe it. I had to take it only twice a day because I only get hungry in the afternoon and right before bed.This is great with exercise and diet !!! This is not a magic drg and I could see its potential fro abuse. I give it a thumbs up !

I have found it to have less side-effects than Ritalin, and a mellower attention-span aid than Dexedrine was. I am giving it a couple of months before deciding which regimen to follow, but so far so good!

Too bad the side effects are absolutely, terrifyingly horrible.  It's converted by the liver into amphetamine &amp; methamphetamine, that's right METHAMPHETAMINE!  This is a mo@#$#@#$ nightmare.  Thanks Didrex, I'm sure there's a special place in hell for you.
