Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Type Dementia	65-74 Female  (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	9/2/2012 12:05:01 PM	My husband has dementia caused by radiation on a non-malignant brain tumor. He should never have had the radiation, but when something is an emergency, we do what the doctor says. He's been on Namenda for quite a while and sleeps most of the time. also, I have no clue if this is a side effect, but he makes noises all the time and it drives me nuts. Once in a while he's quiet and it's a blessing. I'm going to take him off the meds for a while and see if it makes a difference. He's easy to get along with and not agressive, he's not incontinent, he eats well also. If anyone has a problem with constant noises, let me know.

I have had many tests and found no problems, and we believe these are migraines.  I took the starter dose through week three and was about to enter wk 4 when I finally realized my EXTREME INCREASE in symptoms (without the migraine) MUST SURELY be due to these pills.  I am going off them until I can reach the doctor for advice.  I was unable to speak understandably several times today, as if I was trying to hide being drunk.

He has been off 4 days now, and I am waiting and hoping for the best.

So her doctor put her on Namenda and after 2 months she had 2 very vidid Hallucinations.  She can recall these better then her everyday events.  So I called her doctors office after reading some of these reviews about the drug and told them about how my mother was having Hallucinations.  The nurse wanted me to keep her on the drug, and bring her in to test for a bladder infection.  Even though my mother was not having any symptoms of a bladder infection.  I told them I thought it was the drug, and I was taking her off.  I really just wanted to know if she needed to taper off.  I was told that she could just stop taking them, and the doctor would call me when she got back in 3 weeks!What is wrong with our medical profession?   Lets just ignore the elephant in the room!  When Hallucinations is one of the more commen side affects!.  Maybe I could see the nurses point of view if my mom was having fever and signs of a bladder infection, but none of that was true.Like some of these reviews I just thought it was her dementia getting worse.  But it has only been 3 days, and I can tell the difference already  She is thinking clearer and is not fixsated on the Hallucinations (that she insist were real events).It is important to remember, even if side affects dont show up right away it is most likely the drugs we are taking, that would seem to make the most sence....but what do I knw???  .

Then moved to 10 mg.twice a day. He was remembering so much from the past that it seemed like a his memory was so clear! Then in his fourth week the Doctor add another drug to go with Namenda....? Aricept ? That is  when his world turned inside out! He became ZOMBIE like, the hospital couldn't find that he had a stroke or any other problems. So the final bill with the diagnosis was that he was over medicated . This last week they (Doctors) came to the conclusion that the other medications may be the cause!

She was already on Aricept for minor dementia. My Sister visited her this weekend and was horrified that she was in a zombie like state, could not complete a sentence, was sleeping most of the time and couldn't finish dinner without falling asleep. She even looked different. My Dad, who is 87 said this started after one week. The doctor had not told him of negative side effects to look out for. He just thought her condition was deteriorating and did not make the association. We are taking her off this drug. She had minor dementia before this, but with this drug, she can't even communicate. I don't think she should have ever  been prescribed this drug since her dementia is not major. I shudder to think of the consequences if she was to stay on this drug much longer. It was very helpful to see all the reviews of this drug and to learn that MANY others had the same horrible side effects. I appreciate those who shared the experiences of their loved ones. We were just shocked that her condition had drastically deteriorated since we had seen her at the beginning of the month....BEFORE she started taking Namenda.

He has been on it for 2-3 yrs with increasing doses - He has been taken up to 20 mg a/m and p/m - 40 mg a day.  He has declined severely over the last 2-3 yrs with constant complaints of headache (other than a migrane),nausea, stomach pains and severe trouble sleeping.  I am an RN - and I feel that I have been robbed of my husband - he has become a shell of himself with no enjoyment of life - it would seem - while I cannot prove it, this downward slide started with the beginning of the drug and has worsened since the dosage has been increased. He was admitted last Tues nite to ER with a hi fever - 103 and above mentioned symptoms.  After MANY cat scans of various organs and multiple lab tests - nothing shows.  It seems to me that he is toxic.  Could it be Namenda?  Seems to me as a nurse that there is a strong pointing to that fact.

She decides not to take this med. about a week ago due to  the side effects such as not sleeping. dizziness, blood pressure droping, and not having an apetite. She is also on aricept 10mg which is not giving her any problem.  I pray to God that her mind state won't go back to how it was before Namenda.

She feels so itchy, she scratches till she bleeds. She doesn't want to eat, and is always very tired. This all escalated within the last few days. I thought her dementia was bad before, but this is much worse! No more Namenda for her. I'm hoping she will soon be back to where she was.

She has never done a crazy thing in her life. Last week she rolled off the edge of the high bluff we live on by a lake, fell 90 feet, and is miraculously unharmed. This was not a slip and fall, she did it intentionally. She went slowly off Namenda, said she felt fine and &quot;things that bothered me before don't bother me now.&quot;

These meds were NOT worth the agony he went through at the end of the month with the falling, aggressive behavior, zombie-like states, hot sweats, slurred speech, etc. The worst part is the doctor never figured out that his behavior was partly due to taking Namenda! We took him off Namenda and ever since I feel like I have my dad back with us. One of the best days of my life was the day we took him off this horribel drug. I wish he had never taken Namenda.

He tried Aricept and went into rages and off of that.  In Dec, he was started on Namenda 5mg.  After 2 wks his blood pressure was a little high but ok.  Just after the New Year, he started 10mg.  He had taken only 2 pills, one one night and then the next night.  He had pains in his chest and erractic high blood pressure when I rushed him to the ER.  After an afternoon on monitors and blood work, they admitted him and he had more testing overnight and the next morning. The only cause they could come up with was the Namenda.  It had made his pancratic enzyms too high and also caused his BP to fluctuate from 169/92 down to 108/67.  After extensive testing, they sent him home and he has been off any of the ALZ meds for 4 weeks now.  I don't know what is left for him to take.  But his short-term memory is getting worse, yet he can remember so much from even 40 yrs ago. I am overwhelmed.

He's only been on it for a couple months now, and the difference is remarkable.  He's perked up, is interested in life again, and makes sense in a conversation.  He still has trouble finding words, but his over-all demeanor has improved 100%.  It's disturbing though to read reviews of how the effectiveness only lasts a year or so - such a shame.  It's like the &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; story we all read in high school.  My dad was so intelligent back in the day.  I sure hope they can come up with something that will last longer!

Then he was put on namenda. he bacame very lethargic to the point of sleeping all the time, no interest in anything and no improvement in his mental status. I told his doctor and i stopped the drug due to the lethargy. he became more alert within a week. Now he is in a nursing hime and he was put on namenda again. I have noticed a decline again in hjis ability to function. Today on visiting him he was so drowsy and speech was slurred. I called his doctor, who in turn called the nurses for a report. Of course, they said he was just fine. he is so medicated, he will not be able to give them any trouble!! I AM GOING TO TRY TO GET HIM OFF THIS DRUG. I know my dad and I am a retired nurse also.He was better off the drug and just because he is in a nursing home does not mean they can medicate him into submission so they do not have to &quot;put up with him&quot;. God help me to push this through and get him off it. Oh, he could not even remember his own 3 childrns names now, just since on this medicine. I hate it and I advise family members to check for any medication changes if they notice a change in their loved ones health/mental status for the worse, or better.

My memory is more impaired because of the chemical imbalance in my brain following my injury.  I was given a prognosis of being a life long vegetable after my accident it was one of the most severe closed brain injuries a person could have.  My brain got bounced from side to side in my skull and I am just greatfull it didn't fall out.  After being on a barage of psychotropic medications,  My doctor has found a combination that is working well for me.  My memory is not 100% but improved so that life is worth the living!  My drug cocktail is namenda 10mg am pm  /  Geodon 40mg  Am Pm  /  and  5mg zyprexa oral tab at bedtime.  This is a great reduction for me and is working very well even though I did not like the journey to find the combination.  Life is not a bed of roses by any means but is manageable unlike before.  It has been nine years since my closed brain injury &amp; I have discovered the recovery process is ongoing with improvents and drawbacks second by second.  I don't &quot;survive&quot; any longer but &quot;THRIVE&quot;.  I don't know if people can even fathom how blessed they are to be given the opportunity to &quot;live&quot;.

Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Type Dementia	WishingICouldHelpMore, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	4	3	Male		8/19/2010 7:46:37 PM	My dad, 81 and diagnosed with moderate Alzheimer's, was prescribed Namenda in June 2010. He had been depressed for several years and wasn't the most physically fit person--Type 2 Diabetes, Gout, Heart disease, high blood pressure and cholesterol, all being controlled by prescribed medication.  As he took the starter-month pack of Namenda, I noticed heightened aggitation and frustration.  However, as he's now leveled off to 10MG in morning and 10 MG at night, I feel his demeanor has softened.  He will occasionally smile or laugh, occasionally participate in conversation but often still has that &quot;vacant look&quot; on his face, which he also had before beginning Namenda.  As for memory, I do not believe he has gotten worse, but don't know if Namenda has been responsible for this or not.  I am often amazed when he can come up with the name of a former student he had 40 years ago, but struggles to find the correct word for lawn sprinkler (&quot;water thing&quot;).  There have been no negative side effects for my dad with taking Namenda.  To everyone out there, from those directly experiencing Alz. to those who are caregivers, have faith, stay positive and believe that one day a cure will be found.  Good luck to everyone!

When she reached the point of 20mg a day she become very aggressive by stealing steak knives and carving up furniture and walls with no memory of ever doing so. She also became very restless and we began to fear that she might hurt herself or others. Upon talking with her MD we thought it best to stop giving her the medication and within 36 hours of stopping the meds she became managebale again. If this is what the FDA IS APPROVING then we are all in serious trouble.

After talking to her doctor and asking if she should be taken off this medicine, she was taken off of it. it was too late.   after not eating for 5 days, in spite of my complaints, my mom had a heart attack, and eventually died. I feel sure that too much meds are given to these helpless victims.....even some of the aides agreed with me.  too bad they weren't more observant.

He's been as close to normal as he could be since then. Now he has started slipping back into the confusion that engulfed him before being on Namenda. I've heard it only works for about 6 months... does anyone know if this is true? It's been so wonderful but now he's back to screaming and being in terror again. I loved what the medication did for him!!! But it needs to last longer.

After a dose I get sleepy &amp; nap for about an hour, but feel lethargic for total 4 hours; then I perk up till next dose. We think I am just getting acclimated to it because my rage, confusion, frustration is all gone. Memory seems to be worse, as well as cognitive skills. Hoping if I stick with this, as well as Exelon added later, this might level out.

My mother she was put on this medication with no exam and no follow up. My mother lives alone and has never been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

Alzheimer's medication is not recommended for a normal mind, I'm still having side effects a year later after stopping the medication.

His is the slow-progression type (thank goodness)and he's been on Aricept for the past four years. 18 months ago, his DR put him on the combination of Aricept and Namenda and it works great for him. He's had no side effects, but he's also in excellent health. His only problem is speech asphasia associated with the dementia/Alzheimer's. Perhaps the combo of Aricept &amp; Namenda really works.

After being prescribed the usual medications (Ritalin, Methylin, Concerta) and getting very little results my Doctor suggested I try Namenda, he explained that it was used to treat Alzheimer's but as nothing else was working he thought it would be worth a try. I took Namenda for 6 months and have never experienced such clarity, I was able to focus at work and complete everyday household chores that had become overwhelming to me, the results were amazing. Unfortunately this Doctor went in to private practice and his replacement refused to give me a medication that was not approved for the treatment of ADD and have returned to what I call &quot;The Medication Roller Coaster&quot;. 
Other	 Female  (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		3/17/2010 11:05:24 PM	Mother has been taking Aricept for about 2 years. When Namenda was added last fall she became much more anxious, had outbursts of anger &amp; swearing - very atypical of her usual behavior and very hard to deal with, like a tantrum. Also tremors became worse. She stopped taking Namenda after 2 weeks, before reaching the full dosage. It has been about 3 months since she stopped taking Namenda and the negative effects seem to have gradually disappeared.

For the last 9 months she's been pitching tantrums that remind you of a 3 year old but go on for days.  She was very anxious, mean, nasty.  The first week of Namenda she slept lots - that's leveled out and now she has a grin on her face all day long and is sweet.  Yes, she is still confused, can't recall words - the disease is still there - but she's not wearing my dad, my brother and I out.  She's pleasant.  All that we can ask really.

Namenda has been the latest in line of treatments that have made the patient far worse. At least Aricept and the Exelon patch were free samples, though. I've come to be extremely skeptical of these medicines, having dealt with the extremely stressful effects of the patient becoming worse after ingesting them. So I took the patient off immediately.

She is barely audible, and very confused. It is breaking my heart, that I gave her this medicine, when she had a better quality of life previous. I have taken her off the meds. which is now at 2 days and have been filming her, to see if there will be improvement. She had a hospital visit two weeks ago, I notified the hospital that I was not satisfied and wanted the Namenda and Exelon Patch discontinue. They continue these meds as if this experiment is going to continue. Not with my mother, it will not.

He was prescribed this medication and took it for 4 days. Within the first few days we observed severe behavior change, i.e. his mental condition was extremely worsened and he was very belligerant, uncooperative, combatant. He also seemed to stay awake all night and slept all day. He was displaying tremors and refusing to eat and take his medication. After speaking with his doctor regarding these changes, he was immediately taken off of this medicine. We have noticed a positive change in his behavior since only being off of this medication one day. I would definately NOT reccommend this medication to ANYONE! After seeing many more negative reviews about this medication, my opinion is that it should be tested further before being put on the market to be so widely prescribed.

It was like the drug &quot;rocketed&quot; her from moderate to severe Alzheimers in seven days. Tremors, constant sleeping, severely deminished mental capacity, aggitated, has not eaten at all whereas she normally is a &quot;chow hound&quot;. Reminds me of how doctors prescribe anti-depressants for whatever ails you regardless of how many suicides and murders result from it. LAZY DOCTORS-CROOKED DRUG COMPANIES.
Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Type Dementia	Nurses Experience with Namenda, 45-54 Female  (Caregiver) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	8/19/2009 10:51:12 AM	As a Hospice nurse, I have dealt with dozens of people, whom, over the years have taken this drug. For some it seems to work, in the middle stages, at least. In the end stages of Dementia/Alzheimers, no drug will do anything to control the symptoms of decline when the patient is unable to take the drug, for whatever reason.  My point therefore is, that this is an expensive drug with LOT's of side effects that may be avoided by the use of another, less expensive medication. My thoughts go out to those of you who are checking this medication out  because a loved one has just been prescribed it. Read everything, don't write it off too soon. Ask the MD for samples, they generally have some. Arm yourself with all the information and give it a try. Nothing works in the end but it may help in the meantime.

Her reaction included reverting to speaking in her native tongue - Norwegian; refusing to leave the dining room and actually becoming disruptive when asked to do so; extreme weakness in her legs and overall increasd confusion.

Her memory and overall health worsened. The doctor increased her dose and everything went to pieces (bad). In desperation my sister called the doctor and in short told them &quot;forget this&quot;. It told several weeks, but my mother finally started to return to &quot;her old ways&quot;. This disease (AD) is heartbreaking. We as the children (50+) of these aging parents want to try anything and are easily suckered into believing something &quot;new&quot; may work/help. There is NO cure. Everybody seems to change with this disease differently. Watch the medications carefully, good luck.

Since these weren't side effects listed for this drug &amp; it was Christmas day so her doctor's office was closed we didn't realize what was causing this change in her.  The next day when there was no improvement in the way she was acting I contacted her doctor who had us immediately quit giving her this medication.  Within 4 days she was back to the way she was before we started her on these pills.

Namenda in conjunction with Arecept has significantly improved my mental function.  Cognitive skills tests were much better.  I do notice a decrease in mental function when I am at the end of the dose, or very tired.  However, I am still very satisfied.  Before Namenda, I had difficulty functioning at all.  I hope it continues to work.  I have been on it for 4 months.

It affects her behavior and anxiety so significantly that we can tell within an hour if she has missed a dose.  No, it does not improve memory function or fully bring back the mother we knew, but she is more accepting and MUCH less stressed when she is taking it.  REcently some ill-advised &quot;professionals&quot; took her off of these drugs for 4 days...she had to be placed on continuous hospice because her anxiety was affecting her heart function.  Within 45 minutes of returning the meds to her, she was fully participating in her group home activities and feeding herself.  Her attending nurse was amazed!  We weren't.

My mother has moderate AD and we have seen an improvement in her accepting changes however we have not regained any memory function.  She does seem more content and happier, so that is worth it for now.  Time will tell if it slows the progress of the AD.  It was progressing quite quickly up to now.

Four days following the stroke my mother disappeared and an evil twin appeared.  Instant and full-on vascular dementia.  I heard about this drug for treatment of Alzheimer's and talked to her doctor about it.  He said it was exclusively an Alzheimer's drug and had not been tested for vascular dementia.  He agreed to a trial since there were no side effects.  Three weeks later my mother literally woke up and was my mother.  It was like somebody came in and screwed in her light bulb.  This drug gave my mother back her LIFE.  I have recommended it to others and they have had similar results.  An elderly friend of mine had some memory problems and started taking this and no longer has that problem.I would SWEAR by this drug.  I got my mother back!!!  Her doctor is amazed!
