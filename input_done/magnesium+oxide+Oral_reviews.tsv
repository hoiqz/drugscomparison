Other	obbie20, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	45-54	9/26/2012 5:27:24 AM	I have had heart palpertations for years I was taking inderal but it lowered my Bp so I tried prescription mag 400mg twice a day. I started feeling short of breath, weak, my legs became shaky if standing for more then ten minutes and all I wanted to do was sleep. I was so tired. I stopped taking it and it all went away. Even though the heart doc and pharm told me these are not side affects. Theses side affects are not on web md but on cvs website and many others. Cvs is where I got the prescription.  Has anyone had this happen to them

But don't take this drug without getting your magnesium levels checked.. It's a simple blood test....

And as a bonus it has helped my indigestion/gerd! I have so much energy now,I feel like a new person!

Other	peter, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	19-24	6/15/2011 4:40:23 AM	I started taking this for TMJD and bruxism (teeth grinding). It did work surprisingly and my symptoms got a LOT better (after years of grinding and pain - I wear a biting guard at night which doesn't stop the bruxism unfortunately). I'm not in chronic pain anymore.I take magnesium oxide which is supposed to be poorly absorped: That is why I took around 1.75g yesterday. I had magnesium poisoning and was about to call the ambulance. It was over after appr. 3 hours. I had muscle weakness and was in a state of panic (I had the urge to hurt myself, but I could suppress it). So PLEASE be careful - you should not exceed 1000mg in my opinion. Mg Oxide isn't necessarily badly absorped as you can see. I am young and healthy, no kidney problems.One common side effect are loose bowel movements which I also experience. I will lower the dose now as I seem to absorp the product I bought quite well (too well lol).When you have problems with your jaw, neck and back, magnesium is worth a try. 
Other	rewind1955,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female		5/10/2011 10:03:20 PM	I began taking this over-the-counter supplement a year ago along with Calcium for Bone health.  My doctor did not suggest, but after much reading thought this drug would help prevent Bone problems later in life.  Well I began to suffer cramps, muscle and joint pain in ly legs especially in my knees.  I suffer these symptoms for a very long time, ask my Doctor could it be the Statins I was taking and stopped taking them, but leg pain continued.  Eventually I stopped all medicines and supplements one-by-one and come to find out the Magnesium Oxide with Chelated Zinc was the culprit.  So after a few weeks the pain in my legs began to ease, but not yet completely gone.  I do hope that I have not damaged the muscle or bone in my legs, and the pain vanishes soon.  It was a mistake to take this supplement with Calcium for Bone health, what a big mistake and disappointment.
Other	la, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	45-54	2/9/2011 10:38:04 AM	Frankly, I'm really not sure how I feel about magnesium yet. I will be talking to my doctor about it shortly. It didn't occur to me until today (after a few weeks of taking it) that the reason I feel like I'm going to pass out cold at work every day lately is the magnesium. I started taking the supplement on my own without the doctor telling me to do it. This was due to reading the symptoms of a low mag level and I had all of them. I am going to discontinue it until I can talk to my doctor because I can barely function.

It's not an instant cure for the migraines, but after taking this for 4-6 weeks my life was dramatically improved.  Between taking magnesium oxide and doing acupuncture I now only get 2-4 migraines a month when I was living with it daily before.  The only drawback was some diarrhea until my body adjusted.  I haven't been in the hospital emergency room since I started taking this and I feel like I can actually live my life now.  :-)
