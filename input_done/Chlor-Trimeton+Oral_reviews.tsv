Sinus Headache	Raerob, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	8/28/2012 3:56:12 PM	I have been using this product since the 70's went it was a prescription drug.  I had been troubled for years with sinus headaches that seemed to be triggered by overcast weather days with high barometric pressure.  If I took or take 4mg of Chlor-trimeton at the first sign of the headache it takes care of the problem and I do not experience the headache.  I have carried them in my handbag and luggage for years because a bad sinus headache can ruin a day or a trip and I don't want to do either.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	N B, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		6/12/2011 5:11:11 PM	I have very bad seasonal pollen allergies, as well as other inhalant allergies. Have taken Chlortrimeton for years and it works very well with no side effects.Only problem is that I can no longer find the 12 hour pill--and every 4 hours is a nuisance.( this is since the Merck takeover of Shering-Plough). Why did they stop the 12 hour ???? 
Sinus Headache	stuffyone, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	5/9/2011 8:38:24 AM	I found out that I'm allergic to the Chlorpheniramine in this medication. I started having petit mal seizures that stopped after this medicine was discontinued. 
Allergic Conjunctivitis	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	25-34	3/4/2011 8:56:32 AM	I have had chronic allergies my whole life and had about given up on trying to treat them with any OTC (or Rx) drugs.  A friend recommended Chlortrimeton (I got generic version) and it works wonders.  I don't get drowsy and my sneezing/sniffling clears up quickly.  The only downside is taking it every 4 hrs... but definitely worth it!!  Never take Benadryl again.. unless you're trying to go to sleep!
Allergic Conjunctivitis	suzieQ, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	2/4/2011 9:30:26 AM	I agree with Sue, the 12 mg dosage is much more effective than the 4 mg tablet.  I called the manufacturer and was told that the 12 mg should be available again early this spring.  Good Luck.
Sinus Headache	daydreambeliever, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/27/2011 1:29:26 PM	I take an antidepressant Paxil and I've had a reaction to many decongestants and other cold/allergy products containing Sudafed.  Chlor-Trimaton has greatly helped my allergy symptoms (mainly a bad sinus headache and a runny nose) without interacting with the Paxil!
Flu-Like Symptoms	cold sufferer, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/21/2011 12:43:19 PM	This is a miracle drug.  1 12-hour chlor-trimmeton and 2 ibuprofen have successfully discouraged colds and flus for me and everyone I've told about it.  I've tried everything for a cold--but this works.

Flu-Like Symptoms	25-34 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	1/26/2008 9:27:42 AM	I like to use this medicine when I have a combination of symptoms sure as a stuffed up head and/or runny nose. I usually only take it, though, when the symptoms are bad enough not to be treated with minder medicine. It is a more expensive over-the-counter drug and would recommend the 12-hour version. I have tried generic versions (not available in 12-hour) and they do not seem to work as well.
