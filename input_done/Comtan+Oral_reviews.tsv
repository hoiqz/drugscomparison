Parkinson's Disease	marigold, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	65-74	9/1/2012 8:25:35 PM	Started taking 200mg, 3x per day, with l-dopa.Worked very well to control tremor and improve general mood and co-ordination but then, after 3 months use, diarrhoea started and has continued for a month with no sign of abating. Can this be &quot;fixed&quot;?. I would like to continue with the Comtan BUT this intestinal side effect is a difficult one to live with!

Parkinson's Disease	Deborah's Dad, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Male		1/12/2010 9:07:17 PM	My 84 year-0ld dad skiped 2 doses of Comtan because of his doc was trying new meds on him... He suddenly became very rigid and immoblized, cnofused and extremely drowsy. Once he was put back on Comtan, his Parkinson and dimentia conditions were greatly improved. He went back to normal, and everything becomes clear to him again. Yes, he's still rigid and not very active, but compare to without Comtan, it is a day and night difference!
