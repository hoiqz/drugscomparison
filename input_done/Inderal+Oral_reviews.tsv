High Blood Pressure	tsalam, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	65-74	1/13/2012 3:21:13 AM	I was on Inderal-40 when necessary for anxiety, palpitation and ET and gave good results, recently i was diagnosed with pre-hypertension, and my doctor recommended to use Inderal-40 twice daily which did regulate my BP to 111/70, after using another medicine that dropped my BP too much too fast.Now after 3-weeks I decided to stop taking Inderal, as a loud hissing sound developed in my head;(medically Tinnitus)-that started even awakening me at night, very disturbing and worrying. My doctor had an accident recently, and will see her ina weeks time for guidance.

Migraine Prevention	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/17/2011 2:35:37 PM	I am a 59 yr old healthy female and my doc started me on this med about 3 months ago for migraines that were increasing in frequency to 2-3 times per week despite the use of the wonder drug Maxalt.  I have not had one headache since I started the drug.  My blood pressure and pulse seem to be unusually low such as 105/60 and 55-70.  No weight gain at all.  In fact because of the lack of migraines I have become more active and lost about 10 pounds.
Abnormal Heart Rhythm	pat, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	6/5/2011 5:42:26 PM	Hate taking drugs because of side effects. But when I was put on 20 mg. of Inderal twice a day to control my racing pulse during activity, I was pleased with the result. Bet yet, it controls my familiar essential  tremor reasonably well.

I have an adrinelin driven career (law enforcement) and thought I had to retire because I couldn't hold my weapon steady.  Inderal saved my career. I do experience a lot of fatique but hey I'm don't have the tremors.

My BP goes up and down with lifes stresses- it has NOT helped for that.I was taking 20mg ,once a day.When i saw it wasnt working for the BP control i weined myself off of it.My BP is the same now as with the med.My Dr. offered me Benicar-which literally made me pee on myself one day and did NOT work for the BP control either!It actually was higher.NOW im dealing with freaking Tinnitus-which came on about 2 months ago now-and im blaming the use of the BP meds.Do not get suckered into taking large doses of these kinds on Meds. Try natural diuretics and meditation.At least you wont end up with a World of new issues to deal with.

After seeing numerous specialist in the following years I was prescribed inderal (160 mg/daily) at the age of 27 to which I have tweaked down to 80 mg/daily.  The relieve was instantanious with outstanding results and after taking the drug for 31 years I still do not have any side effects. There are some unique situations where I am unable to complete some finite tasks or need assistance, however, few and far between.

It has definitely reduced my migraines. The side effects are manageable, compared to a migraine. No weight gain, but I continuely force myself to work out &amp; eat healthy. I do feel very lethargic daily and dizzy occasionaly, but compared to a migraine it's worth the trouble.

The medicine worked fine but I was taken off it because it was not &quot;cholestoral friendly&quot;. As I recall , it is a calcum blocker and keep's calsum from entering the musles thereby, lowering your blood pressure. I have been off the medicine for approx. 10 years. Since then-I have had calcum deposits removed from my testicals, my elbow. My doctor sent me for a (whatever they call it when they take pictures of your heart) because of a heart murmer (which I have always had). They found that I had calcum deposits in my heart !!!! I guess since the calcum could not enter my musles (It went elcewear  !!!!) Wish me luck !!!

It has helped tremendously! Although I function very well on this drug, I have had to slow down my workouts due to feeling out of breath very quickly. I have simply turned to Yoga and Pilates and slowly paced hikes, sometimes uphill. If you take this med, work with the dose to find the right one for you, work on gaining appetite control and DONT stop working out. If you decide to stop taking it, always talk to your Doc to prevent any ill effects. I'm very satisfied with this drug.

Before starting this med, I had horrible migraines 5-7 times a week.  I have 2 or 3 per year now.  There have been some negative side effects.  I suffer daily with insomnia and now take a prescription sleep med to sleep at night.  When I missed a dose, I had heart palpitations.  The nurse at my doctor's office said this is a normal reaction.

I am unsure if I need to try another beta blocker.

Migraine Prevention	Joe Y, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	65-74	7/3/2010 5:31:10 PM	I began taking Inderal LA 60mg about 5 years ago. During the first year I got 2 migraine headaches (I had averaged about 5 per month).  They increased the second year but not significantly.  I stopped taking Inderal in Oct 2008 because of being tired too often, difficulty sleeping,dizzyness while working out at the gym,cold feet and hands due to circulation problems with Inderal,difficulty swallowing,memory loss and who knows what else Inderal affects. I also felt as if my feet are shrinking because my shoes and sneaks seem like they are a size too small.  The headaches came back more frequently and other medicines were prescribed(anti-depressants, smaller but multiple doses of Inderal) but nothing worked.  I went back to the LA 60mg in Jan 2009 and the frequency of headaches was reduced significantly. Now I am again considering going off Inderal due to the side effects cited earlier. I have already started not taking my Inderal capsule on alternate days. I am sleeping like a baby at night and am no longer tired during the day. I have no heart problems so I suppose I could stop Inderal cold turkey but the warnings about doing so make me somewhat hesitant. My migraines did not start until I was in my 50's and I am currently 73.  Do they ever stop naturally without medication?There are so many triggers associated with migraines and any kind of headache that it becomes a frustrating experience trying to figure out what to avoid and in what amounts.  When all else fails and the headache arrives, thank God for whoever discovered ZOMIG.

It is doing no good whatsoever and I'm going to request to be taken off of it.  Has anyone else been prescribed this drug for this condition?  I can't figure out why I was taking it???

It has helped with that.  The first two years of use I had violent night terrors where I would screaming and hitting the wall, or my poor unsuspecting husband. I didn't realize it was the medication, but when my doctor finally found out he lowered my dose to 60 mg a day and the night terrors have stopped.  Thank goodness. My hands and feet are still cold all the time and I still have some racing of the heart, but not as wildly as before.
Migraine Prevention	Don J., 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	55-64	5/13/2010 10:41:50 AM	I was part of an initial testing of Inderal for the prevention of migraine headaches starting in about 1979.  I took several different dosages over the years as a test.  About ten 20 years ago I settled on one 160 mg LA capsule once per day.  My whole family has had Migraines all of our lives.  But I have not had an other than normal headache in over 12 years.  The Migraines are gone.  I think the only side effect I have is that I don't have much energy.  I prefer to sleep in the afternoon,or when ever I can. But that might be normal for a 65 years old slightly overweight man.  Once I get up and get moving, I seem to be able function just fine.  Sure beats the headaches!
Other	dda2305, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	5/2/2010 3:23:06 PM	I started taking Inderal 20 years ago after suffering a panic attack. I also had high blood pressure and had migraines for most of my life. My migraines changed after starting Inderal, there was no more pain but I still had auras but not as frequently.I quickly gained 50 pounds, developed Diabetes from the weight and became depressed. I blamed all those problems on other medications that I was started on to treat all those problems. After weaning off all the other medications I was still depressed. I finally have been slowly tapering the Inderal down and I feel like I am waking up from a 20 year depression. BE CAREFUL with this drug! Tapering Inderal has given me headaches, not migraines yet, but I am now post menopausal and that may be why, and because Inderal can help with general body pain, I have been having worse back pain. But the fact that I finally feel alive after 20 years of depression is worth it!

Migraine Prevention	nbillshale, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	3/20/2010 3:19:45 AM	I have taken a form of propranolol since my early 20s.  It definitely reduced the frequency, severity, and worry of having migraines.  If one occurs, the aura is first which gives me time to immediately take my secondary medication (Midrin) which stops the aura and prevents headache pain within about 25 minutes.  Then I can continue my regular routine for the day.  I may have some drowsiness, but this probably results from taking the Midrin.

It did prevent the migraines/ headaches I have daily. Propranolol made releif with an otc painkiller work better when I did experience a migraine.  However the side effects are not worth the treatment. The medication caused me to feel tired all of the time and from the lethargy I gained weight. Never a good side effect. I also experienced hair loss which was minimal at first but then it caused concern that it was so much hair. After being on the medication for about 6 months. I would have a handfull of hair after the shower and brushing my hair. I am currently searching for a new medication or solution to my recurring headaches.

Essential Tremor	braveheart, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	1/23/2010 12:40:30 PM	I have noticed that several people are not very satisfied with this drug. I have been living with tremors and Inderal  (and its generic) for over 25 years. I began with this drug alone. It worked well when I was younger. As time passed, my tremors grew stronger. My doctor combined two other tremor medications to help me. If you have trouble with this medication, keep tweaking the dosage of this prescription. The drowsiness symptom does not last long if it is the correct dosage. Your body grows used to it. You might ask your doctor for a lower dosage if you remain drowsy.

Ventricular Rate Control in Atrial Fibrillation	Propanolol works for Tachycardia, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/10/2009 2:04:42 PM	I was diagnosed with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia twelve years ago at age 43 - after an episode of 300+ heartbeats per minute. I was prescribed Propanolol - 20 mg per day and have found it to be very effective in preventing episodes of tachycardia.  When I have failed to stay on the drug, I am susceptible to severe tachycardia - probably fibrillation - with all the symptoms of a heart attack - and they are very frightening.  During an episode, I take an additional 20 mg.  Caffeine, lack of sleep, alcohol, and heat are also factors that increase the likelihood of an episode.  While the episodes are becoming more severe and lasting much longer, propanolol has worked and kept me alive this long.  I had the condition for thirty years before a diagnosis.  I was overweight before the prescription for propanolol, but never made the connection between weight gain and the drug - until I read these reviews.

Have almost all the side effects, cold hands and feet, vivid dreams,insomnia, low blood sugar at times, racing and irregular pulse at times. Wish I would have been prescribed a different medication when I was diagnosed with PAT and MVS. I could possibly have had a comfortable 30 years instead of tolerating all these symptoms but maybe an alternative was not available at that time. I am also on Levoxyl for hypothyroidism. My advice would be to discuss ALL alternatives with your doctor.before taking Inderal/Propanolol.

I've been on Inderal LA 80 mg for about a year and a half now and my blood pressure is controlled and I only have a migraine about once a month (compared to 3-4 times per week). I know it can be difficult to control both high blood pressure and migraines. Doctors often are just taking shots in the dark when trying to treat you. But it is the only way they can properly treat you since everyone's body chemistry is different, which means the medications available do not work the same on everyone. So if this drug is not right for you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist to suggest something else you can try.

Increased to 20mg twice daily and tremors have been well controlled along with lifestyle adjustments (ie. little to now caffeine).  Recently had a dosage increase to 40mg twice daily to assist with Migraine's, just waiting to see if it is an effective treatment.  The only symptom is tiredness, but it's a trade off for the tremors and I can push through the tiredness easily.

I've gained 20 pounds while on this and my appetite has ramped up. It's hard to get the energy to exercise when your blood pressure gets low. I wish there was a way to suppress appetite and weight gain, but given that before this I was having migraines 5 times a week, I'll take the fat over the agony.

Migraine Prevention	Stephanie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	2/26/2008 1:34:04 AM	27 years of age and been on Inderal for 5 years for Migraine headaches.  The medicine works as it should but the side effects are horrible.  I was completely healthy before this medication but now I have high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar.  I can't exercise without feeling like I'm about to pass out and I've recently gained an additional 15 pounds.  My heart rate has slowed down tremendously and drops to about 52bpm at night.  I'm constantly having palpitations that sometimes take my breath away.  I have a very hard time remembering things which has become very noticeable to my family, friends and coworkers.  I have hot flashes and no sex drive.  Although I'm 27, I feel like I'm 87.  I've tried to stop the medication before but ended up in the hospital twice in one month.  The medicine has given me the ability to have a life but is causing other problems.  I would love to get off of this medicine but my doctor won't take me off. 
Essential Tremor	creative7, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	2/22/2008 8:25:53 AM	This medication has made me dizzy like I have been on a all night drunk, even at a half of tab. It also has made me very dry like feeling. I don't like it and I want off! Even though it has helped sorta I cannot stand the side effects of being dizzy - I can't even go anywhere without feeling strange and that is the only pill I am on. I want off!

Unexplained and rapid weight gain with fatigue were hard to deal with. This med didn't work with my active and healthy lifestyle.

Also, I've noticed that the tremors are actually easier to control when they do start. And I haven't noticed any side effects at all. The only thing that Inderal hasn't helped with at all is handwriting. No way is anything I write even remotely legible. Perhaps dosage needs to be adjusted?

Anxious	jane59,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		10/21/2007 12:33:28 PM	I have used it for anxiety related to public speaking.  Since it is a beta blocker that blocks epinephrine, it works very well by temporarily blocking the ability to experience anxiety.  You have to be careful, it tends to cause depression afterwards.
Involuntary Quivering	ladyebugge, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	10/11/2007 6:50:37 PM	Inderal has been effective to very effective against the tremors -  the level of effectiveness has depended on the dosage.  There is a trade-off of the positive vs negative effects.  Most annoying negative effect has been the leg cramps experienced while climbing a few flights of stairs or walking up-hill [I'm guessing this is due to reduced oxygen from lower heart rate.]  I used to love to hike but Inderal makes hill climbing a difficult task.  On the positive side, it keeps my blood pressure moderately low. I've cut back on my daily dosage and put up with some reduction in manual dexterity to get back some spontaneous mobility and more of a natural adrenaline rush when I need it [which Inderal interferes with - that's how it works as I understand it].  It's easier to reduce the dosage when I get enough sleep and watch my caffeine intake. Seems to be a matter of making the trade-offs.

My very first use (1/2 a pill, 20mg) was a home run.  It worked so good that what I used to think was impossible (speaking in front of others) is now very peaceful.  My heart does not race out of my chest, thus a more relaxing life.--- I am, just recently experiancing some dizziness which is a reaction, but it might be due to alergies.  I need to see the Dr to determine the cause.
