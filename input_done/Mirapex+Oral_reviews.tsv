Extreme Discomfort in Calves when Sitting or Lying Down	saved, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	6/12/2012 11:45:27 PM	I did not know what i had (RLS) until i mentioned my severe symptoms to my neurologist during my &quot;migraine&quot; appt., but it (RLS) was so bad  I couldnt sleep without hot pads on both legs  and ice packs on my back after intensive leg exercises, often several times a night. I was becoming desperate.  He prescribed .25 mg Mirapex, which worked the first night. I felt my life had been saved.  After a few years i'm up to .75 mg to 100 mg, daily, taken about an hour before i go to bed, but it is still working. I would give up food before I would give up my Mirapex.  No side effects I am aware of. Truly a miracle drug for me.

I started out with a very small dose, my Dr. increased it to .05 and gradually it did NOTHING for me.  I went to a psychiatrist and he put me on .25 mg  five to six times a day, it is working.  I have severe restless legs and I'm sure this dose will eventually get to be not enough.  I'm okay  taking this, it just makes me very sleepy and I'll still wake up during the night and have to pop another of the .25 Mirapex pills.  There has to be something out there that works and doesn't cause drowsiness.

I was misserable almost everyday and night!I can't set down, sleep and stand still for long. My previous meds. worked okay but not for so long and it knocked me out! My husband says I was sleeping like dead and talking without remembering it the next day. I was okay with it until my dr. Prescribed me the Mirapix; this meds really worked for me.Two monts ago my Pharmacy changed my prescreption into generic which is not really good as the Mirapex. I talked to the pharmacist why they were given me the generic;he says that my insurance would not cover much since Mirapex is expensive, and if i do really want this medecine i have to pay $50.00 out of my pocket which i can't afford. I am still taken the generic one but I doubled my dose with my dr. permission; it seems to work but not the same with Mirapex.

Other	winnie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	11/5/2011 6:07:45 PM	I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia recently and one of the symptoms of Fibro is Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). For years I have battled RLS and now I have been able to sleep right through the night.  I feel so rested.  I used to have to wrap both my legs and feet in ice cold towels to stop my legs from walking.  Sometimes even slapping them so they would hurt, just so I wouldn't feel the tingling sensation from RLS.  This is one of very few meds that I recommend.  I'm not much for these newly marketed meds that the pharmaceutical companies are producing today.  The side effects are more dangerous than the disease that is being treated. So, in closing, I'm very satisfied with Mirapex.

My tremors have decreased tremendously. I still have some balance prolems, especially early in the morning on waking, and on rough terrain, but I sleep well now and if I move slowly I don't drop things, or spill as much, I am able to do more than a few months ago, but still tire more easily than before Parkison's. I am taking other meds to augment all of my symptoms. I am so grateful and so far on a lower dose my Parkinson's is well controlled, My memory is not what it was, but I have had this condition since 2007, only on Mirapex 5 months. This medicine is a God send for me. I thank God for the scientists who worked to create it, and God for creating the genius in them.

Other	millie, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	65-74	7/20/2011 9:20:59 AM	Two years ago I finally found a doctor that didn't think RLS is just in your head.  He prescribed Mirapex and for the first time in my 67 years I found out what a good night's sleep felt like - heavenly!  The only down side is that over these two years I have gained 30 unwanted pounds - good diet and exercise.  Tried to change to Requip to see it it would make a difference.  the change over period was HORRIBLE - As soon as I went back to Mirapex all was OK - except for the weight gain.  Any suggestions??

After about 3 years of using Mirapex and titrating up to the maximum dosage, I realized that the serious behavior changes I had were a result of the medication.  Among these behaviors were hypersexuality, uncontrolled gambling addiction, shopping/spending addiction, risky behaviors, and the inability to feel fear.  I cheated on my spouse which ended my marriage, put my life/health at risk, lost thousands of dollars through online gaming, caused my family's financial ruin resulting in bankruptcy - all things completely out of character for me.  After discontinuing this drug, against my doctor's orders, I turned into the person I used to be.  Only traces of these addictions/compulsive behaviors remain today.  I am aware of the danger of them however which makes them manageable.  I would highly recommend that anyone using Mirapex or another drug in it's class discusses all possible side effects.  They should also make sure the patients spouse/family/friends understand what to look for because often times the affected person doesn't see what's happening to them.  Please be very cautious as I don't want anyone dealing with this disease to have to experience what I've been through.  The best to you!

I have Parkinson's characterized by a right hand twitch. I don't think Mirapex has helped me (after taking 3 mg, for 6 months), my twitch is roughly 24/7.  The only leg twitch I've experienced was after 3 days of not taking this medicine. Does anyone else use (successfully) for controlling hand tremor?

I like it better than requip. It helps my RLS but does not eliminate it.  Have been having some side effects namely upset stomach but it seems to be getting better.  I sleep better but sitll only 4 to 5 hours a night.  The biggest unexpected bonus however, is how MUCH it has improved my mood. I am much happier for some reason and my appetite has decreased a bit.   Ask me in another month if I still feel the same way lol

It requires 1 hour to begin onset, is fully effective in 1.5 hours. For me, effectiveness is related to dosage. .25 mg for daytime is marginally effective, wears of quickly. .5 mg for nighttime is OK, but wears off as well and wakes me up. I would like to take more, but worry about unsolved rumors of melanoma, and my doctor agrees. It makes me quite sleepy as it onsets, and I take it in the evenings about an hour before bedtime...works - but doesn't keep you asleep. I tolerate Mirapex well, no other side effects.

Mirapex was the first drug prescribed by his neurologist, in gradually increasing doses.  Over time, other drugs were added: Sinemet (levodopa/carbidopa), Stalevo (levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone), &amp; Azilect and anti-anxiety drugs.  Soon, his Mirapex reached the maximum dosage (4.5 mg/day).During the first five years, my husband's PD seemed manageable; but compulsive behaviors emerged &amp; worsened: he gave money to strangers, often lied to me, stayed up/out all night, got involved with troublesome people, spent money recklessly, posted personal info on dating web sites, etc. His doctor was very concerned that my husband took 2 - 4 EXTRA pills per day (Sinemet &amp; Stalevo) for 36 months; but gave no guidance to help my husband take his pills correctly.In Dec. 2010, my husband was referred to a PD neurology sub-specialist, who at the first visit took him &quot;cold turkey&quot; OFF Mirapex &amp; increased his Stalevo.  She gave specific times to take his medicines &amp; had/has him keep a &quot;PD Diary&quot;:  when he takes his medications; how he feels: &quot;ON&quot; (mobile with or w/out dyskinesias, those uncontrollable movements), &quot;OFF&quot; (not mobile); when asleep; etc.  After a transition off Mirapex (&quot;internal&quot; tremors, etc.), my husband now takes less PD medication, sleeps better, &amp; most importantly, stopped the crazy compulsive behaviors that almost ruined our 30-year marriage &amp; our 40-year relationship!  BE CAREFUL WHEN CHOOSING A NEUROLOGIST for PARKINSON'S DISEASE, JOIN A PD SUPPORT GROUP, &amp; BEWARE Mirapex!  Our primary care doctor referred my husband to his first neurologist.  Our PD support group highly recommended the PD sub-specialist to me in November 2009; but my husband refused to see the sub-specialist until his first neurologist referred him to her!PD &amp; PD medications affect patients differently.  I hope my harrowing tale can help spare other PD caregivers the hell that I endured over the past two years!

The past month it's been worse than it's ever been.  Also, due to the compulsive side effects (scientifically proven) such as gambling, overeating, etc., which I exhibit also, I decided to stop taking it a couple of days ago until I talk to a neurologist/sleep specialist in a couple of weeks.  Apparently that was a bad idea.  First night was fine, but second night, my symptoms were so bad, one spasm (full-body) almost cracked my head against the wall next to my bed.  Felt extreme symptoms in both legs and both arms, and they kept me awake for at least 3 hours after I went to bed.  I've never been officially diagnosed with RLS; 5-6 years ago I told my doc about the symptoms and he basically threw the medication at me.  Hopefully the neurologist/sleep spec will reveal something more solid.  Again, it does work pretty well most of the time, but over the last month or so, some nights it hasn't stopped the symptoms at all.  I've also become a compulsive gambler/shopper since I started taking the medication, and can't go more than a couple of hours without eating something.  I can't prove that the medication is influencing this, but those behaviors started around the same time I started the med.  Definitely worth resarching since it's been scientifically proven to influence, even cause compulsive behavior due to excess simulated dopamine in the brain.  Caveat emptor!

Requip made me dizzy/sweating and this is so much better. No weight gain, but I do notice an increase in my libido. I do often wake up feeling tired, but at least I can sleep. I suffered for 2 years with RLS before seeking treatment and wish I had done so sooner. I'd really like to know what causes RLS, my doctor said possibly it's a decrease in dopamine.

I had 3 sleep studies which identified sleep apnea and RLS- my leg movements were insane.  Miraplex worked very well for about 8 months.  After that it's effectiveness seemed to decrease.  I increased from 1mg to 1.5mg at bedtime.  Now I'm up to 2.0mg.  I'm up in the early am almost everyday with rls.  I have all day nausea with vomiting thru the night and am.  Now I'm off to a neurologist.  Of note I do take about 12 other medications which include Trazadone 150mg and Seroquel 600mg at hs (for depression and heavy hitters for sleep).  I don't want to change to yet another new medication.  I'm going to suggest breaking out the dosage- but will taking in the am help in the pm?

Taking the Mirapex has been a life safer. I have had weight gain but can live with it. The only other sida effect I have noticed is that I can not combine any other medications with it. If I do, the Mirapex does not work. Would not be with out it.

It is without a doubt a MIRACLE drug! Over the years, I have had it adjusted up, and am now completely stable. I had tried everything. By the time I found Mirapex, my RLS had spread from my lower, to my upper legs and into my arms. I suffered terribly and could be found anytime, day or night sitting up, rocking back and forth and crying. It got so bad I would double up my fists and beat on my legs.  I couldn't drive or sleep. At one time I needed an MRI, and they had to discontinue the test because my body would not hold still, it just kept jerking. I was denied a badly needed test because of it. And it became a 24/7 problem as it worsened. The only time I could get any relief at all was standing up, and of course that is impossible on a 24 hour a day basis. For 45 years, I hadn't had a decent nights sleep. I was beyond depressed all the time.  When my Doctor decided to try Mirapex, she had never used it for RLS and now, all of her RLS patients are on it and doing beautifully!  I have had no side effects (and no extreme urges of any kind), just tremendous relief! I would recommend it to anyone, anyone and everyone.  It saved my life! I will NEVER allow myself to feel what I did for so many years again.  Thank God for Mirapex!! And to be honest: if there are to be any side effects (of which I have had none)that maybe someday, I might have as a result, I don't care.  There is absolutely nothing that could ever be worse than what I have gone through for so many years as I have with RLS, and I have a great many serious and painful problems.  Believe me, they don't hold a candle to the suffering that this disease puts you through.  Try it.  Anyone reading this, TRY IT.  You won't be sorry.

I take between 2 &amp; 4 mg. daily depending on the severity of my RLS on any given day.  I now have extreme sleepiness, going to sleep during conversations, at work, while working on computer, sitting still for more than a few minutes and even driving my car.  I was just lucky that I did not cause a wreck when I drove into the path of an oncoming vehicle.  I know it is the Mirapex because I recently had surgery &amp; was on pain meds for a short time.  I quit taking the Mirapex and all symptoms of sleepiness were gone.  The pain med actually kept the RLS in control &amp; bearable. Dr's worry about pain meds and side effects but I think the Mirapex is much more dangerous. Requip is not an option due to extreme nausea &amp; vomiting.

THE SIDE AFFECTS FROM THIS DRUG ARE INCOHERENCE AND DISORIENTATION! Please take this as a warning for anyone on this drug! My father has Parkinsons Disease and has had it for manymany years, he was switched to this drug November of 09' his dosage is between 5-7mg at first he experienced EXTREME hallucinations all day every day (besides the sleeplessness) after 7 months he has lost his mind. He has no sense of reality, he can't put 2 words together. I can't talk to him, and he can't relay anything that makes sense. He is non-stop interacting with his hallucinations, and has completely lost all touch with reality. PLEASE THIS DRUG IS NOT WORTH LOSING YOUR MIND! The hallucinations are a nightmare and we can't physically control him from what he's doing. He has hurt himself and others. He hasn't slept for 2 days and has non-stop talking and rambling about hallucinations. Up until now, he would just take frequent naps, and constantly be restless. If you have a loved one on this, I would recommend you switch the medication before it deteriates the mind.

From the first day I have had absolutely no RLS symptoms.  My RLS was severe...had it when I woke in the morning and throughout the day...couldn't sit in a movie without carbo/levo and traveling a distance by car or plane was unbearable.  Now I feel like a new person (sounds like a commercial).  The only side effect I've noticed so far was some drowsiness and nausea the first couple of days, but that has now leveled off.  I am a happy person...just hope it will last!
Parkinson's Disease	wife, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	4	5	1	Female	55-64	5/18/2010 2:23:48 PM	My husband took Mirapex for 12 years.  He loved it for the huge help with his PD symptoms BUT the first thing I noticed a few year ago was some gambling a few times that was unusual. Then he began shopping for clothes and he gained a lot of weight. Then the demand for sex all the time. Finally he began having an affair to satisfy the sexual compulsions.  This is a BIG problem that is not adequately addressed in the medical field.  His doctor did NOT do a good job of monitoring the possible side effects.  A casual question or two is not enough for a patient whose psyche is being messed with by this powerful drug. If you are a spouse or caregiver, you need to be very watchful and take the intiative, because compulsive people are not going to volunteer their problem to you.

He also had kidney failure and is on hemodialysis.  Something about the dialysis makes RLS severly worse.  After many other attempts to control RLS using other drugs his neurologist recommended Mirapex.  In the beginning it seemed to help a little, but over time it lost it's effectiveness.  While on Mirapex he began having additional sleep disturbances - sleep walking, acting out dreams, extreme limb movement during sleep.  It was not determined whether these additional symptoms were caused by Mirapex or by the sleep depravation he was experiencing with the RLS out of control.  He was taken off Mirapex and his RLS is not better or worse as it was before he started taking it.  Also, when he stopped taking the drug he experience two seizures.  He had no history of seizures prior to this.  We know people who are not on dialysis that use  Mirapex with success, but it has been our experience it was ineffective.

I looked those symtoms up on my husbands computer and they were all symptoms of Parkinsons along with 20 other symtoms that I had.  In fact I had all but one of the symptoms that they listed.  So I found out who in my area was supposed to be the best Dr. for Parkinsons--he promptly took me off Mirapex for 3 weeks so he could test me.  One week off convinced me, I had forgotten in that short time how much my muscles hurt without the Mirapex.  When I walked into the Dr.s' office (he told me later) there was no doubt in his mind I had it, my face had gone totally blank. He put me back on Mirapex; 1.5 mg, 2 times per day. I have to crush the pill in order to absorb it correctly, but its still working wonderfully and I am rehabbing houses and designing jewelry at 65 years old.

Have had restless legs since childhood (now 45). It works GREAT! There is also now a generic form of the medicine but very hard to get due to demand. My biggest caution is that you become dependant on this drug. Do NOT just quit taking it! You must ease off just as you would depression medicine. I also feel my restless leg symtoms are much worse now than before I took Mirapex but the pills resolve it before bedtime. Even though those things are the bad side I still take it because I do not sleep well without it. It may take hours for the exahustion to overrule the restlegs without it. It has really been a lifesaver. Just read the side effects and know how to take it - and don't assume your doctor will tell you this. Mine did not.

Mirapex did quite the RLS, but I could not fall asleep! About 1.5 hrs after taking I get this funny feeling wash over me, I get chills and feel pressure in my head. What keeps me awake now is not the RLS but my brain not shutting off. I have only been on for 3 nights. Has anyone had these symptoms and will they go away?

When the evening comes and I am sitting back in my recliner watching movies, I can usually get through one movie without the leg issues, but not a second movie. All-in-all, it works good.

It didn't work very well.  Sometime later Requip was prescribed.  I didn't find it all that effective and it made me a bit sick to my stomach.  The RLS continued to worsen, somtimes causing me to lose sleep night after night and be miserable on a 4hr. or better flight.  Then a new doctor prescribed Mirapex.  It was and continues to be a miracle drug for me.  I don't know what I'd do without it.  And ... NO... I haven't developed an addiction to gambling nor have I become afflicted with any other compulsive behavior disorder.  MIRAPEX rocks if you have RLS.

At that time I was emaciated and extremely weak, choking on my own saliva, chair-bound and wasting away, in more pain than any human should have to endure.  Mirapex restored me to a happy, productive life overnight.  HOWEVER: two years later I blacked out at the wheel of my car and now I have titanium ankles, am VERY lucky to be alive and able to walk (still in physical therapy) and exceedingly lucky that I didn't injure anybody else.  Narcolepsy is a frequent and often SUDDEN side effect of this drug about which I was not warned.  Please, please beware.  Mirapex is the only medicine they ever found that helps my  dystonia and I couldn't stop taking it.  The fix?  After three sleep tests and not driving for three years (out of fear) my doctor relented and prescribed 100mg of Provigil each morning to insure that I stay awake (works for 12 hours) and that has worked wonderfully.

Recently I'm only bothered at night, but I have to take the same amount of medicine only in a condensed time frame (7pm to 10pm). I don't sleep for much more than 5 hours a night. I tend to fall asleep when driving. I have several ways to combat this, but now drive only short distances.

The only solution is to take a low dose narcotic, which doctors find hard to give a prescription.

However, now going back on low doses of mirapex...25  3X daily..Had been taking .75  4X daily. Dr. keeping me on other meds above as well: l/2 carb/levo ER 3X daily, two regular  sinemet 4X daily, Comtan 200mg 4X daily. will see how this works. what does NOT work in the cost of all of these drugs..anybody else had that problem?

While driving I would have to stop and get out and walk around.The doctors before had no idea what was wrong with me and I finally gave up and just started living with it.I was finally diagnosed with RLS and was given Requip which my me very drowsy and had a hard time driving and I quit taking it as I like to work and I would end up taking a nap a lot. I found a doctor and he prescribed Mirapex and since I started taking it I was able to get some rest and sleep. Do you know what it is like to go 40 years with it and finally find something that would let me get some rest? I also do night driving and it does not make me drowsy or anything. I can lie down and take a nap get get up and start doing things right away.I will never go back to Requip. So far Mirapex has been a MIRACLE for me.

Actually doctor called it Periodic Leg Movement during Sleep which he said is a step above RLS.  I take it before bed and it seems to be working very well.  After reading about some of its side effects, the worst being extreme sleepiness and incontinence, I may have to ask my doctor about it.

It worked wonders!  In fact I couldn't make it through one night without it, I literally had to drive to the pharmacy to get refills in order to get thru thr nights sometimes! But 5 years later, I have increased it a few times, on bad nights, by like 1/2 pill.  If I double the dose it makes my stomach nauseated.  But it seems to be loosing its effectiveness I am sorry to report!  I agree with some of the other posts that say that without some type of medication for this disorder, it feels like you want to be drugged and hospitalized...because it is soooo nerve wrecking!  I really hope they can find a reason and a cure for this disorder!!!

My doctor put me on mirapex because I had severe tremors/spasms in my legs and not really at night, but throughout the whole day. it helped considerably and am now able to walk with a walker instead of using a wheelchair.  The only downfalls is i am unable to sleep and maybe get 3-4 hrs a night when i would get exactly 8 everyday. It's like my body had a built in alarm. Also my appetite has decreased, eating smaller portions 2 times a day. rarely having a snack in between. Also bowel movements have drastically decreased to once a week. But it's been worth it.i now have spasms happening for 5 seconds at a time, and only 2-3 times a day. I would strongly recommend this drug for MS patients with severe spasms in their legs. i've also had pain and tightness in my shoulder muscles.

I started on the lowest dosage and have had to increase to the next level.  Some nights my legs are worse than others and I need to take two pills.  Since starting Mirapex I always feel bloated, I am not sure if this is due to the medication or not but it is not a problem I ever had prior to taking it.  I also don't like the &quot;drugged&quot; feeling when I wake in the morning but I deal with it because at least I can sleep.  Without Mirapex I would not get to sleep at all.

My doctored lowered my dosage but I have continued to take it. I am now also on  carbidopa and amantadine.  I still have those compulsions(worse) and I have gained approx. 30 lbs since I started taking it. I have decided to ween myself off of mirapex, hopefully my doctor will agree.

I have read many reviews of others and they seem happy with this medication, as my dr says all people will react different to any medication so the best reveiw I can give is that you have to try it to know if it will work for you. I have not had any luck with this medication so far but others have.

We tried some others first..they wore off/out after taking for a few months.  Mirapex has not failed me.  I also get it in my arms and I often tell people (including my doc) that if I were not able to have mirapex, I would prob end up in a mental institution wearing a straight jacked.  For me, if there are side effects I am experiencing.. so be it.  I cannot maintain sanity without it.

Have been through many test and no one has an answer.  I have been on 800 mg. Ibuprofen for years and it works for me.  But it's not good to be on this according to my Dr.  I have been on Mirapex for 3 nights now and I haven't slept for 3 nights now.  I am miserable!  I have read others suggestions and today I am going to split my dose and take 1/2 in the afternoon and 1/2 in the evening.  I am concerned with the issue of weight gain in some people, if that becomes an issue I will take my chances with the 800 Ibuprofen.

In June of '08 I was prescribed this medication (0.125 mg). It sort of worked if I recall correctly, but the effectiveness was greatly overshadowed by a new problem. I suddenly developed horrible stomach probs, including severe pain, constipation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and the inability to eat even when starving. I was about 97 lbs to begin with and dropped to 83 lbs. (It was mid-Nov. when I had finally gained it all back, and then a little more. I am at a healthy 102-105 lbs now). After a week of suffering, I quit taking the medication, and my stomach problems went down greatly, but have definitely not gone away. I now have very slow digestion. It takes me about 5 times longer to digest than the ave. person. Prescription meds have not helped, and have even put me in the hospital. Eating tends to be extremely difficult, and sometimes non-existent, even when I'm hungry. This has also made me more tired than usual (I suffer from insomnia, depression, and anxiety). I'm a girl who likes to wear corsets and other fitted tops, but can't always wear them because it makes my problems worse. I can't say that I would not recommend this med, as my results seem to be unique. While I hope that no one else has to/has gone through this, I hope I am not alone.

With Mirapex I was pain free and slept like a baby.  After a few week I began having dark, depressing and scarry thoughts which stoped when I discontinued the drug. I tried staring it again a few times with the same results.  I take it for 1 or 2 nights for a good nights sleep from time to time knowing that even that is risky for me.  I take a lot of advil, carbadopa/levadopa, hydrocodone.  I have the same reaction to car/lev if I take too much.

I find the drug effective if and only if I take it as directed - three times a day,  morning noon and night, and every day. Missing even one dose is enough to bring back the attacks in a limited way; missing a day of the medication will put me back where I started. This is an unusual reason to prescribe this drug but the drug has definitely been effective. I would recommend it to others.

I've been taking this med about 6 months and on the sleep apnea machine. I still wake up every couple of hours. I'm taking .50 mg, have dreams and nightmares and leg, feet and left hand cramps . I've fallen asleep at the wheel several times inclding one close call of a near headon. Just last week I discussed this with a doctor and refused to take Lyrica thinking that was the culprit plus more side effects with that. I told him I wanted no drug with those side effects. He prescribed cymbalta without discussing it with me. It also will cause you to fall asleep. I fell asleep on the way home from his office. He never told me that Mirapex could be the cause of my falling asleep, but added more drugs. I quit the lyrica on my own having memory problems etc, took only one of the cymbalta, and now after reading about mirapex you can bet I'm finished. Now, do I taper or go cold turkey?My leg cramps are coming from 4 fusions in my neck..muscle spasms. Old fashion muscle relaxers don't have all the side effects of these new drugs! The pharmucical companies are advertising Lyrica, and cymbalta on TV alot, and must have a real push on with the doctors offices! I refuse to be an overly medicated zombie senior citizen sit up to be diagnosed with dementia! I'd rather cope with the chronic pain cold turkey than deal with these side effects.

I've taken Mirapex for over 15 years and take 3 mgs. per day.  It's a high dosage, but without it, I can't function.  It has made the difference between a normal life and a creepy crawly hell.  I have noticed a tendency toward compulsive shopping, but knowing it's a possibility, I can control it.  The only drawback to Mirapex, in my opinion, is its extreme high cost.  This has been a real problem. It is such a wonderful medication, it seems like it should be affordable to anyone - and it isn't.

In my experiences, it is much better than its competitor Requip (ropinirole), and from what I understand, Mirapex has a much lower rate of random fainting than Requip does.  (I, however, have never fainted on Mirapex.)I was given the drug for restless leg syndrome (RLS), and I had the RLS severely enough that it interfered with activities during the day (for example, I could not stand in one place for more than 2 minutes).  Mirapex improved that time to about 10 minutes, which is actually quite an improvement when I go out and have to wait in line for something.&quot;Akathisia&quot; (a severe form of anxiety) apparently is a major side effect of Mirapex, but I did not get any.The only issue with this medication is that a generic is not available (yet) in the US, whereas generic ropinirole is available.  My own insurance does not cover brand name drugs too well (I still have to pay about 90% of the cash price, but have a low co-pay for generics).  That's why I gave it a lower &quot;ease of use&quot; rating compared to other drugs I've rated.

It has seriously helped my RLS, but I have gained 15 pounds since I have been taking it, and I walk 1-2 miles a day, and have cut way back on my diet, and am still gaining weight.  My thinking was the exercise would make me feel better, but the medicine is making me gain weight which is defeating the whole purpose.  So, I either have my legs hurt and twitching all night or I just keep gaining weight.

I experienced hallucinations (frequent and scary).  Dr. cut me down to .5 mg and I have stayed that way for 2 years.  Now I am still on .5 mg but am experiencing hallucinations and more importantly nausea and dizziness every morning that makes feel like I am going to pass out.  I don't understand this change since nothing about my medications has changed.  I realize that nausea and dizziness are common side effects with this medication, but why now after taking it for almost 3 years.

And, now I have been experiencing nausea and vomitting, headaches, dizziness, and the effect is wearing off.  Worst part is being SOOOOOO tired all of the time.

I would also agree if taken to late in the evening it takes a considerable time to work. My major concern and warning for some is the connection between the drug and compulsive gambling. When I had to up my dosage recently my gambling became even more out of control. Maybe I'm just don't want to take responsibility for my problem, but there is a warning lable on the medication regarding this issue. Something to keep in mind.

Lately, I've been having chest discomfort and am greatly concerned.  In investigating Mirapex, I wonder if physicians need to question whether patients have RLS or PLMD (Periodic Limb Movement Disorder).  I plan to question my physician very closely to see if I was misdiagnosed.  This drug is not worth having heart problems.

I recently started having an irregular heartbeat and chest pains. My neurologist referred me to a cardiologist. The side effects listed for Mirapex include both my symptoms but the neurologists said Mirapex wasn't the cause. I guess what I'm asking is: does anyone else have this side effect? and will this cause permanent heart damage?

It gradually got worse over the years.  About two years ago I started to have distressing symptoms almost every night.  At first I took Requip, but I got such a bad case of dry mouth I had to switch to Mirapex.  It has greatly improved my ability to sleep.  However, since the directions said to take it 1 to 3 hours before bedtime, that's what I've done.  But I find I can't sit down to read or watch TV in the late afternoon or evening without symptoms kicking in.  Also, it takes at least 1 1/2 hours for the medication to kick in.  Since I read here that other users take it at other times of the day or even split the pill in two, I'm going to try that.  Maybe it will improve the quality of my leisure time as well as my sleep!

At first I took 1-2 hour prior to bedtime with little relief. Then a good friend of mine said to take 1/2 dose at 6pm then remaining 1/2 dose right before bed. As a result, I have complete relief. Only side effect is that I get tired around 9-10ish but I can live with that. I would recommend anyone with RLS to do this as I did not for awhile and wished I had.

I took Requip first, it did not work at all, and seemed to make all three illnesses worse. I started taking Mirapex and althought it has stopped the RLS, I notice that I still have knee jerks off and on during the 24 hr. period. I started the Mirapex at .25MG then after 7 days upped it to .50MG. &gt;50 MG was too much, I felt miserable and nauseated all of the time. I reduced it to .25MG, and am currently stable. I do have trepidation taking this med., however, the alternative is unbearable.I tried Requip which did not work.

I didn't notice the RLS symptoms at night during my drinking days/times. Wife noticed my RLS after alcohol wore off. Symptoms have become worse since I quit drinking. Have been taking 0.125 MG for a little over 2 years for my RLS, I feel it has been very effective for me, my wife has different views and feels it has only been moderately effective. Wife wakes up at night while I am sleeping when I have RLS movements. Have recently, last 2 months, doubled dosage to 0.250, still feel it has been beneficial. Only known side effect would be falling to sleep easily (day, evening or night) has not ben any real problem. I have recently acquired a rash on my cheeks and neck. Wonder if it is from the increased dosage? Anyone else experience a rash? Overall very satisfied with Mirapex have not tried any other medication for RLS.

I'd walk, eat, stretch legs, anything to keep my mind off my legs. Tried OTC pain/sleep meds; didn't help. I'd be up all night. Gained weight from that routine! Mirapex is my miracle drug. Take .75mg about 30 mins. before bedtime along with a 150mg Trazodone. All x-tra weight dropped off since starting Mirapex. I can now sleep!  Have had no side effects- and no more RLS!

Extreme Discomfort in Calves when Sitting or Lying Down	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/5/2008 3:46:31 AM	I haven't been able to sleep before. I used to end up with my legs in some really odd position, or I would just roll and turn and freak out while trying to sleep. The first night I took this, first of all, 45 minutes later...out like a light. Then woke up in EXACTLY the same position...Never happened in my life. Slept better than I ever have. New to it. So, hoping effectiveness doesn't decrease. And also a little worried about the weight gain...Gambling..eh. I don't think I could gamble while I'm so asleep my cat could chew off my arm...

I've been taking for about 8 months.  I have gained about 20 pounds during this time frame and have had periods of &quot;dopey&quot; days.  I used to take 2 TyenolPM at bedtime to help me fall asleep and after reading everyone elses reviews of this drug, I will be stoping taking this med (with Doc advise) and going back to the TyenolPM.

Anyone taking this drug should be aware of the potential harm when one stops.  I also had a huge weight gain and compulsive shopping while taking mirapex.  I hope to soon be over the effects but do not recommend this treatment.
Other	KittyBelle, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/1/2008 11:59:47 AM	This medicine has helped immensely with my RLS as well as Fibromyalgia!  I have been allergic to Requip (dye on the tablets) as well as having issues with other medications.  Myself, as well as a few others I know with both RLS and Fibro all report that the fibro is better controlled while on Mirapex, and I'm reading that they're considering Mirapex as a fibro treatment.  It works beautifully.  Still adjusting the dosage here (going to .5 mg tonight) but overall, I feel 110% better.

I started on lowest dose, but have had to have dose raised 3x's.  I'm at 1Mg. now, But going to ask for it to be raised again--if I try to nap during day or even just relax, legs start jerking.  It does help me sleep, so I'm happy.  After researching, I found out its hereditary(I have it and so does my mom &amp; daughter.  I also found out that it's linked to &quot;growing pains&quot;, which I had a horrible case of as a kid. Good luck to everyone dealing with this.Sweet DreamsShelley

The first night I took it I has some problems sleeping but even though I slept less, I felt 1000% better the next day.  I had more energy, I was more focused, I was able to concentrate more and my productivity at work was greatly increased. I would definitely recommend this medicine to anyone who feels like they may be experiencing RLS.

I found that my RLS has become more prominent during the day now, and when i get up in the morning my legs and arms are wild.  I hope it is because i'm fairly new to the drug but I feel a little more able to relax in the evening. It takes several hours after i take it that it finally kicks in. I really am putting alot of hope into this drug working!

My frontal lobe was severely damaged which intesifies my pain.  Damaged nerves from the amputationshave caused tremendous amounts of pain that have been so unpredictable it really altered my life.  I was afraid to leave home not knowing when the pain would take over.  Sometimes it would only last a few seconds or it would last for hours.I've tried nearly all pain meds like Lyrica, Neurotin, Amantadine, etc.When I first saw the TV commercial I researched it online and then called my doctor.  He was unsure since it is primarily used for treatment with Parkinson's disease.I've been on it for a little over 2 months @ .25MG in the evening before bed.My sleep is better than ever and the pain has stopped altogether.  I'm very satisfied with MIRAPEX!  =)

I have had RLS for over 30 years and the only thing I was ever given by a doctor that woked was Valium which I did not take very long because of the addicting factor that Valium has and also doctors do not like to put you on it for long term use, it did work but would not hold you through the night unless you took at least 10mg. a night. I have not had any side efecctes from Mirapex since I started taking it so I hope it stays that way.

I am taking .50 of mirapex nightly and found that it works most nights.  Although if I have had any alcohol it becomes ineffective.  I also have movement during the day so my doctor has started me at .25 in the mornings also.  No side effects, other than I do get spacy during the day occasionally.  Anyone experience any Parkinson related stuff?  I have stiffness when rising up from a chair....
Other	Dave, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	3	Male	55-64	5/19/2008 6:29:02 PM	I took this drug to treat my RLS symptoms.  It has really helped me for several years get better rest by ending the constant movements and cramping of leg muscles, however I have gradually and constantly gained weight.  My appetite seems to be worse in the afternoon and evening, despite the fact that I eat a very healthy diet consisting of mostly produce and protein.  It is very discouraging since I have had a reduction in activity level at the same time due to a back problem requiring surgery 17 months ago.  I have been walking almost every day as well as returning to many of the physical activities I was able to do, but still no weight loss.  Is there any other drug that could help the RLS without the weight gain?

It seemed to be working, however I also suffer from sleep apnea and fibromyalgia.  I have been taking 2mg before bed.  For the last 6 mos or so, I've been telling the Drs that I have periods of just spacing out, or &quot;falling asleep&quot;.  Could happen during a conversation, at a red light etc. They associated it with the apnea.  I recently &quot;fell asleep&quot; momentarily while driving and was in an accident.  Luckily no one was hurt, but the Drs immediately took me off this drug because of the sudden onset of sleep side effect.  If this happens...please notify your doctor immediately.  I'm lucky no one got hurt.  I never realized the seriousness of this side effect and now wonder why the Drs all let me go for 6 mos complaining about what I was feeling/doing and never associated it with the drug?  Please be careful!

I find it effective on some nights, but on nights it is not effective..I may not get to sleep until 6AM, seems worse than if I had taken nothing at all.  Yet except for those few days...its the best treatment I have found.Although it is not heavily stressed in the bulletins, I think more than one drink at 6PM, followed by the Mirapex at 10PM will likely nullify or make worse the RSL condition by 12.

Most nights it works.  I've found if I perform leg exercises right after taking the drug, it starts to work faster &amp; works longer.  I usually do a minimum of 500 leg lifts 1 night &amp; pedal or walk at least 2 miles the next night. On a bad night more exercise seems to help. If I don't exercise in the evening, the drug doesn't work very well &amp; sometimes not at all. I haven't noticed any side effects. I just wish it was less expensive but I'm told there isn't a substitute that is even partly covered by my insurance. I'm 70 years old. My Mother had RLS also.

I've had RLS for most of the latter half of my life (I'm 51), but it has gotten increasingly worse in the last two or three years to where I can't sit still on a bus or lie in bed awake for hours.  When I finally reported this to my doctor (who argued with me that this is ONLY a nighttime sleep disorder and I had to print out pages of from medical research on the Internet to prove it wasn't), he prescribed Mirapex.  I wouldn't do without it for the world.  I've had to start taking it twice a day because the condition has worsened, but, I don't care - I'd take it 5 times a day if necessary.

Also helps me get off to sleep. However by 4:00am it has stopped working. If i forget to take it, the next night i can't sleep due to legs spasing out all the time.  This has been a wonderful medication for me.

I caused abnormal thinking, severe edema (swelling) in my legs, feet and arms, and I went for about two months without sleeping.  If you or your family notice behavior changes, notify your doctor immediately!!!
