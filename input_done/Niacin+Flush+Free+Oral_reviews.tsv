Deficiency of the Vitamin Niacin	sd.pharr, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	8/29/2012 10:38:56 AM	I am a non-smoker for 22 years...Anyone smelling woodsmoke or cigarette smoke after taking niacin? It is horrible. I feel like I'm smothering from the smell and it makes me cough!!! When I opened my bottle this morning, I made the connection...there was that smell! But, I'm sitting at my desk at work and that horrible smell is with me. Any suggestions?

After taking flush-free niacin for 6 months to raise my HDL, results were good and my doctor's happy. No side effects whatsoever.

I have not smoked in 6 years but since I started taking it I have heartburn every night and then my mouth taste as if I have been smoking very heavy and not brushing my teeth.  I can not stand this taste and have decided to come off the niacin and see if this bad taste goes away. I really need for it to work because I have tried everything else to get my tris down, they are still at 230.

I have a severe case of tinnitus and niacin reduces the loudness of the ringing in my ears. I've had no side effects at all. If I miss a few days of taking it, the ringing is unbearable. I recommend it for anyone suffering from tinnitus.

Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	35-44	4/20/2008 2:38:10 PM	I have been taking 1000mg of Niacin 2x a day for 8 years now. I started when I had a TRI level of over 600... with Niacin and some other changes it came down to about 200. I started taking Niacin under Dr.'s direction and found little effect at 500mg 2x a day... things improved dramatically when I went to the full 1000mg (2x/day). I do get blood tests for liver functions a couple of times a year. The hardest part of taking this is the &quot;flushing effect,&quot; which can be uncomfortable. This effect is reduced when I take half an asprin with each dose (Dr.'s suggestion). It took a few months to adjust but the long term benefits (nonprescription intervention and cost) are well worth the results. Hang in there if you are going to try this and I would recommend doing so under a Dr.'s supervision. Good luck and I hope it works for you like it has for me!

Also I ended up with gout.  I now have to monitor the high amount of Uric Acid my blood to control the gout, because it now comes back. Watch your diet while taking niacin.
