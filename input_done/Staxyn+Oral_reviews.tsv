Other	loveit, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	8/24/2012 4:46:29 PM	Did not really need this but tried it and wow. After ejaculation, I can keep going and going and going with a hard on like I've never had. Sometimes....boom a second and better ejaculation. No side effects other than extreme pleasure for both. I'm 55.
Inability to have an Erection	songstero, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	4	5	4	Male	45-54	8/18/2012 9:55:48 AM	i use a razor blade to remove pill. used to take entire pill. now take 1/2. entire pill would really work. at times, after i came, I'd have another hardon in 15mins. your face will flush red, like w/ viagra. i notice i cannot get a restful sleep. would like to take in morning. if i take at night, not doubt it's affects will work in the morning too! it's expensive. tastes mint-y. with insurance, it's $10 per pill. i once ordered from Canada, and the particular batch (no generic is yet available) didn't taste right. they ended up refunded my money, but i kept the tabs. i WISH WISH WISH i didn't have to use this (I'm 46), but i do....... :-/
Other	cash, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	55-64	8/2/2012 2:30:25 PM	Wonderful. 30 minutes or so after taking the medication, a strange feeling occurs in the testicles. Now able to take my time with oral sex and no problems with penetration. After ejaculation I am able to keep going and going and going....and sometimes ejaculate again, even better the second time. I noticed that if I then shower and just let my thoughts go....I easily get erect again. I've never felt better and confident.

It has also boosted my confidence in bed. My doctor gave me a few samples now I get them from time to time. My erections are hard and last longer than normal. The disintegrated tablet is so easy to use too. I recommend it if you have insurance.

I achieved an erection, adequate for foreplay but not rigid enough for penetration I'll ask my doctor for a prescription.

Hard erection in less than 1 Hr after taking it, seems to last more than 24 hours. No side effects in my case.The only problem is price: 16 dollars per pill was the cheapest I found.

I am a swinger and attend many parties and functions associated with this lifestyle... after taking this med 2 hrs. Prior to arriving at a party, I was pleased to experience an erection the lasted approximately 10 hours as I had become sexually active with 6 or more female partners...  I did experience the &quot;stuffy nose&quot;  9ften associated with taking this type of med.

Hit or miss erections and very poor erections. Can not have penetration sex and only good for short period of time. Not the best drug for me.
Inability to have an Erection	b,  Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	3	1	Male		11/20/2011 8:27:43 AM	Much less effective than the comparable dose of the film coated tablets and twice as expensive. The packaging is hard to open compared to some other meds (such as Micardis). Overall, not an advance.
