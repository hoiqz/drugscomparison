Anemia from Inadequate Iron	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	6/1/2012 4:30:56 PM	I have used this medicine weekly  4 times for about 6 months. My Iron levels came down a bit more and gave me side effects like weakness and weight loss
Other	Rachel S, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	2/23/2012 1:03:08 PM	I am taking this medicine because I have sickle cell trait.  My blood count gets low at times and I also get weak so I have to take iron supplements.  I have been taking Ferrex Forte 150 for about a week now and I feel so much better already.  I am not tired and fatigued so easily.  I love my new doctor because my old doctor did not manage my blood count when she knew I was sickle cell trait. Make sure you get a doctor that monitors your blood count if you have sickle cell, anemia, or the trait. Lovin Ferrex 150 Forte.

I didn't go for my blood work, so don't know if it is really working.  I have been taking pills twice a day to treat my low blood count.  It seems working slowly but still feels tired.  I am somewhat satisfied until I see my doctor again.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	debbie1056, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2		45-54	9/1/2011 3:33:47 PM	On my package the back is easily peeled from the side.  Has anyone had nausea or headaches?  I really don't know about the effectiveness because I have not been back to the doctor yet.  Hoping it is working.  I really don't want infusions.  They don't sound so pleasant.
Other	miss shell, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	35-44	4/25/2011 10:51:55 PM	I have alpha thalassemia. I started this med 7yrs ago. I used it on &amp; off over the yrs till recently I had a blood transfusion. My Dr prescribed this twice a day. My kidneys /lower back is killing me. My red blood levels keep dropping. I've been told to take this for another month before trying an iron transfusion. I don't think it's working.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2			1/22/2011 5:43:27 PM	I agree with the way it is packaged, very hard to open each pill. Has anyone developed upper muth sores.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	Bamboo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	1	5	Female	35-44	9/13/2010 2:54:28 PM	Like that other patient commented about the packing.  It is impossible to open without using something sharp to poke open the hard foil then tear open the foil to take the pill out.  Do not attempt to use the pill to push through the foil, the pill will crack, then you'll have alot of brown powder on your hands.  It is really dumb to have such a hard thing to open.  As for the effectiveness, I find it worked for me very well, I am no longer tried all the time due to lack of iron.  The side effects I have is gas and black stool. (alot of loud stinky gas!) 
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	davey, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Male		6/26/2010 2:50:42 PM	The pills work great, but with my arthritis, I cannot open the blister packs myself. Other pills such as Protonix have thin aluminum bases which can easily be pushed through, and others such as Crestor come in a bottle with a dessicant capsule. I don't know why the Ferrex manufacturer packages these so difficultly.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	3	Female	55-64	5/1/2009 8:00:25 AM	As I take several other prescription drugs, I found it somewhat difficult to time the taking of this one.  My iron levels have not improved and I may need to go the infusion route in a few weeks.
