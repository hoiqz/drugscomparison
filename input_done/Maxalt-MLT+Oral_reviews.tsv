Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/9/2012 12:19:53 PM	This was the fasting acting medication I have ever use to treat my migraine.
Migraine Headache	Headache sufferer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	8/15/2012 10:21:57 PM	I have been taking Maxalt for a couple years now. Generally it starts to loosen the headache within 10-20 minutes and in most cases my migraine is gone within an hour.  If my migraine is full-blown, its too late and will not work.  Lately, I am having some side effects the rest of the day or the next. I feel very tired, weak, and droopy. Almost like after having the flu.  Not sure if I will move on to a preventative med. I find cervical chiropractic works well too.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	8/3/2012 9:53:30 PM	About an hour after taking Maxalt Mlt, I started experiencing hallucinations, uncontrollable emotions, muscle twitching, fever, hot/cold flashes. My three day migraine went away within an hour of taking the medicine. Would consider using Maxalt again (now knowing what to expect when taking it).

My migraines generally lasted 6-8 hours of intense pain, then gradually subsided. I have tried other medications including imitrex, but they were not effective. Maxalt works but only if taken upon very first symptom. I generally have a mild headache, but can function. This medication changed my life.  What a relief.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/20/2012 7:39:47 PM	Maxalt is a lifesaver.  I would say it has relieved my headaches in less than 30 minutes well over 90 percent of the time. No complaints whatsoever.

Finally, in 2007, after a lot of trials and errors, my doctor put me on Maxalt MLT. After being given this medication, I was amazed at how fast it worked! Occassionally I will get very tired after taking the medication, but it is better than hurting!

I take it when I feel a migraine coming on, and within an hour (usually less), the headache is completely gone! In the past, my migraines were so bad that I would have severe sensitivity to light/sound, accompanied with vomiting, which made it hard to keep other pills down. This one dissolves on your tongue and is ridiculously fast-acting.

Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/25/2011 3:40:28 PM	I have tried numerous medications to help treat my severe migraines(the ones that put me to bed, in solid darkness, with nausea and vomiting!). Maxalt is the ONLY pill that has treated my migraines and allowed me to get back to work. Other medications that I have tried that may work for you are: Depakote, Topamax, Imitrex, and Bupap.

Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/24/2011 4:49:06 PM	This is the best migraine treatment i ever used. I almost always throw up when I get a migraine so it is hard to swallow pills. These are easy since they dissolve and also work pretty quick. Make me a little drowsy but helps me get rest long enough for the headach to go away. Get my meds through the Va and upset because they don't carry it. I loved it though.

Approx. 15 years ago, my PCP decided to concentrate on migraine relief. I tried many different things, but a combo of Paxil &amp; Nortriptyline finally reduced my migraines from 2-3 PER WEEK down to 1-2 per month. Journalling my episodes provided essential tracking. During all of this, I was using Excedrin with marginal success, for my migraines. I then tried Imitrex with zero success. At some point, MaxAlt MLT-10 became available &amp; my PCP handed me a bag full of samples to try. A few days later, right on schedule, I had my next migraine. I took 1 MaxAlt MLT &amp; 30 mins. later it was gone. Not just gone, but as if it had never happened!! Over the past many years, I have continued using MaxAlt &amp; it has never failed to vanquish even my most severe migraines! I'm sure many of you know what I'm talking about when I say I've awakened in the midst of a migraine so severe that I spent hours vomiting. Since MaxAlt dissolves on the tongue, vomiting does not reduce it's effectiveness much. I have had to take a second dose on a very few episodes, but it has always been effective within 30-60 mins. MaxAlt has literally saved my life by allowing me to work a steady FT position without constantly calling in sick due to my severe, crippling migraines. 
Migraine Headache	keri, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	1	2	Female	25-34	8/31/2010 4:55:10 PM	I have been suffering from migraines for almost 1 year now.  I have been on a wide varitety of meds to include blood pressure meds and elavil, none of which helped.  My doctor keeps me stocked with samples of Maxalt MLT, most of the time I take two doses 1 hour apart at the first sign of my migraine and still have to resort to the narcartics or end up at the ER.  I am picking up Imitrex in the morning so we shall see how that works.  I don't recommend this med.
Migraine Headache	mbrown, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/7/2010 9:43:03 PM	I've had migraines nearly all my life. About four years ago they got to the point that I had to do something about it. There were times when I would spend most of the day in bed. My doctor prescribed Maxalt and it turned out to be a life changer. If taken early enough with onset of symptoms, my migraine is usually gone within a hour with little pain. If I wait too long, it will take about two hours before I notice relief.
Migraine Headache	alexis, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	6/25/2010 9:47:07 PM	I have recently began to have severe migrains, and this is the first drug prescribed to me, i find that it doesn't help. i still have to take several Excedrin Migrain pills. And i seem to be getting even more migrains.

My doctor gave me some samples of this medication and at my first migraine symptoms, I took one and dissolved it and less than half an hour later the migraine was gone!! I was so excited! I recommend this medicine highly to anyone who has ever had failure with other medicines for migraines!

Migraine Headache	detroit , 55-64 Male  (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	55-64	1/4/2010 7:48:40 PM	Started taking maxalt for migraines. In the beigning it was great but I started having rebound headaches. A lot of rebound headaches (migraines). I stopped maxalt all together. Wow! what a difference. My migraines are now far and few between. Beware that maxalt is also bad for your heart. If I have a migraine now I take midrine but that's rare. Other side effect maybe reduced strength of erections.
Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/30/2009 1:40:52 PM	I have tried multiple migraine medications with little or no effect. One dose of this medication and less than an hour the migraine was gone and after 3 days the headache is just now beginning to return.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	12/6/2009 6:48:28 PM	I have been using this drug to treat my migraines for over a year. When I get an aura I take maxalt and 1000 mg of pain reliever, and then I go straight to bed if I am able to. I still get a lot of pain however, my migraines only last a couple of hours instead of a whole day or more. I do get some side effects such as, tightness in jaw, I'll get prickling sensations most often on my forehead (I'm not sure whether this is from the medicine or the aura), and when I wake up after my nap I am always extremely 'loopy,' and this can last throughout the following day as well.  However, I highly recommend maxalt since my migraines last only a few hours rather than the entire day, and I would much rather deal with the few side effects than the unbearable pain of a migraine. (I have had 6 migraines in the past 4 weeks, 4 of them in the past 2 weeks)
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/27/2009 12:04:46 AM	I take Inderal as a migraine preventative, but when one strikes I go straight to the Maxalt. Stops my migraines whether I take it at onset or when the migraine is full blown. Takes about 30-45 min. to take effect and usually makes me pretty drowsy. A quick nap helps. Thankfully, I've had no side effects. This has been a lifesaver for me. My migraines used to happen 2-4 times a week and sometimes last for several days. My family is equally glad to have me back.

Migraine Headache	jcrunningbrook, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	10/27/2009 12:47:28 PM	My migranes have been high in frequency lately.  I woke up out of a dead sleep with a full blown aura.  I couldn't find my Imitrex so I was forced to use Maxalt MLT from my daughters stash.  I am SO GLAD that happend.  Imitrex never really took the migrane pain away.  I suffer from really bad migranes.  I will spend the day in the ER if I don't get meds, my blood pressure drops, and I am in severe pain (I would rather be in labor with no pain reliever!)Maxalt so far, which is twice, has COMPLETLY taken the migrane away, it's so awesome!  I don't really get any side effects.  Maybe a little air headed but my migrane does that to me also.  The only thing I have noticed is my aura's are different.  I don't know if that because of the maxalt or my body (I am getting more than usual) - My last auro started in one eye, went to both then went into the other eye and ended - very scary.  I love Maxalt so far, it's truly a God send.  The ONLY problem is the packaging is really hard to open, when you can't see due to an aura espcially.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/18/2009 1:37:31 AM	Maxalt is a true God-send for me. I started it in high school when my migraines were getting really bad. One morning I woke up crying cause of the pain, and my mom opened my bedroom door, letting all the light pout in, I screamed it hurt so much. That was the first time I took Maxalt. I took the pill and laid back down, managing to get a bit of sleep. I woke up an hour later feeling completly better and back to normal. It works every time and has no side effects for me. It's an amazing PRN migraine med and I reccomend it to anyone who gets migraines. 
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	10/16/2009 1:52:59 PM	When taken at the very onset Maxalt will kick the migraine quickly.  If you let it linger it may take while to take affect.  I suggest taking a nap right after taking it seems to work better for me.

Sometimes I have to take more than one, but I get very severe migraines.  This has been the best treatment other than DHE protocol.

SO A COUPLE DAYS LATER I TOOK MY FIRST DOSE OF THE MAXALT-MLT, AND IT WORKED AGAIN WITHIN MINUTES, BUT I HAD ALL THE SIDE EFFECTS, I WAS A SLEEP AT WORK, I WAS SLURRING MY SPEECH, I FELT LIKE I WAS ALL DOPEY, I JUST HOPE THE NEXT TIME I TAKE THIS THE EFFECT ARE NOT AS BAD.
Migraine Headache	mk-clt, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	25-34	8/18/2009 2:19:42 PM	Within a week of being prescribed a sample of the presecription, I had a bad headache come up that I could tell if I didnt take care of it would turn into a full out migraine. It was one of those headaches that I woke up with and sometimes first cup of coffee does the trick, but not this time. So I took the disolvable losenge, and the headache continued to persist. I definitely had the diziness side effect. 2 hours later nasuea set in and I threw up, with a good amount of blood in the vomit. I am allergic to asprin and my stomach is very sensitive to it. So it must have something in it that set me off. Needless to say the medicine did not work and my headache went from bad to much-much worse. My doctor has now switched me over to Frova, going to pick that up today - we'll see how well that works.I was originally on Midrin, which is no longer available. Midrin used to work wonders, but the alternative did not.

It is still not 100% effective for me, but when it does work it's like a magic spell. It tastes like candy and a couple of minutes later I feel like a brand new person. I have used zolmitriptan (Zomig) nasal spray for several years with similar results and tried sumatriptan (Imitrex), alprazolam (Xanax), amitriptyline (Elavil), topiramate (Topamax) all with no response. Maxalt-MLT is the best so far but the packaging is ridiculously wasteful and difficult to transport.

I have taken Imitrex, Zomig, Topamax, migriten, and nasal sprays.  Hate the sprays and after taking the others I felf like I had lead in my body.  This medication helped me instantly and I was able to stay at work.  I hate missing work and feeling miserable at home with these freaking migraines.  I am so happy my dr was able to give me something that has worked fast and didn't taste bad.  Whoo-hoo!

The pain is so bad that I am completely useless and have to go to bed in a dark, cool room for hours.    I am so gratefull each and every day that my doctor asked me to try this drug.  I use the 10mg melt away tab.  It generally stops the migraine cold...in it's tracks within 15 to 20 minutes. Sometimes I feel a bit drowsy but have otherwise felt no other side effects.Maxalt gave me my life back!!

It did not help my migraine at all, and after taking it, I was nauseous the rest of the day (which I don't get with migraines). I don't think I will be taking this medication anymore.
Migraine Headache	thanful, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	12/20/2008 6:21:59 AM	Being a military member I don't like using something that will make me drowsy while being deployed.  I usually take Motrin so now that I am on leave I have used this for the first time last night.  I was shocked with-in 10 minutes that the migraine was practically gone.  By this morning it is gone and I feel refreshed.  It did not make me sleepy at all and now I am ready for some well deserved time with my family for some fun holiday time.  I have used Zomig and it just did not work, this is only thing that has worked besides the 800mg of Motrin.  I highly suggest using this product if you have migraines.  I really wish this was available to me 10 years ago!!
Migraine Headache	lynn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/9/2008 3:59:23 PM	I am a 32 year old female and I have been taking maxalt for about 2.5 years now.  In the beginning it worked great. I only needed 1 dose to quickly relieve my severe migranes.  I now sometimes will need to take the the 2 doeses and a 600-800 mg motrin for relief. I hope I am not getting use to the medication or maybe my migranes are just getting wrose.  Overall, I am very pleased with this medication and the side effects are minimal for me.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	12/6/2008 8:20:39 PM	I have migraines quite frequently and have never taken anything other than tyleno and excedrin.  Once those medicines stopped having any effect, I began taking Maxalt-MLT and the relief was instant.  Also, my migraines seem to have lessened in occurances.  Not sure if these are related but I'm thankful for the relief.

I can only take it 3 times a week, however and I oftern have more headaches a week than that. But I like the fact I can take it without water. I have a tendency to take it earlier at the beginning of a headache since I don't have to stop what I'm doing and get water to take a pill with.

Migraine Headache	Renee999, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/9/2008 11:03:29 PM	I have been using Maxalt for about 6 months for my hormonal headaches occurring once a month for 2-5 days.  Most times it works in 1-2 hours if I take it at onset.  Once I had to take 3 doses to get complete relief.  I don't like the taste either but for the result it's worth it.  I sometimes feel very tired and heavy after the headache, I don't know if it's a side effect of the drug or the headache.

At first I didn't think it worked, but for me, it kicks in about 2 hours after I take it.  When I had a migraine before, I would be down for the day, but with Maxalt, I know it will work after those first two hours.  Also, about the price, if you contact Merck, they may send samples (like they did with me) or help you pay for it with a doctor's RX.  Bless all you other sufferers.  I hope you find something to help!

It has worked very well for me.  After a week on the medication I am down to 1 spell and take only a half pill at the first ping of an attack.  This medication works fast and has very few side affects.

This is the first time I have ever been able to find something that will take my migraine headaches away. Before they would last for 3 weeks at a time now I take a Maxalt and go. The taste does not bother me either.
Migraine Headache	sttorm99, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/13/2008 5:51:57 AM	A LIFE SAVER!!!... ive taken this for years and am greatful for useing it. i used imatrex and built up a tollerance for it, besides the rare occasion, 1 tablet usually helps me (its taken up to 3 tablets somtimes to stop some). ive just started getting heart flutters and havent put the two together till ive read these comments. but im VERY willing to have those over a migraine any day! my insurance only covers so many a month, but i've had to spend several days several times in the hospital for migraines, so the insurance uped my doseage alloyance. p.s. i like the flavor
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	4/18/2008 4:13:48 PM	I've tried Imitrex and Frova and this medication works the best. Takes my hormonal migraine away every time. I get migrains twice a month that for 2-5 days in a row. Maxalt works faster if I take it at the onset of a migraine.  The only thing that concerns me is muscle and joint pain that I have noticed gradually coming on since I started Maxalt about a yr ago.  Seems to be worse the day after taking Maxalt. It doesn't seem to be a common side affect so I don't know what to make of it.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/3/2008 11:55:18 PM	LOVE this med! I recently started to take a med to prevent my migraines or else I get an average of 2-3 a week, so thankfully they're not as frequent. When I get one, however, I reach for the Maxalt with the first signs and symptoms. I love that I can take this pill anywhere, and have to come not to mind the chalky taste over the last couple years I have had this medication. Nothing but the maxalt works for me, and I'm so thankful for it. It is expensive even with insurance, but worth it for me because of how well it works. I tell friends who get migraines to try it, because it's the best stuff out there. I'm lucky enough not to get side effects from it- no fatigue, which is great because I need to take it at work sometimes.  Defiantly recommend it 1--%. 
Migraine Headache	Bonnie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	4/1/2008 9:17:10 PM	It's been a hit or miss with this medicine.  I felt like I was hit by a car the day after I took the medicine.  I'm sore all over and my joints ache.  I too get migraines when the weather changes and I feel terrible.  But this is better than nothing.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/30/2008 5:10:32 PM	After getting quite ill taking Imitrex and finding that Excedrin Migraine didn't quite cut it, I tried this medication.  I had very fast results each time I took it, with only one dose.  The migraine was pretty much gone, or at least very bearable.  The only side effects I experienced were fatigue and racing heartbeat.  But they were tolerable compared to the migraine pain.

Migraine Headache	UGA, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	2/23/2008 10:21:12 PM	  I have just started taking this medicine. I am very pleased with my initial use of Maxalt. The taste is not that bad and it started working witihin fifteen minutes. For me, it worked better than Imitrex. But, it is very expensive under my current Insurance Plan.

Migraine Headache	KimWinn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/26/2007 4:29:54 PM	After trying Imitrex and Axert, I have found this to be the medicine to help me.  The others made me sick to my stomach and I am very pleased to have found a medication that works well for me.  I know that every headache and every person is different, but if your doctor recommends this, pleae give it a try.  It may be just what you've been looking for.
Migraine Headache	SarahMiller, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	12/24/2007 8:55:44 PM	very bad taste. like a latex cloved soaked in spearmint. i've had to take it every 2 hours even if i do catch the migraine early on.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	12/20/2007 4:44:31 PM	This medication worked for me at first, but I seemed to build up a tolerance to it after a while. 
Migraine Headache	Dee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/4/2007 5:19:26 PM	The taste is a bit bad, but since it's quick desolving, it's over quickly.  It helps me in a matter of minutes if I catch it at the beginning of the migraine.  Would recommend to someone with migraines, especially helpful with the light sensativity and nausea.
Migraine Headache	Shannon, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	13-18	11/27/2007 5:25:13 PM	Easy tp take, except for the aftertaste. It takes several hours for it to kick in, but it does work. Its not effective unless you take it at the start of the migrane; taking it in the middle will not help you at all. 
Migraine Headache	Laina, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	5	4	Female	19-24	11/19/2007 4:59:39 AM	LOVE IT. It doesn't do anything if the headache isn't a migraine, but when a bad migraine hits, this gets rid of it fairly quickly. It tends to make me a bit drowsy after I take it, but it's worth it to be rid of the migraine 
Migraine Headache	shitch,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female		11/9/2007 8:02:22 PM	I have found that in most of my migraine attacks Maxalt-MLT has work wonderful for me. It is the most easiest and convenient medication I have taken for my migraine. It has been a life safer for me when the attacks have come on at work and there is no need for water to ingest the tablet; just let it dissolve on your tongue and let it do its job! JUST WONDERFUL

Migraine Headache	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	10/26/2007 5:03:10 PM	Have taken for several years. Leaves a lingering unpleasant taste.  Now stops the headache after one dose about 75% of the time. Initially it stopped the headache 95% of the time with a single dose.

This is the most success I have had with all the many drugs I have tried. No side effects at all. I wish it had not taken so many years to find it!!!
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	10/12/2007 12:02:50 PM	it made me extremely nauseous for hours and my migraine never went away.  I took the medicine again, following what my neurologist had told me, and still no luck.
