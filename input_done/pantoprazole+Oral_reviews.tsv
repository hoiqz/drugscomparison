If i take it at the beggining of the day i stay hungry. also it is very important to take it 30 min before eating or else u will see very little results.

Prevacid worked fine at 30mg for the past 7 years, but this med is junk. I take 40mg everyday like instructed and I still experience heartburn followed with stomach aches and diarreha. I have also noticed in increase in stomach pain that seems to be contstant on both sides as well as gas pressure buildup. I wish my Dr. would just put me back on Prevacid that worked better and I had very few days a month where I didn't feel well compared to feeling sick on almost a regular daily basis. I have been on this for a half a year and have not found any relief.

I just suffered a severe reaction after getting a refill.  I found my iniitial prescription said Pantoprazole 40mg tab KRE and the new refill said Pantoprazole 40 mg tab DR.  The pills look totally different and apparently the ingredients are not the same much to my misfortune.  Be careful and check you pills when you pick up your new prescription.

I must say that it works very well if you take it everyday. I have tried to get off from it and try other medicines but they didn't work. I am so glad that I found something that helps ne. I have suffered for years with a persistant cough after I eat. This medicine helps relieve my cough. I never have any side effects from this medication.

I am concerned now after reading reviews of weakness and hip pain (which I have) and I'm wondering if its caused by this drug. Coincidentally, those symptoms seemed to start when I began taking this drug regularly.

Recently my insurance company, Aetna, changed the generic I was taking to one manufactured by &quot;Dr Reddys&quot;.  It smells very foul and tastes worse.  My symptoms are back with a vengence.  I called Aetna to complain but, of course their motto is Profit Before Patient Well Being.  I have now called my doctor to change the prescription and will have to pay for Protonix.  I am going to report Dr Reddys (corporate headquarters in INDIA) to the FDA, not that it will help.  Those of you having problems with pantoprazole drugs should look into the manufacturer, that is probably the issue.

I've been on Pantoprazole for about three years now and it has lost it's effectiveness. First started noticing decline in effectiveness about three months ago and getting much worse at an increasingly faster rate. Old symptoms have returned: excessive belching, extreme heartburn, intestinal gas. Taking an extra Pantoprazole helps for about one hour then symptoms return. Will try to get back on Protonix if insurance allows. Tried many meds in past but Protonix was flawless! Pantoprazole just isn't a true replacement for Protonix. Insurance companies know this but their bottom line is most important to them! Too bad for us!
Other	thewahoo76, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	55-64	7/2/2011 3:27:10 PM	I think my regular doctor, who I saw first, made a misdiagnosis due to a machine they used to look for pancreatitis and sent me to the hospital.  In the hospital, the attending said I didn't have pancratitis did not listen to me at all.  I mentioned again at the hospital that I needed help with constipation.  He gave me some other pills for upper digestive track issues...  but nothing for the constipation.  It was an awful 12 hours for nothing.  I finally bought Florastor after leaving the hospital, and it worked.  What's wrong with these doctors...  and machines out of calibration.  I have most of the Pantoprazole in the closet.

This drug works great for me, I've never taken Protonix though, don't know if it would make any difference.

I have never been on any OTC acid reducer or Rx. This med cured me within 6 - 8 weeks. I still occasionally have episodes that require me to use the med for a week or two. Last year BCBS would not authorize me to get the name brand (Protonix) but I was able to get this generic. This med is worthless. I agree with many users here, that this is nothing like Protonix. It was non-effective. Thankfully BCBS will now authorize me to use the name brand, Protonix, now that I have given this generic drug a chance. I have a $35 co-pay for 30 days, and -0- co-pay with this one and I much rather pay for the Protonix. My pharmacist told me that Wyeth does not make the generic, now I understand why it doesn't work the same. Run from this one.

Vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, thirst, problems swallowing, sleeping and much more.  Husband says I have food poisoning but after reading reviews I am sure it is side effects from this medication.  After being up all night vomiting I did not take it the next day and felt better but then took the following day and was nausious with diarrhea again that night.  Have not taken today and am feeling better but far from well.  Have not been able to eat anything and can drink very little.  I really need to get this stuff out of my system and never take again.  Thanks for all the help and knowledge in reviews.  I truly believe my problems are caused by the meds and NOT food poisoning.

Took it for a week and had absolutely the most side affects ever. Headaches, chills, extreme cramping in my legs. Didn't even do anything for my acid-reflux, GERD and Barretts Esophagus. I know everyone reacts differently to meds but for me this drug should be banned.

Everyday I had a burn that compared to an eruption at Mt St. Helen. This medication stopped the burn after 1 day. I do have some dizziness and some moderate headaches but it is not unbearable. I will take the trade off for a month. No signs of hair loss yet.

Other	edenshaw, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	7/23/2009 1:54:24 AM	I thought, in the beginning, that the drug was working, but little did I know the side effects that was building up.  In a short amount of time, maybe two weeks or less, I became so constipated I thought I was going to explode.  It was horrible.  I have read nothing but negative comments about Protonix or Pantoprazole. If you can get your doctor to write prescription for somthing else, something safer, PLEASE, DO IT!!!

Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female		6/28/2009 8:18:33 PM	After years of treatment effectiveness with Aciphex for Acid Reflux, had to try Pantaprazole because Insurance company refused to pay for Aciphex any more. After only 4 days, complete constipation resulted, misery. How convenient for the insurance companies that Aciphex or anything else that really works, is out of the financial range for the people who really need it for the Acid Reflux. They documented in my records that I have tried everything else but Pantoprazole without success, and my Gastroenterologist verified that I need this drug for the Acid Reflux, have been taking it since the late 80's  the insurance company refuses to pay. And Pantaprazole even has the nerve to write in their handouts from the drug store that you can take AN ANTACID WITH IT IF YOU NEED TO. If antacids worked, we would not need the drugs! they are fooling around with an ailment that can cause cancer, do they not know that?

I have not had one eppisode with reflux or heart burn of any kind.  As for some people saying that they have had bowl issues I have some extreme cramping and diarrhea but never thought to link it to this medication.  Maybe I need to monitor it more.  But, overall I am totally impressed.

I would not recommend this drug to anyone and am still suffering from side effects after several hours of taking this medication.

Other	 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female		7/6/2008 1:32:39 AM	I was originally taking Protonix since 2006. Now since early March, the insurance company will only pay for the generic. Just a few weeks ago, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure, which I never have had EVER. One of the main ingredients in this med is SODIUM, which may be a contributing factor to my recent dilemma. I will be calling the pharmacist to verify what has happened to me, and possibly seeking legal assistance due to my ill health now.

I've had no ill side effects.  Stomach acid is still gone, have had nothing but wonderful results.  If you have acid and gas even after taking this as prescribed, there's probably another issue with your intestines or stomach you should have checked out.

I just stopped taking it &quot;cold turkey&quot; yesterday.  My chiropractor gave me enzymes and H-acid activators to use after each meal.  I already feel better.  Miss the Protonix, but not the price.  Eat smaller portions, avoid caffine, spice, fried foods, try not to drink with your meal, etc.  Still feel a bit of heat in my upper stomach area, but have more energy also and am more alert.
