I'm supposed to take the full dose, but it makes my heart pound in my chest. I feel unable to wake up the next day, too.

Hiccups that are Hard to Cure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/20/2010 5:41:44 PM	My husband has had 2 surgeries in the past 10 years and got hiccups after both of them.  The first surgery's hiccups lastest 3 days off and on, mostly on.  I called the surgeon and he immediately called in oral Thorazine for him...one dose stopped them.  His second surgery, he was unable to take Thorazine due to a potential interaction with another drug he had already been given.  They tried Reglan, but it only helped for a few hours and the hiccups came back.  This problem after surgery is thought to be from a sensitive phrenic nerve...the diaphragm is irritated by the anesthesia gas and can cause the person to have hiccups for days... Hope this info helps someone else!

My hiccups lasted 2-3 days before going to ER for this med.  Have had them on and off for 20 years and this dosage always works for me.  I get the hiccups on average every 2-3 years.
