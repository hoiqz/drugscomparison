Now that I'm having to move both my elbow and wrist I'm in worse pain than before.  While waiting to hear back from the Orthopedists office I started taking 1500mg of OTC Acetaminophen  every 3 to 4 hours.  Both during the scrip and especially now on the OTC, my stomach hurts!  Everything I've read says it shouldn't cause stomach upset.  I cut back to 1000mg every 4 hours but still have a sour stomach.  I can not take NSAIDS due to being on daily anti-inflammatories for arthritis.I've taken a few doses at a time over many years for back pain or headaches, but never had this sour stomach.

Head Pain	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	10/10/2009 1:13:19 AM	Acetaminophen does nothing for my headaches. It's good for fevers, and that's about it.  It does not help swelling go down like aspirin or IB. AND acetaminophen is NOT as safe as most people think it is!!  If you take it a lot it causes liver damage and ulcers (that's holes in your stomach people!).  If you take it with alcohol it causes liver damage so don't take it to prevent a hangover.  If you take it in high doses for a long time it can worsen arthritis when you get older.  Just some warnings since people seem to think they can use as much as they want.

In the evening, at bedtime, I take Tylenol PM, to ease pain and promote a less-interrupted sleep experience. I take half the recommended maximum, of 8 units/day (4). On occasion, after an extended period of physical effort, may may need to increase the frequency of my current dosage.  I have not had any after-effects from acetomenephin, which I am limited to because of my taking og a prescribed blood-thinner(Cumidin), for mild Atrial Arytmia.

My cousin developed Lupus which eventually cleared upon stopping the use of this drug. And I myself was taking it for joint and muscle pain, my dad has rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune diseases run rampant on his side of the family, and I believe that the use of Acetaminophen exacerbated my symptoms and was the cause of my developing erythema nodosum. I stopped taking the Tylenol and in a little more than a month my symptoms subsided, and I could walk again. I'm not 100% sure that the Tylenol caused my condition, (pretty sure)however, I just wanted to throw this out there so that anyone this may apply to can speak with their Dr. and discuss the possibility of such reactions. Take care everyone.

I've found that it actually CAUSED me to have migranes even though this is supposed to lessen pain. I also experienced vision changes. Unless this drug is coupled with codeine (such as with Tylenol 3) I've found it to cause more problems than it gets rid of.

I had previously tried it for headaches without success as well but was willing to use it when I hurt my back, however experienced several days of suffering due to my willingness to &quot;give it a try&quot;. As a R.N. I know this drug is widely used for pain and fever control. For fever it is very effective, it however does not live up to its reputation for pain control for me and also for many many of my patients. A sad disappointment all these years. I have found for myself that plain old aspirin works better but am also aware of the dangers with that drug where other patients may not be.

Fever	Yayagirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	9/18/2007 12:22:26 AM	Tylenol is the only OTC pain reliever/fever reducer that I can use now that I have had gastric bypass surgery. NSAIDs are too harsh on the revised gut structure of a Roux en Y patient. It has been three years since my surgery and I have relied completely on Tylenol for relief of headache pain. I also take the Tylenol PM product after a particularly rough physical day when I have body aches and need help falling asleep. It does the trick every time. I rely on Tylenol.

Sometimes I would have to take it upon awakening or even during the day, but I really needed it at night. I was disappointed that its action didnt last longer. But I continued to use Tylenol; because I thought it was probably the safest thing to do to treat the pain, even though I sometimes had to take it several times throughout the day. I never went over the recommended daily dosage. Now, however, my doctor wont let me use it at all. She was concerned about its affect on my liver function and had me stop it completely. My liver function tests have stabilized since I stopped taking the Tylenol. I now take Aleve. It takes fewer doses, lasts longer and hasnt caused the problems with my liver.

Plus, I believe there is a rebound effect to consider; the more you take the more the need for it builds, thereby losing its effectiveness.So, after taking more than the label advised for many years to combat the pain, I slowly weaned myself off of it.  Now I use relatively little (2-3 Extra Strength Tylenol per night) to take just the edge off the pain and because I no longer overuse it, what little I take is more helpful.  (I have chosen to not otherwise use medication to treat my Fibromyalgia pain, instead relying on exercise and other lifestyle choices.)I'm also aware that Tylenol is processed through the liver so I avoid drinking alcohol when using it, which means most of the time.
