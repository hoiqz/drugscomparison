The one thing I want to put on this review is that DO NOT take yourself off the drug because you feel nothing! I understand you are not feeling anything because I was there you are reteaching yourself how to feel what thoes feelings are that you are experiencing. The reason you have these problems is your brain cant differentiate between the transmitters its been under heavy stress give it time. I have had to relearn what it feels like to cry, laugh, to be angry, and even embaressed. 
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/24/2012 9:18:00 PM	This has worked amazing for me, been on it since I was 17 am now 20 at a dose of 375, 6 months ago I was reduced to 300, withdrawal symptoms were quite bad for 2 months, all the suicidal tendencies and depression returned and then I was fine, I'm being reduced to 225 in a few days and I'm not looking forward to the withdrawal symptoms but at least now I know it will only last for so long, I would warn anyone before going on them, they do work amazingly but are extremely difficult to come off and you will have to eventually, I'm also on seroquel and epilim chrono.

Weight gain since they up the dose to the max. Ive gained 20 lbs. in 3 months without changing anything. I was wondering if anyone else has been having sweating since they have been taking it. Its a all over body sweating.

Depression	katheryn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	8/13/2012 9:17:45 AM	What I don't understand is all the reviews about STOPPING this drug.  I guess if it's not working for you, you should stop taking it (under close medical supervision), but several of the reviewers admit it helps them, then talk about the withdrawl symptoms..  Not real sure why you stop taking a drug that works for you?  Depression is not like an infection -- you aren't &quot;cured&quot; by taking a few doses.  If you had high blood pressure, you wouldn't stop taking blood pressure medicine just because it came down while you were on it, would you?  I have been on this for years and it works for me. I would be a basket case without it.  I was fat to start with, so I guess I didn't notice if I gained weight after I started it. I just know I am a much better person inside my head with it than without it. 
Depression	nancyharr, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/12/2012 5:09:47 PM	It went to work immediately for me. No more episodes of anxiety like I was having before.No depression symptoms that effect my daily life either. IT WORKS!
Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Male	35-44	8/12/2012 10:56:02 AM	I have been taking Effexor 75 mg for 6 weeks for depression. It seems to not only take away the depression, but all emotion. I don't care about anyone, anything, have fits if rage, and no sexual desire. After reading all these comments, I have decided to take myself off of this drug, I am worried about side effects, however,I would rather be depressed than feel nothing. Wish me luck:)
Bipolar Depression	Donna, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	8/10/2012 10:59:41 AM	Got off of Paxil for sexual side effects.  Effexor eliminated that problem, but is not as effective for anxiety.  I recently asked my psychiatrist to get me off Effexor, and he said withdrawals were difficult.  Now afraid.  I had benzo withdrawal and it was awful.  Guess I am stuck.
Depression	k_star, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	8/8/2012 2:25:37 PM	Began taking this when I was 17 for depression. I had no side effects going on to the drug. Started at 75mg and worked up to 150mg. I'm assuming it worked because I didn't have those scary, terrible feelings. I'm 24 now and slowly came off the drug through a compound formula (literally all the way down to 2.5mg). The drug is extremely hard to come off of - very, very bad withdrawl symptoms. Wish I had known it would be this bad before going on it. The withdrawl has been just as bad as my depression ever was. Watch out.
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	SO Very Sad, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	8/7/2012 4:59:48 PM	I starting taking medication for PTSD. I whole reason I tried the med was becuase I wanted to feel normal again, well it seems that all this time I've been feel like a black hole might be in part from the Effexor XR. I couldn't cry, i didn't want to be with my husband, I have been very mean to people and really just kinda blank on the inside. So after being put on a different brand I started to see the little pods from the in of the capsule in my stool. At first I thought it was just me then it happened again. I decided to stop taking the effexor and BOY was that a BAD idea. For the past week I have been have the most real feeling Nightmares ever, sweating like crazy at night, can't breathe when I try to run, Arms going numb, Pins and needle feelings in my arms, headaches, allday yuke feeling, swelling, body feeling weak all over, sleeping all the time and now I read it is only the begining, wow it could take week to complete the withdrawal feels&quot; My Lord&quot; I thought I was get ready to die. I went to the ER and everything. This is the WORST drug ever. I am just going natural. I pray I make it through this storm. Oh i forgot the part about the breakout all over my body like painful Acne and hands locking up.  
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Granny Carla, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/6/2012 6:06:53 AM	My experience has always been a very positive one. Taking this medication leaves me feeling calm/at peace without the side effect of feeling drowsey,tired or &quot;medicated&quot;. The only down side I have ever felt is not feeling able to cry when I felt I would normally do so. I won't say I can't cry but it is a rare occurance... as opposed to being something I would have found myself doing often, and with little reason. I am much happier and less &quot;unreasonable&quot; now that I am taking Effexor regularly. I am 60 years old and now only use 37.5m daily. Going without the medication is still not an option for me. I prefer to feel in control of my emotions. I'm still a very excitable, passionate person, that's me. Rather, I am not a panicked, frustrated and impatient individual.

Started on Prozac, then lexapro and the Effexor. Recently I had a major hypertensive issue, BP 211/110. My MD stopped the Effexor and changed me to Celexa. After only 1 week, I feel like a different person. My BP is down, more energy and basically feel like a new person. I didnt realize how bad I felt on Effexor!
Depression	Krissy33, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	8/4/2012 9:35:07 AM	My doctor put me on Effexor XR after my insurance company would no longer let me have Cymbalta. I really didn't like being on it. It made me feel like a zombie-- no emotion or feelings at all. I finally got tired of feeling that way, having no energy, being tired all the time and not having any sexual desire, so I went off it. I got heart palpitations, felt dizzy and unsteady on my feet for about a week. That was definitely no fun but after that, I started feeling much better. I still take my Wellbutrin XL, and I have more energy than I have had in a long time, I'm not nearly as tired and it feels good to desire my husband again. I guess the medicine works for some people but I'm not one of them.
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	55-64	8/2/2012 9:11:58 PM	I have been on this medication for several years.  My dosage is 37.5mg., it works okay, and my daughter also was prescribe this medication.  I started not sleeping well, maybe getting  three or four hours per night, so I thought it probably was the medication, so I started coming off of it, and it has been horrible, I am not going to give into the horrible side effects, but I wish my daughter never started it, and hope this drug will be pull off the market. DON'T TAKE THIS DRUG, NEVER START IT, YOU WILL BE SORRY!
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Lilly, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	7/31/2012 10:44:45 AM	I was prescribed Effexor X-R to treat anxiety. I had hurted myself at work and I couldn't sleep and was feeling anxious. I expressed my concern about taking that type of drugs but was reassured by my doctor that they were not addictive and as soon as I wanted to stop taking them all would be fine. The first first time I tried to stop I could not get out of bed. I was feeling so ill I had to call in sick at work. I spent two days like this. I went back to see him and explained what happened and was told that after a couple days I would be fine. Wrong!! I kept taking the tablets because I could not handle feeling so sick. Even after all this still I was not told that I needed to come off them slowly . When I went back to see him, he was away so I had to see another Dr who gave me a lower dose and explained that I needed to take the lower dose for a while before I could come off them completely. I did this for 2 months and then decided that it was time to stop. Had enough. If I had known what was to come I would have never ,ever listened to my doctor and trusted him. It has been over two months now and I'm still having withdrawal symptoms. The nausea, light headed, heart racing,finding it difficult to concentrate, lack of libido, sudden feelings of sadness or anger, sweating even when it's cold, nightmares, just to name a few. I don't wish my experience with Effexor on my worst enemy.

I think 75mg did not work. went up to 150mg still, a danger to myself. We finally raised it to 300mg.  That helped somewhat. Started Welbutrin with it. had to  work that dosage up to 300mg before any relief. Now I have constipation, lack of sex drive, weight gain, still have the saddness, but no danger to myself. I need to come off it though, because of antichlorestertol med, both act on liver. Since I no longer want to kill myself,and the crying stopped, I need stop. I want to live, so I choose to keep my liver healthy. I guess weaning myself off a little bit at a time, and I will talk to my therapist first. She may not feel it is time yet. Any suggestions on weaning myself off this medication, Effexor XL 300mg po every day,with Welbutrin 300mg po every day.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	7/23/2012 6:59:51 PM	I started taking effexor xr about 2.5 months ago after the other meds i was on made me extrememly sleepy, to the point where i would dose of at work constantly. This med (effexor) worked great for me. I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for 20 yrs and this did the trick. The only problem I have with effexor is that I found out I was pregnant when I went in for surgery and had to stop effexor cold turkey! Not good, do not recomend cold turkey unless dr advises. Withdrawl is pure evil! I have been off effexor for 4 days and still feel almost numb and tingley all over! I feel light headed and dizzy, I feel like my balance is off and only doing it for the wellbeing of my unborn baby! after I give birth I will definately go back on effexor and hope I never have to stop again!!

I regained energy, control of my emotions and relief of my depression.I have tried to get off of it 3 times and could not tolerate the &quot;withdrawal symptoms&quot;.It was originally reasonably priced--now 3 months worth cost me almost $500.00.Can't afford the price but cannot tolerate how I feel without it.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	7/17/2012 3:21:43 PM	After trying 2 other drugs, this one worked right away.  I started on 75mg and worked up to 225mg prescribed by md.  I was feeling great.  This drug really lowered my anxiety about anything.  I think I became a zombie for a while.  I tried getting off this drug and kept lowering the amt I took per day till it was around 37mg every other day and I still couldn't get off due to brain zaps.  Based on other peoples experience, I'm going to try again.  I'm tired of forcing myself to loose weight only to gain it back.  Plus I'm not sure it's doing the job anymore.

I did not feel it was doing any good whatsoever so when  finished with the Tamoxifen, I asked my doctor to switch me back to the other meds. Even with tapering off, smaller doses etc etc, the side effects and WITHDRAWAL symtoms are beyond belief.  What is in this stuff that makes it so addicting? I still am having the horrible withdrawal symptoms and it's been over a month of cutting down.  NO ONE should ever have to go through withdrawal like this ... if it had been an illegal drug then I could justify it, but a drug that is supposed to help depression - ridiculous.  In my opinion this drug should be taken off the market immediately.

I was not myself and it was scary. It does make me a better person to be around than I was previous to taking it.

Wondered if it could be this drug.  It has worked wonders for my mood (depression &amp; change of life symptoms after a heart attack). Only previous problem I had was  nausea/vomiting for the first few days, then nausea only for the next few weeks. Getting concerned about side effects if I ever decide to go off.

Depression	Anony, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	7/8/2012 6:26:06 PM	NIGHTMARE - Oh, yeah, it works, and it is easy to use, but try going off of it after you have gained a ton of weight and it stops working.  You can do a long taper of weeks, months and in some cases years and you will still have horrible side effects.  A year on, and after having to go on another antidepressant because the side effects of withdrawal were so horrible, I am still not feeling right and one of the worst side effects is memory loss.  Do no take this drug.  The Glaxo Smith Kline July 2012 billion dollar settlement is the tip of the iceberg.  That settlement had to do with prescribing for teenagers and off-label uses (lies) - just wait, there will be more if people on the inside continue to whistle-blow.  Meanwhile, there is nothing to help those whose lives have been ruined by this crap. It is as difficult to get off of as heroin but I am not so sure it isn't worse.  No one really knows how or why it &quot;works&quot; - but it works by somehow deadening your feelings. You don't give a damn about anything.  If you ever want to go off of it, plan on tapering and then going crazy anway.

Depression	zzzzzapped, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4		55-64	7/5/2012 6:58:15 PM	I have been on this medication for over 10 years. Weight gain and lack of sex drive seems to be the side effects of all of these SSRI's. It has helped a lot with my major depression. The past 6 months or so, it feel like it has stopped working. Maybe I have been on it too long. I do, however, wonder how any other SSRI will work better since they all basically work the same way. I'll check with my GP and possibly try something else. OR maybe wean myself off of it, which is something that I have been debating fot several years. Time will tell. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	7/3/2012 3:04:48 PM	Before taking this medication,I was depressed and had a very short fuse. I was on prozac for 10 years and did not seem to be working anymore. My doctor put me on 75mg per day and it has been a life changer. I feel somewhat normal again. I dont walk around with my head in the clouds but I am not in a bad mood all the time anymore either. I have had a loss of apetite but that is the only side effect so far.

I alleviated the tired feeling by taking my meds at night and exercising more.  I have tried other meds with equal results.  Might be willing to try something else but the withdrawal effects are awful.  Within 12 hrs of missing a dose, my sinus' start stuffing up.  By 24 hrs out I am nauseated and completely wiped out.  After 36 hours I am vomiting, headache, sleeping constantly, stuffy nose, etc.  Yuck!

It keeps me from getting into a long down mood.I tried Wellbutrin twice, but no help.  Only drawback is a slight delay with sex response, but worth taking drug.  
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	6/23/2012 9:43:01 PM	Yes Effexor is a horrible thing when missed or when trying to come off of it.  I believe that this medication has caused me to feel like I've entered menopause at age 36, NO ONE can touch my ribs or hug me or it will cause pain.  I have gained 50 lbs in the past 5 years.  I feel that I am stuck on this medication!!  I have gone from 112.5 mg to 75 mg I've added Prozac to it now.  I feel great, however I feel like a prisoner at the same time!  I'm thinking I would have been better with out it!

Though I was concerned that I didn't need a medication for depression, I trusted my doctor.  My hot flashes were not as frequent or as intense, but I was still getting them.  Plus the other side affects including weight gain, insomnia, lack of sex drive.  After 2 years I decided I would rather have the hot flashes then the side effects, if a medication is not working for what it was prescribed for, why take it?  My mother and grandmother had hot flashes and they managed to survive without any drugs.  I agree with all the posts about going off of the drug, it has been a hellish journey, and I have done under DRs supervision.  First reduced from 75MG to 37.5, then taking every other day, now I have been off for 2 weeks.  Still experiencing dizziness, brain fog, insomnia, but I am going to hang in there as I know eventually I will comletely detox from this drug.  Please do your homework before you start taking this medication.  I have a family  member taking it for depression/anxiety and it works amazing for her, but I would really think about it before using it for hot flashes only.

Other	lucymason, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	4		55-64	6/21/2012 9:36:40 AM	I have been taking the drug for ADD for ten years.  The other reviews about drug withdrawl are correct:  one cannot just stop, there must be a stepdown period. Times were awful when I allowed myself to run out of the drug, or there was an insurance problem with my reorder.  One or two pharmacists, sympathetic to my plight of being out of the drug and knowing the withdrawl effects, have given me enough meds for a day or two until I could get insurance paperwork straightened out.  Also, according to clinical trial and recommended usage guidelines, this drug is not normally used to treat ADD, so I've had problems getting insurance companies to cover the dosage I use for the purpose for which I use it.  I tried many drugs before settling for this, none were as effective.  The cost is down now that there is a generic formula.

It has been wonderful for me. I was having panic attacks and chest pain that I thought was a heart attack. I was yelling constantly at my children and would have fits of crying. Both my parents suffered from anxiety.  I went on this and a rescue medication. After 3 months I was able to get off the rescue med and continue on this.  I have not had any more panic attacks, or chest pain. I am more patient with my children and my husband loves that I dont get upset at little things like I used to. I am more mellow. The only down side was that it made me sleepy. That diminished after about 3 months.  I keep my pills in a pill strip so that I remember to take on every day. When I forget it gives me horrid headaches.  I know there is a generic now, but I am sticking with the name brand. If you go to the effexor website you can get a card which gives you up to 75.00 off your copay. My insurance charges me over 85.00 a month now because there is a generic, but with the copay card I pay just 10.00 a month.  I was in a horrible place before this medicaion and I dont want to go back there. I hope it continues to work for me.
Depression	 (Patient) 	2	5	2			6/6/2012 6:29:04 PM	I've been on Effexor for years and I am extremely depressed right now.  I think it's time to change antidepressants.

It took over 24 hours before I felt normal again. I should have called 911, but thought that I had vomited all of it out and that I would feel better soon. Wrong! Very scary time. I'll take the hot flashes any time over the nightmare episode with Effexor!

But if I was late taking my dose by just a few hours, the withdrawal would start. I would NOT recommend this drug to ANYONE.

Panic Disorder	cscott, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	5/31/2012 8:03:54 PM	I have been taking this medication for 10 years.  i had to increase my dose 5 years because i would feel dizzy and light headed.  im going on my 10th year now and im having a very hard time sleeping.  i cant fall asleep at night i feels as if my thoughts will not stop.  once i do get to sleep i dont want to wake up.  i have an appointment scheduled with the doctor.  also i know right away if i miss my pill because i get light headed and feel out of my body...i get a headache as well. however these would be some of the problems i have encountered with the medication.  there are so great things about the medication.  my social anxiety has decreased and my depression isnt running my life any longer.  
Depression	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	5/24/2012 12:43:19 PM	I was prescribed Effexor xr by me PCP. I had some improvement but it didn't seem to change much of my symptoms. I finally got in to see a Psychiatrist and he changed my medication, adjusting to lower the Effexor and increasing the new medication. The first reduction from 225mg down to 150mg caused me horrible mental distress and many other problems. The worst was extreme rage which I had to be prescribed another medication for it because I could not control my anger and could not tolerate any kind of emotions I had. Until my Psychiatrist talked to me and I understood it was the medication, I knew I was in for a hard time. It's been 3 months backing off and I'm just now at 75mg this week and have another 6 weeks to go before I can try staying off the Effexor. I think this medication can be helpful for a lot of permanent problems, but I think it's a catch all pill the PCPs prescribe because it's supposed to cover so many problems. I would recommend going to a Psychiatrist to be diagnosed and get on the proper medication the first time. I'll never let a regular doctor diagnose my mental state again. I could have easily not continued my life because I couldn't handle the withdrawals until the Psych DR. put me on the medication to keep the rage under control. Most people I talk to that have taken this medicine have gotten off it because the unbearable problems it causes.

Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	john2007, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	5/16/2012 2:16:26 AM	I am a post trama patient.8 sugeries,7  imobilizers,some braces for months,24/7. My whole family is gone.You have to trust me when I tell you that I have tasted hell. I was wound thighter than a mid-western tornado.I then went to my doctor who is a personal friend,internal medicine/infectious deisease,one of the smartest docs in Ca.He did not hesitate to put me on Effexor and I did not even question him. I`m real again.It has been extreamly beneficial for puting me back into society. Effexor: TRazadon for sleep,meditation,yoga,swimming,biking,workouts,ex ersize is crucial.Quit sitting around the house feeling sorry for yourself,this is just a componding scenerio,life is to short for that.Yes,its hard and I sympathize, beleive me, but its still a gift.Embrace the trails,they will make you stonger.Then suck it up and go have some fun.   Yes there are side effects. Hard to empty my bladder. No problem with erections,ever, but hard to ejaculate sometimes. A little loss of intrest in sex,it just takes someone to get me fired up about it. MY EARS are ringing! Anybody else? I have had some many MRIs in a short period of time that I thought perhaps that might be part of the ear problem.My doctors says the only way to know is to go off of effexor, but there is no way I am ready.On a final note. After reading all the Horror stories about effexor withdrawal, I asked my doc, (who has weined me off of oxicontin,percocet,zanax,alcohol)and asked him about the withdrawal, and he said &quot; DO NOT TAKE MORE THAN 37.5 Mil out of your perscription in a two week period if not longer and then another 37.5 for two more weeks and so on. I am here to tell you all that is a SLOW process or your going to be hating freaking life if you try and go cold turkey on any med., not to mention you could have a seizure!Ahh, excuse me, but what part of talking to your doctor first before stopping this drug don`t you guys understand&gt;?    I hope everyone finds peace in their lives. Be well.

Through counseling  and a psyciatric examine I been found to have GAD.  I was using the alcohol to help cope.  Since taking the drug I have had no desire to drink and I am much calmer.  It does make make me tired but I can deal with that over being drunk and stressed all the time.

I dont feel numb or any of the other things i have been reading about.  in fact i still feel my feelings just not intense like they were.  my mind still races like normal about everything and jumps from subject to subject.  wonder if there is something for that?

However my husband and I have been talking about having children and I have been told by my doctor not to have kids because of this drug and thats a hard pill to swallow. otherwise this drug works.

I feel better then I have in years. I came from being miserable all the time to having a good attitude most of the time. Had anger issues, gone. Had a drug abuse problem, gone. Had panic disorder, gone. Now this drug wasn't the complete solution to my mental health issues I also was in intense outpatient treatment for nine weeks. CBT is extremely helpful in understanding yourself and developing coping skills. Any further questions: juvannorees@gmail.com

You tell them a 'Brain surge' or like power surge in your head. They say there is no such thing. so basically your stuck with a drug that makes you feel weird.

The side effects are horid.  My insurance company would no longer pay for Cymbalta without being on Effexor SR or the generic equivalent for 30 and then a complete review as to why Effexor SR doesn't cut the mustard. The sides effects are bad, bad, bad.  I am only experiencing nausea beyond belief to the point that I am not able to work.  I constantly feel hot mouth at my jaw (you know the oh my god, I am going to hurl hot mouth?) and then it is all I can do to focus on not hurling.I've already left a message for my physician advising that the generic stinks to high heaven.

Except when my idiot psychiatrist &quot;forgot&quot; to call in my March script and I was forced to stop taking my meds COLD TURKEY one day. I have suffered the withdrawal off of such a powerful medication and have been continuing to withdraw as of this writing.Where's the American Medical Association when I need them?

I have Dystonia Episodes even if Im a few hours late taking this drug. I also had a Gran Mal Seizure when I missed a dose. I am so afraid off getting off this medicine. I see that Im not the only one going thru this. Im so sorry to those out there who are suffering from the effects of Effexor XR. Please do not attempt to stop using Effexor with out  Doctor supervision!

So I know I need it. No other side effects as of yet and I hope not to get any.
Depression	JJPet, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/4/2012 10:59:30 AM	This was the 5th drug I have tried in the SSRI/SNRI class. When I tried Effexor, I had finally decided to consult with a psych. I had a similar reaction to all of these drugs, but my one time 18 mg. dose of Effexor was the worst; my body got the warm, tingly sensation, loss of coordination, hard to concentrate, hard to swallow, extreme head ache, body shakes, vomiting, no sleep for 2 days. I only took it one day, and three days later, my head is still pounding. Where as my internist had suggested that I stick with these symptoms for a week in hope they would get better, my psych wanted me to stop and head to the ER right away. Come to find out, not all people can matabolise the SSRI/SNRI drugs. I suggest listen to your body, and if the side effects do not feel right, please consult with psych before continuing to experiment with these drugs.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	2/29/2012 10:10:32 PM	Tried celexa, paxal and gained weight rapidly - 40 lbs in 18 mos. Then tried lexapro, continued to gain 20 more lbs, eventually stopped working for me.  Effexor XR is much better, but don't try to go off suddenly.  Miserable side effects.  No weight gain on this which is a plus.  Have taken off weight gained on other antidepressants.  In winter go up to 150 mg due to lack of sunlight in northeast.  Pharmacist substituted the generic form and I didn't notice.  Awful.  After 3 days, was an emotional basketcase, crying, sensitive, not sleeping.  Overall has helped me cope with anxiety, stabalized moods and restored my cheerful personality, easier to cope with insanely intense professional job, graduate school and family ... full plate.  Works for me. Hope it helps you.

Pfizer had been providing it to me thru &quot;connection to care&quot; assistance program. For that I am greatful! BUT, I tried to re-apply and with NO warning was told via phone that they no longer have Effexor on the program. I have had to stop with only one week of weaning off and have never been so sick. My doctor is very unhappy with Pfizer! It is DANGEROUS to stop without weaning off SLOWLY!!! I was given no heads-up at all that I would'nt be getting a refill. This is not how you treat people, nausea, diarhea, headache, dizzy like the world is swimming, aches all over my body and what feels like &quot;brain-snaps&quot; for lack of a better term. I've been living on soda crackers for a week now. I am truely grateful for the pills i was given, but I believe it to be EXTREMELY WRONG not to offer at least a weaning off process with the last supply. They (Pfizer) should be ashamed of putting countless destitute people in harms way after getting them completely dependant on their product. I will never use a Pfizer product again!Cathy-Spokane WA

Bipolar Depression	Topcop, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	2/9/2012 5:53:11 PM	After almost breaking off my engagement due to hypomanic and depressive cycles, I was prescribed Effexor XR (75mg to start, up to 225mg at present)combined with Lamictal. While I agree with everyone about the missed dose side-effects (MAN those brain &quot;zaps&quot; and vertigo SUCK!), This combo literally saved my relationship. I noted that others experienced sexual side-effects, but I have been fortunate enough to avoid them.  I also agree with the patients here that say that if you take Effexor, make sure you're in it for the &quot;long haul.&quot; I am, and it has been well worth it as I feel stable again. My advice (at the risk of sounding like a commercial): make sure you consult with your doctor before starting and do NOT try to come off of this Cold Turkey!

Neuropathic Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/4/2012 8:37:48 PM	I was only on 37.5mg once/day, and it turned me into a total zombie, plus I was nauseated and developed a stabbing headache and tics. Took almost 3 days after I stopped to get back to normal. Definitely not the right med for me!
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/3/2012 10:33:55 PM	I've been taking the XR version for almost 13 years and it's had an amazing, positive effect on my life. I'm able to focus and think through my reactions to daily events in a way I never could before. HOWEVER, if I'm without my dosage for more than 1 day, I have a terrible reaction: intensely disturbing dreams and &quot;brain flashes&quot; like electricity going through my head...AWFUL FEELING!  Even the use of non-XR version doesn't help. I feel like I will never be able to be off this medication. But it's been so helpful in my daily life, not sure I want to discontinue. Very grateful for the generic version.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	2/2/2012 1:51:10 PM	Initially this drug had worked for me better than the other 4 antidepressants I've tried.  Took care of my anxiety &amp; hormonal mood swings 100% but helped me feel normal, as myself. Major complaint was lowered sex drive &amp; insomnia; kept me up all night...never slept. Had to discontinue after learning of pregnancy...horrible side effects that lasted 3 weeks: electric shocks orginating from brain to core of body, dizzyness, and mood swings out of control.  Only antidepressant that worked for my hormones however. My mom and sister did well on this too, may have a genetic component.

Hot flashes and night sweats were severe.  Anyone who complains about 'weaning off' should have read about the drug before taking it.  My dr. told me right up front that if I wanted to discontinue useage, I had to be prescribed something else for about 2-3 weeks.  If you're using the internet to read these postings, you should be using it to read about the side-effects of stopping usage suddenly.  Yes, they're severe and horrible.  Missing a pill is not pleasant.  But this is all part of the deal.  I can't take HRT due to cancer history in my family, and this drug has the fewest side effects of anything I researched.  Do your homework, folks, and don't take anything you don't understand fully.  I would (and do!) recommend Effexor as a solution for lots of the miseries of 'change of life'.
Panic Disorder	Happy Camper, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/18/2012 1:05:36 PM	I have been on it for the past 7 years. I am on a very high dose = 225 MG per day (3 pills), and have been for about 5 years, however I will say my life feels incredibly normal.  I experience hardly any anxiety, nervousness, or mood swings whatsoever.  I can remain calm, cool and collected.  The ONLY downside of this drug, is forget trying to stop taking, or weaning off.  If I miss my dose by even an hour, the withdrawal symptoms are horrid.  I feel electric shocks throughout my body, I feel tired, weak and extremely irritable.  That said, if you stay on a rigid schedule of taking the exact time every day, you will feel blissful.   I have no intentions of discontinuing this drug, and my doctor has decided long term use is not harmful.  Overall this drug has been lifechanging and I am forever thankful for it.  I feel like ME again.

Panic Disorder	Willowbee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/2/2012 8:03:46 PM	I have used this 3 times now in 7 or 8 years about 3-6 months at a time to over come anxiety, panic attacks and mild depression. This has been the only one that works fast and I have no side effects (75 mg). The plus side is that I also don't eat as much. I would start forgetting to take it and just take myself off. I had tried the 150mg and it did cause nausea for 1 week. I think it was too strong for my body. The 75mg I could not even tell I took anything other than I would not have the attacks and I felt more like myself.

It has been three weeks of weaning this drug out of my system but I don't see any light at the end of this tunnel. Everyday I feel worse than the day before...and I wonder if these effects are permanent. I would tell others never to go on Effexor unless they commit to lifetime use never trying to come off of it.

It worked great for me and gave me a wonderful laid back feeling. My depression definitely lifted. But I got crazy carbohydrate cravings and gained 10 pounds over 3 months. Plus it took a long time to orgasm and my sex drive fell too recently. But seriously, getting off of this drug is ridiculously hard. I'm not even off of it all the way and I started weaning on 11/9. I've had dizziness (this went away, mostly), terrible mood swings, crying spells...just an awful time really. I wouldn't recommend it but maybe for those who know they'll need something long-term.

I like the change in my mood but continue to need Xanax for anxiety before sleep. My only complaint about Effexor (both versions) is that they will make me quite drowsy and nauseated for about 6-8 hours after ingestion.  I have learned to take them in the late afternoon or at dinner, then I can sleep or drowse through the evening, feel nauseated in the comfort of my own home and will continue with this regimen when I find a new job and go back to work.  It definitely has made me feel brighter and less depressed than Prozac. Prozac and Abilify worked equally well, but the cost of Abilify was just too high for me to continue. So I am happy with this combination.

Loss of sex drive, couldn't sleep more than 2 hours a night and felt like I was on speed. After 2 weeks it seemed to be working to treat my depression without side affects. Looking back, I think this drug contributed to me having to file bankruptsy. While on this drug I was reckless with money. I spent money like it grew on trees, maxed out the credit cards and didn't have a care in the world about any consequences of my actions. I had short term memory loss and could never pay attention for more than a few minutes.
Depression	itmatsb, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	12/12/2011 7:18:14 PM	This has been a miracle drug for me over the past 8 years with EffexorXR. When I got severely depressed I thought that no drug could help me with a terrible quality of life from 24/7 migraines that not only gave me constant pain, but prevented me from doing much of anything for the 2 and half years before.  Also having had a major stroke I was suffering from other disabilities.  A certain percentage of those suffering from chronic pain do commit suicide.  The doctor had me increase the dose and get counseling.  I never got the counseling, but 4 weeks later the depression went away--and still with the same horrible life.  Although I believe that the higher dose did help with some of my migraine pain.I have now gone off of it and switched to Pristiq because of the lack of any sex drive.  We'll see if it improves.  I have suffered from depression for many years and am committed to taking anti-depressants for the rest of my life, so the fear of getting off of it is not a concern.  I did in fact discontinue the Effexor while first switching to Savella which caused extreme nausea and never got it up to proper dose--now to the Pristiq.  If you taper off Effexor gradually, you can get off of it, unless you need it and then the depression will return. I had that experience as well years ago.I had no other side effects other than the lack of sex drive--a big one.

It worked wonders!!  I was on 75 mg. for years with no issues.  My insurance company then felt that need to substitute the brand name with generic (which I did not catch, so I could not figure out what was wrong with me), and I crashed-BIG TIME.  The generic is in no way like the brand name.  It took me a good 3 months to get back to where I was.  I have since increased to 150 mg. after the loss of my father, and slipping back a bit.  I did notice that if I fluctuate the times of taking it, even by a couple of hours, I will have a difficult time with anxiety/sweats.  Has anyone else ever experienced that?  When I called the doctor they automatically wanted to increase the dosage, but I am hesitant to do so because I am fearful that everytime I increase it gets me closer to being at the max I can take, and I don't want to ever get to a point where I can't take this med.  I am extremely med sensitive, and to find something that works for me is a godsend.  I know that the withdrawal is awful, but quite honestly, I never plan to stop taking this. 
Depression	rusmom, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	5	Female	65-74	11/29/2011 4:14:56 PM	I've been on this time-released drug (and now use the generic form) for almost 4 years and have remained on the 37.5 mg doing just fine. I haven't gained weight and have lost/been able to maintain my weight unlike what I was on previously. My headaches haven't increased. I'm in my mid-60's and doing fine on the drug. After reading all the horror stories that people have posted, I have to wonder why they kept upping the drug if it wasn't working for them. There are so many types of drugs for depression, you should work with your doctor to find the one that's right for you. If your current doctor doesn't help or they're just fishing for different drugs and not monitoring you, CHANGE DOCTOR'S.

It takes me to a place where I feel normal again. Thank God a generic has finally come out. It is very expensive without insurance. I have paid upwards of $300 for a prescription. Running out is very ugly. The withdrawls are terrible. As long as I can continue to get my Effexor, I'm happy and able to work, have a happy marriage and function day to day. It's awesome and has worked wonders for me.

This combo seems to work the best for me: we have tried different combos, but to not great satisfaction. I was without Effexor for a couple of days this summer. It was an immediate &amp; dramatic withdrawal. It seemed as if I was experiencing bursts of &quot;electrical activity&quot; in my head, I was very dizzy, all I could hear was a continuous &quot;white noise&quot; that increased with my vertigo. So, I don't plan to go off it any time soon. If I ever have to stop taking it, I will insist on constant monitoring, since I seem to be very sensitive to the drug.

It worked great, first time in years I had no constant burning in my feet.  After three months the insurance company said they wouldn't cover it anymore and I had to take Effexor XR.  I have been on it two weeks ant it is terrible!  Always tired and feel like I have the flu.  Terrible dry mouth.  I'm due to increase the dosage in three days, but I think I wil call the doctor and get off of it.  From what I've read here, I'm dreading getting off of it, but I can't stay on it either.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	anonymous, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	10/16/2011 11:09:27 AM	I have fought with depression and anxiety for years.  I have tried 8 diff meds and effexor is just the most helpful for me.  I am on 150mg of xr and it has made me human again.  I do experience trouble finding words sometimes, night sweats, tremors in the mornings... but not to the point that it bothers me much.  I have taken this in the past and coming off of it is horrible.  The brain &quot;zaps&quot; are annoying and the feeling of being out of my mind was awful for a few weeks.  I am well aware of all of that now that I am taking the meds again.  I tried a few others after coming off effexor xr and they just didn't benefit me the same way.  So don't fear that this drug will ruin your life.  It has helped me get mine back.  Know what to expect when you come off of it.  Follow your doctor's advice for stopping it.  Or just stay on it!  I plan to for a while.  For more positives, I have not lost my sexual drive at all.  I have also lost 20lbs in the 6 months I have been on it with little effort.  My appetite just isn't nearly as strong as before taking this.  And best, no more intrusive thoughts and crying episodes!

While it is helping with my depression and hot flashes it has begun making me extremely tired. Had to switch from taking it in am to pm. This little change is making a big difference. I sleep better at night and still reaping the benefits from this medication.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/9/2011 10:41:57 AM	I absolutley loved this medicine, but the only problem I am having with it is the side effects of coming off, and that is EXTREME dizziness, and it makes me sick to my stomach and have a very hard time focusing on anything, almost like having a panic attatch. my dr has taken me off this medicine due to i have been on for a very long time and she feels it is not working for me anymore. I am having a very hard time doing daily activities, and all i can really do is sleep or lay down and not move alot to avoid being dizzy,

I then was experiencing mood swings, extreme hot flashes, night sweats, joint pains, crying, etc..talking w/my doc it was said to be depression and put me on this &amp; didn't work, tried other things out there &amp; didn't work &amp; then back to this @ 175mg/day. To date no results, decided to see ob/gyn, well...the ob/gyn put me on estradiol (I had my uterus removed 11 yrs ago due to endometriotris)I'm feeling great! NOT DEPRESSION!!!It's change of life!!! I should've gotten a second opinion a long time ago instead of all this; very weird dreams, extreme weight gain with no matter what I did, still mood swings, with horrible hot flashes, night sweats, etc. I did try cutting cold turkey...don't it's horrible experience!!! I started going every other day then every two, then every three and so on...this worked!!! I advise everyone getting a second opinion before going on any antidepressants unless it's for a fact it's depression!!!! I don't put the sole blame on the med though, it's hugely my doc not listening &amp; a part me not getting a second opinion and putting my faith &amp; belief in just one person I thought I could!!!
Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/8/2011 6:47:13 PM	I Took this eight months after my son was born for post partum anxiety and panic attacks. I have delt with anxiety issues/ pa's my whole life, but it was way out of hand when I started using the drug. I was terrified to go anywhere and terrified to be alone with my baby. It was awful. Within one week of 37.5 I felt better and another week of 75 mgs I was on the road back to my old self. Six months into it and I went back down to the lowest dose and six months later I stopped taking it. It was a sluggish light- headed four days, but other than that it gave me a wonderful year with my son and gave ms back the confidence to deal with my anxiety on an appropriate level. Thank god for this drug. 
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	10/8/2011 2:43:45 PM	I had a horrible time using this drug. It made my depression worse &amp; was making me sick, and I know I am not the only one who has felt this way. If your doctor prescribes this drug, make sure they know for sure that it is something that will work for you specifically. Maybe even get a second opinion. I would not recommend this drug to anyone.

This drug has been the worst thing that's happened to me. I've been on it for approximately 5-6 years at 300mg daily. When starting, no problems at all. After the effective period (which has been so long ago, i dont even remember when it stopped working) ended and i became so uncontrollably sick from the withdraws I started reading on here about what i was going thru. I was amazed how many people were reporting the EXACT same things i was going through, but more so the fact that my dr told me NOTHING about any of it! Since then I have literally been too afraid to try to stop again because of the withdraws. This drug is so highly addictive it is unreal. Until the last month, I've taken the medication with no benefits with the sole reason being the fear of withdraw symptoms. The last month, however, My depression has escalated and feel that I can no longer fear the withdraw and still be this miserable. I have a new prescription (cylexa I believe) and will be starting in the next day or so.

Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/27/2011 7:56:51 PM	I've been taking Effexor for 6 years, now, and from the first day starting at 37.5 through now at 150, I told the Dr that &quot;I never want to stop taking this.&quot;  It put me on an even keel, and takes away the &quot;fretting&quot; about what used to send me into a black abyss every day.  Kind of like just sweeping everything under the rug - I'm okay with that; I guess I'm happy just avoiding the problem.  The ONLY problem I have (and my Dr tells me that it is a very rare side effect) is that I can easily sleep 15 to 17 hours a day.  And, no, it isn't the depression causing that because I have tried switching to Wellbutrin which eliminated the sleeping problem.  But I am going to have to go back to Effexor because life just sucks too much on Wellbutrin - I get so angry....
Depression	franny, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/26/2011 10:59:13 AM	Effexor is the only antidepressant that works for me. I have tried celexa, zoloft, wellbutrin and always return. It is so important to taper SLOWLY if coming off. I thought I was in control of my depression, could get by without medication,and with my DR's supervision, tapered for 2 months to get off 75 mg daily. Going slowly, side effects are minimal. Don't even think about quitting quickly.We halved the dosage for 3 weeks, 1/2 again for 3 weeks, etc. As for weight gain, I have lost 5 lbs and have decreased appetite. It hasn't helped with hot flashes, I'm 54 and in menopause. Sometimes I have weird dreams, but overall I'm happy with the med. It got me out of my deep, dark hole and I feel like myself again. I was off for 3 months, but am back on- feeling good.

Started on the lowest dose...3 years later at 300mg a day I had enough...this drug alters your ability  to make to think straight and make  sound judgements, beside the 65 pounds I gained. There is NO warning that this drug can impair your thinking process. If I could sue this company for the hell my life became while on this drug I would !! Weened off it and thankfully did not have problems that I read others here did.  I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. My doctor was very upset about the side effects I experienced.

Expect loss of focus / fuzzy head all the time, weight gain, loss of interest in sex,vision issues, muscle spasms possible bells palsy. Withdrawal is murder so get your doctor to help you get off of this medication. I have been off it for a month after 3 years and feel the best I have in 3 years.

Slow drop in dossage over a few months is best.

Panic Disorder	myfirstpost, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	8/27/2011 1:58:35 PM	I was extremely excited to take Effexor XR. I first came on WebMD and read all of the amazing reviews of how people love this product. I suffer from panic attacks, usually brought on my situations or events. I didn't have general anxiety and a Xanax was usually how I would treat an attack.  But since my attacks were becoming slightly frequent the doctor prescribed me Effexor XR 75mg.  I took my first pill after breakfast and within 2 hours I started too feel like a zombie. I also started to exhibit signs of an anxiety attack (sweaty palms, hot/cold, nausea)But I was able to press on, went into day two, same thing, trouble sleeping, overall miserable. So I started reading online, most people were starting off at 37.5mg. not 75mg. so on the 3rd day I put a call into the doctor to find out what he thought, because obviously something wasn't right with this prescription.  Within 2 hrs of being awake I felt a panic attack starting, so I took .5mg of Xanax hoping that would calm me down.  Unfortunately the panic attack was full blown, and was one of the worst attacks I have had in over 10 years.  I was on the verge of calling 911 to help get me sedated but luckily I had family who helped sedate me and get me to sleep.  Today is the 2nd day without this medication, and again I woke up with the same general anxiety and uneasy feeling I had yesterday. All in all, this medication is not for everyone. The side effects are very real, and very strong. I was brought up around anxiety in my family and am very knowledge on what triggers my attacks and how to handle them accordingly.  What I am experiencing because of this Effexor XR is not horrible and beyond anything I have dealt with before.  I strongly suggest that you use this with caution and I hope that if you read this and it helps you I have done my job. This is my first review on here and I just felt the need to share how horrible my experience was with this medication. I would not ever take this again.

Major Depressive Disorder	Yobbo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	45-54	8/24/2011 7:17:04 PM	Over the years I have tried several other anti depression medicines (Zoloft, Paxil, Cymbalta, Abilify) but have found Effexor XL has the best effect in combination with Wellbutrin XL. I take 300mg of each daily. I'm still tired all the time, and lack energy a lot but my outlook of life is better. I also have Adult ADD and Wellbutrin helps with that. I tested my testosterone and found it was low. That can also be a cause of my tiredness and low energy, and other conditions.

Effexor has made this stop, still have mild feeling of being hot, but no more drenched sheets and clothes.  Sometimes I feel indifferent about what is going on, lack of sexual desire but otherwise no other side affects.

I was on Zoloft for 3 months and started having panic attacks and anxiety all the time so the venlafaxine has been a godsend.  I have gained 10+lbs even while exercising and watching my food.  I have noticed when I miss a dose I get a very bad headache, dizziness and nausea.  No sex drive.  I did not realize that stopping the drug would be so terrible as described in the other comments.  If it is anything like missing a dose I know it will be bad.  For now it has helped me and until I read about withdraw symptoms I would have said this stuff was great.

I've only been on it for 3 months now and since my DR doubled my dose I have definitely started to feel the positive effects of this drug. It's almost as if someone has turned a bright light on in my world. I feel much happier and I have so much more energy to do the things I want to do everyday. It hasn't really helped much with my anxiety though.
Other	Benshope, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	2	2	Female	45-54	8/18/2011 1:20:45 AM	I have been on this medication as a preventative for migraines for over a year. My dosage was 300 mg per day. The reason I am commenting is I have been tapering off of the med and want to forwarn anyone to not do it without a dr. The withdrawals are bad, please do it slowly. I have had all kinds of withdrawals that have been very scary and still are having them. Please for your own good, do not do this on your own. This is one medication I will never go on again, or one like it. Please be careful with your decisions and your health, thank you!

It helped with my depression for several years, but being on this drug long term caused a multitude of physical problems. In addition to confusion, sexual dysfunction, constipation, constant gas, ringing in my ears, and memory problems, in the last year I have developed severe stomach problems, weird and frightening dreams, twitching of my legs, arms and hands. I weaned myself off this drug for 2 weeks, then went cold turkey 3 weeks ago when I realized my stomach problems were improving since I stopped taking Effexor.  Right now I fight unexpected feelings of irritablility on and off all day, sadness, and frustration, but I can eat anything I want, no more heartburn or indigestion.  My sex life is back, and I have more energy. I am trying to be aware of my moods and if I feel that I need medication again, it will not be Effexor.

Panic Disorder	SA1227, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	8/1/2011 5:49:23 PM	I was very anti-mood enhacing medication until I came upon this one. I had/have panic disorder and thought I was going to lose my mind to uncontrollable fear (fight or flight feelings)..it cam so suddenly and prevented me from eating, sleeping, drinking, etc. My doctor put me on this and it may have saved my sanity. I got a grip. I didn't intend to stay on it because if you miss a dose you start to feel VERY strange...I did not like that...but when taken properly it was a savior, and it's the only drug I have ever said that about. I didn't feel worse, or more depressive, I just felt better and clamer. I did go off of it because I want to be as medication-free as possible. But it did help me get control over my panic/anxiety...coming off the medicine slowly was still rough. I had my fiance on the phone almost all night at the worst of the withdrawl. But everything was OK. At least I know I can come back to this medicine if my panic ever gets to that point again.

I think i've read enough.  I have been on Effexor XR for 6 days now.  I am eager to have this drug take effect.  I am currently on Paxil 60mg.  I started feeling the drug in my body within a couple hours; neither positive benefits or negative one yet except I had a hard time falling asleep last night. I'm taking 75mg once per day at bed time.  Paxil took 4 weeks to really benefit me.  Dont stress out about whether it will work or not; just go on about your business letting the days pass and sooner than later you will make a decision on what to do.  Paxil has been a life changer for me.  I never knew so many others had this excruciating condition.  I don't plan on ever getting off these meds; they work so well.  I need to take it, no big deal.Happy Searching!

In the past year my doctor has added Buspar with it and its been AMAZING!! NO ANXIETY!! However if I missed a dose within 24hrs I could feel my whole body feeling different and withdrawls coming on! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!! I have thought at times that I wanted to get off it but I am terrified to feel the withdrawls intensify!

If you carefully follow your doctor's instructions there are a number of things you can do to make the transition quite manageable (including decreasing the dose very slowly and adding a drug like Prozac).  Never stop taking Effexor without your doctor's instructions but don't be frightened away from a medication that may help your life feel worth living again.  I have been taking 300mg/day Effexor for over a year now and it is the very best thing that has helped me manage my depression.  I have always followed my Doctor's instructions and have not had any problems with the medication.  I do have to be very careful not to miss a dose though or I experience a lot of dizziness and anxiety.  I have been treated for severe depressive disorder for about 6 years and have taken a number of different different medications as part of my treatment (including Prozac, Wellbutrin, and Lamictal).  I was only getting minimal benefit from depression medications when my PCP was prescribing them but since I started seeing a psychiatrist and she put me on Effexor I have been managing so so so much better (even when my Mom died of cancer last year).  I highly recommend getting a psychiatrist and talking with them about all the pros and cons if you are considering taking Effexor.  
Depression	Chiefbear2, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	7/24/2011 6:47:07 PM	Does anyone have experience or info re memory loss with this med?  I feel that it was poor choice for me as my depression has historically had significant anxiety component with inability to be still, severe insomnia (partially work hours related, partially just me) When I started Effexor, I almost immediately started losing ability to pay attention to what I was doing, seeing, hearing etc.  Huge memory gaps still exist although I stopped taking it about a month ago.  Plain SSRIs used to work, and I have restarted Sertraline which I'd taken successfully before.  I was so unaware of the effect, I didn't even know I should be calling psychiatrist or PCP.  After about a year, it got so bad, I couldn't perform my work and have been underemployed, then finally unemployed.  Will the lost memory come back? (new ones are f0roming quite well now

I used to have major anxiety when driving, and would have major frustration issues at work and at home. since starting this med, all of it has gone away. i learned quick to not skip a dose, it seems like you are high or drunk when a dose is skipped, and my heart starts racing. but its easy  to fix, just dont skip a dose! 
Depression	Trish, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	7/22/2011 5:38:00 PM	I started taking 75mg a day 11 years ago. About 7 years ago I dropped to 37.50mg with no problems. It's worked for me. Yes, some weight gain and others are correct when they say it's hell if you miss a day or so. For me, I missed a couple days when I had the flu and it was a nightmare.Overall, I can honestly say it's helped me. I have no desire to stop taking any medication if it's helping me and the side effects are not harming me either.

Depression	SB, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	7/17/2011 8:52:53 PM	After being diagnosed with chronic deppression, I began treatment with other anti-depressants, but results were inconsistent and temporary. I quit taking meds for about a year, but depression returned. Began taking Effexor; first at lowest dose, gradually raising to 150. Yes, there are some side effects; trouble sleeping (I take it in the morning now), some weight gain (not all due to the drug I'm sure), and if I forget to take a dose, I feel dizzy (Use a weekly pill box and keep some in your purse or at work just in case). I can live with those relatively minor side effects. I can't live with the constant darkness and occasional suicidal thoughts I had before. I've been taking this medication for years, recently with the addition of Wellbutrin. I will continue taking this medication as long as I need to. If, for some reason, I needed to quit taking it I'd work with my doctor to gradually lower the daily dose ... not just skip doses or quit taking them.

I have used it for a few years now. I get restless leg syndrome at night which are directly related to this drug. Last year I tried to get off it and attempted suicide within 10 days (planned it couple days before). Emotionally better when back on it but causes me to cycle into hypomania a few times yearly. If you are bipolar don't start this medicine. Request a mood stabilizer that has an antidepressant effect. Trying again to get off it. Praying all goes well this time.

Neuropathic Pain	Bailey, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4		55-64	7/8/2011 9:05:06 PM	I have had severe Fibromyalgia for about 15 years but not diagnosed until 6 years ago.  Since then I have been taking Gabapentin 600mg 3 x a day, Skelaxin 800mg 3 x a day as well as Dermerol 50mg at least 3 x a day, but usually 5 to 6 times a day  There was some relief but not much and was unable to sleep on my left side at all due to the severe pain in my hip and leg.  Added Elavil 75mg to help with sleeping which did help however the side effect of an increased desire for sweets eventually became too much to deal with.  As I was eating one thing, I was thinking about what to have next.  With my height at 4' 10'' my weight ballooned up to 140 lbs I was very uncomfortable, so I stopped taking it.  My pain was to the point I could barely function and I became severely depressed, fatigued and my pain was off the charts, at least as far as I was concerned.  After researching Cymbalta and Effexor I talked with my doctor and decided to give the Effexor xr 75mg a try.  I have been on it for 3 months now and I am very pleased with the results.  My depression has all but abated, I have my &quot;bad&quot; days one or two days a week mainly fatigue but not as bad as it was.  But more importantly is my PAIN IS SO MUCH BETTER!  I am hoping to get off of the Gabapentin and Skelaxin as well as weaning off of the Demerol.  I'm finding that I don't need it as much as before.  As long as it continues to work for me I have no issue with staying on it.  I do have some side effects, I always have a slight headache but I can deal with it, if it gets too bad then I take some Ibuprofen.  The most annoying side effect is the sweating, I live in the Desert Southwest where the temps often run 110 degrees in the summer months.  I'd rather sweat than be in pain.  The insomnia was the worst, however I've found that if I take in the morning that seems to work for me.

When I first began, I was experiencing PTSD and was completely miserable and could not control my emotions. It took a few months to get used to the medication and to really feel it working. A combination of Effexor and an amazing psychiatrist worked for me. My only complaint is that the withdrawl from the medication is terrible.

I could not lose weight in spite of regular exercise routines, diets and even taking in half the calories necessary to sustain my weight. Effexor continued the problem as I doubled my weight from 175 to 350. I have other friends who had the same problem.

And they gave me this drug to help.  It was hard for me to come to terms with taking medication, just to get through the day.  I have been on it for 2 years now and have come to a place in my life where I've decided enough is enough.  I have more good days than bad and want to get off them.  I was only taking 75mg and the doctor said to take 37.5mg.  I didn't notice any side effects or difference in my moods.  Then I decided to take it one day and not the next.  I feel light headed and dizzy and nauseated.  YUK!!!  How do you get off these things?  I don't know if I can put up with the effects. Does anyone get off these things?  How long do the effects last?  Am I destined to stay on this drug for the rest of my life?I was told by a friend of mine (on the same drug) to divide the 37.5mg into half again.  I'm going to give this a try! Wish me luck, after reading the other reviews, I think I'm going to need it.

I was angry and anxious even more so than before I started it. The side effects were so much worse to deal with than just being bi-polar. I was constipated, had an immense amount of weight gain, dizzy spells, headaches, backaches, unbareable periods. And as one person said brain quivers. I quit cold turkey after 3 yrs on it. It was the hardest thing in the world to do. They only thing I still notice is the anger issue. After a year off of it Ive lost 90 lbs feel much happier with myself my constipation is gone but my cramps are still more unbarible than I could ever explain. I strongly recommend getting yourself off however you can if you are taking it. Or if youre considering it DONT! Now that I have been off of it for a yr Id like to know if my period will always be like this and have I completely shot my chances of ever becoming pregnant....

I am now taking 225mg and it is really helping me. I still need it to be bumped up some and my Dr. is helping with that. I have read A LOT of reviews and I hate that you all are experiencing such trouble. All I can say is that this is heaven sent for me. I feel like a brand new person. My mom takes it also and she is a completely different person also. She loves it. It has made a world of difference in my depression and other symptoms. :)

Headaches, dizziness, exhaustion. I couldn't figure out why I was so dizzy for the past few days, and then I realised why. I'm trying on my own to stop taking it. Attempted suicide because of it. I'm sure I'm a minority when it comes to the efffects of taking this drug, but believe me, hot flashes and occasional temper tantrums are much better than taking it.
Bipolar Depression	debra213, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/27/2011 9:10:23 PM	I've been on Effexor XR for over a dozen years after having tried almost every single antidepressant on the market.  I guess I'm very lucky that something finally worked.  But, on the minus side, withdrawal is a BITCH!  If I miss one dose, I get a persistant headache and my thinking becomes cloudy.  Last year, I was in the hospital for my depression and the first day there, they did not give me any meds until late in the day.  By that time, I was already feeling really crappy.  The nurse insisted that what I was feeling was not withdrawal.  I knew better, of course.  Anyway, you really have to weigh the pros and cons before you take something as powerful as what we're prescribed.

I've been on it aprox 6 yrs. Now coming off of it. I felt for the last several yrs I was living in a fog, just realized the last yr it was the effexor xr. I couldn't concentrate, some days couldn't get the words out I wanted to say and tired most of the time. Best way to describe it would be living in a numb state...not depressed, but not anything, just living live a zombie.  I've been reducing dosage for the last two mths. Usually very, very passive, but first day on reduced (from 75 to 37) I was so angry I thru a bottle and put a hole in the wall. My 2nd day off it completly(today) is a nightmare! Now very ANGRY &amp; Mean! Yelled at my elderly mom yesterday and mad at everything. Today, I'm mad one second,crying the next. Minor brain zaps,minor because I withdrew slowly, was down to aprox 15 mg when I stopped completly. For anyone contemplating taking this, PLEASE research it in detail. If you do an internet search you will see that I am one of many going thru the hell of withdrawals on this awful medicine. Dr's DO NOT tell you what this is like. I wouldn't wish this feeling on anyone...well maybe the CEO of the drug company that makes this horrible stuff!

Let me begin by saying that I am not a typical case. Six years ago at the young age of 28, I become post-menopausal do to surgically removing ovarian tumors. Because of this, I do not have hot flashes. My symptoms are extremely slow metabalism and low libido. So my doctor gave me Effexor in the smallest dose to hopefully combat these symptoms. Although I read all of the reviews here before taking it, everyone reacts differently so I decided to try it. I took 1 pill Sunday night. Within an hour my heart began to race. I did not sleep all night, and went to work the next day. My eyes were bugged out and I was wired, I could have ran a marathon! By 2:00pm I started to come down, my heart stopped racing but I was still wired. I did not take another dose Mon. evening, and I slept well. However, I woke up Tues. with a horrible headache. Within 15 minutes the diarehea started and then immediately the vomitting. I couldn't even keep down water. After vomitting 15 times, I had to call off work and was able to go back to sleep. I slept over 14 hours that day and finally kept down soup at 4:00pm. Another full night of sleep, Wed. I was a little groggy and Thurs. I felt like myself. All of this was only with ONE DOSE and the minimum dosage at that! Although everyone reacts differently, please research this well and have someone available who can monitor you and help you if you need it. This is very potent stuff. Good Luck.

Now I'm in Portugal to help elderly relatives and can't get access, so I'm trying to wean off it.  IT SUCKS!  Withdrawal is hell!  If you can avoid starting it, all the better, believe me!  Best advice for weaning off it is to avoid anyone you care about so you don't tear their heads off and walk as much as possible.  That's my best strategy anyway.  I'd surely like to be asleep right now but that's not happening thanks to these lovely withdrawal symptoms. ARRRRRGGGGG!
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	19-24	5/3/2011 9:07:45 PM	Well, when i started taking this medication i didn't notice any changes with my depression and i still don't. But now, I notice that it makes anxiety worse. And worse anxiety causes more anxiety attacks.

One you are past this it will work wonders. You will be able to tell if you have missed a couple of days because you will have side effect again. When taken correctly and and utilized properly this med does its job!
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	little, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	5/3/2011 2:17:24 PM	I have been taking this drug for many years. Recently, I've noticed that I easily bruise, just a small bump can cause a huge bruise.  I have made an appt w/ my doctor.This drug is VERY hard to wean off of.  You can NOT do it yourself.  I have tried.  Contact your physician, he'll start by lowering your does, 100, 75, 37.5....then he'll he may put u on Lexapro, that is easier.  You will make yourself REALLY sick if you do NOT do it this way...its the ONLY way.  I maybe starting to do this soon, like this month.  Good Luck to all who are trying!

I have leg &amp; stomache cramps, intence back pain, twitching toes, constipation, and best of all, I FEEL ROTTEN!!!!! I have just sat here reading testimonials for 3 hours.

I DONT RECOMMEND TAKING THIS DRUG!!! FDA SHOULD REMOVE FROM SHELVES!!! Wish me luck.

I was put on effexor to relieve these attacks. I could kiss the person that came up with drug. I was able to function without fear of anxiety taking over. When the generic came out, I started taking that. Not good. It didn't work at all. It seemed to have a shorter life. The anxiety didn't come back, but my mood was lower.

Until I tried Effexor xr did I feel relief of anxiety &amp; mood swings. At first my doc put me on the name brand then changed me to the generic brand and there was no difference. I feel great. Life for me is not easy or always great but this medication sure has helped.

I got very sick with a sinus infection so I stopped taking the venlafaxine ER 75mg, because I had to take other meds for sickness...the result of stopping the venlafaxine was atrocious!  I was sick with such dizziness and had a numbness from the back of my throat all the way to the top of my head, I could especially feel the numbing in my face.  It was terrible for over a week and I still to this day have this sensation occasionally but not as bad.  I should not have stopped taking all at once.  Bad call on my part.  Am making appt. with Dr. soon

Stoped for about 6 months, started getting sick again with depression and Dr. prescribed generic effexor. Tooket for 2 months and was getting depress again, couldn't sleep, headches, nausea, etc. Took brand name for a month did great, back to normal. Went back to generic(Venlafaxine) 5 days latter I got so sick(extremely dizzy, very painful headache, stiff neck, nausea, sweats, anxiety attack, burning/tingling feeling in the harms, hands and legs, etc.) Taking name brand again for a week and just anxiety/nervousness symptoms left. No more GENERIC(Velafaxine) for me!!!!!!

The benedits outweighed the side effects until the last year. I gained weight, got overheated easily, and began having neurologic issues such as numbness, dizziness and trembling. These stopped when I got off, but the depression and mania returned. I'm currently looking for a new med. Recommendation for those getting off, get your doctor to give you the starter pack in reverse. It's still not pleasant, but it's better than going cold turkey.

I have missed doses and I hate it when I do it makes me soooo sick. I really want to get weaned off of it. Does anyone have any suggestions? I know I can go to the doctor but shes going try to keep me on it. Or try another drug. I only want to take something when I feel like I need it not everyday. I am a forgetful person and don't want to take a daily medication that I could forget to take.

I am on 75 once a day and have been on the same dose for 6 years. Due to insurance I had to start using generic.I do not find it as effective. Even though I thought the generic had to be the same as the original it is not.Wishing there was something I could do.I don't want the other life I had before Effexor...

I have been able to stay out of hospital for 5 years! Experienced NO side effects as I had on other antidepressants. I had been on almost every anti-d. ever put out without success. This med has stabilized my social anxiety &amp; my depression has lessened. I still get episodes, but they are manageable. I will have to stay on this for the rest of my life - a small price to pay for having a lot better days than the many years previous!

Depression	crsentz, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Male	25-34	3/25/2011 1:17:40 AM	I took effexor for almost five years. It took two of those five to get off this medication.  The side effects were horrible, headache, nausea, &quot;brain quivers&quot; (the best way I can describe the feeling)...and that is just a few effects I dealt with.  Under no circumstances would I ever recommend using this medication.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/23/2011 8:29:12 PM	I love this drug! It has had few side effects for me. I just dream a little more and sweat a little more. I have tired Zoloft and Prozac and had terrible side effects with each of those I lost tons of weight and the smell of food made me nauseous. You can definitely tell after a few hours if you have missed a dose. But, there is no extreme happiness and sadness with this drug.

I was also go through menapause. After being on effexor for 2 or 3 weeks, I felt so much better.  Last year, I tried to wein myself off because I lost all sexual desire and I was afraid I was addicted to it.  The withdrawal was horrible. I became very angry, and I was driving with anger.  This really frightened me.  I also became very dizzy.  I was off of it for a month or so and was not feeling any better, so I asked my doctor to put me back on it.  I went from 75 mg to 75plus37.50 and now I am experiencing a very nervous feeling every morning.  I don't want to increase this med but I may have to.  I would really like to go off of it.

It has worked great on keeping them at bay, but I have encountered some side effects.  The severe sweating is the worst.  I could be in a freezer and still be pouring sweat.  Good medication if you are able to handle the side effects.

I have been taking 150 mg for a month and have been having headaches at the base of my neck and my blood pressure has increased slightly.  I have lost a total of about 15 pounds since I started taking this medication; in which I truly needed to loose.  I am going to continue this medication because my doctor says that it could take up to six months to start helping; not that it isn't helping because it has.  I initially went to the doctor with chest pain and palpitations; these symptoms have went away; but I am not resting well at night.

I was not told about all the wicked withdrawal side effects. I took effexor 150mg for 1 year and came off of it cold turkey to start my new med. Never again will I do this. I actually thought I was having a nervous breakdown! The constant crying I could handle but when the dizziness and the brain zaps started it really scared me. I went to a doctor who told me that I should have been weaned off of that one and it will take 2 to 3 weeks for the withdrawal symptoms to ease. Now I have to take Klonopine for a few weeks to help with the symptoms but I will have to be weaned off of that also!!! People needs to be aware of what they are taking including the withdrawal symptoms and some physicians fail to explain things to them like they should!!!! 
Panic Disorder	blklotus, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	3/14/2011 9:11:38 AM	This medication worked moderately well when I was on it, but if I missed even one dose I started feeling nauseous and shaky within a few hours.  Coming off of this medication was AWFUL, even though I did step down gradually off of it over the course of a few weeks.  When I stopped taking it altogether I felt anxious, nauseous and incredibly panicked.  My doctor actually had to put me on Paxil to curb the withdrawal symptoms for a few weeks until my body adjusted.  I wouldn't recommend this medication at all.

It has caused a few strange things-sweating is more prominent as are the vivid dreams.  Increased blood pressure/heart rate.  If you miss a dose, you can definitely feel it within a couple hours of normal taking time.  I got pregnant a few years back and they stopped me cold turkey-DO NOT DO THIS!!!  The side effects are WORSE than taking the drug.  They finally realized this and put me back on it.  It has truly helped me, despite the negative parts-its been a life saver for me.There are some of us who will need anti-depressants once, some who need them intermittently, and some who need them forever.  It works for me, so until it doesn't anymore, I will keep taking it.

I felt like a caziilion bucks and I was normal. I was able to concentrate on things a lot better. I saw things much clearer. I did not experience any medication or dragging feeling. I was able to wen off the medication in a short time without a withdrawal from the medication. I have been off this medication for years and I am still feeling like I can be around people without being depressed. I lost another love one to a massive stroke and was able to work throught the berevement period. Thanks to Effexor, my life is better.

The withdrawal symptoms, even with careful tapering with the assistance of my doctor, was so horrible I could not function in daily life. I found I needed to take time off of work. It turned out to be so bad that I had to go back on the pill and wait until summer (i work in a high school) to devote it to getting off the drug.

I wish I had been given more information before I started it. I get hot very easily and not just in flashes (I almost die in the summer). I also had no idea how difficult it is to get off of it. It was never a drug I planned on staying on. I'm shocked at what I've read by others weaning off of it. Every time I've talked to my doctor about coming off of it, they want to postpone it. Now I know why.... I will never take my doctor's word for it &amp; will research any new drug I take in the future!

Also, if you ever plan to stop taking this medicine then DO NOT EVER START IT.  You cannot get off Effexor without almost losing your mind and body.  Put a melody to this and just sing along, cry, cry, cry, that's all I ever do when I try to get over taking u, can't live that way, so now I just never quit taking it and pay, pay, pay.

It helps take the edge off.  Nothing is going to completely make your life stress free or problem free but this medication helps me get thru it without losing it.  I recommend this medication for depression and anxiety.  There are little to no side effects.  Atleast I didn't have any.  :-)

I take 150mg/day. Is pretty effective although some days I feel like a need a larger dose. I don't really notice any side effects when I take it correctly but like other writers have mentioned DO NOT miss a dose or withdrawl kicks in immediately. I ran out once and missed 2 days and thought I had the flu or mono for a week. I can always tell immediatly if I've forgotten to take my medicine within a about 4 hours.Remember not every medication works for every person. Also when 37.5mg may be effective for one person another may need 150mg to be effective. Do not just assume because the doctor started you out on one dose that this will work for you. Keep in close contact with your doctor so that adjustments can be made if one dose isn't working for you. I do agree though that family doctors and internists should not be allowed to prescribe psychiatric medications without scheduling psychiatrist followup with their patients first. I know my doctor wrote me the rx when I asked and then just keeps renewing it. Not a good idea.

Well it did nothing at all actually made things worse.  I gained 40 lbs, memory problems &amp; made my anxiety worse. To top it off I have pain in my arms, legs, neck &amp; hips. I was only on it six months and didn't have to bad of a time getting off it.  Thank goodness.

Prozac and Paxil quit working so I went to Effexor xfProblem is now I think the druggist just put me on the generic. I am having anxiety.Chocolate is sending me into mania.  I haven't had caffeine for years but starting having some for migraines.  I believe since I have been taking what I think is generic everything has changed.  Chocolate sends me into mania and so does caffeine.  I could say the caffeine is making me have anxiety but I have been drinking it for a year now and this just starting in December.I am waiting for the drug store to open to see if I am on generic.  They just approved the effexor xr in capsule form last summer for generic.  I have on my prescriptions no generic.  Why is it that we have to check ourselves to see what is wrong.

Before I started taking it I was extremely depressed &amp; attempted suicide more than once.  No side effext problems, boosts my energy, &amp; keeps me functioning.  I've taken it for nearly 9 years now.  Now the pharacutical company has created a generic Effexor XR which I oppose, generics rarely give the effextivness as the brand medication &amp; what's worse about the generic is that it causes head aches when startin &amp; stopping the pill &amp; from a brain injury  from a car accident in 1967 I get horrific head pain very easily, especially when medications are changed or made differently.  Effexor XR generic is just a time bomb ready to go off with people like me who are extrememly suseptable to head trauma.

Since I began taking it my memory is going downhill.  I cannot find anything on memory loss but I am certain that effexor is causing mine. It does help my depression.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/1/2011 6:22:40 PM	The first 2 weeks were awful! I had every single side effect. I even fell asleep at my job! The side effects did eventually go away, and I finally got my life back. Make sure your Doctor graduallys increases your meds- I started at 37.5 and it kicked myt a$$!! After a month or so I went to 75, and then to one 37.5 and on3 75 pill. I've been on it for a year and a half, and after being on 150 mg for over 6 months, just moved up one more step. The only real side effects that I still get are yawning ( espicially when I take the pill late) and restless legs.I would highly reccomend it to anyone- just make sure you give it a chance after about a month. The first month is hell!
Depression	45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4		45-54	2/1/2011 3:09:05 PM	The only issue that I have are the nightmares that I have occasionally.

I am 57 yrs. old and was a complete recluse. The thought of going to the grocery store made me dizzy and weak.  I am once again functioning like a well balanced person and have regained my confidence and ability to volunteer and be inter-active with my family and friends.  In my opinion it is a minor miracle! 
Bipolar Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/31/2011 8:09:28 AM	I have been taking this medication since 1998, 300mg daily for bipolar disorder.  They work very well apart from infrequent times when I have 4-5 days of light depression.  I have added Wellbutrin, 100mg daily and have been depression free for a year.  I have been on various antidepressants since 1989 and, so far, have had good blood test results.
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	45-54	1/28/2011 10:43:30 PM	I am slowly starting to feel better with this medication. Just boosted up to 150 mg and daytime panic attacks are way down. Still have the panic attacks at night with the nightmares though. Have been told it will take time and therapy with the meds to get some sense of normal back, if ever. 
Depression	CW/WC, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	1/26/2011 9:24:48 PM	I was put on this after I had a seizure while on Wellbutrin. Lucky me. I was already doing well before I was put on this but I haven't been able to come off because I'm in college and never home long enough. (constant state of transitions/changes) If I skipped 2/3 days I felt the beginnings of withdrawal and/or felt crummy emotionally. That was fixed by taking it the next couple days in a row. Most of the time I've been on this I'm also in regular therapy as well. I have vivid dreams. This might be the only side effect but it's never gone away or diminished. They're not disturbing or scary most of the time though so it's almost enjoyable.

It really helped; once the side effects in the beginning (felt like speed) wore off. It was increased to 150 later on, it seemed like an answer for me. I did however, have a lot more migraines. Ins only paid for generic a few months ago, and I felt different. I started having more ANXIETY panic attacks. I started feeling more depressed. Now that I am in a better emotional state, I went from 150 to 75mg. This alone seemed to help me, as I am having LESS panic attacks, and don't feel as tired. I want to go completely off of it now, but I fear The &quot;Brain Ticks&quot; feeling (I get when I miss a pill). I also am going to the bathroom more regularly now. To sum it up, at first, the benefits were so helpful, now the negatives out way them. I would definately recommend a &quot;diary&quot; be kept for long-term use of this med! Even if you've been taking it for years, the effects CHANGE!

Overall however we really didn't notice a difference on or off the drug.A different experience..several years ago (during this same bout with depression) it helped me for a few days. The Dr titrated me up to 450mg(!) and I became a zombie. Also every time we went up in dosage my psoriasis became MUCH worse! None of the Drs have heard of that b4 however I can guarantee that it was a very real and upsetting experience.

I washappy it was less money; however, after taking this for3 weeks, I started having tingling, burning, &amp; cramps in my legs. I did not consider the medicine as the cause. I went thru test after test including a mri. Nothing showed up. The only thing that was different in my life was the generic effexor so on my next refill I asked forbrand name effexor. 3 weeks after I stopped the generic, all my symptoms were gone. Now my insurance doesn't want to pay for brand name. Has anyone else had these kinds of symptoms with thegeneric? This review is for the generic effexor.

I stopped the medication and the nodules were gone or decreased dramatically in size during a follow up. I started taking the medication again in October 2010 (75mg/day) and yeserday I woke up with a stiff neck and very large nodules can be felt in the front of my neck. I am discontinuing this med and never taking it again. I do not see this as a coincidence this time and believe it is from the med.

It has started to give me really bad insomnia and has mad me cranky with no chance of being positive on anything. I have started to reduce my dose with the help of some vitamins/minerals to combat the horrible withdrawals that come from this drug. This med is like trying to get off of cocaine in terms of it's addictiveness. I am much happier on my lowered dose and plan on to continue with trying to get off this nasty med. I am also starting to go back to doing my drawing and painting-since this med made me numb to creative things.

Over time I had to switch to generic but after like a week or more the dizziness stopped.  The ONLY DOWNSIDE, AND ITS A BIG ONE, IS...  if you have to come off this medication, it is NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE.  DO NOT QUIT COLD TURKEY AS IT CAN MAKE YOU DIZZY, SICK TO YOUR STOMACH, TIRED AND THATS JUST THE PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS.    Do Not quit this drug cold turkey.  I did once, and the results were devastating.  I didn't know that it was dangerous to do so.  And, no dr.  will tell you that it is.  PLAN ON BEING ON IT FOREVER.

I knew what I was getting into 'cause I had gone through it all about 5 years earlier. I have gained 25 un-needed lbs. although I am very careful of how much I eat.  I am sleepy during the day, to the point of falling asleep while driving.  I am in wonderful shape emotionally, but dread the day I decide to wean off of it once again.  I went through the brain zaps, dizziness and self-torture of &quot;cold turkey&quot; last time, and at least my doctor and I know what to do this time.  My doctor did not know about the withdrawal problems the first time... I had to educate him and tell him about weaning off gradually.  This med is wonderful, and saved my life, literally.  Some day I will again get off of it... the right way, and try to lose the extra weight.  In the meantime, I am fat but happy!

It made me paranoid, twitchy &amp; made me feel like I was &quot;jonesing&quot;...I imagined I must have appeared to others like a heroin junky. It made me feel jumpy and really on edge. I hated it, it did little for my mental state but significantly altered my daily life in that it was such a noticable change on my body &amp; actually created anxiety that I never had prior to taking it.

It doesn't do a miracle job, but it lessens it a bit.  I do warn anyone NOT to stop this medication without a DR's help.  You must wean yourself off of it.  I use mail order prescriptions, and due to a mix-up at the provider, and the holidays I was off this medication &quot;cold turkey&quot; for 8 days.  I felt like my brain had a severe &quot;short circuit&quot;, sometimes down to my feet and hands.  I was dizzy and forgetful to the point of being 'spacy&quot;.  I am crying alot, and really have thoughts that nobody cares for me and they'd be better off if I was gone.  Prior to being on this drug I had not thoughts of being worthless.  I do know that it's only the lack of medication that is causing this.  I did receive my prescription today and started the drug again.  However, it is going to take a bit to &quot;get back in my system&quot;.  I am seriously thinking about getting with my doctor to stop this medication safely.  It scares me.
Depression	LW Not Paronoid, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	12/27/2010 1:00:54 AM	The med worked fast (within about 2 weeks)to help me in a dark time of depression, anxiety, &amp; ptsd, but now that I am better (after 4 months)I began to reduce my dosage over 1 month from 150mg per day to zero per day, I am having terrible withdrawals.  Even if I forgot to take 1 dosage I would have terrible dreams and what feels like my brain is short circuiting. After doing internet research to see if anyone else out there was experiencing similiar symptons as me, I found out many described the exact symptoms as I..now I know they are withdrawal symptoms.  At least I am relieved to know that what I thought may be mini strokes is being referred to as &quot;brain Shevers&quot;. When I tried to explain to my family, they thought I needed to go back to taking the effexor because they thought I was being paronoid.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	kyzrsosay, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	3	Male	25-34	12/26/2010 1:35:08 PM	Over the course of 10 years or so, I have struggled with mild depression and anxiety.  I was originally prescribed Celexa, Lexapro (which I hated, although I know many others who swear by it), and EffexorXR with Effexor being simultaneously the most effective yet most difficult to adjust to.  Withdraw was annoying but not unbearable.  I found the worse symptoms occur from not being properly titrated.  My doctor started me on 150mg after being off of the drug for 2 years.  I'm now one week into the treatment and have severe diarrhea, no appetite at all, and have hardly slept a good nights sleep in a week.  Please don't be discouraged by this drug by my review, it certainly improved my quality of life when prescribed properly. However Effexor when not properly prescribed can make a patient non-compliant and unwilling to seek much needed treatment due to these uncomfortable side effects.  To all suffering from depression and anxiety out there, I wish you all the best and i hope my review was helpful.

It started working really well but then became stagnant. I'm up to 300 mg &amp; have such dry mouth that I can hardly swallow meat.  I'm thin to begin with and have about zero appetite.  I would love to want to eat again.  Scared to get off tho after reading about the withdrawal.  
Depression	mimi2two, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	45-54	12/16/2010 7:49:06 AM	I have been on Effexor for about 8 months now and started on 75mg and went to 150 mg and have stayed at this level for the last 6 months. I had all the side effects starting it dizziness, brain shocks, headache, nausua, slight weight loss. But after a few weeks it does go away and I felt wonderful like a had not felt in years. BUT...I have gained ALOT of weight over 20 lbs and I have more memory loss than ever and I am only 45 years old. I have not tried coming off this drug as I have read the withdrawal effects but if the vision change gets worse i may have to and I think it will be hard. So I agree DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE taking this drug and weigh the risks.

I have a hard time walking.  I don't know if it is the medication but I suspect that itis because I didn't have these problems until I started taking this medicaton.

A debilitating increase in my ADD/anxiety/depression symptoms was evident within a mere 48-72 hours of switching from the &quot;genuine&quot; product!  (Actually, I'm incensed that this generic brand legally can be considered the treatment equivalent of Effexor XR!  And this is not my first encounter with a deficient generic substitution for a medication!)  Fortunately, my prescriber promptly provided a &quot;no substitution&quot; scrip to get me back on track -- well worth an additional $20 per month (now at my insurance plan's highest co-pay tier) despite considerable financial constraints!   
Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	11/19/2010 9:29:09 PM	I have taken this medication for the past three years. It has does wonders for my mood and level of anxiety. I feel much calmer and my mood is more stable. I'm just overall a happier more productive person. Best antidepressant for me. Beware if you switch to the generic venlafaxine er capsules. It is not the same drug as Effexor XR.  I had terrible side effects that came on over a period of six weeks on the generic. At the end it was like I wasn't even taking an antidepressant at all.  I am happy to say I am back on the brand name and feeling good again.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	11/16/2010 9:27:02 PM	prescribed Effexor for multiple reasons- primarily incredibly frequent and severe hot flashes after chemo and surgical induced menopause; works for the depression and anxiety that accompanied menopause as well.  Not sure if it's losing it's effectiveness as job-related stress has increased dramatically in the past 2 months making me exhausted, anxious, sometimes just plain overwhelmed.  Read a bunch of reviews regarding horrible time others have had getting off the drug after long-term usage explains why my doc wants to try to get me off it in another 3 months.  Right now, though I wouldn't dare try to live without it as spouse has PTSD/head injury and is taking his own cocktail of drugs.
Depression	weesahoney, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	11/16/2010 3:50:52 PM	i had been taking this medication for years with some side effects that i didn't recognize as being from the effexor. TERRIBLE dry mouth and &quot;other&quot; muscosal areas, very slight head tremors, headaches, sexual side effects, and suddenly,it just didn't &quot;work&quot; anymore. having to ween off of the effexor was problematic. i have had to come off other anti-depressant meds before, but this was the worst. spinning,crashing headaches, nausea, vomiting, disorientation. i went to pristique from effexor xr, and NO problems with ANY side effects while taking the new med. FOR INSURANCE REASONS I HAD TO GO BACK TO EFFEXOR AND AM HAVING A TERRIBLE TIME WITH IT!!!! VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS MEDICATION.....need to get off and never go back!

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	25-34	11/16/2010 1:10:25 AM	It helped slightly with my depression, it kept my moods more regular. I was told it could help me sleep too, which it didn't. If I was late or missed a pill the side effects were horrible. I would be nauseous, headaches, and a feeling like having &quot;electric shocks&quot; through my body. My head was cloudy a lot of the time when taking this, and sometimes even confused. I'm sure it works for some, and besides the high price tag, it was not enough for me to continue.

It was effective, but caused terrible withdrawal symptoms when I went off of it. I couldn't function for over a week due to extreme dizziness and &quot;brain zaps.&quot; I had periodic brain zaps over 6 months after I stopped the medication. A medication that could take care of the problem on the front end without causing so much pain and trouble on the back end would be more effective. That said, it worked and maybe that's worth a terrible 2 weeks when you stop taking it.

My doctor decided to increase the dosage and when that did not seem to help, he recommended a new treatment and weaned me off of Effexor for a week. After the week of not taking Effexor, I experienced awful vertigo symptoms, dizziness, numbness in my fingers, etc. not to mention the flu-like symptoms I have experienced for 3 weeks now. Be forewarned that this is not a pleasant experience it your doctor recommends another medication.

Depression	tk13, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/9/2010 11:56:45 PM	I've been on Effexor XR for about 3 years.  I have Major Depressive Disorder and have had to increase my meds to 300mgs a day.  I haven't had any side effects besides some initial shakiness in my hands.  It went away after a week or two.  This medication has been a life saver for me.  If I miss a dose, I don't have any side effects.  No brain zaps, withdrawal, or anything else.The generic Venlafaxine ER on the other hand is HORRIBLE.  The biggest problem has been the dizziness I get every night.  I've also had several panic/anxiety attacks and more acne than I've ever had in my life.I had to go on the generic because it's not a &quot;preferred drug&quot; on my insurance.  My doctor is now going to fight to get it covered.

I was sent the generic for Effexor this last month thinking their wouldn't be much of a change but I started noticing that I had a total flat mood but didn't feel depressed. My anxiety increased &amp; my blood pressure increased to a dangerous place even with taking medication so a small dose of a different medication for blood pressure was started.I know we all react differently to meds but I have been so stable in all areas of depression, anxiety, &amp; blood pressure that I am wondering if going to a generic could change my moods &amp; other symptoms alone. Plus, will it begin to taper off the flat mood &amp; help me be stable again. My anxiety &amp; blood pressure have been affected the most.

I have no sex drive.If I forget to take a dose I have terrible nightmares, headache and generally feel bad. I don't know how I will ever get off this medication. I will never take a medication again without investigating it's effects. I don't know how I will ever get off this.Wish that I would have never started taking it.

Panic Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	10/28/2010 11:54:21 PM	The drug works for anxiety issues. I'm currently taking the drug and have been for around 2 years now. The FDA recently approved of a generic, which is fantastic because even with the best insurance my medication costs were through the roof. *HOWEVER* - Ween yourself ONTO, and OFF of the drug. DO. NOT. MISS. A. DOSE. Anything more than 24 hours off the drug and it feels like you're dying. Headache, dizziness, double-vision, nausea, muscle pain, crying fits - you name it. If you are thinking about coming off the drug, start off slow. It's something you need to talk to your doctor about. When taken properly, just like any other drug, it works wonders. It'll do it's job very well.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	malyn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	10/26/2010 1:36:25 AM	I wanted to tell other people that I think there is a way to get off this drug. I'll tell you what I am doing that seems to lessen the withdrawal effect. First get a notepad because you are going to want to write everything down because you will be decreasing your dosages. Your effexor XR capsule will have little white beads inside of it. Depending on your dosage, that is how many beads are in it. My dose is 75 mg, so I have 75 little white beads in it. Step 2 is to get a small dark colored bowl and a pencil. Next wiggle &quot;cap&quot; off the capsule. This is the shorter end of the capsule. Once you have it off then set it to the side. Now you will see that there are the tiny little white beads inside. Do not dump the entire content of beads into the dark colored bowl! (I use the dark colored bowl since it's easier to spot and count the beads). Now while holding the capsule, tip it slightly to loosen the beads up and grab your pencil. With the pencil tip, easily scrape the beads out one at a time if you can. Always check your bowl and COUNT the white beads because you need to be exact. EVERY DAY YOU WILL REDUCE YOUR DOSAGE BY 5 WHITE BEADS! DON'T REDUCE BY ANYMORE THAN THAT OR YOU WILL DEFINITELY EXPERIENCE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS! Once you remove 5 beads from the capsule, screw the top &quot;cap&quot; on snug. You will have to wiggle it back on. Discard the beads preferably in an old medicine bottle with a child-proof cap. Take the capsule with at least a bottle of water to wash down and WITH food. Do not take with juice because I heard it can increase the effects of medications. So far I have reduced by Effexor dosage from 75 mg to 40mg with no side effects. I am really starting to feel like I am getting my personality back! Plus I have dropped a few pounds since my body is feeling alive again. I recommend this method to anyone wanting to get off this Effexor nightmare. Do not stop cold turkey or you'll be like a person experiencing a heroin withdrawal and that's not a pretty sight!
Extreme Apprehension or Fear of Social Interaction	m21belize, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	10/26/2010 1:30:10 AM	So far I have reduced by Effexor dosage from 75 mg to 40mg with no side effects. I am really starting to feel like I am getting my personality back! Plus I have dropped a few pounds since my body is feeling alive again. I recommend this method to anyone wanting to get off this Effexor nightmare. Anti-depressants are the worst meds ever developed. Especially since doctors hand them out like candy. Do not stop taking Effexor without sloooowly reducing your beads! Otherwise you'll be like someone going through a heroin withdrawal and that's not a pretty sight! It might seem like it will take forever but you will get off this beast! 
Panic Disorder	Jojo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	10/25/2010 9:19:05 PM	I've been skeptical for last 2 yrs on taking any anti-anxiety medication, but finally due to the worsening of my physical symptoms (panic attacks and shortness of breath in middle of the night, insomnia, high blood pressure), my doctor has prescribed what I refer to as the &quot;happy pill/miracle drug&quot;.  My first experience of taking this drug - within two hours of taking my first dose of 37.5 mg - I had blurred vision, fatigue and a &quot;fogginess sensation&quot;.  Same night, I had experienced insomnia, extreme night sweats and flue-like symptoms.   Above side effects has since subsided.  It's now been three weeks on same daily dosage, and am now re-experiencing blurred vision again and ringing in my ears.  As for my panic attacks and other symptoms at night, it's gone.  I'm currently on meds for HBP, and is closely monitored.  Pros-&quot;It definitely works - no more anxiety:)  You get a good night rest.  Live a normal life again&quot;.  Cons-&quot;What price do you have to pay?  Does the side effects of this drug really worth  living with?  Are the withdrawal symptoms really worse than what I was going thru b4 this &quot;wonder drug&quot;?  What are the long-term effects on your liver and other internal organs?  Is it really worth it?  I'm still debating on whether to continue Effexor or not since I have no intention of increasing my current dosage for obvious reasons.  I may go back to herb medicine since I never experienced any side effects as indicated above and no withdrawal symptoms.  **In conclusion, Efferol does relieve anxiety symptoms, and I have felt the immediate effects within two weeks of taking it. As for continuing on taking it, we'll have to see if there's any other alternate methods-Natual products, healthy diet, meditation and relaxation techniques, acupuncture and exercise...

I had crazy dreams for the first few months and occasionally after that period. Night sweats and dry mouth are the most common/continuing issues for me. I get headaches if I skip a dose and a 'buzz' after taking it post-skipped dose. Despite the side effects, this medication has really been a lifesaver.

Did not want to use HRT, herbal pills were not working for me.  I thought I was going to combust with the flahes day and night without sleep. One pill every night. If you miss one you will feel queezy and dizzy that day.  Sleep like a baby with strange dreams. But it's better then alternative for short term I have been using it for 10 months now.  It took 4 months for it to kick in.

It helped a great deal and the benefits of the drug outweighed the negatives. The negatives for me were extreme exhaustion and lack of ability to get up and do social things like I used to. I did continue to force myself to going out with my friends and became used to living with the exhaustion. Tho it was always nagging part of my life. Sleeping 11 hours + a night and still being tired. Not to mention the vivid dreams and drenching night sweats (not just sweat, but clothes are wet and sheets are wet to visible point - like an absorbed puddle almost).After 5 years I've decided to go off the medication, I feel my life is in a much better place and I'd like to try life drug free. Also, at this time, the negatives were outweighing the positives. I've been on a dose of Effexor XR 150 for 5 years. I've been weaning off for a full 5 weeks under the supervision of a psychiatrist that I see once a week. It went well at first but as I'm approaching my 3rd week on a quarter does (37.5) I've become really sick. Terrible headaches every day, vomiting, dizziness, motion sickness...its really debilitating and I'm now out of sick days for work. Aside from the actual physical sickness, I'm also having high anxiety and could burst into tears at any point. It could be a great joy or pretty much any emotion/feeling that triggers this. I wish I knew what I was getting into. I don't regret my 5 years on the drug and the way it helped me get my life back in order - but I was not prepared for the terrible withdraws from this drug.

My physician was going to take me off Effexor but I started experiencing horrible dizziness, vivid dreams, lightheadedness and headaches.  I could not think straight or concentrate.

My dr. recently added 50 mg wellbutrin, which &quot;speeds me up&quot; and not always in a good way.  Recent situation is fired from my job last week.  Feeling very sad, such a looser.

I am still having such a hard time because now I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks and I hate that my body is dependent on this drug now. Was once good but not as much now. What will I do in another few years? May have had the same reaction to the other meds as well, who knows.

Panic Disorder	mrm, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	9/26/2010 1:43:08 AM	Effexor XR has worked the best for me out of Paxil and Lexapro. I have been on Effexor for almost 10 yrs now. My life became free of phobic constant thoughts, panic attacks, and mild depression. It made me feel in control again and able to be a working mom of three. Now the drawbacks...missing one to two doses causes me to feel weepy, irritable, have stomach cramps and brain zaps. It's so important to take this med consistantly.  I have decided to come off my meds because I have absolutely lost my libido and almost my marriage! I exercise regularly, but have gained 15 pounds since I uped my meds to 150mg. ( I have taken 75mg for most of my yrs on effexor) My family doctor is going to ween me off slowly to help with the dreadful side effects. My advice is to take this med if you suffer with panic disorder and need a long term fix because it works wonders. I hope to manage w/out it...

My doc recently switched me from Celexa, which I felt was not working anymore (I was on it for three years). So I asked for something to deal with my three-month (like clockwork) &quot;OH MY GOD EVERYTHING IS WRONG THE WORLD IS ENDING I CAN'T GET OUT OF BED BUT FEEL LIKE RUNNING AROUND THE BLOCK LIKE A LUNATIC BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE I AM JUMPING OUT OF MY SKIN&quot; episodes. Sorry for the all caps, but trust me, those episodes are all caps worthy. I've only been on Effexor for a few days but feel rather zombie-like, have zero appetite, am dizzy, and feel nauseous. My doc advised me to stick with it for one month to see if it begins working. This is a tough decision for me, because although the Celexa did work wonders for a good amount of time with little to no side effects, this Effexor is making me nervous.

It kept me from killing myself, but it also kept me from having a life. I was like a zombie. I don't even remember much during those 3 years! I weaned off of it, very slowly, in a matter of 10 weeks, and it was pure hell. I felt like a heroin addict coming off heroin. I was put on wellbutrin 400 mg, and lamictal 300 mg and I am so much beetter. I have many friends who tell me I am so different now...more like my old self! The only way I woul recommed this drug is for someone who is suicidal, and has attempted sucide at least once. It numbs your feelings. GOOD AND BAD!

Simply not working well enough. On 450mg a day. Now being weaned off and put on Lamictal. NOT liking the &quot;coming off&quot;. VERY difficult to say the least. LOTS of dizziness and headaches and need to sleep all the time. Am being told it's normal, but it is AWFUL. Seeing DR this week in hopes for a &quot;bridge&quot; med to get through the transition. Be wary of ever coming off this one, even if necessary ask for extra help!

It has worked well for these years. REading any reviews can scare a person about any drug.  I take mine first thing in the morning. I was warned not to take it later than noon because of possible insomnia.  My diagnosis ranges from depression to &quot;change of life&quot; issues, as well as ADHD.I've been very fortunate to be able to obtain this medication and follow the dosing exactly 75 mg for me.  I do my very best to keep track of dosage and refill before I run out. For someone who uses it faithfully, it works....side effects? I haven't really had any.

Depression	KATT,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		8/21/2010 1:11:25 PM	I was given Prozac in 1997 for treatment of depression/anxiety. I stayed on it for approx 10 years and gained 40lbs. I took effexor for 3 years, gained more weight, slept,sweat, and had no sex drive. That was nothing! Coming off of it was an absolute nightmare. I ended up in the hospital. I was told my Dr. she DOES NOT perscribe it anymore because she can't get people off of it. I came off of it with a Dr. help (A PDoc not a family practitioner) over a years time. I have been off of it &amp; on nothing for 3 years and I have lost ALL the weight and feel good. Please work with a Doctor and come off slowly. DO NOT come off of it alone or any SSRI or SRNI work with your doctor. If you need it stay on it! Also, see a therapist! Talk therapy works a pill will NOT solve it all. I recommend a book by Dr.David Burnes-Feel Good. Cognitive Behavior Therapy is amazing.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Love, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	35-44	8/21/2010 9:34:32 AM	I have been taking Effexor for aproximately 1 1/2 years. At first I felt it was a God send because of the death of my best friend and horrible other losses and demanding job not letting up! I found I was tired than normal, I put on weight and had not near the same drive and motivation as normal. I am usually a top performer in sales and care very much about excellence and all the sudden, when you are use to an A performance C was just fine. Some of that was ok, I guess I needed a break from Ms. over achiever however, sleeping to much was affecting my life allot. I could just go to work come home and sleep and sometimes if I did not take a nap in the day I would be sick. Coming off the drug is the worst physical side affects I have ever experienced and I had no idea how long it will last. I am attempting to ween myself off and I am having horrible sweats, dizziness nause and horrible night mares. If you try to go off cold turkey it is so much worse than the stomach flu, you wish you were dead! I wish I had been given other choices and had known that this was an addictive drug. If I had it to do over I would have much rather endured the weeping and heart ache than the tremendous ordeal and physical side effects this has been! I cannot wait till this is entirely out of my body! Please if there is another non addictive drug take that! This is horrible!!! If you have to get up and work your life will be hell untill this has been cleansed entirely from your system. I am not sure how long that process takes but would love to hear a report of someone who made it off and how long it took them to ween from the drug and the side effects leaving.

I have tried several antidepressants for my anxiety disorder and this one seems to work the best for me. When I felt that I didn't need anything anymore the Doctor had me wean off and low and behold the  withdrawal symptoms that you read about for this drug were horrible... for two and 1/2 weeks I was nauseous and dizzy with vertigo symptoms non stop and lost weight. After the withdrawal wore away is when I felt that I needed something yet to help control my anxiety. I am now on the 3rd drug and am almost ready to tell my doctor that I'd rather be back on Effexor XR again. Only one other downfall other than the withdrawal symptoms is it causes low libido. We have to work on that one.

When your body adjusts, then it's like you're not taking anything at all.  However, if you forget a dose, you feel very weak and dizzy.  There are also unpleasant withdrawal (they refer to it as discontinuation effects) symptoms.....you feel absolutey horrible for days on end.  I wish I never took then, and cannot wait until my body adjuss to being off of it.  Be sure that you really want to take it, or that there are NO other options before you do.  If you must take it, ask your MD lots of questions.

Worked for hot flashes and the depression, however, - Life is very stressful weening off of it. The Tinnitus from the drug has become very difficult to cope with. My  Doc is taking me off (weening) effexor to go back on Zoloft. The five day 'no med' period is just awful. The well known brain shivers, headache, depression, zero concentration are debilitating. Will this stop once on the Zoloft - how soon after starting? I had actually thought that maybe I could start life anew with NO meds. Effexor weening is the most difficult medical experience I have ever had. I wouldnt wish it on my anyone.How much time would it take to stop these effects?
Depression	AmyC, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	8/10/2010 11:49:28 PM	I was prescribed Effexor for Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  I had pretty much tried all the other ones and nothing worked, I couldn't tell I was taking anything and I would just stop taking them abrubtly and nothing happened.  HOWEVER,  when I was prescribed Effexor, after the first few days I started having nightmares, I mean CRAZY nightmares and during the day I felt like I was in a fog.  It was the scariest feeling ever.  So I just stopped taking them. WHEW!! That's when I really thought I was losing my mind.  I called my DR but he never got back with me.  (It was a new DR)  So I got on the internet and read about it and I found all these other horror stories exactly like mine.  And you can NOT just stop taking them so as bad as I hated to I had to start back up and wean myself off them.  I take Klonopin now and it works awesome.  However,  it's not for depression, only anxiety so if you have depression you will need something with it.  I just wanted to tell my experience about Effexor,  I'm glad it helps some people, just be careful and ask a lot of questions to your DR ahead of time!!

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	MW, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/8/2010 8:57:09 PM	I experienced HORRIBLE anxiety after my first child was born, to the point that I could not sleep or care for my baby.  I hated life and asked my husband if we could give our child up for adoption.  I knew something was seriously wrong, so I went to the doctor.  They put me on Zoloft, but it didn't work and I didn't have several weeks to wait and see if it would work.  I went back to the doctor, and they put me on Effexor XR.  It started working within a few days and significantly increased the quality of my life.  I could take care of my baby again and began sleeping better and enjoying life again.  The only side effect I noticed was strange dreams, but that was a small price to pay for feeling human again.  I was on it for about a year and decided to wean off it after finding out that I am pregnant again.  I was on a dose of 75mg/day, and it took me about two and a half weeks to wean off Effexor completely.  The only side effect of weaning off was that my head felt &quot;floaty&quot; - I joked with my husband that I felt like a bobblehead.  I am starting to feel more anxiety again and may go back on it if it is safe to use during pregnancy.  I know Effexor is not for everyone, but it truly has been a miracle drug for me.

I have been on this medication since 05 and I believe I may not have survivied without it.  I take 225 mg. at night, no side effects.  I still feel a lot of sorrow over my son's death, but effexor helped me to cope.

I yawned at least ten or fifteen times every hour; at times it was almost constant.  I also began waking suddenly with tremors that scared the daylights out of me.  I won't even mention the sickly-sweet sweat that continually poured from me.

Unfortunately, I lost my job, then my medical insurance, and there is no way someone can afford this without insurance. Even the generic version costs way too much for a single mom with no job.

I had to leave work early as I keep hearing this 'swooshing' noise and getting so dizzy thought I was going to faint. Never had these problems before in my life, and Im 51 years young. Very tempting to refill the script, but gonna hang in there long as I can. Took tomorrow off as I have a feeling not going to be any better and I NEVER miss work ever. I was only on the drug 6 months, I cannot imagine the people that have been on it for years. ARG. I dont take pills ever and will never again. Last night puked my guts out, got mad at my husband (for no reason) and laid in bed having horrible nightmares. This morning I couldn't remember if it was a dream or real. This stuff is DANGEROUS and if the FDA wants to do some testing on me I am more han willing. My doctor is a greenie I cannot beleive she prescribed this to me. Im am miserable but going to hang in there if my head dont implode.

Didn't notice a big difference other than weight gain and lack of energy. However, I went off it 3 days ago and man oh man I thought I had a stroke until I read the reviews on this website. I am having what others referred to as 'brain zaps' everytime I move my head. I cannot even think they are so intense. Thank you folks for reviewing this as I really thought I was stroking out. Wow how weird today a little better than yesterday but my employees thought I was nuts today, cannot remember anything. Man o man. 
Depression	Tess_du_ville, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	7/28/2010 4:52:35 AM	I have been on Effexor XR, 150 mg. for 9 years and find it very helpful as a depression aid. I had to give up my job in L.A. and move to Las Vegas when my husband was transferred in 2000; this was a monumental step for me, causing great headaches and depression. Once when I went on a five-day cruise, I forgot to take this medication and experienced withdrawal involving nausea and stomach aches; that reaction frightened me, and I am very cautious now not to forget the appropriate amount of Effexor XR when I travel. I have had absolutely no negative side effects other than the one mentioned above. Many unhappy experiences have occurred in my life since 2000, but Effexor XR has helped me considerably, and I wouldn't want to change to another anti-depression medication. In fact, my doctor asked if I wanted to try Pristiq, a newer anti-depression drug; I did experience it for two or three weeks, and it was not a good or effective medication. I was teary and emotionally upset for the duration of the drug use. I returned to Effexor XR and felt completely better and more satisfied immediately.The only drawback is the expense of Effexor XR; I run out of insurance in June, and it costs me around $400 for a 90-count the rest of the year; however, I have to continue with it because it does the job.

Effexor has worked great I started with 37.5 for 2 weeks and now I'm on 75 for the last 3 months.  I have had minor side effects but overall they have gone away and I am enjoying life.

I was supposed to be on it until Sept. 2010, but due to the high cost and the fact that I took my last treatment at the end of March of this year, I decided to stop taking it.  I read a lot of blogs regarding the brain shivers, insomnia, etc. and was pretty apprehensive about going &quot;cold turkey&quot;, but decided that it couldn't be any worse than kicking a heroin habit.  It has been almost 2 weeks now and the first week I found myself being very emotional, crying for no reason, brain shivers, insomnia, etc. It was uncomfortable but not as bad as others have experienced.  I'm doing pretty well this week, still have the brain shivers, but they're not as frequent or as severe.  I would recommend reading the experiences of others BEFORE taking Effexor XR.  I have taken Zoloft in the past, but did not experience any withdrawal problems with it.

Depression	melly, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	7/21/2010 3:19:32 AM	I have never experienced side effects as severe as I have with effexor. I hate it. In less than a month the doctor increased my dosage from 37.5mg to 150mg while still on 150mg of Zoloft. I became severely constipated, vomiting all of the time, slept for 15 hours straight and I felt dead. I had severel panic attacks ( which have not occured so close together in years). Medication works differently for everyone but I honestly do not recommend this drug to anyone. There are other things out there. research and you will find the one to help you.

I couldn't get out of bed or even make myself food. But once I got on the Effexor, I felt SO much better! I had the energy to be active again! I was at 75g only and it still had a huge difference! Since it worked so well, they pushed me up to 300 and everything is going great!

My doctor increased the dosage to 150 mg. This was where all went wrong.The symptoms of needing an increase in dosage are similar to the symptoms of needing a decrease. I went the wrong way. For nearly 2 years I stayed on 150 mg- my attention span barely existed, my short-term memory was terrible, and I felt as if I was constantly in a fog-- much like the original depression. In an attempt to rid myself of all medicines, I quite cold turkey for about a week. The same withdrawal symptoms that everyone talks about- the brain &quot;zaps&quot;, dizziness, headaches, shaking, etc.- consumed me. What I did next saved my life in many ways. I went to ANOTHER doctor who put me on 37.5 mg. I began to feel stable for once. I felt as if I was back again; I felt like me. I have been on 37.5 mg now for a while, and all is well. I have no outbursts, no lows, and even no manic states. I truly believe that people's many bad experiences with Effexor are due to over-medication.

I went from Celexa to Effexor XR 75mg. and after, 1 week 150 mg. I had feelings like a panic attack (except I knew I wasn't dying). I fortunately had been on it such a short time (1 wk at 150 mg), I weened myself back off just like the dr. had weened my dose up. I think there are newer, or at least better meds. I also have chronic pain and major digestive probs which were made worse. I had been on Celexa for 12 yrs. Why mess with something that works? However, my 60 yr. old husband, thinks it is heaven- sent (although impotent for too many yrs. to count).

When I had so many person problems going on I had to take it. I was on it 1 year (75 mg) and no side effects. I could go on with my life without being tired like most anti-depression drugs. When I had to come off the drug it was a bit hard for about 1 month.  It was a lot better than any other drug the dr. tried to put me on. The only thing I regret is that my insurance stopped paying for it. It really does work.

I have been on it now for a few years and i have been trying to get off of it... i have had the worse time even with stepping down to the 37.5mg dosage from the 75mg that i have been on for years. The tingling in my face and head and hands and then sever panic attack that i can't breath and i know that i am fine but the withdrawls are horrible i don't recommend taking this medication unless nessary because it is very difficult to come off of it. I like the fact though that it kept me in control of myself and my emotions in check and i was able to think and still had energy to get up everyday. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	35-44	6/30/2010 12:40:36 PM	I have just renewed my script for my second month of 37.5 mg. I have lived with severe anxiety my whole life. The benefits of this medication in the past 5 weeks are AMAZING! I do have a few concerns, I don't care for the daily left temple headache that comes and goes through out the day; but not stressing about everything all the time makes me happier than I have ever been! The other two side effects I have are that it is NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE to enjoy sex or orgasm anymore and some nights I wake (3-5 am) and have HORRIBLE episodes of anxiety to the point of a panic attack much worse than before I started taking the Effexor.  I thought this medication was &quot;constant&quot;. Is there a &quot;low time&quot; with this medication?? No one else has commented on this in any other post so maybe it's just me? I am very worried about increasing or weaning from this medication per all the reviews here but I am SO COMPLETELY HAPPY during the day without all the looping crazy thoughts in the back of my mind that have plagued my life prior to the Effexor XR. Lastly, I also take Adderall for ADD, I am glad I talked to the Pharmacist before starting the Effexor, he told me that I needed to space the two medications a minimum of 2 hours apart every morning or I would not be happy with the side effects.

It worked for me; maybe too well. I feel like I have little emotions or empathy. I am a 51 yr old female who has lost all desire to enjoy a physical relationship with my husband. I blame this drug. Right now I am weaning off of it. These withdrawal descriptions are scaring the hell out of me! They are enough to create anxiety themselves! I do feel a little dizzy and occasionally feel slightly nauseous, but I have high hopes that I don't need this med anymore and can begin &quot;feeling&quot; life again soon. I plan to watch my diet and eat well and use exercise for stress relief. I hope it works.

However, I began feeling more and more aggitated and anxious. Plus, the weight gain and not able to stop it created &quot;image issues&quot;. I decided to come off the medicine. I spoke to my doctor and began the awful process of weaning off the drug. Once getting from 75mg to 37.5mg was not so bad. But then when I was down to nothing the pain began....the nausea, vomiting, &quot;brain zaps&quot;, tingling in my arms and legs, and feeling not in control of my emotions became too much to bear. I started lashing out at my husband and one night it got so bad I tried to committ suicide! I am in the process of finding other alternatives to control these symptoms...Valerian root and ginger tea have helped me the most!!I think doctors should warn of the pain and problems this drug has when one is trying to come off of it.

I have been experiencing some symptons that were very hard to explain until I read this user review and the most recent posting about the side effects from withdrawing off of effexor are exactly what i'm going through except my doctor didn't tell me to lower doses, just told me to stop and start zoloft. the first 2 days were. The sympton that has got me freaked out is the the &quot;brain zaps&quot; like explained from the last user. When I move my eyes or move my body a certain way i get those zaps in my head and sometimes it shoots down to my fingertips. I'm gogn to talk with my dr tomorrow. I just had to post this to say thanks to the last user review that warned about the withdrawl symptoms. I haven't had any other symptons but the one I have SUCKS and that's an understatement!

I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder at 17, &amp; experienced HUGE bouts of depression and anxiety.  Effexor has really tamed those down for me.  I sleep better &amp; my previously tumultuous relationships have calmed down a lot.  Generally, I'm just a lot happier.  At first, I had some motion sickness/dizziness &amp; eye blurriness.  But that went away about a week after starting.

What ever you do Do not take Effexor without reading the effects you will have when you want to come off it...#1 The effects you will live with when coming off this drug are not worth it....I weaned off the best way possible going from 150mg to 107 to 75 and finally to 37.5 over a couple months and still had to live with the worst side effects / withdraw symptoms you could imagine for months!!  You dont get warnings on this before taking this drug.  Look/google it up and read the horror stories before you decide to take this drug... You will be sooooo sick no matter what when you try to get off this drug.....tons of people can not get off because of how bad the withdrawl is.  You just can not function...You are to ill to move, you get so dizzy you vomit, you get weird brain zapping feelings, you cant concentrate, I was afraid to drive it was so bad and so on... #2 Now being off this drug and the side effects slowing  I feel so alive, motivated, happy,I can finally poop like normal and sex !! Being on Effexor you might as well forget sex... I forgot how fun it was (lol). I had no idea what this drug did to me, looking back just a month later and how I feel now,,,,Was I a walking zombie?...I dont know but Im so happy to be off it....I would not recommend Effexor to anyone!!! Personally I will stick to prozac...... Good luck to all....

Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	6/9/2010 1:08:30 PM	I have been on this since 2001 for bipolar. Started out on 75mg then I started to become depressed and went up to 150 mg. I could not handle that dosage at all, i felt drugged all the time so I weened myself back to 75mg, which took a week to feel &quot;normal&quot; again because of the side effects of the withdrawal! Over time, it has stopped working for the depression, but my mood swings are still being stabilized.  If you are getting it prescribed just for depression, don't take it! This is for bipolar disorder. The side effects you get if you miss a dose or horrible! As you will read in all the other posts here! I want to get taken off this drug to something else, the side effects or too much for me to take if I miss a dose. 
Depression	chelseabrock, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	35-44	6/8/2010 8:17:59 PM	Been on this drug for about 10 years, worked very well at first but over time it becomes very in-effective and the withdrawels if you miss a dose is one of the worst feeling ive experianced, sort of wanting to eat your own face off. I have cronic pain from 3 major back surgerys, my Dr wants to put me on Cymbalta but I hear those withdrawels are just as bad. I know to take my meds everyday but just being a few hours late is like missing the dose all together. And here I thought it was just a placebo...I think not. Good luck to you if you are just starting this drug, it's either a wonder drug or just another issue in your life, there is no in between

Felt great; symptoms went away.  I was always thin, size 6, but over a year gained about 15 pounds.  My diet/exercise habits did not change. All of the weight was in the stomach.  Felt bloated all the time; looking pregnant.  Dry mouth.  Just weaned myself off this drug.  It's been 4 days now without it.

Depression	Ethomas99, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	19-24	6/5/2010 5:36:35 PM	If you're reading reviews because you are considering taking Effexor, PLEASE READ THIS. I hope this medication gets taken off the market. I was put on 37.5 mg in a psychiatric ward while I was suffering extreme depression from drug abuse and psychosis in 2006. It helped a lot. My brain was so imbalanced from my drug use that at the time, I needed medication. However, the initial euphoric reaction I had to it faded, and my quack doctor increased my dosage more and more. By 2008 I was on 300 mg, the maximum dose. I stayed on it, out of fear. Why was I afraid? Because missing a dose even by a matter of hours made me experience severe withdrawal. In the beginning, I dropped 30 pounds in 3 months, but then gained it all back slowly and no matter how healthy I ate or how often I excersised, I couldn't lose weight. My hair also stopped growing. Finally with enough support from family and friends, I tapered down. It's taken almost 2 years to go from 300 to 75 mg. Each time I taper, I have debilitating withdrawal. Nausea, sweating, anxiety, mood swings, body aches, brain zaps (feels like fireworks going off in my head) and extreme trouble organizing thoughts. But my hair grew and I lost weight. My mood became stable and I was generally more upbeat. I stopped getting overly upset at small things and my energy skyrocketed. I have to wonder what must be in this medication that makes withdrawal reduce me to the fetal position, crying in a pool of sweat, and taking less of it makes my hair grow and restores my metabolism. I can't wait to be done with this. It's taken me to hell and back. It traps you into a physical dependency that makes it impossible to skip a dose or stop, because withdrawal is so scary and the half life is so short that if I forget to take it and leave for work in the morning, I have to anticipate getting sick by the afternoon. STAY AWAY FROM THIS STUFF, IT'S EVIL.

I have manic depression and severe panic/anxiety disorder. I believe it was an inherited from my parents as they both have the same disorder. I have tried everything on the market. My dosage is 750 mg twice daily. I now enjoy life to the fullest.

In that time I have been diagnosed with several different heart problems. NO problems before med. I feel like a slug while on it, but am afraid of &quot;DTs&quot; without it! DO NOT go without this medication unless you are under a doctors care, side effects are horrible! Nausea, brain zaps, dizziness, EXTREME mood eruptions, too many more to list. I really HATE this drug, but feel as though I am trapped. In a way I feel as though I can now relate to illegal drug users trying to get clean.
Depression	Panda, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	5/29/2010 2:34:41 PM	Lately I have been experiencing severe panic attacks and anxiety.  I am constantly filled with anxiety and am no longer able to concentrate on onything.  When I spoke with my doctor about this, she raised my dose from 300mg to 375mg.  Nothing seems to be working and I wonder if the effexor is causing some of this anxiety and panic attacks.  I rarely go out anymore in fear I will end up with another attack.
Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/26/2010 10:28:46 AM	I must say I am shocked at the amount of negative responses this medication has received. I was diagnosed bipolar when I was 12, I am 26 now, and this is the ONLY drug that has worked for me. I have tried many, many medications and Effexor has had the best results with the least amount of side effects. Granted, the withdrawals are terrible, but if you are responsible and don't run out before you refill, this is not a problem. I have had NO weight gain because of this medication. My opinion is this goes to show you that these types of medications work differently for different people, so don't put too much credence in these reviews.

My dose is 150mg once in the morning.  HOWEVER...I went to Hawaii on vacation and forgot my meds.  Luckily I was able to get more but it took 4 days.  The first 2 days without Effexor Xr were tollerable.  The last 2 days I was extremely suicidal.  My withdrawal symptoms included extreme suicidal thoughts, awful taste, heebie-jeebies, clothes felt like sandpaper, people touching me freaked me out, socially a mess and horrible nightmares.  The devil was one step behind me...Mind you I was on holiday in Hawaii.  Hours after taking my dose I felt reborn and finally enjoyed the wonderful environment. This drug is very powerful. Every debilitating reason I took the drug was hightened 10 fold during withdrawals.  I don't have the funds to pay for the drug so Wyeth has supported me with free meds through their patient assistance program.  ....................NEVER DRING ALCOHOL WITH TAKING THIS DRUG.  MAJOR BLACKOUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.................... I have read that some people have tried to get off it and could not.  COULD NOT.  Never being able to get off Effexor Xr makes me concerned, but alas, I will cross that bridge if I ever get there.
Depression	Amy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	5/25/2010 1:40:25 PM	I have been on effexor xr since 1995.  I have high blood pressure, due to my excessive weight gain over the last twenty years.  I was 150lbs when I started taking the medication and now I am at 200lbs and struggling to get the weight off.  I went to the gym four times a week put in vigious exercise for an hour and a half and all I could take off was 10lbs.  I watch what I eat and practically starve myself and still can not loose the weight.  I am planning on going off the medication after what I have read.  The side-effects just seem to get worse as the years pass.  It was effective in the beginning, but now if I don't take it everyday like clock work I can't funtion normally.  I appreciate all the other reviews and am happy to finally feel like I am not alone and other people have had problems.

I weaned myself off it last year but the doctor put me back on it. I get severe pain now, the headache's are blinding, I have lost well over 3 stone, and now im seriously thinking that my thyroid problem is the rare side effects off this pill. Ive been on these well over 5 years now and im being told I might have cancer. DO NOT TOUCH THESE TABLETS. THERE NOT WORTH ALL THE SIDE EFFECTS ive got young children too and some days its so hard I cant cope, I can barely go out the house because of these pills.  GET THEM OFF THE MARKET

While it was effective in relieving my depression, the withdrawl is horrible horrible horrible. The first time I ran out of medication before the refill arrived, I thought I was going crazy beginning about 48 hours after the last dose. I wanted off it, but was so scared to go off it. My doc finally started me on another drug and eased me off the Effexor, but it was awful even so. Even though it was effective, I will never go on it again. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	65-74	5/20/2010 7:48:11 PM	I was on 37.5mg of Effexor and still some anexity so the doc. put me on 150 mg of Venlafaxine. I was on this new dosage for 6 days and I began having side effects such as being weak in my knees to the point of close to falling, if it hadn't been for my husband catching me I would have fell.  My husband said my speech was slured also.  I think the dosage was increased too much at one time.  I will discuss this with my doctor.

I seem to manage my depression better.(in other words I have more good days than bad)I only notice it doesn't work as well right ahead of my period. Not a big enough concern to address. I have tried to come off of this before and DO NOT recommend doing so without a doctor. It is all about management of my depression for me. I wonder if something might work better, but am too afraid to come off of Effexor XR to try something else. It is expensive and at times I have had aid from Wyeth (the drug company that makes it)in order to take it. I am not aware of any bothersome side effects myself.

It seemed to work very well.  But I had no idea how hard it would be to stop taking. The cost got way too much.  Tried to stop but withdrawal was horrendous.  Even missing a dose was very bad.  Most Drs do NOT understand how bad  it is to stop.  This drug should come with a warning.  I have read so many people have tried to stop and can't.  PLEASE do NOT tae this medicine.  Find another.  Finally, I went to a psychiatrist to help me wean off.  I have been off effexor for one month now.  She had me take Wellbutrin and celexa.  I will have to wean off celexa but nothing like effexor.  The first 2 weeks after I stopped effexor were bad.  I had flu like symptons, aches, nausea dizziness and those brain shocks.  They have lessened.  I am still dizzy quite a bit but it is manageable. I began wellbutrin and celexa 2 weeks prior to stopping effexor.  I was on 75 mg effexor and stopped cold turkey.  Depression is good and I am so glad to not be a slave to that drug.  I plan to wean off all meds in 2 months and see how it goes.  I am starting to feel myself again.  I didn't think I was that numb on effexor but I was.

But the worse part is trying to stop taking it!  It is the worse symptoms I have ever had from anything.  It has lasted 4 days now and shows no signs of lessening.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!  Check the internet for other stories like mine - they are numerous!  If I had known, I would NEVER have started taking this in the first place.

I had tried Lexapro, Zoloft, and one other drepression med with no luck. I have struggled with depression since about 10 years old and within 3 years of taking Effexor XR in the 75mg dosage, I have been taken off depression meds completely. There are times that I feel I need it and I am comforted to know that if I do get a reoccurance of depression that I have something that I know works.

I am able to think clearly now and don't have the severe lows I used to. It's awful if I miss a dose though- vertigo, &quot;brain zap headaches&quot;, sleepiness and fatigue. It's also very expensive. But it does work.

If I forget to take it before bed, it's so much harder to wake up in the morning also. But the benefits overweight that by far.
&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs		4	4	1			5/12/2010 9:04:36 PM	this medication helped with hot flashes and mood swings, but the side effect are to much for me to handle. I have only been on it for 3o days 75mgs. Before I started the med I was walking 5 miles a day eating healthy, now I have a hard time getting out of bed I nap in the middle of the day Im dizzy and nausous all the time. I have no energy. My doctor is taking me off of then slowly. I would rather deal with the mood swings and hot flashes.

I was not advised of the horrific withdrawal symptoms. My GP prescribed me this without any discussion or explanation.  I was originally on 150mg per day and then reduced to 75mg (not without problems). Thereafter managed to reduce to 37.5 mg twice per day and then one 37.5mg per day. Each time I reduced I experienced withdrawal.  I recently stopped taking Effexor, on the advice of a Consultant. The withdrawal symptoms are terrible. I have electric shock like feelings in my head which travel down my arms whenever i move my eyes from side to side, extremely sensitive to sound, shaking, nausea, disorientation, vertigo, either insomnia or extreme sleepiness, nightmares, weakness, flu like symptoms. I have now reached day 6 off Effexor and no sign of the  withdrawal abating.  I am now seeking the help of a counsellor to assist me in coping with not only the withdrawal but the terrible mood swings.  My life has completely changed since taking and coming off this drug, and not for the better. I would say to anyone thinking about taking Effexor to think carefully before doing so and be aware of what you are going into.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	5/12/2010 2:39:40 AM	I have to say Effexor was THEE WORST drug I've ever taken and i was only taking 75mg! Aside making me feel more depressed, I gained an enormous amount of weight, had blurry vision, felt weak all of the time, restless legs, arms, hands &amp; throat; had less than no sex drive,  and my hair started to fall out (that was the last straw). Getting off of it s u c k s. The side effects were so bad, I was afraid to come off it completely so I cut down to the lowest dose for as long as I could until finally I stopped it altogether...but not before having the worst episode of blind rage I've ever had in my life, followed by anxiety attacks, brain shocks, and dizziness. Took almost two weeks after I stopped the drug completely to not feel any of the things above. Sure, I can be a depressed person (hence, why I take anti-depressants!) but Effexor made me an ultra-depressed crazy person and to be honest, i'm not sure how it has FDA approval. But again..this is just my experience, others have had success.

Gradually,the side effects started to out weigh the benefits.Extreme dry mouth,inability to cry at any time.(It,s just not normal to not feel sad EVER.)Absolutely no sex drive,which in itself was depressing.Getting off the drug was a horrible experience.The docs never seem to tell you that part of it.I started  at 75 mg/day and was increased to 150 mg.That was not good. I went back down to 75 mg and stayed there for a while.I finally got fed up with &quot;missing life&quot;, so I tried to get off the drug.It was a slow ,difficult process.It took over a year, gradually cutting down.First 75 mg every other day to 50 mg every other day and then 50 mg every three days.At that point I would go as many days as I could possibly stand it before taking a 50 mg dose.The withdrawal symptoms were vertigo,confusion,and the &quot;Brain zaps&quot; that only someone who has gone thru this can actually relate to. I am finally done with this med although I still have some of the zaps now and again. Do not go on this drug unless you are willing to give up all feelings (good and bad) and are done with sex.I am now on hormone replacement therapy and feel great.I changed docs too becuase he thought Effexor was the wonder drug of the century and would not switch me to HRT.

Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	55-64	5/5/2010 5:18:44 PM	The  drug works well for my depression.  In 2008, I was laid off and eventually could not afford health insurance or medication.  Effexor (no XR) was cheaper and available in a generic but it was not effective.  To go off Effexor XR is to dive into the black hole of insanity - confusion, depression, inability to reason (cook, pay bills, etc), 'brain zaps', suicidal thoughts and the belief that I would become homeless.  It was the scariest experience in my 20 years since diagnosis.  Fortunately I was able to get the drug from Wyeth and am again stable.  I do fear the next time I need to go off this drug for lack of funds or to change medications...just know that it will require medical intervention!

I am on what my doctor consideres is a half dose (75 mg) and am responding really well. The first few weeks were rough, but once I got used to the medication, I haven't had a single panic attack since. I have been able to fly, attend concerts, movies, and feel like my old self again. I wish I would have tried this sooner.

My doc switched me to another antidepressant with instructions to begin cutting down on the dosage. I became dizzy, shaky, sick, physically unbalanced. If I took a pill (venlafaxine), the symptons stopped. It took over three months before withdrawal problems stopped. I wouldn't take this med again for all the tea in China!

Worked great in the beginning but then had severe side effects. Nausea, throwing up, excessive weight gain(normally am small), dizziness, hip, leg and arm pains, nystagmus- which was the inability for my eyes to refocus so I couldnt drive or even walk straight, racing heart, chest pain, headaches...you name it. Basically had all the serious side effects. Tried cymbalta, didnt help, only caused weight gain. Now they are switching me to Remeron.

However, side effects got too severe to continue: sexual dysfunction, excessive weight gain, needed to sleep 10 or 12 hours a night, blood pressure SKYROCKETED, and I started having weird involuntary muscle spasms when trying to sleep (and throughout the night).Getting off it was difficult.  Even though I slowly weaned off it, I still got shivers every 5 minutes.  Ugh.

Side effects included serious restless leg syndrome, which I had to then take another med for that.  When I was weaned off the effexor..very slowly and under md care...I swear I was going crazy for sure.  'brain zaps' as they are referred to, a terrible experience!!!!  Very scary and very common from what doctors have told me.

I had been on Prozac for 6 years and then changed to Effexor. I take it for chronic pain and depression issues associated with chronic pain. I find Effexor to be the best anti-depressant by far. I took Paxil for awhile but cried all the time. I choose to stay on the Effexor. But like any medication it may or may not work for you. But for me...it works!
Depression	painter714, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/7/2010 1:07:01 PM	I have been taking Effexor for 16 years and it has been a life saver for me. I was having horrible panic attacks, general anxiety disorder, and depression. My doctors tried Paxil (made me sleepy) and Zoloft (same side effets as Paxil). I finally found a good psychiatrist who prescribed Effexor and Klonopin. This combination has worked for very well for me, with few side effects. I no longer have anxiety issues and am feeling relatively stable in terms of depression.

Became caregiver for parents. Retired. All things between 1995 and 2003. I also began menopause during that time. Took hormones, but could not tolerate them. Since taking Effexor I am more able to handle the stresses of life. It keeps me level. Much more calmer to handle situation with calmness

I had several with the most irritating being constipation and unable to ejaculate.  Withdrawal is terrible, just completed a 59 day withdrawal program and still had withdrawal problems for a week. All the side effects have now disappeared and I am taking 5 htp for anixety which is working very well.  Stay away from effeor or venaflaxine.

Depression	roxy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	3/30/2010 6:58:08 PM	I started taking Effexor XR about a year and a half ago to deal with a divorce.  It worked very very well.  I did experience some weight gain (about 10 lbs) and loss of interest in sex.  However, I still feel that if you need it you have to take it.  There's no point in suffering when there is something that can immediately help. After reading countless &quot;caveats&quot; about coming off it, I weaned myself off very slowly and with direction from my Dr. I reduced my dosage by 37.5mg 1 month at a time.  IT WORKED VERY VERY WELL.  I experienced little to no withdrawel symptoms.  I've been off the med for about 10 weeks.  Sadly I'm beginning to have more episodes of feeling depressed; not being able to get out of bed, having little-to-no energy, and am probably going to go back on it.  I really wanted to be &quot;free and clear&quot; of the med and I'm not sure that it's possible. Some people have a chemical imbalance and it's beyond their control.  Sadly I'm feeling that I'm one of those people...

It initially caused me diarrhea and headaches - one long medium headache for three monthes actually.  It helped with depression, mood stabilization, pain relief.  It still works for me.  Nil libido.   When I miss a dose, I feel fibromyalgia pain come on strong.  After reading these reviews, I am afraid to get off of this drug.  Brain shivers?!  yikes

I have had all the side effects everyone mentions, but only if i miss a dose. My greatest concern is the long term(vision or brain problems).  I hate being dependent on anything, but without this drug I am a nightmare for my family,,depressed, i suffer from PMDD. and anxiety also.  And this drug helped me to stop  all of that.  I have been on 150mg, but recently changed to 225mg. And I feel better, but do I have to keep going up??? I hope not.  Its an expensive drug, and my doctor says, I might have to be on it until menopausal age.???huh? Im scared of that.  I think the next step is to get a second opinion.  But it has helped me with my depressive/angry moods. I lost alot of wieght on it, my sex drive is back up (yeah), but I hate the (if you miss a pill 1 day) feeling. Its horrible.  I order early so I wont forget to fill prescription, to scared of side effects. What to do I dont know,,,,let me know if you have a solutin? should i see a phyciatrist?

Panic Disorder	Jennifer  S., 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	3/25/2010 8:10:21 PM	I Suffered from severe anxiety for years before I was prescribed Effexor XR-75mg once daily. It has changed my life and has worked wonders for me. I hardly ever have any episodes of anxiety or anxiety attacks like I did before and they were severe! Been on it for 10 years. The downside is definitely missing even 1 dose or trying wean off. It is horrible. Missing 1 dose makes me feel like I have the flu times a thousand. I wish I knew when I was prescribed this, just how terrible the withdrawals can be. As wonderful as it has been for me, it is scary to think what would happen if I got stuck somewhere w/o my Effexor!! Don't EVER try to stop taking this drug w/o consulting your doctor! I tried one time and made it for almost 4 agonizing days w/o my daily dose before I thought I was going to die. 
Depression	Sophie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/25/2010 4:24:55 PM	I used this and it was my miracle drug! It helped me in so many ways, but when it started to lose effectiveness then I was taken off of it. My Doc took me off cold turkey and I would not suggest that to anyone. Withdrawls were/are awful!! But I'm still thankful that I was able to be on it and have some 'normal' time. But here I go again, trying to find something that works! 
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/25/2010 3:31:56 PM	This medication gave me bad side after 8 months of trearment.

I had my Dr to take me off of this medicine, &amp; I no longer have the headaches or loss of memory.
Depression	shivers, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	3/25/2010 11:23:29 AM	I was on Effexor XR 75 mg for about 5 years.  I suddenly began having a dizziness that was unexplained.  Emotionally, I felt good though, and thought maybe it was time to get off the drug.  I reduced my dosage down to 37.5 for two weeks, then cut the few remaining pills in half for about 10 days.  What ensued from there has been a nightmare.  I was having severe brain shivers most of the day every day for over two weeks.  Brain shivers are like an electrical stimulus to your brain.  My emotions and sensitivity to light and sound were severe.  My doctor was totally unavailable to me during this process.  It has now been over a month and all of these symptoms are still happening, although to a lesser degree.  However, I believe this is a VERY dangerous drug and would recommend against starting it.  If you are on it, try switching to something less severe and then titrate off.  There is no way of knowing the length of time I will have to suffer with these symptoms and apparently there is no relief from them.
Bipolar Depression	jer, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	3/25/2010 3:36:58 AM	I was on this drug for 5 days. Unfortunately I experience many of the side effects. My body simply did not agree with this drug which I am told is in the same class as Prestiq. Nausea, the runs, loss of appetite, insomnia, shakes, tremors, chest pains, sweats, flu like symptoms, the shakes, increased anxiety and fear of dying increased. I'm trying Paxor now instead.

Depression	WhoamI, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	35-44	3/23/2010 12:54:43 PM	I was on Celexa prior to Effexor XR and I am going to see a psychiatrist now to find a better med.  I still have serious anxiety and hives as a side affect of the Effexor which occurred right after switching to 150 mg up from 75.I am a 40 year old, single mother of a 3 year old with a PFA against my daughter's father, along with chronic back pain due to disc problems and a type one diabetic for 30 years.  What a train wreck, right?

HOWEVER the withdrawl symptoms when you decide to stop taking Effexor are TERRIBLE. Nausea, vertigo, brain shivers, hot flashes, insomnia to name a few.  And they take weeks to months to stop.
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	3/22/2010 1:57:58 PM	I have been on this drug for over 8 years. I just recently began having vision problems.  I was taking 150 per day and am now trying (under the docs orders) to wean off of them - taking 75 per day - so far so good.  After reading all of the comments I am apprehensive of what I will experience when I am totally off of this drug.  It has REALLY helped with my depression, though.
Depression	K9Lover, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	3/21/2010 8:37:38 AM	I quit smoking in 2001 and started taking Paxil at that time. After about 4 years, I opted for anotber due to the horrific weight gain. My Dr. recommended Effexor CR. I started at 35 mg and went to 75 shortly afterwards which I was happy with. In January 2009, I opted to see if I was able to do without the meds. I slowly reduced my dosage from 75 to 35 over 5 months. By my sixth month, I was 100% antidepressant free. My withdrawal symptoms by weaning myself off slowly were minimal, but due to the high stress of my job and my minds tendency to make things much, much bigger and dramatic than what they really are I decided, along with my Dr.'s recommendation, to return to taking Effexor CR. The side affects such as sexual, weight gain, forgetfulness are minimual in comparison to being without it....at least at this time in my life. Maybe some day. Just not right now.

I recently have been going through menopause and have been experiencing major hot flashes.  My dr. put me on effexor to stop hot flashes. (I'd never heard of this either)  From day one my hot flashes were gone but I wasn't able to sleep at all.  I'm taking 37.5 two times a day. I've started taking my 2nd pill at 2 p.m. instead of bed time and that helped me sleep. The Dr. will increase my doseage to 75mg twice a day in a week but I don't think I'll go that high.  All these commemts are making me a little nervous about this drug.  It feels like my blood pressure is a little higher than normal.  I take hbp meds too.

I am taking two pills at 75 mil. My throat always feels like it's closing up on me. I can barely swallow. It feels like I'm swallowing through a straw. I have headaches &amp; I get dizzy easily. At first I thought I was sick with a cold, but I soon realized it was because of the Effexor. I heard the withdrawal sythoms are a horror so what do I do? How do I get off of this medication?

Was put on it for Panic Disorder..now have severe depression, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, stomach problems.  Not worth and cannot get off of it...withdrawal symtoms are more terrible than I can ever describe. Tried 7 times to get off of it.  Life is not worth living on it.

Depression	DOMCOC, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	3/16/2010 11:42:14 PM	For 10 years, I took Effexor XR (300mg) for for a major depression and recently started to come off them. It's not because I no longer suffer from Depression but because it affected my sex life and Stopped me from feeling anything, good or bad. It's now 2.5 weeks that I have been off the medication and the side effects have been extremely difficult. I suffer from Migraine's but since stop taking the medication, I get one every night combine with the shakes, chills and nausea. Sleep is difficult as I have cold sweats at night and sometimes wake up shivering out of control. I find myself having to take sleeping medication so I can sleep the entire night. I do not know how long these side effect last but I hope the disappear. I hope this help anyone thinking of stop taking this medication...you are not alone, these side effects are real and happen to more people...I thought I was a lone until I read some of the reviews.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/16/2010 6:44:16 PM	I was on effexor for about 5 years for depression. I was not warned of the terrible side effects including a very weird sensation in my brain that felt like it was tremmoring, along with the shakes and chills if I missed even 1 day of the medication. Weening myself off of it was even worse, with those side effects amplified times ten. I also developed a severe anxiety disorder after coming off it 2 years ago that I have been struggling with ever since. Effexor's website says it is perfectly safe and not addictive. THIS IS A LIE. I regret ever taking Effexor, and I wish I did more research before taking it. 
Depression	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	3/15/2010 7:43:02 PM	i have taken effexor xr regularly for over 5 years.  the side effects of going off of it (missing from one dose to several) are so severe i get anxiety just thinking about it.  i recently went off of it suddenly and the withdrawal symptoms ranged from the most severe nausea I've ever experienced (including vomiting) to hyper-sensitivity through my fingers to a brain-clicking feeling like a cd that keeps skipping to anxiety and emotional upheaval.  the side effects lasted about 2 weeks and I've decided not to take the medication anymore because i don't EVER want to have to experience them again. ever.

My prior experiences with anti-depressants has not been positive (dramatic mood changes), but with Effexor I am &quot;even&quot;.  I am able to cope and manage my depression and anxiety with the medication.  I believe I will always have sever depression and anxiety, but Effexor helps me function a quasi normal life.  The effects can be dramatic, I have two friends who suddenly and scarily became suicidal whilst under Effexor.  They obviously sought other treatment, but I have never once had such thoughts-thankfully.  I occasionally experience &quot;brain shivers&quot; which, while unnerving, does not last long.  I do fear what effects there are to my brain and vision in the long term (many new medications long term studies have not been conducted).

Effexor does not  help with any ofmyback  pain  as the cymbalta seemed  to help a bit. My doctor refuses to change me back.

Effexor is not perfect in that I still get sad and angry once in a while.  But it &quot;takes the edge off.&quot;  I fall asleep much easier too.  I am worried about stopping this because of all the reported problems of withdrawl.  But for now, I know that I need the medication to keep me level-headed and less edgey.

Was on Zyprexa 20mg before that which made me gain weight,tired and lazy.I can actually go out of the house and be sociable.Only one downside i can find, which i might add is common with alot of posts, is you miss 1 dose you certainly know about!I take mine in the morning.No weight gain side effects for me.If anything i have more tone. All the weight i gained on Zyprexa is gone. Blood pressure is great as well.

The one (big)problem I found was a decrease in my sex-drive.  And if I miss a day or two the side affects are NOT fun.  I feel HORRIBLE and get mad at the stupidest things.  I don't want to be dependent on this drug but on the other hand I am afraid to get off of the drug.

I don't know what to do about that, it's very frustrating.sometimes I do get lightheaded and I find myself having horrible night sweats sometimes. however it has helped my mood and anxiety problems. I've been on it for 4 months and just wish I could find a cure for the sexual side effects

Within the last year I started sweating a lot, my hands shook more, and it became harder to think clearly and not get irritated and angry (even at 75 mgs). I could not work feeling this way and I quit my job, so I decided to get off Effexor when my insurance ran out.  Whoa! Talk about side affects! The doc gave me 37.5 mg pills to take for 2 weeks to taper off, and now I have been on zero Effexor for one week.. and I have major ringing in the ears, nausea, dizziness, shaking, constantly tired, can't sleep, and bizzare crying jags over little things that never bothered me before.  I am hoping that this will all subside within the next week or so.  I have to agree that the benefits of Effexor are not worth the withdrawal symptoms.  I hope and pray they are over soon.
Depression	cajun2core, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	3/7/2010 5:53:26 PM	I got on Effexor when I was severly depressed due to marriage problems and I was suicidal.   It got me through one of the roughest years of my life.   However, getting off of it was nearly impossible.   I had the worse case of insomia that I have ever had when I tried to get off of it.  I had to taper it down very slowly. I started at 150mg and ended at 37.5mg.  Even on the 37.5 mg I had to start taking it every other day then twice a week before finally getting off of it just a few weeks ago.  It took me months to get wean myself off of it.   The bad news is, my father is dying and I just lost my job (no I am not making this up) so I may have to get back on it to deal with the depression.    To me the good things were worth having to wean myself off of it.

Have been on it 9 years.  Most important: I once tapered down from 300 to 37.5 without any side effects at all.  Just did it slowly.  Then I worked back up to 150 which is lower than I had been taking and am doing great.

It has pulled me out of the darkest deppressions of my life twice now and I'm alive today because of it.  Yes it's VERY difficult to get off of, I decided to discontinue it once and it was horrible! Needless to say 2 years later I found myself in the worst depression of my life and once again Effexor pulled me out of it.  I'll never stop taking it again, Effexor allows me to live a normal depression free life.

I was on each of those anti-depressants for long enough periods of time to know that they were doing nothing for my depression.  Effexor XR, started at 37.5mg a day, increased to 75, increased to 112.5, increased to 150 and finally to 300mg per day and I have almost forgotten what depression is.  It's the best treatment I have ever been on for my moderate to severe depression.  And all with not one adverse side effect.  Oh, well, except for the weight gain.  I'll take the extra pounds in exchange for the heavy weight that has been lifted, for seeing a vivid world instead of a gray world.

They were really bad when I missed multiple doses (because I did not have a refill).  I take them in the morning because if taken in the afternoon or evening I get terrible insomnia.  My body jumps a lot when I sleep.  Recently, I changed prescription providers and started to get the zappy feeling even when I take the medication and do not miss a dose.  I read in another review that increased exercise or sweating caused this person to get that zappy side effect so I'm thinking that is a possible cause of my zappy feelings instead of pharmacy issues.  I take 225 mg/day and still get terrible PMS every month.  I've been on the medication for over 5 years with a steady increase in the dosage.  I am afraid to stop taking this medication, even with the consultation of my doctor, because of the withdrawal side effects.

I was confident, outgoing, goal-oriented, happy. Six months in I started to get sudden spinning sensations, like someone reached into my head, grabbed my brain and twisted.  This turned to shocking zaps that would temporarily blind me.  I describes this to both my primary MD as well as psychiatrist and neither had a clue of the cause.  18 months in my dosage was increased and I suddenly got severe fatigue and my temperature dropped as low as 95.6F. My husband (and I if I was even capable of caring) thought I would die.  Getting off this medication, even tapering off as directed, was one of the most aweful experiences of my life.  Almost three years later and I still have occasional &quot;brain zaps.&quot;
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	55-64	2/20/2010 6:18:44 AM	I have avoided nightmares by taking Efexor at night. This also helped with nausea and vertigo in the early stages until enough accumulated in my system. The reverse happened when I was first  weaned off it.So taking it at night was right for me and it also kept me awake during the day so I slept better at night. However the weight gain, high blood pressure and cholesterol have caused me to decide that the side affects could possibly be more dangerous for me than the depression. Anyway I have decided to very gradually get off Efexor, again and hopefully forever, with the help of my doctor.I agree that it is most important to be as knowledgeable as possible before deciding to take it.

Depression	Jude, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	2/19/2010 5:28:21 AM	I have read many of these reviews and can relate to much. Was told by family Dr. Efexor 'was not addictive'(you can become addictive to anything really), I would need to take forever and that if I weaned off it it I would need higher does to bring me around the next time.I did successfully drop 75mg daily for 2 years. It was not what I believe to be depression that returned. No sleep for 3 days lead to my mind running 100 miles a minute while my body seemed to move in slomo. This is one serious drug. Returned to Efexor 150mg and I awoke to electrical impulses in my head that were likefireworks and my body shook uncontrolably Result meds increased  to 175 mls. been ok for 4 yrs but weight increase caused hypertention which caused mild stroke so now i'm on stroke whatch.. Whatever decision we make about medication it all comes down to quality of life... and what the alternatives are. So research and research again then make an educated decision whether to continue or not.

Depression	love spring, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	2/18/2010 2:30:23 PM	This drug caused an increase in my cholesterol to 325. I developed gall bladder problems - not gall stones but sandy sludge - need removal of gall bladder. Which caused other medical problems. I am on other anti-depressants and have cholesterol level of 153. I researched on the internet and found that high cholesterol is a side effect of effexor.  Also be careful if drs prescribe combination of anti-depressants that are related to the combination in effexor.

I had taken Serzone years ago (for 8 years) finally my doctor wrote me a prescription for it.  For me works great and no weight gain.  In fact I have more engery, because it is working, that I have lost weight.

I started off on 75 MG a day which worked very well and quickly.  Then, after a week, I moved up to 150 MG a day and did not notice any improvement in mood but I noticed a substantial increase in side effects.  I stayed on for a few months but decided the side effects were so strong that I rather look for another medication or natural way to deal with my issues.Side effects were strong while on the medication.  Increased sweating and loss of appetite.  Also, an increase in migraines.  The WORST part of this was coming off the meds.  I  weaned myself off for about a month and it was the worst thing I have experienced with medication.  I was dizzy, sweating and constantly moody.  I felt like I was a recovering drug addict...

Furthermore, I am experiencing disquieting symptoms called &quot;brain zaps&quot; if a dose is missed, delayed and as I attempt to taper-off the drug.  Prescribing doctors seem mostly unfamiliar with these symptoms but internet reports of the withdrawal issues are common and need to be investigated.  Are these mini-seizures?  Controlled research needs to be undertaken with scientifically based recommendations following for those of us experiencing &quot;brain zaps&quot; that cause momentary disorientation.  Perhaps we need an investigation into this by FDA or a watchdog group to determine what the manufacturer knows, when they had the information and what is being done to protect the public!

My Dr. said I was suffering from postpartum depression. I have never taken any medication, besides the Effexor. It helped with the anxiety. But the depression didnt go away. I was on 37.5 for 5 months and went to 75 until recently. I am now tapering off, per Dr.'s orders. I feel like I am going to go into shock. I am so dizzy and sick that I cant even drive. And I am very grouchy. I have no idea how long this will last. My Dr. 'promised' it would not be this way. Another lie from a Dr. If you are considering this drug, please choose something with better withdrawl effects. This is soo not worth the little help it gives.
Depression	BlueCatLover, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	55-64	2/15/2010 7:11:11 PM	I've found that over the 10 years I've been taking Effexor XR (150MG) that I have become more irritable, have trouble sleeping, and have had an increase with ADD.  I fly off the handle quite a bit. My husband would describe me as &quot;hyper&quot; a lot of the time.  I tried weaning off of this drug while increasing a new med - Wellbutrin - at the recommendation of my doctor.  The withdrawal from the effexor, once I was completely off of it - was HORRIBLE!  Brain zaps, dizziness, night terrors (even when taking an afternoon nap) - oh, and very very tired - I started just curling up on the bed and falling asleep once I was off of the Effexor. The Wellbutrin gave me serious stomach problems, so this doc said &quot;I don't want you taking anything (meaning anti-depressents) until we know what's going on with you.&quot;  Well, my cat died the day after I stopped taking everything and I damn near went suicidal.  I mean I went completely beserk, had crying jags, etc.  Got back on EffexorXR (37.5 mg) immediately per my primary care physician's insistence. I have since found new medication psychiatrist who suggested that maybe the Effexor's effect on my norephinephrine was just too much for me.  At least at my current low Effexor dose 37.5 mg, I don't have constipation problems anymore, and my libido has returned &quot;just a little bit.&quot; (thank goodness).  I'm ramping up on Zoloft again (per doc's suggestion) - it did wonders for me when I first started taking in in 1994-2006 (and I lost weight, too) so maybe it will help me again.  I sure need something to pull me out of my current depression.  But the Effexor WITHDRAWAL effects ARE HORRIBLE - and I'm a little bit scared of going completely off of it for that reason.
Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	13-18	2/15/2010 1:47:13 PM	At first this seemed like a miracle drug. It gave me lots of energy, made me very happy and optimistic, controlled my appetite, and even seemed to help my fibro pain! I was so excited but after about 3 weeks I had to go off it because the side effects became too much for me. I had many, and some may have been allergic reactions. I experienced: tremors, fainting, loss if coordination, insomnia, blurred vision, peeling rash around my mouth, racing heart, irregular heart beat, &amp; shortness of breath among some other things. I went off cold turkey and the withdrawls were awful but I needed to get off it quickly. It was very disappointing since it was working better than any other anti depressant I'd been on...
Depression	ECAS, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	45-54	2/14/2010 7:13:15 PM	I have been on this medication for about 2 years.  I have tried other meds but this seemed to do the trick in a better way.  BUT, I have been sweating a lot. Only from the neck up.  My doc thought it was anxiety but I don't think so. In the last 6 months I have been sweating more and my depression seems to be worsening. Please don't think that once you find a medication that it is the answer to all. Keep logging changes or differences you notice and then try to determine any of the sources. My doc didn't want to change me to another med, but I insisted last week! I hate what I hear about  going off this drug, but there must be something better than how I am living now!

Although it has helped with my depression ,as many people have stated in their reviews, you cannot miss one day or you cannot stand up. I am pretty tough but believe me you are dizzy, nauseu and your head feels like a baby's rattle. I would love to break free of this pill but I'm so afraid of the withdrawal effects.

I haven't lost any weight yet, but I've only been taking this medication for a week and a half.  I am going to go back to Prozac 10 mg b/c I felt a lot more energetic and actually lost 15 pounds on it.  I was much happier on the Prozac.

I take about 1 hour before bed each night. It has worked wonderfully for me.  I have missed an occasional dose with no problem.  Started out at 37.5mg for 1 month, now at the 75mg level. The night sweats have all but stopped, which allows me to get a restful nights sleep.  It has made a tremendous difference overall, I'm back to my happy, positive self.  I feel like the old me before menopause began.  My husband &amp; I can cuddle again without me having to pull away due to hot flashes!I also was experiencing increased migraines before Effexor which I suspect was largely due to lack of sleep (and hormone flux because of menopause).  These too have been less frequent.  I have not noticed any weight gain with this product and I found I have lots and lots of energy again.  After reading the other reviews regarding addiction, I do intend to speak to my doctor about going back down to the 37.5mg level.  Even that level made a big difference in the night sweats.  I am not a proponent of taking pills for everything, but believe me I tried all the 'natural' remedies with no success.

You must take it at the same time of day (i take it after dinner)everyday to avoid drenching NIGHT SWEATS,headache and feeling like crying. I noticed WEIGHT GAIN of about 10 pounds over the last 2 years. Too bad it's so expensive.

I had been on various dosages of Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil with either poor side effects (inability to orgasm) or poor effectiveness. Doc put me on 150mg of Effexor XR. It helped my depression, anxiety and libido but the side effects and withdrawl were horrible and TOTALLY debilitating! I was getting my prescriptions through MedCo's mail order system so it was very easy to be out of meds and at least 3 days from getting any more. The worst withdrawl symptom was a nauseous dizzy feeling in my head. I could not move around without feeling as though my brain were somewhat disconnected from my head. It would worsen with each day to the point of nearly vomiting! Let me be very clear here, I could not move my body without feeling like I was going to barf! And I have an iron stomach! Another serious effect that I have experienced is hand tremors. It has been 12 years since I began taking Effexor XR and 4 years since I stopped and my hands still shake, sometimes so bad that people ask me if I have Parkinson's Disease!! Most of the time people say nothing but look at me like I am a junkie! I have been to the Doc and they ran tests and have no explanation- even though I KNOW that I never had this problem until I went on Effexor XR. I would recommend this pill because it helped me overcome a severe depression but I caution strongly against it if you have a hard time keeping a pill schedule. The Doc's didn't want me to go off of the pill. They said depression was &quot;in my genes&quot; and I would fight it my whole life. Well, as a biologist, let me tell you that THAT is NOT always the case. I have been anti-depressant free for 4 years and I have never felt more clear, fresh, raw and happy than I do now. Sure there are bummers, sometimes every day. But I just focus on the good parts and count my blessings with my shakey fingers every moment I remember to!

IF MY DOCTOR HAD BEEN HONEST ABOUT THE SIDE EFFECTS, I WOULD HAVE NEVER TOUCH THE DEVIL PILL, BUT WHO KNOWS, MY DOC PROBABLY GOT A BONUS FOR PRESCRIBING THE DEVIL PILL TO ME.  IT HAS BEEN ABOUT ONE WEEK SINCE I HAVE NOT TAKE THE PILL AND I HAD TEMPTED VERY MINUTE TO TAKE ONE, BUT SINCE READING THE OTHERS EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PILL, I AM MORE DETERMINED NOT TO TAKE ONE.

I would get dizzy spells that I could feel down into my fingertips. Don't know how else to explain the sensation of that. It worked well for me as an anti-depressant but I couldn't deal with the side-effects.

Lexapro was not helping ..maybe making it worse (according to a Federal study) I was on Lexapro...but my income decreased so I needed a generic. My shrink put me on generic Effexor. I did not know why immediately but my GI doctor figured out why I was getting nausea...it was due to effexor...he is a smart guy. After a few weeks the side effects passed.I no longer have highs or lows but can function without fear and anxiety. Unfortunately I am still falling victim to spells of obsessive thinking and acting on these after awhile. I do not have the daily OCD,...the trembling hand washing etc but get fixated on things or a course of action contrary to all the best advice. It has caused me problems and cost me money in the real world...plus a lot of humiliation. Being aware of my lack of awareness when I am in a spell causes me suicidal thoughts...probably just self-pity but I am an adult and soemtimes cannot find real reasons to live...on the contrary I find more reasons to be dead. I attend 12 step meetings however and have listened to folks like me who after years realized their life had completely turned around until they were &quot;happy, joyous and free&quot;. I also hear at these meetings about the ones who self-destructed, either immediately thru suicide or slowly thru alcohol and drugs. I do not think God wants me to kill myself but I do wish he would fast-track my spiritual emotional, mental, physical, situational and locational recovery.Effexor okay but Lexapro made me feell better and Celexa really helped me  fast when I went into severe depression. I would like to be completely drug-free but do not want to be the same person I was. Have not put on any weight but it is hard to tell about side effects because I take other drugs as well.

Depression	Jamey , 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	1/24/2010 10:04:55 PM	I have been on the medication for a long time and I do notice withdrawal effects if I do continuous exercise or sweat too much.  Maybe my body metabolizes the drug really fast.  I have had no weight gain or other troubling side effects except horrible nightmares. What's more troubling is that I wake up screaming and kicking.  then i go back to sleep and it picks right back up. I have been on other SSRIs and the same thing.  I wake up exhausted.  I will say that it works better than the others I have been on.
Depression	scurtis, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	25-34	1/23/2010 7:11:47 PM	Over a year later and I still have the sound sensitivity side affect.  Absolutely ridiculous to wean off of as well.  It took me two months of taking a few more granules each day until I was down to zero.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	1/23/2010 5:27:25 PM	When I first started taking Effexor, I had horrible ringing in my ears. Then came the weight gain. All told, I've gained about 45 lbs. My psychiatrist has repeatedly told me that this drug &quot;doesn't cause weight gain&quot; but hey, it's right there on the label. My mother also gained about that much weight, but the dr. kept insisting it was my diet or exercise, neither of which changed. Most of the weight was in my abdomen, making me look about 6-7 months pregnant. She put me on Topamax to help lose the weight. Now I have side effects from that as well. I will be switching medications (and doctors) very shortly, just trying to time it correctly for some life events since I've heard the withdrawal is terrible.
Depression	buddy, 75 or over on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	3			1/22/2010 5:06:52 PM	have taken it for 10  years it is not fully helping relieving depression
Depression	Dmizzle, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	1/22/2010 10:07:47 AM	You must take this med. exactly as the doctor tells you to. my depression was severe and this med really saved my life. like all anti-depressants you are never really happy but you really are not sad. its kind of like you just exsist. But exsisting was alot better than the pain from depression. Now when you quit taking this you need to slowly come off, it is horrible cold turkey. If you skip a day you will know and all you want to do is to take one and you will feel better. But the reason getting off for me was i was tired of not really caring.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	35-44	1/21/2010 6:33:38 PM	This medicine helped me at first but when I stopped taking it I went through horrible withdrawal. I felt out of control and I would have ringing in my ears that would'nt go away. I would ask lots of questions before I accepted this as a form of treatment!

I doin gquite well now.What a difference !!!!
Depression	notgood, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	45-54	1/19/2010 8:00:10 AM	I have suffered severe depression since 1980 and I was put on effexor xr 150 mg a day (1999) and it took some of the edge off but was not nearly good enough.  10 mg lexapro was added and this was better but still not good enough. I still am depressed to the point of severe crying and hopelessness. I have been on so many differant antdepressants and anti anxiety and other medications. I am fed up with Phyciatrists and MD'S.   I am now looking into vitamins at( doctoryourself.come) and exercise and juicing vegetables.

Extreme Apprehension or Fear of Social Interaction	Blue Collar, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	1/16/2010 1:07:15 PM	An absolute godsend for me. After having lived a life barraged with social anxiety disorder coupled with depression, I had finelly gotten to the point of going to my doctor and asking for help. The best way I could express my condition to him, was by saying,&quot;Something's wrong.&quot; I was loaded with self-doubt, could not make ANY decisions with a measure of confidence, had paranoid thoughts on a near daily basis, and suffered from enormously heavy feelings of guilt (reliving bad scenes &amp; bad decisions I've made  in my lifetime.) Was started on 75 mgs. or Effexor XR five months ago. My life changed instantly!! It helped with the anxiety within a couple of hours, and all the irrational negative thinking has subsided.Downsides are involved though. For me, there were two.And they were major for me. Libido prblems and extreme tiredness. Both issues have been minimalized through pinpointing MY correct doseage, and my body adapting to the medication. After topping-out at 225mgs.(way too much for me) I have zeroed in on my proper dose; maintaining the wonderful effectiveness of the medication, and nearly ridding myself of the unpleasant side effects. I say nearly because they are still there... however, they are very slight. Also, I did wean myself off completely back in Nov. and DID NOT have any of the horribles effects I am reading about on here. I DID however experience &quot;my old self&quot; immediately! Needless to say, I restarted the medication and am having huge success on the smallest doseage of 37.5 mgs. per day. This is enough for me, and I have a Keith Richards' like constitution!! That being said, I am amazed that such a low level dose has affected my life in such a miraculous way!!!
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	1/15/2010 5:27:44 PM	I was on 300 mg of Effexor XR for a year after taking Lexapro and Zoloft in the past. It initially helped and I did not experience any of &quot;zapping&quot; side effects others have described. I also didn't notice any stomach/bowel difficulties that my brother who is also on it suffered if he missed a dose. However, I found myself turning into a zombie and went off cold turkey - very big mistake. My doctor was able to eventually wean me off of it over a 3 week period of time and am doing much better on Welbutrin.
Depression	sacredworld, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	45-54	1/13/2010 3:51:19 PM	I was given lots of other drugs to try before Effexor XR nothing worked however this one did. I am now trying to get off the drug and stopped taking it three days ago. At first i thought I was OK until the mind and body zapping started! I have just popped on of the pills today and will try to then go for another couple of days until I get off it completely, if i can stand the electric currents that keep going through my body everytime I move.Don't take it if your GP recommends it to you.

Since they took me off Premphase, the hot flashes are back (after about 10 years of both) and if I miss a dose of Effexor, it's like my nerves are buzzing in my head when I turn it or whatever.  It's horrible.  I wish I could get off, cuz the hot flashes are there, especially when I get upset. I guess I never realized it until I quit taking the hormones. But I don't know how to get off.
Depression	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	1/11/2010 1:41:26 AM	Worked great but gained 20 Lbs in 3 months which in turn made me more depressed. Dr. said it wasnt the medication so he did lots of testing. All were negative, so I switched to Wellbutrin and started loosing weight immediately. (definately not as quickly as I put it on) Eating habits and activity level did not change only medication.
Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	1/10/2010 1:43:52 AM	I call this &quot;evil&quot; Effexor - it was horrible being on it and even more horrible coming off of it - I don't recommend it to anyone

I was skeptical at first but it worked almost immediately.
Depression	flygirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	1/9/2010 12:41:25 AM	I have been taking different antidepressants for 15 years. Been on effexor about 10 years and it has worked very well.  However it is impossible to get off this med.  My doctor weaned me and I still ended up in the hospital and they put me right back on the drug. I would never have gotten on this drug if I had known this.  If I miss even one day, I have terrible side effects. Even though it has helped my symptoms, I would never have started it.  I do not recommend this to ANYONE!  I'm afraid I'll be on this the rest of my life.  HELP!!!

I have been trying to go off Effexor and onto another med and the withdrawel is horrific. After discussing with my Dr. he suggested I go to half strength for 2 weeks then half stenght every other day for 2 weeks. I am now off but feel sick at my stomach, have a headache, and go from freezing cold to hot flashes. These side effects are better than going cold turkey. I tried that and thought I was going to die.

Depression	colrful, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	1/7/2010 9:05:56 PM	Due to side-effects from Topamax I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. Effexor was the 3rd anti-depressant they put me on (I was sick of being a zombie every day on anti-depressants).  I take a variety of epilepsy medication which probably didn't help but I got violent on this med to the point where I punched my son in the face xmas day. 1mth later I stabbed someone - all totally out of character for me.  Whether it was just the effexor or the combination of Topamax with it (Topamax had the worst side-effects I have EVER experienced) I don't know.  But I certainly will never take either of them again.

I've taken it for 6years now and the only problem I have noticed while taking it is my weight gain but over all I feel great.                              Thanks, Lynn

Bipolar Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	19-24	1/4/2010 7:40:07 PM	this is the second time i've had to take effexor xr. first time was for depression and i stopped because it made me feel different and not like myself as well as causing really bad headaches. depression worsened after stopping my meds, went back to the doctor, got diagnosed with bi-polar and gave effexor and it did nothing but caused the headaches to worsen. then was switched to abilify and celexa for my BP.
Depression	Deb7, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	1/4/2010 7:11:08 PM	This drug worked so well I didn't feel any emotion at all as I was going through a philandering husband and headed for divorce.  But after about a year I started to have high anxiety, crying all the time, over reacting, seriously depressed....it was a reaction from the Effexor.  I had to go to a Holistic physician to get weaned off the drug, but now feel great even though the divorce has  now been pending for two years and the drama has been going on for 5 yrs.  Just pay attention to your body.  Drugs can backfire and create the symptoms you are trying to alleviate.
Depression	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	1/4/2010 12:08:47 PM	I started using Effexor XR about 10 Years ago and it has worked well to curb the problems with my depression.  I changed to this med to give me more energy during the daytime.  I was a middle school math teacher and needed &quot;lots of energy.&quot;  I am now retired and find the expense of this drug to be a problem in my budget.

Your child has a HIGH probability of suffering from: SIDS, coma, seizures, stillbirth, birth defects, miscarriage (spontaneous abortion), and an overall increase in neonatal deaths! Before you consider taking this drug, if you are female, please visit the following website for women that have experienced problems during pregnancy: http://uniteforlife.wordpress.com/2009/03/07/ in-memory-of-indiana-effexor-baby/I can also testify that my doctor said it would be fine to continue taking this drug to help with my anxiety during pregnancy. I took her advice and my son at age 6 still has breathing issues and delays in speech and language comprehension. Please, please DON'T take this drug if you are going to be pregnant!!!!!!!!

I was having horrid chest pain and continued anxiety.  I was hospilized for heart problems. They discovered my problem was anxiety. It did make me tired at first but my body has adjuste and I have been free of chest pain for 6 months.  My husbnad says I am much more relaxed and less uptight. I am able to not obsess about things as much as in the past. I feel I have more patience with my 3 kids under age 5.  I was taking the pill at night and was so tired during the day and not sleepy at bedtime. About a month ago I swithed and started taking the pill in the morning. I am now more awake all day and ready for bed at night. I have been sleeping 8 hrs easily with no wakeups.  It is great! I am happy my dr finally convinced me to try an antidepressent. This is the first one I have every taken.

I couldnt take it durning the day so I tried taking it at night and it would keep me up all day. About a week ago my dr. said it was time to try something else. Since the 23rd of Dec. I have been sicker then a dog. Dizziness, lightheaded, hollow feeling in my ears, feeling like the tummy flu with other things added. If the meds is working for you great. Dont miss a dose ...you will know it. If you are coming off the meds...Ask the Dr. the right way to come off it DONT do it cold turkey you will truely regret it...

My therapist felt I had come to a &quot;wall&quot; and may need medication to help me overcome whatever left over anxiety and depression I had.  I was put on LEXAPRO first, that was okay, just made me EXHAUSTED !  He then switched me to effexor XR, the lower dosage of 30 something at first, then currently I take 75mg.  This drug has been a NIGHTMARE!  I didn't realize what a mistake trying to take myself off the drug would be.  I have SEVERE vertigo, nausea, ringing in my head, nightmares, night sweats, my heart beats uncontrollably- I would NEVER have started this drug if I had realized what awful withdrawal symptoms I would face- calling the doctor tomorrow, seeing what I can do to help me get off of it.  I have been trying 'cold turkey' for a couple days and it is absolute torture. I don't reccomend this drug AT ALL !

This pain and anguish is worse than any symptom I had before taking this drug.
Depression	maria s, 55-64 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	1		55-64	12/24/2009 9:19:42 AM	I took this drug for 11 months on the advise of my therapist.  It did assist in relief of depression and addiction but the side effects were unacceptable.  My need for sleep increased dramatically, gained weight, had frequent &quot;zaps&quot; like electrical current at the base of my skull and was almost immediately unable to cry.  I felt like I didn't recognize the person I had become.  Came down gradually and had some discomfort but am so glad I did.  Now more than a year since discontinuing treatment, still have &quot;zaps&quot; occasionally and have never been able to cry to release emotions.  Regret ever having taken this treatment.

Depression	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/23/2009 1:26:35 PM	I've been on 150mg Effexor XR for about 5 yrs for depression.  It works best for me after trying several others on the market.  I can't miss a dose, or I get very bad nightmares, and a &quot;rubber-head&quot; &amp; sick feeling;  It works well for me.

I think it is working well for me though I still have manic episodes related to my bipolar disorder.I read in a drug reference book that Effexor Xr should not be used in patient's with bipolar disorder.  Is this correct?

I know when I take 75mg, it really helped with many things. When I jumped to 150mg, it had a negative effect.

Depression	gabz666, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	12/19/2009 11:45:53 PM	i've been dx with MDD since my teens, (first offical dx @ 16). i have intense episodes of depression every 6months pretty much. ive tried celexa, which made me feel high and then low so i stopped taking that. now i am taking effexor xr and the first week i felt really high and was really excited that finally i might be coming out of this depression. i was suicidal, cutting, angry, aggressive, anxious, having panic attacks, crushing guilt, a big mood swinging mess. so i thought it was working. now a little over a month in and at 150mg i feel nothing. it has helped with the agression and constant worrying. but i still have bad anxiety attacks, agoraphobic(w/o the help of an benzo) which my doc doesnt want to rx me, and i still have crying spells. i have no sex drive, which was actually quite healthy to begin with. i am more prone to an agitated depression, and the effexor has changed it to a lethargic depression. where now, i dont want to do anything, and i dont care to do anything, when i am actually the type that wants to do everything and cares too much. i stopped taking it a few days ago and have experience a weird feeling. i feel detached and have flown back into the psychotic mood changes, yelling at the drop of a hat, if something is not in order. so i suppose i will start taking it again. ive told my doc and i will be seeing him soon for some help. not sure what he will do, up the dose more? or an add on?

However, if you are considering this medciation, you should be aware that it is very important not to miss a dose.  It causes a very uneasy/uncomfortable feeling...kind of like a hangover, but light-headed and dizzy.  Even being a little late taking it can cause these symptoms so you should get in the habit of taking it at the same time every day.  Another thing to be careful of...don't stand or raise up to quickly or you can become very light headed
Depression	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	65-74	12/18/2009 3:52:31 PM	On this medication for 2 months. Changed from Paxil due to an non-critical side affect. Change over was practically seamless.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/18/2009 2:13:01 AM	I found Effexor worked great, and I have tried many antidepressants. Paxil-made me sleep my life away. Zoloft-felt like a zombie. Wellbutrin-made me extremely moddy. Celexa-awful neck pain &amp; my jaw would clench. The only problem I had with effexor was how huge-dialated my pupils got. I hate to sound so picky but my eyes are greenish-hazel so if my pupils dialated, it was really obvious and I felt really self-consious about it. I'm taking about like my pupils were almost as big as my eye. I thought people might think i was on some illegal drugs, so I just decided to go off the meds. WOW, major withdrawl symptoms. It's hard to say, if I had dark colored eyes, I would def stay with this med. I hadn't felt so good in a long time, and it worked awesome for both depression and anxiety! Will try Lexapro next
Depression	mesa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	12/17/2009 11:07:20 PM	I posted a comment under the heading,bipolar depression, since that is my diagnosis.  The reson I am posting under depression is that more people seem to respond in a more timely manner under this discription.  I am going to detox from Effexor at a hospital in Jan. that is how frightened I am about this drug.  I don't know how I will deal with my mental health once I am no longer &quot;hooked&quot;.  At least I won't see a drug addict in the mirror anymore.

It must be doing something bad to me inside if it is so powerful as to prompt such horror stories about withdrawals.  I too wish someone (myself?) had informed me about that side effect before I started this drug.  I can't think of anythig else each time I take the med.  I feel as though I am being held hostage by Effexor.  I plan on going to a detox hospital in Ocala in Jan. to get off it, as I see a drug addict each time I look in the mirror.  I don't know what I will do about the depression.  Perhaps there is a drug for me that will not make me fat and isn't akin to detoxing of of herion.
Panic Disorder		4	2	1			12/17/2009 10:28:25 AM	I am writing this because although this medicine worked the WITHDRAWS where HORRIBLE, it took me a year to get off of it.  The brain zaps where HORRIBLE I am so glad Im off of it.  If I would have know the withdraws i would have NEVER took it!!
Depression	hotmomma, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	12/16/2009 4:52:23 PM	as far as helping my mood swings and depression, it is good...not great...just good.  It is effective because it does not make me feel loopy, but it evens my moods where things don't affect me like they used to.  I am calmer.  As far as side effects.... the withdrawal is terrible.  If you are even late on a dose, it starts with the creepy lightheadedness that makes you feel off...then comes the nausea.  After 4 days off one time (due to finances), i felt like dying.  I was so dizzy i almost fell in a restauraunt and i could only just lay down and i still felt dizzy and nauseated.  I have weaned myself down to a lower dose, but i wish someone had of described this pill a little better to me.

It has helped but did not totally eliminate.  I have been taking this medication for about 6 months now but am having some side effects.  One is weight gain.  Second, which I am going to talk to my doctor about, is blurred vision.  The blurred vision is getting very irritating.  I keep reading of withdrawals from other people and am not looking forward to it.

Depression	trickykitty, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/13/2009 1:04:33 PM	I have been on Effexor for about eight yrs. and it is one of the most effective meds I have ever been on.  I was without it for a few months from an insurance problem and had to go off cold turkey and I will say that it was terrible for the withdrawal, though nothing as bad as the horror stories I have read from other people.  The biggest problem for me was not the withdrawal however, it was that nothing else that I tried worked for me.  I wound up fixing the problem with the insurance and went back on it.  Even knowing what the withdrawal entails, if the benefit outweighs the risk... that's the basis for all meds.  My experience with this med has been a lot more positive than the stories I have read. Regardless if people say that it's addictive and regardless if I ever wind up having to go through the withdrawals again if my insurance drops coverage again... this is an essential med for me and I will take advantage of the benefits it brings for as long as I am able to.  Without it I am a crying miserable wreck and completely overwhelmed by my depression.  With it there are still depression factors but at a level I can live with.  I do take four other psych meds along with the effexor and my current dose is 150mg/day.  Just for reference, the other meds are buspar, klonopin, seroquel and lamictal.  No benefit from trials of prozac, wellbutrin or celexa.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/11/2009 11:36:09 PM	This is a great medication but it does have side effects.  Make sure you don't miss a day, or you will know it. The trade off is worth it for me. I do miss my sex drive though.

I took 300mg per day for 5 years and had wonderful results.  I never experienced unusual weight gain, suicidal thoughts or decreased libido.  The big downside with Effexor is the withdrawl

Up untill she took effexor and when she was on prozac our friends and family thought of us as love birds. We had a great sex life and that completely disappeared withing the first two months. She became angry, impulsive, agitated towards me and the rest of the family. She thinks it is working. She tells her shrink that it is working. She sees her shrink for 30 minutes every 3 months and he renews her prescription without checking for side effects with her family. If you are thinking of taking this drug, give yourself a going away party because you will be leaving everyone who knows and loves you you will be replaced by an entirely different personality. Here is how Weyth promoted this drug through falsified testing and paying for positive reports from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/17/health/17depres s.html http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22237 http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/12/18/dear-me-ne meroff-wrote-himself-about-payment-for-effexor-ar ticle/ This medication is addictive! Addiction - Big Pharma marketing calls it &quot; discontinuation syndrome&quot; which the shrinks don't tell you about before you start taking it. Agitation, anger, impulsiveness, memory loss, loss of cognative ability and weight gain. The manufacturer stresses the opposite - weight loss - but that is true in young women. It makes it appear that women are getting a feel good pill and a diet pill, when in fact many post menopausal women gain 30 - 50 pounds. Pfizer/Weyeth deserve an army of tort lawyers. Hippocrates oath has been changed from &quot;first do no harm&quot; to &quot;first line you pockets with cash.&quot;

No sex drive, constipation and my OCD has gotten worse. I have started taking Zoloft while trying to come off of the effexor. I'm having a hard time with withdrawls.  Headaches, an &quot;out of it&quot; feeling and my panic attacks are more frequent. I now take 150mg every other day and 50 mg of zoloft everyday. I'm hoping the zoloft will kick in soon and the withdrawls of the effexor goes away soon!
Panic Disorder	Angie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/1/2009 10:29:51 AM	effexor xr has been amazing. the generic which is not xr (extended release does not work the same at all.) unfortunately i have to pay a large co-payment for this drug. My doctor is going to write a letter of medical necessity in hopes of of eliminating my co-payment.  I don't understand how insurance companies have a preferred drug list if there isn't an exact generic copy (xr) of the drug.  I have been suffering from panic disorder since the mid 1990's and finally found real help.

Been on it about a year, have had to up the dosage a couple of times, definitely know when I forget to take it, my brain feels like it's getting zapped and I get woozy. Gained 30 pounds and have NO sex drive. Had suicidal thoughts for the 1st time when I first started taking it, but since we upped the dose I haven't had them. Bottom line, it's working, but I wish there was a better way...

But the worst side effect was my sleepiness.  I actually had to take myself off of it after 2 months because I literally could not stay awake.  I had SEVERE side effects when weening myself off; head shocks, nausea, dizziness and head aches.  I also weened myself off too quickly and went into an extreme depression, so definitely ween yourself off slowly.

These symptoms went away within a few months of starting treatment. My energy level increased dramatically. I began sleeping soundly and rising early. I actually began enjoying life and looking forward to getting my day started.

Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	45-54	11/17/2009 4:24:19 PM	I've started taking this drug for mild depression about 3 months ago. The original dose of 150 mg per day had almost no effect. I'm now on 300 mg per day. It may be helping a little but certainly no life changing results for me. The most notable effect for me is a decreased sex drive.

I'm struggling with depression again and I'm going up to 300mg.  I guess my body is metabolizing the drug. It has worked very, very well for most of the 5 years.

If you suffer from depression, this is a miracle drug and is not at all addictive.

I have tried several times and can not beat the w/draw symptoms.  My Dr told me 20% of those who start it can't stop taking it. I want to stop mostly due to the cost.  The generic form doesn't work as well.

I have taken it for a number of years now.  Other antidepressants either just didn't work well for me or incompletely addressed my symptoms, resulting in under- or over-medication as my prescribers tried different combinations.  I was recently offered the opportunity to try a different medication, but I'm not risking it.  Effexor XR has been a life saver for me.  I do wonder about my weight gain, and development of type II diabetes, but I could not face life again the way I was before this medication lifted me out of depression and anxiety and let me know what &quot;normal&quot; feels like.

My doctor increased my dosage from 75mg bid to 150mg bid for anxiety and again it worked very well for me.  It's been almost 3 years since I first begain taking effexor and I wonder when will be a good time to stop and will the symptoms return?  Any suggestions?

I ran into a complication with getting my script renewed and had to go without it for a few days. I went through the worst withdrawals ever. I have gone through withdrawals from a severe addiction to a very strong illegal drug and THAT wasn't even this bad! It caused vertigo as well as horrible sweating, nausea, abdominal pain, eye pain from the light, and the worst mood swings ever! My husband had to take me to the ER because he found me on the kitchen floor and all the chairs were knocked over, apparently I had fallen. I couldn't remember anything at all until an hour after I had taken a dose of the effexor which the doctor had given me. Also.  Since I have been on the effexor, I have become an anti-social zombie. I barely get out of bed and my already lack of motivation turned into a lack of life period. The only thing I like about this medication is the fact that it stabilizes my mood, well... more like it keeps me mono-toned 100% of the time. I no longer have extreme lows or highs.

I have been on every anti-depressant.  Effexor is the worst and the withdrawal when weaning off of it was pure hell.  The withdrawal was so bad that the doctor had to put me back on it at four times the dosage I was taking!  I cannot believe I lived through taking and withdrawing from this drug.  They should take it off of the market!  God bless anyone who takes this awful drug.

The standard course of treatment was prescribed, therapy and drugs. After two years of meds and less than satisfactory results Effexor got its turn. Finally, I had relief, for a few months. Effectiveness tapered off, dosage increased, then combination with other meds. Sound familiar, after 10 years enough of this. The treatment is worse than the illness. My answer is healing prayer and neurofeedback therapy. Get off the chemical highway, it wont cure and is endless.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	helpguyy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	11/12/2009 10:16:38 PM	After 9 months on Effexor XR I feel confident to say this drug has completely and utterly changed my life.  I read many reviews before starting the drug, and I was scared to death of all the reviews that said the drug had horrendous side effects, and was absolutely impossible to get off of.  Well, I have experienced just about every side effect imaginable, that I will outline below for you.  But, I will never experience the effects of withdrawing from the drug, because I have absolutely no intention of getting off the drug.  My life is now phenomenally enjoyable, which I will also outline below.  I'm going to give you complete details, because I wish someone had maybe done the same about a year ago when I was searching desperately for answers to my many questions.  Here goes. ME: I am a forty-something male, married, two sporty kids.  Profession requires public speaking and frequent client interaction.  I was a professsional athlete and continue to work out almost every day.  PROBLEM: I've always been extremely anxious around people, although few people knew it.  It was a constant struggle being around people other than those I knew really well.  I was also nervous talking to important clients or making important presentations, but, again hid it.  The reality, though, was I was not enjoying myself, avoided all such situations, and therefore didn't excel at many things I did, despite the fact that I am a very smart, witty and caring person (don't mean to sound vain - just saying I've always had the tools to be an extremely successful person, but my anxiety/depression squelched everything).  My anxiety occassionally elevated to full blown panic attacks where it was obvious to the people I was with that I was nervous.  I know now that I was experiencing related depression as well. At times I would get into a complete funk, tired and exhausted, despite the fact I was getting lots of sleep.   I would be in a fog. CURE: My GP prescribed ativan at first, since my primary c

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/11/2009 12:10:42 PM	I began taking effexor xr 37.5 mg about 4 years ago. I had started taking prozac about 6 months after my daughter was born, stayed on that about 1 year but experienced weight gain, stayed sleepy. went off that about a year, then started having anxiety again, crying at the drop of a hat. My doc recommended effexor.  I asked to stay on lowest possible dose, and have really liked this mecication.  the only side effects I noticed when I 1st started were extreme &quot;energy&quot; esp. when I 1st woke up, and some trouble sleeping, but I was already having trouble with that. That subsided quickly enough, the only other thing that was significant was headaches, but I can't say for sure that it was from med.  They have stopped too. I feel effexor has allowed me to be the person I'm meant to be.  I feel very happy and &quot;normal&quot; again, even better that ever.  The few side effects I have/had were not enough for me to stop taking it.  A co-worker quit her effexor cold turkey and told me &quot; you've got to get off that stuff&quot; story similar to other posts here.  My take is--don't stop any meds like that cold turkey, that's just dumb.  And everyone is different, but I would stay on as low a dose as possible, I think It makes it easier if you do decide to stop.  I wish I didn't have to take anything, but since I do, I like this med.  With prozac I felt sluggish, and was ravenous all the time, but not with this.  I feel very energetic most of the time, and don't worry like I used to.  But there are alot of meds out there, try something different if one doesn't do it for you.

I tried other drugs, but they didn't work or made me really ill. I also have problems with severe anxiety and this has really helped! I can always tell if I've forgotten to take it though, and I have read the other comments about coming off of it. If I miss a day I get nauseated and woosie. It has caused me to have high blood pressure, but, when I think of how much better I feel and how it helps the anxiety, well, I guess it's worth it. 
Depression	triplet mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	35-44	11/9/2009 9:59:50 PM	I started taking this drug for severe chronic depression and anxiety. Beginning this drug, I was vomiting right away, so make sure you take it with food. The side effects get better as you continue taking it, and rather quickly. After taking this drug for 2 months though, the drug was helping immensley with the anxiety, but making my depression much worse! I began hallucinating and hearing voices &amp; whispers, and became very suicidal. I slept alot, had zero energy or desire to do anything. I wouldn't shower for days and couldn't even get basic things done. I am now weaning off of it to start something new (Celexa), and the weaning has been fine except that I notice that I am much more aggitated and irritable, and anger very quickly. Anxiety attacks are coming back as well. I have back problems, so I also take muscle relaxers, pain killers, and nerve relaxers as well. Not sure if there is an interaction going on? It's very hard to be patient with finding a drug to work for you. I am half tempted to try the medical marijuana to see if that helps with pain and anxiety?

It doesn't work for anxiety at all. It seems as it actually got worse. The first time I was on it, I had dry mouth and appetite loss. This is the 2nd time I have been on it and at 150 mg per day, I have not noticed any side effects. It's a good depression medication but not so much for anxiety.

I'm not totally depression and anxiety free, but with bipolar depression finding a medicine that worked this well took a long time. Today p-doc gave me samples of Venlafaxine ER. I am worried after reading the reviews here about experiencing extra side effects. With Effexor I have few to none as long as I take it on schedule. I can't afford to lose anymore energy. Life drains me enough.

The little brain zaps can be hard to deal with. I'm trying to slowly wean myself off (with doctors help) but it's difficult. I feel addicted which causes mroe anxiety than I had when I started the medication. Think long and hard before going on this medication.

Bipolar Depression	Billy BUBB, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	11/4/2009 9:23:20 PM	I have been around the block as far as anti-depressants go- nardil, amitriptoline, asendin, and several others, including tri-cyclics.  Was on Prozac later, then Lexapro.  With Lexapro, I felt a lot better as far as moods and swings went, but after taking it for 4 years, it leveled off and worked less and less.  Then I took Effexor.  I feel a lot better, and more level mood wise.  I've been suicidal since age 14, and am now 54.  I've gotten past the pain part, so 'leaving town' isn't the issue it once would have been.  IOW, it'd be a whole lot easier to do myself in now than before, were it not for wife and kids who would take it as something their fault.I liked Lexapro, but it stopped working out.  Effexor works, but all the posts and comments are scaring me.  What to do?  stop and die, or keep taking it and die, or at least deal with powerful side effects, while the other part of effexor allows a better life for the time being.  A pill for every need- medical legacy of the USA.  Just a wholly BIZARRE plight to be in.  Here I thought that other stuff I was experiencing was some other pill. sweating, lucid dreams, strange physical sensations, 'blank spots' during the course of the day or workday, strange physical pains or feelings.  Maybe back to Lexapro.Thank you all for posting, for your experiences have led me to think about other realms that had not occurred to me...  Just so bizarre!  And yeah, even the sex dept has gone south

Withdrawels are awful, I am even tapering down as my Dr. has prescribed, and I am feeling horrible......upset stomach, heartburn, headache, just to name a few. If I would have known this drug caused withdrawels and your body becaome dependent on it I would have never starting it to begin with.

I've also detoxed from the medication a few times and that can b no fun. However my MD worked out a detox plan with another med that made coming off the drug a breeze...so speak with ur physician  might ...I related to the post about brain zaps ...or something along those lines.

I tried Zoloft, then Lexapro, then Paxil, &amp; finally Effexor XR. I have been very satisfied with Effexor XR, 75mg. I tapered off a couple of yrs. ago by skipping a day, and then taking one 75mg. pill, etc. for a wk. or 2.  I did not have any bad withdrawal symptons by doing it that way. Then a couple of yrs. ago in June '07, more troubling things happened in my life, so I went back on it again. I have extreme fatigue, but I don't know if it is because of Effexor XR.

It's hard to remember how or if it was effective in the beginning. I have been batteling SEVERE depression for over 10 yrs and spent 5 of those yrs in bed. I've been on all kinds of meds in different combos and ultimately came off everything 2 yrs ago except for the effexor. I CANT stOP. If I go even 2 days without it the brain zaps are terrible. Fortunately I don't seem to be having any of the other side effects many of you have talked about ie no wt gain or moodiness that I can see but how do you differentiate the moodiness of the med effect from the symptoms of the depression itself? If I really knew that ex was still helping me I wouldn't mind it so much but I just don't know if it really is helping or if I'm staying on it to avoid the withdrawl of stopping. Also I don't have insurence and it's expensive to stay on it just to stop the withdrawl. Still I have found that most other meds I have tried have had worse side effects. Maybe I'm just really sensitive to meds now that I have tried so many but with some meds I would forget what I was saying half way through a sentence. It was awful. If I try again to get off ex I would do it over a 1 yr period. I don't know what to do. I'm still classified as severly depressed but at least I'm working and interacting with people again. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks

Yes, I have side effects--mild sweatiness, loss of apetite, the need to be busy and enjoying semi-solitude. Every once in a the combination &quot;fails&quot; and I start down the &quot;slippery slope&quot;. I have successfullybeen weaned off Effexor under the therapist's guidance and I never experienced the brain pain that other reviewers felt. Truthfully, I'd rather have the side effects than be in bed in a fetal position OR WORSE. I have accepted I will have to be on Effexor XR for the rest of my life. With few exceptions, I am having the happiest years of my life (spending many of them being depressed and untreated.)

I decided to wean myself off this drug as I experienced weight gain &amp; SEVERE withdrawl symptoms.  I have been tapered down to the 37.5 mg level (I had been up to 300mg) but I can not quit the drug completely!!!  Even at this low dose, I experience the extreme effects I did when I forgot my medication while on vacation.  One side effect I did not realize I had was a complete lack of interest in sex!  Now that I am down to the lower dose, my sex drive is back thankfully &amp; my energy has increased.  I have lost 15 pounds due to diet &amp; exercise since lowering my dose.  My advice to others is STILL the same!!  DO NOT accept this drug from anyone, even a doctor!!  Since I have been unable to remove myself completely from this drug, my opinion about this is even stronger. There are so many alternatives, do yourself a favor &amp; JUST SAY NO!!!

This medicine was given by my General MD when I told him there were bugs in the house and they were biting me, bites especially along ankles. Pest Control said it was fleas. The bugs responded to powder Boric Acid are left the easy chair I sit and sleep in. Dr had no comment, said it was a parasite. Gave me a brown envelope with medicine inside and written on outside says, Parasite Medicine. I think that was a terrible response. I see a Psychiatrist and she gives me Celexa and Valium. I am mad at this Doctor for deceiving me and I went to this site to find out what this pill really was. So thank You whomever maintains the site.

Depression	rosalie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/27/2009 12:46:02 AM	Effexor took away almost all my anxiety and most of my OCD.   Never thought any drug could do that.   Did affect my sex drive a little but after awhile it got better.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/26/2009 4:14:39 PM	I began taking this med in '08 after trying lexapro and wellbutrin, which did not work for me. I took 75 mg once a day (effexor xr). AFter one week I immediate felt relief and felt like my depression was being treated! I felt wired at first, dry mouth, nausea...the side effects it states you will have. But they eventually went away. I stayed on this med for 6mths, but since I planned to have a baby, I went off of it. The only withdrawal symptmos I had were the brain zaps, but I gradually withdrew the amount I was taking by breaking open the capsule. I only had to do this for 2 weeks. Now after having the baby, I am on this med again...this time on the generic form. Same initial symptoms. I have been taking it for 3 weeks now and I already feel like my head is clearer and I'm not as angry. I think with these types of medicines you have to just try to see if they do work for you or not. Just b/c someone else had awful reactions or withdrawals does not mean you will! With any of these drugs that affect you physiological system, you do risk that possibility of withdrawal symptoms!

I felt tense all the time and was Grinding my teeth. Had outburst of anger and almost lost my job. The Dr. took me off of this immediatley due to my blood pressure increasing to dangerous levels. The Withdraws were the worst. All of these drugs are trial and error. Be careful!

Bipolar Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	19-24	10/22/2009 9:21:30 PM	I did not take Effexor XR very long because it hospitalized me with SEVERE DEPRESSION and SUICIDAL THOUGHTS at a very low dose. I realize that I just had a very bad reaction to this drug, but it was the worst reaction I have had from any of the medications I have been on for Bipolar Depression (close to 15). I now take Cymbalta, which is also a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and it has been one of the best medications I have ever been on. My advice for anyone who is considering taking Effexor XR is to look out for a severe reaction involving depression and suicidal thoughts. I wasn't sure if my reaction was to Effexor XR or another new drug I was taking, but it turned out to be Effexor XR. I thought I could just tough it out through the side effects and that it would maybe get better, but that was a horrible mistake that put me in the hospital.  Just be sure to use caution when starting this medication!

But now that I am taking it and trying to ween myself or if I miss a dose, I get very depressed!
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	keray55, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	10/21/2009 11:46:53 PM	I have been living with anxiety for my entire life and finally decided that no amount of therapy would help and it was time to medicate.  My doctor prescribed XR as it was the latest and greatest drug out there.  Initially it worked wonders.  For the first time I could breathe freely everyday, I was productive, and never nervous.  A few years in I decided this wasnt something that I wanted to take forever, especially since my MD warned me it wasnt for long term use and it should have changed my chemistry.  I weaned myself off, which I expected to be painful based on others experiences, and it was.  That wasnt the worst part though.  After withdrawal ended I was left feeling like I had no brain.  Years later I still feel the same way.  I have no memory, I'm always at a loss for words, and I can't begin to articulate my thoughts.  Effexor changed my life for the good for a very small amount of time, but the damage it has done has been much much worse.  I can only hope its not permanent.  Be very careful when taking this drug.  Think long and hard about the side effects, because there will be some, and what you would do if it fundamentally changed you if you decided to stop taking it.

Didn't work for me for that at all.  I was a little depressed too.  It made me feel a little numb emotionally, but that was good.  I wasn't too numb.  I did get those &quot;brain zaps&quot; at the lower part of the back of my head.  Also a little bit dizzy at times.  After a year on these, my doctor helped me to stop taking them because they were no help with the hot flashes.  Sometimes I miss the numbing effect of my emotions.
Depression	Emmanuel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	10/20/2009 12:25:06 PM	Started taking meds 4 months after my daughter was born. Pretty severe postpartum depression. Worked very well and was happy with the results for the next 2 years. At one point my Dr tried to wean me off, but soon realized it was a bad idea. Within one week I had serious thoughts of suicide...did not actually attempt but the desire was very strong.Now I feel like a prisoner to this medication. I experience erratic mood swings, paranoia, apathy, no sex drive, jitters. My body/brain won't let me sleep until very late at night, so I'm always tired and lethargic.I was once an outgoing person, and now i'm reclusive and anti-social.I believe Effexor is a great short term solution to combat depression and potpartum. I wish I would have known about the side effects of long term use because I do feel it was a factor in my divorce.

Depression	yngrptnt, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	10/18/2009 8:14:31 PM	I took this medication briefly, for maybe a few weeks, a couple of years ago.  I had these side effects:  worsening mental/mood changes, difficulty urinating, personality changes.  This drug made me feel weird.  In a way I felt better, but I felt really different over all.  I am someone who thinks before I do something or say something, and on this medication I was definitely doing things without thinking.  I would not recommend this drug to anyone based on my experience.  I went off it quickly and back onto Paxil because of the side effects and the way it made me feel.

I am now 55 years old and have few side effects from the medication and menopause.  My OB suggested I go off the medication and set me up with a plan to slowly withdraw from the medication.I am through my first week reducing the dosage and I have had a challenging time with hot flashes, and anxiety.  I was put on the generic form of Effexor and not sure if it's due to these symptoms or the change in dosage. I have to admit I've had minimal mood swings during the past 7 yrs, which has been a blessing, as I have a very stressful job and don't intend to retire until I'm 65 years old. I am concerned about the many opinions I've read about going off this drug and would welcome any suggestions to mininize the stress going off Effexer.  Thanks

The medication is great! I take around 300mg total daily. There are side effects that people need to be very concerned with. I have lost my sex drive completely at age 23, gained 15pounds, if I skip a dose I sweat severely, shake very bad, fireworks go off in my head, and I have sever panic attacks. Great medication just remember going off of this is like having drug withdrawals.

Noticed a difference right away, moved out, got a good job, better decision making.  Now not noticing a lot of difference other than not as bad depression.  Side effects noticed, sweating A LOT more, vivid dreams, tired a lot, occasional headaches.  Missing a dose, NOT A GOOD IDEA! 24 hours are manageable, 48 hours- mind numbing migrane. Had to drive home at night with sunglasses one because of sensitivity to light.  Only on 75 mg, not sure may need higher dose but nervous.

It's not some great &quot;happy&quot; pill.  Biggest complaint is NO sex drive at all! Start to get off the med &amp; sex drive comes back. Cannot just stop taking this! I felt the worst in my life when tried to quit taking it; zapping feeling, crying, very angry, nausea, headaches.....list goes on &amp; on.There is no generic for the XR formula. I had to cancel my health ins., so if I want this med I have to pay $160 per month for it.  Currently I am seeing if Wyeth (manufacturer) will let me have it at no cost. Have to go to their website &amp; print out application. Take it to your doctor to do her/his part &amp; mail it in.  I'll know in 5-7 days if I can get it free.

My doctor put me on effexor XR.I took the drug for 4 years and in the 4 years, my leg and hip pain became so bad I was unable to climb stair or walk for very long with out take a break. Was told that my arthritis was getting worst. After returning home after job lost and no insurance, I weaned off effexor XR because I could not afford it. To my surprise my pain in my hips and legs was gone. I could walk in the park and climb hills.  I could not believe it. It is not listed as a side effect. So I am telling you so if anyone is having this problem they can tell their Doctor.

Depression	Crocodile1, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	10/5/2009 2:06:55 AM	Effexor XR is not effective until you get to the 150mg threshold.  It is FDA approved up to 225mg/day, but many doctors prescribe way higher than this with good results.  I saw one post on here where the person said the drug didn't work and they were at 37.5mg/day.  Yes, the drug will have virtually no effect on you at that low dosage!!I've been on it a year and I'm at 300mg/day.  It is a wonderful medicine, but I don't like the sweating and the fact that it raises blood pressure.  People, DO NOT trust your primary care or family doctor to know about these psychoactive drugs.  They mean well, but a Psychiatrist is where you need to go for the guys who know everything about psychoactive drugs.  Also, I am not a doctor, nor do I work for a drug company.  I just wanted to throw some facts out there for people to use so that they can be helped.

It makes me wonder if it is even a good idea to have begun taking this in the first place and now I feel completely hooked on it.[Luckily, the horrible side effects were gone by the end of the 2nd day back on the med.]but not sure where to go from here...

Yes, I had vivid dreams, slept alot at first, but the pain was abated and so I did not mind until I fell face first in a parking lot. I don't remember the incident so my Neurologist deceased the dose by half and within 3 days the pain had returned. I miss being relatively pain free.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	10/3/2009 12:36:34 AM	I took Effexor 150 (mg) for three years.  Missed a dose, here and there, and the withdrawal was intense.  The electric shock feeling was terrifying the first time. I complained to my doctor ans was told that the &quot;shock&quot; feeling might actually be a plummet in saratonin levels.  So, on my own, I cut back, first to 75mg per day and then half again.  I was able to go dose free for 2-3 days before the &quot;shock&quot; would come and I'd take a pill.  I continued just treating the &quot;shocks&quot; as they came until I was pill free for days, then weeks at a time.  If you are ready to wean off Effexor, get your doctor to lower and break up your dosage (instead of 2x75mg per day, ask for 4x32.5). This will help you begin slowly skipping one dose and so on.  Effexor is a fantastic medication and it doesn't have to be a nightmare (literally) to come off it.  Pay attention to your &quot;shocks&quot; or crashes as you lower your dosage and treat only when you feel them.  It will work.  I was completely off the medication within three months and I had very little hardship.

I had to go off of it for 9 mo when I got pregnant, but for the most part it has been a godsend. Happiness in pill form.  only now is it no longer as effective for me, and i am dreading the side effects of going off of it...  the brain zaps, the shakes, the nausa, the heavy body feeling. I'm also sort of looking forward to it as I am realizing that the symptoms I've been living with have been side effects of effexor (profuse sweating, headaches, weight gain, etc).  I have a hard time recommending effexor, but just as hard of a time condeming. It has been great for the 6+ yrs I've been on it.  Just time for a change.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Fed up,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female		9/28/2009 5:58:19 PM	after taking Ativan for about 2 yrs I began experiencing feelings of rage.  Dr. perscribed Effexor XR 75mg which I took for over 2 yrs.  Once I had my thyroid removed and began taking synthetic meds. for that I asked to be weaned off the Effexor as I believe many of the symtoms I was experiencing were due to the thyroid problem.  Dosage reduced to 37.5 mg at that time, then from 7 days a week to 6 days a week.  It has been several months and Dr. will not assist me in getting off this drug.  I have stopped taking altogether for the past 4 days and am experiencing the brain shivers, sensitivity to motion and sound and over sensitive nerve endings. I am trying to determine how long this will continue as I do not want to begin taking this drug again. My insurance does not cover it and it has caused weight gain.  Has anyone else quit this med. with good results?
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	45-54	9/26/2009 9:19:56 PM	At one time was on 150 mg but blood it made my blood pressure go up but didn't realize it until I went on meds for it.  Lowered the dosage to 37.5 a yr. ago.  No blood pressure meds now.  After a week of no pill, having brain shivers but trying to excercise and drink plenty of water to get this med out of my body.  Would NEVER have went on it if I would have read the reviews here first.  I'm going to try to exercise and stay active to get pass this horrible side effects that came with this drug.  Don't go it this drug unless it is your last possiblity for hope.  I would not have gone on this drug if I knew it was going to do this to me.  I'm not sure if the depression was worse or this feeling.

Depression	Debbie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	45-54	9/24/2009 12:18:16 AM	I was prescribed this medication in April and thought it was a godsend. It helped me through a very rough time in my life. By July, my head was feeling weird ( i.e. strange pressure behind my eyes, trouble focusing, apathy, swore I heard music in my head) and I was weaned off of it. I was receiving psychiatric counseling also so I had some good coping mechanisms already in place. Almost 3 months later, I am still getting a headache at the same time every day. My focus is back,the pressure behind my eyes went away and no more music but I don't think I can recommend this drug for more than 3 months at a time. The withdrawal headache for me is minor but for some, withdrawals from this drug are terrible.

Other	ACPants, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	9/22/2009 11:16:44 AM	I first began this drug as an alternative to taking stimulants/ssris in combination therapy for adhd and depression. My depression was under control within 2 months, but my dose had to go higher as I was experiencing withdrawl even when taking the drug. It does not help my adhd and has even been antagonistic to my impulsivity and restlessness. Once I became comfortable on it, at 28, we found out that I have severe secondary hypertension and might have a stroke if I stay on Effexor. I'm in the process of weaning to Cymbalta with the option of going back on a stimulant now, and I feel better already. Know that this drug is definitely a lifer, and it does help control depression and anxiety very well, but to keep an eye on your blood pressure, pay strict attention to your diet, and excercise, even if you don't have the motivation or energy. That's what saved my life.
Other	revdon, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	45-54	9/21/2009 9:01:53 PM	I have been taking medications for ADD (no hyperactivity) for over 25 years. My ADD symptoms were a strong tendency to &quot;spin off&quot; into depression when facing manageable but tough problems. And also when I was exhausted by overwork! The depression became bad enough at 26 to cause me to take a year off from everything. I've been on many, many drugs; most worked for a while, some never worked, but none were too bad as far as side effects. After Prozac &quot;pooped out&quot; on me, I was put on Effexor, 75 mg twice a day at first, then building up to 300 mg XR once a day. The med seemed to work great the first several months. But then my energy dropped, which led me to cut back exercising. Over the next couple of years, I gained 80 pounds! After batteries of tests and numerous nutritional/diet solutions, I peaked out at about 280 pounds. I'm 5' 7&quot; tall! My doctors concluded my weight gain was due to the Effexor. SO I got off - but OH GOD was it bad! It took nearly a month for the drug to &quot;clear&quot; my system. During that time (and especially the first two weeks), I had shakes, tremors, problems sleeping. Worse, there was this strange effect: my head felt like it was being whirled around, quickly, like you might experience on an amusement park ride. And I would get what others have described as &quot;brain zaps&quot; - it felt like I was getting a sudden surge of electricity through my brain (without pain). My Psych put me on Wellbutrin after the first two weeks. That got some of my energy back, and improved my mood. At the end of a month, all the weirdness stopped. The Wellbutrin helped me to feel more like myself. This drug is effective up front - but I'm convinced it should be used temporarily for severe cases. Then a patient can switch off to another med once things are more &quot;under control.&quot;  
Depression	kg64, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	9/21/2009 6:03:19 PM	I've been taking Effexor about a year but have become concerned about some possible health issues which I didn't assume were side effects until I started reading these postings. I started hearing music in my head when hospitalized in April &amp; it continues to date. About 2-3 mos after I fell &amp; fractured my pelvis, my hair started falling out &amp; still is. I have dry mouth,hoarseness, difficulty at times swallowing. Been blaming everything on the recovery from the fall, but now I wonder. I'm going to call my dr tomorrow &amp; try to get off this.

My doctor tried other anxiety medications on me such as Lexapro and Paxil and both made me so tired i couldnt function and slept all the time.  When I was switched to Effexor it felt like a hugh weight was lifted off my shoulders.  My life hadnt changed just the way i was handling the everyday issues and not so stressed out and worked up all the time. I am happy i have the anxiety relief but this weekend i missed a doseage and the withdrawals were horrible and now I am afraid of how dependent my body is to it.  I dont want to go back to the anxiety ridden life I had but I hate being dependent on a drug to function.
Depression	milly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/19/2009 5:27:36 PM	After many years of trying several medications (prozac, seroxat, paroxatine etc) my consultant psychiatrist put me on these, they have been a godsend! ive been on 225mg daily for 6 years now and without it i would not be alive today.  There are no side affects unlike the other ones ive tried and even if i do miss a dose i just stay in bed (as you can get an annoying not painful brain shake symptom) but within an hour of taking the missed tablets the shakes dissappear.  I would recommend effoxer xr to anyone with severe depression, also i wouldnt change it for anything.

I take 3 75mg capsules a day. It has worked and saved my life. Now I believe I'm living in HELL! I have never in my life felt so hopeless and helpless. I now have thoughts of dying. I just don't want to deal with anything anymore. I have a great life and wonderful family, but because of this pill, I just can't be happy. I talked to my Dr. but he refuses to change my meds or prescribe something else. I have tried to wean off of it, but the withdrawls are worse than detoxing off of opiates. I AM STUCK IN A HELL OF MY OWN. I would not wish this on my worst enemy. If I would have known then what I know now, I would have never taken this drug. 
Depression	jodyjean0821, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	9/17/2009 2:25:25 PM	I have been on Effexor XR for almost 2 years now &amp; have made the decision to try to wean myself off this drug, mainly because of the weight gain I experienced while taking it.  I also had a horrible experience where I went on vacation &amp; forgot my medication.  The withdrawl symptoms started the next day.  I was completely floored by what happened to me; the dizziness, sweating, headache, brain zaps &amp; lack of ability to concentrate were severe.  I was also completely drained of energy.  I have been on a lower dose for about a week now, and none of the side effects, just a lingering tiredness.  So far, so good.  I would urge all patients to seek treatment other than Effexor &amp; tell doctors that if they feel they MUST prescribe it, to let the patient in on the symptoms they will experience when they get off the drug, or even miss a dose.  Im sure if I would have known the problems associated with Effexor XR, I would have NEVER, EVER taken this drug.  I would suggest everyone else to do the same.

I have tried paxil, zoloft, welbrutin, prozac none worked like this drug. Do have the side effect of elongnated ejactulation during sex and sometimes the most basic of words don't come to me and its frustrating. I take 300mg. a day and the side effects are pretty tough if you come off of it. I have resigned the fact that I will be on a drug for my life for depression and anxiety and in no way would I go back to the life I had prior to this medication. For the first time in my life I know how people live i.e. not being paranoid, worried or nervous all the time.

I will have to take it probably forever but I have my life back. At one time I didn't refill my perscription and went without it. DO NOT DO THAT!! Only reduce or stop using under a doctors orders. I had severe side effects from headache's, nightmare's, suicidal,ect... My doctor has me on 300 mg a day. Sometimes I may only take 275mg but always give myself the extra if needed. I use this in combination with 100mg Seroquel and 1mg Ativan. I find this combo really works for me. I have suffered from severe depression and bipolar my whole life.

I am back to post that my w/d was FINE. I read that no one posts the positives, so that's what i'm doing.  I tapered off from 75 mg to 37.5 mg for one week.  Then every other day. Then every 2nd day.  Then every 3rd day.  I was totally fine with the exception of one day of feeling &quot;off&quot; but tried to tell myself that my blood sugar was low; basically to trick myself into believing it was something else.  Because maybe it was?  I was determined to get off this before i experienced what others say is impossible.  It can be done with minimal impact to your life if you have the right mindset and determination to do it.  I did transition to another anti-depressant (Celexa 20 mgs), which probably helped a little.  I'm determined to get off this one as well in another month or so.

I have been on Effexor XR 75mg for almost 5 years now. It is great. No more panic attacks or fear of stupid things like dogs and the dark. It is true that if you don't take it at the same time you will feel like crap. Kind of like if you had a hangover. You can get off this drug. Both my husband and sister were on it and got weaned off by their doctor just fine. The only way I will stop taking it is if I was to become pregnant which I really doubt but you never know.

I was put on this the end of July.  I am on only 37.5 mg and finally am feeling the best I have felt in years. With a slow metabolism I generally use smaller doses than many.  My doctor said I may be on it for up to a year.  What works with some dosent always work for others.  I am still amazed.  and I hope it continues, I do feel warmer at night than usaual.  That is the only side effect now.

Like I said it was a miracle my anxiety went away I was able to deal with every day events more efectively.But before I knew it it controlled my actions I was no longer able to cry,enjoy sex,have impathy,or concern for most anything in my life.It made me numb to most all things.And after 4 years of being numb I decided I was going to gain controll of my life again little did I know it would be more hell than the reason I started taking this drug. It's been 1 year now And I'm down to 1/2 of a 37.5  pill a week,down from 225 a day. If I had of known that this loss of controll of my own life  is what it would have done to  me I would have put this effort into finding a support group or some other form of non drug related help. Life may have been difficult but I had feelings, Happiness saddness and love I wasn't numb.Life is getting better with time,The side effects are leaving day by day and I cried for the first time in 5 years.(tears of joy)It was better than any drug getting me through life.So please research this drug find people who are taking it or who have taken it before you decide.It is a miracle drug but it is also the drug from HELL.Good luck

If you have depression and anxiety that has not responded to other drugs then try this.  But be aware that it is very hard to wean off of. I have to say, however, that this drug has saved my life.  I can function now, work, deal with my diabetes and other health issues much better.

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	8/31/2009 11:19:32 PM	This helped my depression, but after time it caused my moods to start swinging so I had to go off.  This drug is SUPER ADDICTIVE and it took me trying to go off for over a year and 3 different times to get off.  I finally got off of it with 2 ER visits and the worst withdrawal symptoms I could ever imagine experiencing.  I have been off now for a month and am still dealing with some of the withdrawal symptions that are still hanging in there.  Doctors don't tell you how terribly addictive this drug is so be super careful and really decide if you want to become so addicted and dependent on a drug. When I was on it I had to take it to the exact hour every day or I'd start getting withdrawal symptoms.  Just be very careful with this one.

I have been drinking alot of extra water to flush out my system. I also take valerian root at night because it helps  to detox you from prescription or recreational drugs. 
Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	19-24	8/31/2009 8:02:00 AM	It has helped my mood, but the side effects have been pretty terrible: shaky hands, tense jaw/neck, memory problems and decreased sex drive to name a few.  Withdrawal symptoms are horrible too - it literally feels like an electrical storm in your brain.

Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	45-54	8/28/2009 11:37:34 AM	I gained 30 pounds on Effexor. After stopping the drug it took me over 12 months to reduce the weight gain. It slows the body's ability to metabolize food and the effects are residual after discontinued use. It works for anxiety but has a terrible weight gain side effect.
Depression	RLS96, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	8/28/2009 3:11:26 AM	I had severe post partum depression after the birth of my son. I tried just about everything, nothing worked but effexor.  Side effects were mainly sleep disturbances, I had very vivid dreams and always woke up exhausted.  I had to get off this medication when I got pregnant with my daughter after being on it for two years.  HELL, utter HELL.  The withdraws were horrific, I was paranoid, suicidal, delusional, and I am lucky I had a great support network.  I chose not to start taking it again after the birth of my daughter and have done fine.  If I ever had to take it again, the only way I would is if I knew I could take it for the rest of my life.

Depression	Raven, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	8/26/2009 10:49:25 PM	This is not a good drug because of the withdrawal symptoms you suffer with when you stop taking them. It is horrible, it is equivalent of being a heroin addict. At least a drug user is hospitalized and gets 24 hour medical help, with anti-depressants, you don't get any assistance. Use vitamins, exercise and therapy instead!

He was like a possessed man, like Satan himself. Now he is  asweet, loving caring human with a heart and a soul. We are NOT getting a divorce now. Only drawback: if he forgets one pill, he's a psycho for 2 days. Other wise, its heaven.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	8/24/2009 2:24:51 PM	I had only been on this drug for 1  and a half years...too long!!! It worked really well, it did, but now that i am trying to get off of it I want to die! I have serious anxiety around vomiting and nausea and they are the number 1 and 2 withdrawal symptoms!! Its been 8 days without the drug and I still have a hard time concentrating, I can't move quickly or I'll become nauseous, I dry heave in the morning or sometimes randomly, I am SO FREAKIN HOT and I can't cool down, I sleep all day (even at work - thank goodness for a wellness room), I've got muscle spasms, &quot;brain zaps&quot; where its like the world does a shuffle inside my skull...DO NOT GO ON THIS DRUG UNLESS YOU HAVE SERIOUSLY DEEP, DEEP DEPRESSION. There are much better options out there. I have been on 6 other medications, this one working the best for &quot;moods&quot; but I had no libido and was more or less numb for the entire time and the withdrawal is not even remotely worth it. It almost negates anything good Effexor ever did for me. If given a choice, I'd go back to Wellbutrin. That said, I've opted out of the antidepressant route all together and am going to a Naturopath and dealing with my issues through CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy). Please really consider your reasons for needing to be on medication and how long you think you may be on it. Effexor, if it has to be used, should only be as a very last resort. VERY LAST - it is like withdrawing from heroine, and i was on the absolute lowest prescibable dosage!!

Panic Disorder	25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		25-34	8/23/2009 10:40:16 AM	This is the best anti-depressant that I've been on.  I have had only 1-2 panic attacks in the two years that I've been on it.  Even though I dealt with a divorce, a chronic illness of a family member and working two jobs, I have rarely had a panic episode.  I don't know how I would've coped without it.  This pill is much more effective than Zoloft.  I truly feel like I am in control of my life.

I have been on effexor for 2 years ever since my son was 6mo old. This med works great but I am now trying to get off of it again. You WILL have withdraws. They are horrible i pased back and forth in my room for days, couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, was hot and couldn't get cooled down, sweating bad, and more anxiety then ever. Please if there is anyway possable please stay away from this med. Yes it may work I will give it that but what you have to go through just to get off of it is horrible. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.....
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/21/2009 4:03:34 PM	I have been taking Effexor XR for almost 10 years and it is the best antidepressant ever. I cannot imagine not taking it. The only bad things are dry mouth and low libido. And you can't stop taking it suddenly, you WILL have withdrawls and they are horrible. Decrese your dosage gradually. I would reccommend this drug to anyone with clinical depression.

I was on it for 3 years, have tried to stop taking it 3 times.  The withdrawl effects are soo horrible,  Vomitting, headaches, crying.  I am now trying Celexa (only taken Celexa one day so far).  Pray for me.  Hoping Celexa is better than the devil drug.  Would like to not take any medication at all.  Wish I would have never been prescribed Effexor.

I still need to give it time and my doctor said I may need to increase the dosage to calm down my anxiety, but this has worked better than any of the SSRI's that I've taken for my depression.  I was feeling down thinking I wasn't going to find something that would help me and then I asked for an SNRI and that's when my Doctor prescribed Effexor XR and I'm happy he did.

It was effective for a while then the side effects from the drug came on very strong. It caused a vaginal infection and a rash and very bad headaches. I would not recommend this med to any one with any kind of mental disorder. If i was with the FDA I would pull it off the shelves. BAD! BAD! BAD!
Depression	boanderey, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	8/16/2009 8:30:56 AM	Depression runs strongly in my family, and in the past 10 years I've been on several different medications.  I've been on Effexor XR for 6 years now and on my current 225 mg dose for 4 years.  If I miss a dose, I do notice some reactions - feeling achy, irritable, but those actually have lessened the longer I've been on it.  This is a great medication for me.

I never  dreamed in a million years I would ever need such a thing.   Some meds left me feeling fuzzy headed orworse yet, numb.   Effexor has lifted my mood and left menot feeling quite as hopeless as before.I also have had none of the side effects always listed with such medications.   Overall, I would would say the drug hashelped me.
Depression	technophobe, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	8/15/2009 12:24:04 PM	I went on Effexor when my paroxitine wasn't helping with my depression.  I was working in a stressful environment, and I realized that my depression was getting worse, like a heavy weight that kept getting heavier.  The effexor has helped with that, but I found it does not keep my anxiety levels down, so I take it in combination with a low dose of paroxitine for anxiety.  So far this has been effective, and I have been on the regimen for over a year now.  I was diagnosed in 1998, and have taken only Paxil (paroxitine) until I began this regimen.

Additionally, if I miss one day, the withdrawl symptoms kick in almost immediately with dizziness, headache, nausia and swimming eyes.

I went through a lot of doctors, therapists, group and medicine to get to the normal state I am in today.  One out of the five therapists I experienced was effective.  Group, for me, was useless.  I take 225 mg of Effexor XR once a day and a light dose of Klonopin twice a day.  That, combined with putting my foot down and taking charge of my life made all the difference.  I am a very happy, in charge, successful person today due to my medication and life adjustments. 
Other	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	8/15/2009 3:13:47 AM	I have suffered from severe fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndrome since 1983.  By nature, the disorder is resistant to treatment; as such, I have tried many different drugs in a desperate attempt to get well. I discovered that an antidepressant which reacts on both 5-HT &amp; NE works best, and out of the three currently marketed, Effexor XR (150mg) worked best for me by far. It does have one colosal drawback, however; it is extremely expensive. Without insurance, 90 capsules, 150mg, in the US will set you back over $400. Cymbalta's efficacy compares favorably, but it's price also compares to Effexor XR 150mg caps. I tried milnacipran when it was only available in Europe, without success. In any case, if you are trying to overcome severe CFS, you're in for the fight of your life. GOOD LUCK!
Depression	laurab, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/15/2009 1:16:41 AM	I have used this drug for quite some time. I ran out of these once and had a horrific experience with the immediate withdrawal. When I was able to get my medication a couple of days later I tried taking 1/2 of my prescribed dose (due to the scare of the withdrawal). I am prescribed two 150mg caps per day. I found one cap per day was no effective in treating my depression, so I went back to my full dose and felt much better. I have found it is useful in treating many disorders - many of which I have and my doctors have been pleased I am already taking Effexor to help with these. This would include lessening hot flashes, as well as lessening pain. 
Depression	Sad Sara, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	8/14/2009 11:19:16 PM	This medication has not given me any adverse reactions.  I have been taking it for over five years.

Effexor was the worst, hands down.  Check out http://www.petitiononline.com/effexor/.  If you go off of Effexor, you will learn what a &quot;brain shiver&quot; is, along with many other side effects. You will be incapacitated for months.  I cannot begin to tell you how bad this drug is. I pray for everyone who takes it and tries to go off of it. I was weaned off over a period of a year, but as soon as that last tiny portion of the pill was taken, that's when my nightmare began.  God bless.

Panic Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	8/12/2009 5:11:57 PM	This drug worked great for me, I took it for about 6 years and was on 75mg.  The anxiety pretty much disappeared.  However, I caution everyone to do your research before deciding to take this drug or any like it, and if you can possibly get through it without meds even better. If your anxiety is not that bad than I think xanax is much better and safer with no withdrawls because it's a fast-acting medication that leaves your system quickly.  I've recently &quot;weaned&quot; myself off Effexor and  while doing so experienced dizziness, moodiness, wierd brain/eye movement stuff, nervousness, did not sleep well for a few days, and tiredness which lasted about a week.  I plan to use the xanax as a PRN but so far have not had to use it, I also started to work out regularly a few years ago (martial arts) which I think helps the anxiety and is a much better alternative to medications.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	19-24	8/8/2009 5:38:59 PM	I had been on Effexor for four years, increasing the dose yearly when it began to decrease in effectiveness. Weening off was by far the worst experienece of my life. Constant uncontrollable crying, dizziness, and nausea- sometimes unable to keep any food down for days. I am finally off and doing much better on Wellbutrin

I have been very satisfied with the results. No more panic! When I miss a dose I do have feel dizzy and light headed as others have said. I also think it has really lowered my desire for sex. That said , I will take NOT having panic over a greater desire for sex.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	bh, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/6/2009 11:48:13 AM	I have had servere stress for several years and my doctor put me on Effexor 37.5mg the lowest dose. I have been on it for 2 months and feel great, no side effects except maybe less appetite. Due to the cost of the drug I have been off it for just a couple of days and feel fine. Maybe taking it every other day would work also. I think it is well worth trying!

I became unable to sleep at night. Had red itchy reaction on my face and neck. Started believe everyone would be better off without me. With out sleep my head injury   symptoms were worse. Could not think so I didn't realize that I  was reacting to the medicine. I started having seizures after having been off of medication for several years. I also bloated up. I became very puffy. Just kept getting worse and worse.This drug  really effected me badly.

It worked, but you can never miss a pill or the withdrawal is horrendous.  I don't like being on anything that has that bad withdrawl, so weaning off now.  Be careful that you try other stuff first, as this is a long term thing.  Stopping the Effexor is pretty awful.  Also experienced sexual side effects that weren't worth the benefits.

I gave it time to work and the smallest dose worked well for me, so I did not want to get use to the higher dose if the smaller one worked.

It is also - oddly the only one that worked within a week (and yes I know it is not supposed to).  And if I miss even a couple of days I can tell the difference.  I've been on several different medications since diagnosis and this medication is by far the ONLY one that actually made me feel good - not just relieve the symptoms to a degree.
Depression	sissy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	45-54	8/2/2009 7:54:39 AM	I took effexor xr for about 6 years. I found it worked extremely well for me at 150 mg. It was a real live saver for me. The only side effect I experienced was I was unable to have an orgasm. This went away in a few months. Coming off of it I did experience brain zaps which I found slightly annoying. If I missed more than one dose I would be sick to my stomach. I had to make sure I took it at the same time each day.

Mentally, I have no problem if I withdraw gradually.  However, after about one month being off the drug, I develop IBS and gut related symptoms. Pain, extreme bloating, gurgling, pressure in the abdomen. It affects my life to the point that I do not even go out that much anymore. It is unbearable.  So, after awhile, I figured out that every time I stopped the Effexor XR, my gut problems returned.  I then have to go back on this medication.  I know that the gut is made up of 95% serotonin. Therefore, my gut area has become addicted to this medication.  I wish I could go off of it, but after trying many times, I must stay on it.  I sure hate to depend on this drug to keep my gut stable. I never had any problems previous to this medication.  I have been on these type of anti-depressants for 8 years, but on this type of anti-depressant for 4 years. Before that, I was on Prozac.

Neuropathic Pain	Koolmom20, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	7/29/2009 5:23:01 PM	I was prescribed this drug for occipital neuralgia. I feel like the clouds have been lifted. I can think again. The only thing I really hate is it makes me so tired. I wish there was a drug with the same benefits but didnt make me so tired. I also never feel like eating. I have lost about 30 lbs, but my nerve pain has lessoned and my headaches are less frequent. So it is worth it. I was on 4 other meds before this one and i never thought anything was going to work but  this has. Although no drug works for everyone. I just hope when the time come i dont experience the bad withdraw effects like some people do. 
Depression	kerryann, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	35-44	7/29/2009 5:22:11 PM	Took Effexor XR 75mg for 1 month... didn't help with my temper or irritability like Sertraline did. It seemed to help the depression a little but not still Sertraline worked much better!  Plus since Effexor is a capsule I couldn't wean myself off of it

While it has stopped working several times,changing the dose and that of the Wellbutrin has kept me from going down the slippery slope. I take only 75 mgs. 
&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs	moondust, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	7/28/2009 4:42:49 AM	I had a hysterectomy several years ago and was thrown head-first into what my doctor called &quot;surgical menopause.&quot;  Then our family's retail store closed, my father died AND a five-year love relationship ended.  In short, I was a MESS and the 75mg timed-release dose was just what I needed.  It helped me tremendously, but there were unfortunate side effects: gained 40 lbs. in 4 years (size 12 to a size 16), let my house take care of itself (dust gathered and junk piled up), quit balancing my checkbook (unbelievable), and figured whatever it was I'd &quot;get to it one of these days.&quot;  Originally paid about $95 for 30 caps, which was manageable, but the price kept going up (XR not available in generic).  Last month it jumped to $148.  That was IT.  Asked my doctor how to go about weaning myself off this drug; she suggested the generic non-XR 75mg tabs and cutting them in half, taking 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 in the afternoon, gradually going to 1/2 each morning and then none at all.  It's been 3 weeks and the gradual withdrawal seems to be working.  Side effects so far have been waking up in the middle of the night with hallucinations (birds flying around the room) and just feeling &quot;out of body&quot; at times - minimal, to say the least.  Have started walking and dusting again (checkbook is too overwhelming right now).  Whatever it takes, I intend to get my home and my body and my finances back on track.  And I WILL.

Extreme Apprehension or Fear of Social Interaction	colycole, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/27/2009 3:42:42 PM	This is my second time on effexor xr 75mg. The medicine worked great the first time for my extreme anxiety of everyday life.  I lived in a constant state of panic.  Yes, I agree the side effects can be terrifying and cause more anxiety.  I dealt with an increase heart rate and felt very nervous the first week both times.  However, I know this medicine works.  The first time on effexor xr for more than a year; I experienced the terrible effects if I missed a dose.  But, I also know whats its like not to even want your two precious children come towards you because they made nervous. I went back on the effexor when I also lost my fourteen year old daughter to Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.  When you almost lose a child you realize its time to quit being young and stupid and think you can handle things on your own.  I would rather deal with some unwanted side effects and unpleasant feelings than to not enjoy my childrens life. Plus, I noticed the way I lived in fear affected my children.  And my daughter has shown signs of the same anxiety.  I realize getting help means helping to teach my children to enjoy and embrace everyday God gives us.  And if I am having a bad effexor day, I except that its not a good day and know tomorrow is a new day. Also, taking a 0.5 mg Xanax helps control the side effects when starting effexor xr.  It helps with the nervousness and rapid heart rate.  Took it three times a day the first week when starting and reduced the xanax til 2 a day and sometimes those are just half a pill.  Ask your dcotor about something to take the edge off when starting a effexor because it takes years or more for our nerves to get bad; so it takes the effexor some time to undo the damage our nerves has caused(there is no shame in it).
Depression	Roger1987, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	19-24	7/26/2009 10:37:18 PM	I have been suffering Long term depression. I sought out help in my final year of college. The Health Center DR put me on this and it worked. It worked for me for the whole time. There was one lul where watching a movie with a lighter in my hand (as i just lite a candle While watching 1408) the fire scene came on and i thought to myself... I could light this lighter and drop my hand and it would look like the movie. (I never have thought like that EVER) I was already working on coming off this drug as I was ALWAYS sweating and I wanted to end the medication life. Every night was filled with sweat, all winter long I was sweating, ACTUALLY I didnt mind it because I was warm when it was Cold. The other side effect I got was if I missed my dose even by 3 hours if I was walking I which ever direction i would turn that hand would go numb. The weaning off was not too hard, but I took it slow with an actual physician, I went down 37.5mgs each month. When it came to the end I felt like crap for about a week, the sweating ended after about a month. It has now been out of my system since March 09 and its July09. I look back at the last year and a lot of it, was a blur due to this medication.
Depression	Butterfly, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	65-74	7/26/2009 5:40:55 PM	I was initially precscribed Effexor XR to treat my severe dailey migraines along with several other drugs At that time I was not diagnosed with depression although, I suspect my doctor thought that was the cause of my headaches. I had mild relief but, still had dailey headaches. About 4 years ago my doctor recommended Botox injections. We found that the combination of Effexor and the botox injections (every 3 months) was the winning combination. After 47 odd years of severe to incajpacitating migraines, I AM FINALLY HEADACHE FREE. I take one 250 mg Effexor in the morning and another at bedtime. As to side effects, I can't comment as I'm on several other medications with the same side effects, namely dry mouth and eyes.  However, it's more than worth it to only have occassional. normal headaches (like when it's approaching time for the botox) and very rarely a severe one.  I'm, naturally, very pleased with the Effexor. I was unaware of the withdrawal problems but, will probably be on it forever so I'm not worrying about that now.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	7/25/2009 12:43:21 AM	when i began using this medication about a year and a half ago, it worked fine. I could actually see something happen- like i noticed that i was changing, and i was back to my old self again. Then about a few months later it just stopped working. IDKY- it just did. and now my episodes have came back, and they are stronger. Not to mention I get tired- a LOT easier now and can't get enough sleep- even when i take it just before bed. I also find myself having way more panic attacks, so the doc has upped the RX and decided to try piggy backing with another. So we shall see how this one goes! I mean it really did work- and hopefully it will again.

Depression	pamela, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	7/24/2009 11:34:12 PM	Effexor worked great as far as keeping me on an even keel. I had no side effects, except for a 40 pound weight gain over the 4 yrs that I was on it. The weight gain was bad enough, but worse than that is trying to get off this drug. Getting off of it is an absolute nightmare - brain shocks, sleep paralysis, uncontrollable crying, and nightmares.

I tried to get off this med, but felt so sick, like a junkie, that I ran into the doctor's office like a crazy woman begging for a script. I will never attempt to get off it again. I hate the idea that I am very much addicted to this med, and was not even warned beforehand. Please beware!
Panic Disorder	lifesabike, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/24/2009 1:54:23 PM	When I began having panic attacks at work my doctor recommended something to be taken daily rather than as needed. Within 30 minutes I had stopped sighing to get my breath. It is truly a miracle drug for me, as I have always had depression with several episodes of clinical depression.  After being on Effexor for several years I thought I was able to come off. I weaned myself off gradually, but within a few weeks began to feel depressed.  Decided life's too short to live with depression and anxiety.  Thank God for Effexor.

The tics went away shortly after the med was stopped.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	7/22/2009 10:19:14 PM	worked well for a long time but then stopped working. interfered with sex drive as well which was very upsetting. made me manicky sometimes and I sweat a lot. stopped taking the drug under a doctor's supervision (tapers and all that) and experienced severe withdrawal symptoms that were debilitating.  I am currently taking Cymbalta which seems to work a bit better but still I'm not satisfied.  Oh well people I guess we can't expect a pill to make ALL our problems go away, we have to put in the work as well! good luck to you all. 
Bipolar Depression	walkingRx, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	7/22/2009 5:13:31 PM	I took this medication for about 3 weeks, within the first week I had a migraine that I was unable to get rid of. Some days it would be worse than others, but I would always have a headache. Week 2 I started getting hives all over my arms and legs. I get rashes easy so I had to rule out a lot of different things till I figured it was the pills. Had to change pills again!
Depression	kaitlyn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/21/2009 11:03:12 PM	I have been on Effexor XR for a very long time and consider it a miracle drug. As long as I am on it I am very much in control and have no anxiety at all. Once a Dr. tried to take me off of it and it was the worst week of my life, so I agree totally with the comments related to the withdrawl issues. Also I travel a lot overseas and a couple of times I have either forgotten to pack it or it was in my luggage that did not arrive on time. If you are on a high dosage it can be difficult to get foreign Dr's to prescribe your normal dosage, so triple check that it is in your carry-on before you leave.

I have been on it for 6 years with the least amount of hypomanic trouble compared to the other drugs I've tried.

Please &quot;google&quot; effexor and you will find tons of blogs dedicated to the horror stories people have experienced when trying to get off of this drug.  Thank goodness I researched this drug before getting back on it following my pregnancy.

Depression	nopain, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	7/16/2009 7:05:32 PM	For so long, this medication worked well for me. But lately, it seems to be far less effective. My doctor is weaning me off while trying something new (Cymbalta). So far, so good, but we are taking it in baby steps. Once before, she tried weaning me off it and I just had to give up and stay on it because of the severity of the withdrawal symptoms. The so-called &quot;brain zaps&quot; were horrible. I thought I was going to die. I had the worst of both worlds: depression increasing as withdrawal symptoms were getting worse. I am hoping for an easier transition. The medication did work for many, many years, so overall I am satisfied, but for me, the withdrawal symptoms were too much to bear.

IT WORKED THE FIRST 6 MONTHS BUT THEN MY METABOLISIM WAS EATING UP THE MEDS AND BY 4PM EVERYDAY I WAS GETTING THE 'PINS AND NEEDLES' SENSATION IN MY HEAD AND PAIN BEHIND MY EYES. I STARTED TAKING TWO 75MG. ONE IN THE AM AND ONE IN THE PM. THIS WORKED FOR 2YEARS. THEN I WAS FINALLY DIAGNOSED WITH A MOOD DISORDER AND MY DOSAGE WAS UPPED TO 225MGS ONCE A DAY. NO MATTER IF I TOOK MEDS ON A EMPTY,OR FULL STOMACH IT ALWAYS MADE ME NAUSEA. FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS MY EYE TWITCHED RANDOMLY. AFTER ABOUT 6 MONTHS MY METABOLISIM WAS EATING UP THE MEDS AGAIN. FINALLY MY DOC DIAGNOSED ME W BI POLAR. NOW I'M ON SEIZURE MEDS. I THINK THE EFFEXOR ESP AT 225MG MADE ME GAIN ALOT OF WEIGHT.I AM STILL WEANING OFF THE EFFEXOR.... SO FAR I'M NOT HAVING ANY WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS.

I liked effexor because I found I could concerntrate more on things such as watching a movie, reading a book or engaging in conversation. It allowed me to come outside of my own head and not focus on me and my problems so much. But the heart palpitations never stopped. Overall, I did feel a lot less shit house so I can't wait to get back on it again.

Depression	want to help, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	35-44	7/13/2009 4:34:33 PM	Taking the drug can help reduce depression however the withdrawal effects are rarely addressed, be warned, it is extremely difficuly dealing with the withdrawal symptoms! It's been over a week and my head still feels horrible and functioning is difficult, I was better off before I started the drug. Have a discussion with your doctor before taking it, it's basicaaly a one way ticket.
Depression	paws, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/13/2009 8:50:53 AM	I have been on this for a long time, and it has helped me so much. I call it my miracle drug. If you miss a dose though you feel dizzy, faintness, and it's really hard to concentrate. I am on the highest dose possible. I am scared to get off this drug, I do not want to be depressed anymore, my doc says I might have to be on this for the rest of my life. great. I do swear by this drug!
Other	Searching for peace, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	7/12/2009 8:46:23 PM	I am a male who has been on Effexor XR ap. 6+ years.  There was a notable positive difference when I started 37.5 mg qd dosage.  I could not believe the difference!!!  Gradually, my PCP gradually increased my dosage as time &amp; incidents have occured.  Now, I am on 300mg qd - AM.My new XY is weaning me off Effexor XR for two weeks @ 150 mg qd - AM and as of now wants me to be totally off tomorrow (07-13-09).  Instead, I am to start Wellbutrin XL 150 mg qd starting tomorrow.  The &quot;let down&quot; from the Effexor XR has been horrible my second week.  I have had increasing amount of depression episodes; wanting to sleep all of the time; increasing muscle &amp; joint ache; having hot and cold spells; having very restless periods; wanting to cry to rid myself of built-up internal tension; and having desire to be around &quot;loved ones,&quot; but would rather be alone in bed sleeping.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	7/11/2009 1:20:40 AM	My experience has been a good experience. Now that my doctor and I have found the right amount ( dosage ) before finding it, there where some side affets that where quite uncomfortable. But I am now good. This is the second anti-depressant I have tried. The first was Zoloft which was very unsuccessful. We are also combining Effexor with Tegritol? ( mood stablizor ) I am Diagonsed with Major Depression &amp; generalized anxiety disorder.
Bipolar Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	19-24	7/10/2009 11:04:32 PM	I had a very bad reaction to this medication.  Within a few days of starting this medicine, it worsened my depression greatly and gave me suicidal thoughts and made me hopeless.  I have been on many other antidepressants with little or no effects, but Effexor XR had horrible effects on me, even at a low dose.  I have heard others who tolerated it well and had benefits from it, but everyone is different when it comes to medications, and Effexor XR worsened my depression greatly.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	45-54	7/10/2009 2:22:59 PM	I'm actually on the highest dose, 450 mg once a day. I no longer need any other anti-depressant drugs. I feel much better, and am able to use my coping skills when minor depression flare ups happen. I would recommend Effexor to anyone with longterm depression issues.
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	7/10/2009 12:48:12 PM	I have to take 225mg plus other antidepressents, I know my case is difficult. I get discuraged often. But Effexor XR has worked the best for me thus far.
Depression	difficulty weaning off, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	1	2	Female	45-54	7/9/2009 3:22:20 PM	This medication worked well for me while taking it. If I missed a dose by even a few hours I would begin to get dizzy and have odd sensations in my brain. When I attempted to wean off the medication I had a lot of trouble. The Dr. lowered my dose to the lowest doseage and I did that for a while with minimal dizziness and odd sensations but everytime I tried to skip a day and get on that portion of the weaning off I would get terrible dizziness, bumping into things, hearing a creaking noise in my brain and having memory difficulties. My balance was entirely off. I did the one day inbetween for longer than my Dr. originally anticipated. The Dr. said he has never seen a patient have such difficulty weaning off a medication. I missed 2 days of work over the course of this and am on vacation as I write this. I haven't taken the medication at all in 4 days and the problems are fairly minimal. This has been more difficult to quit than quiting smoking. It concerns me that a medication can alter some process in the brain that when removing the medication from the system, following the process of doing so, causes such severe changes in my natural chemestry. I don't know if this experience is unique to me but if someone has difficulties with medications I would avoid this one if there is a different choice.

Bipolar Depression	Nikki, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	7/8/2009 10:03:58 AM	I was put on 300 mg of Effexor XR in 2002 and took this dosage until 2009.  If a dose was missed or late, I would immediately feel &quot;shocks&quot; throughout my entire body; like I was being electrocuted. It has been the most difficult and worst experience of my life to come off of these drugs.  It has taken several months for the withdrawals to stop even though I have been slowly weaning myself off.  During this time I have been extremely angry, self destructive and suicidal.  I truly did not think I would make it.  The coming off effexor part has been so terrible that I cannot remember if it worked for me for all those years or not.  My doctor did not offer any support except to say that &quot;everyone goes through the &quot;shock&quot; feelings...You just have to deal with it&quot;.  Obviously she had never been through this as I am sure most doctors will never get themselves hooked on these drugs.  I did not know what to do.  If it weren't for my husband &amp; family I am 90% sure I would have killed myself.  I will never allow my body to become addicted to these types of medications again.  Please do not take the first doctor's prescription and believe that he/she has your best interest in mind.  Please seek second or third opinions.  Drug companies offer incentives to doctors for selling their &quot;drug&quot; and as we all know, anti-depressants are the trendy, hot drug and there is so much competition the pharmaceutical companies have to push doctors to prescribe their brand.  I am not saying that medication should never be used; it helps many, many people - just PLEASE protect yourself. I am telling you now, if you start Effexor XR, you will end up taking it everyday for the rest of your life or you will go through the worst pain, depression, anger you will ever experience trying to get off Effexor XR AND you cannot do it by yourself - you need someone to watch out for you.

Depression	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female		7/7/2009 8:53:41 PM	Was on Effexor for a few months, went off because it didnt really work for me. Still very weepy and depressed. I had no side effects taking it or coming off of it. Maybe becuase I was put on Lexapro while weaning off of it? I dont know, but I know one person who loves it and one person who had to go off of it cause she kept hearing music in her head ! I think everyone is different and will have a different experience. Dont let anyone talk you into or out of anything. If you trust your M.D., see what he or she says.

My doctor never told me about any side affects or withdrawal symptoms.  I feel like I would have to check myself into a psych ward to get off of it. Missed a dose and got very dizzy and tired.  I tried to stop taking , had severe paranoia and I wanted to kill somebody. I wish I had known this before I started, I think I have more symptoms now than I did before.

My doctor told me it would take 3-4 weeks to get into my system before it works! I could not stand this feeling for 4 weeks. 
Depression	Bermie, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	7/2/2009 6:58:02 PM	I have taken 150 mg daily for over a year after changing from other meds like Lexepro and Wellbutin. I found that the Effexor XR worked well. I have recently taken myself off this medication. There were side effects to stopping such as vision difficulties, nausea, vomiting and sleep disturbances but, not as difficult as I thought from the reviews. I can only believe that because of my large weight, it did not effect me as bad as some other reviewers. I am trying to stay off all depression meds and go with more homeopathic remedies, exercise and routine.
Bipolar Depression	Rachelle S., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	7/1/2009 8:30:09 PM	I have had mixed results with Effexor XR.  (I took it for several years before switching to Pristiq a few months ago.)  Initially and for several years after starting Effexor XR, it did a good job treating my depression associated with Bipolar Disorder (I take mood-stabilizers as well!)  Effexor XR was, at one time, the best anti-depressant I had ever taken in terms of mood symptoms.  I did have some gastrointestinal side-effects; diarrhea and stomach-aches.  However, I medicated those in addition to taking the Effexor XR, because the Bipolar was &quot;a bigger issue.&quot;  After approx. 4 years though, the effect from the Effexor XR diminished and I had to take an increased dose, which brought more side-effects and less impact on elevating my mood.  If I ever missed a dose of Effexor XR or took it a bit late, my head would feel dizzy and horrible.  I went off the medication twice.  Once, (a former) doctor did not have another anti-depressant for me to switch too and that was a nightmare, both with bad side-effects and mood issues.  The second (and final) time I discontinued the Effexor XR, I started Pristiq and my new doctor helped make a very smooth transition by decreasing the Effexor XR and increasing the Pristiq.  So, overall, Effexor XR may prove very effective, but may have some side-effects.

DO NOT TAKE!!!I have watched my mother, who has never taken a recreational drug in her life struggle with this drug almost killing her (literally) from the withdrawl symptoms. She began taking it to treat her hot flashes and depression and built up to 225mg. All was well and wonderful, that is until she ran out of insurance, lost her company and could no longer afford the outrageously expensive drug. She stopped taking the drug and began to feel like she was shutting down, physically and mentally. I have struggled with opiate addiction for a few years now and i think there is no worse feeling than the withdrawl you experience when quitting. that was until i saw my mom go through this. she went to the hospital for what she was feeling (not knowing it was effexor withdrawl) and they told her that her body was literally shutting down. Once she started telling them the medication and dose she was on, they knew right away it was the effexor. since then she has only been able to ween down to 75mgs, due to the fact that YOU CAN LITERALLY DIE FROM THE WITHDRAWL OF THIS DRUG. She feels too awful when she tries to take any lower of a dose. She feels like she cant control any mental functions, she feels out of body, horrific nightmares, can't sleep right, complete physical drain, awful rages. And thats just the symptoms that wont actually kill you!!!Just take the time to research the class action lawsuit against Wyeth. And the thousands of blogs about the people going through the same things i have described here. Please just don't take this drug, i wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy.

I gained over 35lbs and had never before had a weight problem. Getting off the medication is not easy. You really have to ween off of it over several weeks. My side effects with getting off of this drug were dizziness, headaches, sweating, nausea, shocking sensations etc. decreasing it to 37.5 and then decreasing the number of beads inside is the only way to do it.I wished I hadn't started this medication in the first place. It took several months to get my metabolism back and I still am having trouble with taking the weight off.I am 35 and my weight never fluctuated before I took this.

I stopped the Cymbalta due to the cost! I love love love this med. I always have felt heavy with burden, or have had social anxiety, couldn't stand to talk to ANYONE if i wasn't interested in the conversation. I could agree with them all day long but not even remember what the conversation was about later! I had NO interest in anyones thoughts, ideas, or conversations, or life stories! I could only see the pos. effects from this med. when it finally regulated in my body, which was roughly a constinous month without missing a single dose! I became more engaged in conversations with people, was truly interested with what they had to say, and was able to comprehend what was being said to remember it later! I am more happy with life in general, i'm more laid back and just about accepting of whatever burdens or stress that heads my way! I do have VERY vivid dreams( almost life like), I STILL have NO SEXUAL DRIVE AT ALL! I DO NOT like that and neither does my husband! I AM NOT ABLE TO ORGASM, I HAVE GAINED ABOUT 15LB.S IN 6 MONTHS, i have less desire to get up and do the things i once loved (waxing my car, cutting grass, and MAINLY cleaning)! Its a toss-up for me on wether or not its worth taking the meds and dealing with the neg. side effects, or going back to being a selfish, inconsiderate individual that loved the outdoors!  I love the possitive sides and ABSOLUTLY HATE THE NEG. I hope this information has help a user that has some questions!

Depression	Dmac, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	6/24/2009 1:40:46 PM	I have been taking Effexor XR 75mg for over 2 years and I like it the most. I tried Lexapro (did not like and did not seem to work), Paxil (worked but was too powerful with side effects), Remeron (did not seem to work and had little to no side effects), and Welbutrin (did not seem to work as well as Effexor &quot;for me&quot;). One thing is for sure, all of these meds cause grief when missing a dose or trying to stop. Paxil was by far the worst if I missed a dose. I have always taken low dosages of these meds but they seem to even me out. Effexor does not cause side effects at 75mg but at 150mg I was having libo issues and it did not seem to help me in any way that was apparent or measureable. Effexor XR can be missed for about one day but come the second day I get headaches, the zaps and dizzy headed. Some of the other meds I tried could not be missed by one day without terrible withdrawl symptoms. I might try a Welbutrin/Effexor combo but it will be a minimal dose for both. I have no idea why people think a pill is not easy to use and rate drugs that are pills less than 5 stars??? Put it in your mouth and swallow :)

I too have vivid dreams, remembering them each night but it is not that bad. The orgasm thing, I could not in the beginning but now they are actually better.  Missing one does really does make a difference, but perhaps that is because I KNEW I missed a dose.  In addition, I WISH I had the reduction of appetite...still eating just fine.  Overall, works great for me.

I stopped taking it not knowing there would be SEVERE SIDE-EFFECTS! The withdrawal was one of the worst things I have ever gone through. Never having gone through any kind of withdrawl, I didn't know what was happening to me. If you even think about getting off this medication, please talk to your Dr. and let them ween you off, don't just gp cold turkey.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	6/22/2009 9:04:18 AM	Wow!  Was on it for 6 months.  Doctor wouldn't call me in a refill.  I didn't have $$ for doctor visit.  She knew I would have withdrawals.  WOW!  It was the WORST couple of weeks of my life.  Don't Take!
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/22/2009 8:22:04 AM	I was on 300mg a day for 10 yrs and found Effexor to work wonders, only noticeable side effect was a little blurry vision and some constipation.  My doctor told me about side effects and what to expect coming off and how to taper down, I don't understand why so many have had such terrible withdrawls.  I am not saying there weren't a few but nothing like everyone is talking about.  I wonder why more doctors don't tell patients what to expect.  I feel great now that I am off.

Only side effect is difficult to ejaculate. Tried generic but could not sleep for over 2 weeks and went back on effexor XR. Prevents headaches and Migraines. Have tried to come off a couple times however my headaches returned and now I will stay on this great medication
Depression	nurse/patient, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	6/20/2009 8:58:52 PM	I used this a few years, nothing bothered me, I was very calm, but almost numb. It's more normal to have other emotions, like anger, excitement, etc. I told my doctor I wanted to stop, and it was the internet that informed me to wean off it. It was still a bad withdrawal to be left like that. I never had experienced such anxiety and panic. All I had was nsaid/PM to help me get 3-4 Hrs sleep. I shouldn't have had to go  through that unsuperivised.

Wondering if it was the re-start at high dosage levels?????

I took this medication for a couple of years and then my situation improved and I wanted to try without an antidepressant. I slowly decreased my dose but went through an absolute nightmare to get off this drug! It made me vomit, SEVERE headache, feeling of being electrocuted, felt like I was crawling out of my own skin. It was SOOOO awful. Take something else.

The worst side effect for me was that I really let my housecleaning go to the wayside. Almost like I didn't care, did what I had to do to get by. I agree with others about bad side effects if a dose is missed; happened to me a couple of times, ugh! No longer taking it.

I found myself a lttle too happy with 75 mg so now I actually squeeze then open the plastic shell of the pill and pour the little medicine onto a dish. I then take about a quarter of it each day. It works great for me. I don't know if they want you to do this or not, but if it works so I'll continue to do it.

I WAS A ZOMBIE, COULDN'T THINK, OR FOCUS  I WAS ALWAYS HOT, AND HAD RAGING ANGER SPELLS. I FINALY STARTED CUTTING THE MG MYSELF TO 150 MG , THEN WENT TO MY DOCTOR AND TOLD HER I WANTED A rx FOR 75 MG. i FOUND ANOTHER PSYCHIATRIST AND TOLD HIM ALL TH SYMPTOMS AND HOW MYSERABLE i WAS, AND HE AGREED WITH ME AND CHANGED ME TO A LOW DOSE OF LEXAPRO. I FEEL LIKE ME AGAIN! I HAVE FEELINGS, EMOTION, AND A MIND THAT CAN ACTUALLY WORK AGAIN AND BE CREATIVE.i NEVER THOUGHT i WOULD EVER SEE THAT PART OF ME AGAIN!

It is of course easy to use, how difficult could it be taking one pill daily?Then one morning as I was about to take my daily meds, I had a major seizure at home.  I do not suffer from any seizure disorder and have not had one since.  This medication has made me terrified to try ANY medication that is unfamiliar to me.  I would never take this medication again.

I think the medication taken for anything works (or does not work) dependant on the person. This has worked for me and with no side effects at all.

It was the worse side effects I have EVER experenced and ended up in the ER after one week of use. It caused severe night sweeats, sleep diisturbance, worsened the anxiety to the point of my brain being completely manic/aggitated and could not concentrate on the minor of things (TV!).  It was explained to me by a psych doctor, after the fact, that the reason I had this reaction is because the med is for anxiety AND depression. Since I did not suffer from depression it simply added 'gasoline to the fire' by speeding  up my brain - tenfold! I am now on Buspar (one week) and  have not experienced any side effects.

I've been on so many other anti-depressants that their effects eventually wore off.  I did experience the vivid dreams (nightmares sometimes), thirst, lack of sexual desire, insomnia, anxiety, but the worst part towards the end was the tiredness.  I was what my doctor called a state of hibernation.  All I wanted to do was sleep.  I couldn't wake up in the morning, I'd nap at lunch and go to bed as soon as I got home from work.  I'm transitioning to Pristiq at this time so let's see how this goes but Effexor and Paxil have been the two meds that worked the best for me.

I did not get maximum relief until I reached a dose of 450 mg. per day. No side effects except a ringing in my ears. Felt normal for a change. I started to feel anxiety when the economy started to fall apart in October, 2008. My doc switched me to Lexapro, then Cymbalta, then Zoloft. Felt terrible on all of them. I then returned to Effexor, and I feel great with less anxiety. I think I just needed a break from the drug. Kind of like pressing my &quot;reset&quot; button.

Dr. changed me over to Effexor XR, 75mg. and I have taken it ever since. No side effects but the copay is high on my Rx plan. I would get off but I'm scared of the side effects of withdrawal. And I do have a more &quot;easy going&quot; mood taking it. I guess I'll just take it the rest of my life!!

I quit it cold turkey which sucked nausea and mood swings but went away after about a week. like having a hangover for a week. Stuff is expenisive.

I missed one dose because of a mixup at the pharmacy and experienced horrible withdrawal symptoms. Do everything to ensure that you do not miss a single dose, these side effects are common as a result: vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, &quot;brain zaps&quot;, uncontrollable crying and rapid heart beat.

Extreme Apprehension or Fear of Social Interaction	wickedhalo7924, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/7/2009 8:14:41 PM	I have been on Effexor XR for social anxiety and slight depression due to a raw up bringing in my childhood, that were at the hands of my father! I have been taking the Effexor XR for almost 3 months after being on Cymbalta, and the generic for Effexor, due to the fact that Cymbalta didn't help me much and taking two doses of the generic effexor just about made me puke because of the taste. For the first couple weeks of taking it, i swore that it was a waste of time and most deffinatley money! I continued doctors orders and took my medicine on a regular basis! I am glad that i did because after my body regulated the drug i have seen a great difference. I am much more happier, content, and i don't loose my cool at the drop of a dime! I am able to focus 10 times better and i am able to socialize much easier than before! It has done wonders for me! I found that taking my med. before i go to sleep rather than early in the morning when i awoke made me feel better and help curve the appetites and cravings! This drug makes you pretty hungry and wanting to snack all the time. So by taking it before i go to sleep helped me bypass all the cravings and snacking! my dreams became more vivid or &quot;real life like&quot; but i would rather the dreams than the weight gain! The only down side to this medication that i have experienced so far is minor headaches, (including sinus), and only once since taking the med. i felt like snapping and being extremely pissed off, (most likely due to my body trying to regulate the drug), gaining weight, (I ABSOLUTLY hate it). I am retaining ALOT of fluid. I have an appointment Fri. so hopefully i will be able to get the water retention under wraps! I have not expierenced the brain &quot;zaps&quot;, nausea, or any other negative side affects that many users talk about on the reviews of this drug! I hope that some of this information has helped other users, and or reviewers that are thinking about taking Effexor XR. Everyone is different when it comes to narcotics!

It was the only medication that worked for me.  Yes, in the beginning the headaches were crappy, but it worked!!  Since, I have been diagnosed bipolar and am on Lamictal as well.  Dr. is playing with my meds and has switched me from Effexor to Cymbalta.  I believe the withdrawal is what is killing my head right now.  I can't wait until it stops.

I wonder if this is considered habit-forming &amp; I won't ever be able to stop taking it?
Depression	ZoZu, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/4/2009 1:52:59 PM	I have been on Effexor for over a year.  At first, I had trouble with the whole orgasm issue and was truly upset that I might never be able to have one again.  Shouldn't have worried - once my body adjusted to the drug, everything worked itself out.  My dreams are weird, not so much in the content of them but the way they happen.  They are so vivid and real and play kind of like a movie (which really isn't a bad thing).  I love it!

I do feel tired and lazy alot. I have also noticed during my  period my symptoms get worse or come back. I have recently been having an ongoing battle with low blood sugar and somewhat high blood pressure and also low potassium. I am unclear whether Effexor XR is the cause or not.

I was working alot, running two businesses. I felt I was a strong person, so I was concerned about the mental and physical effects I was experiencing. I went to a Dr., and was told I needed this pill, it would help. The Dr.told me he could not help me if I did not start this medication. Had I know what would happen when tring to get off, I would have never started. This will be my third time trying to stop taking this &quot;non-addictive&quot; medication. Believe me, this IS ADDICTIVE, and the FDA should make the Wyth Company make people aware of this before they become an addict. The side effects of withdrawl are really, really bad.

It is well studied and known that bipolar patients go crazy on traditional anti-depression.  It didn't work for me because of other issues.I will say this much.  Aside from the mania, I experienced impotence of the likes I never thought were possible.Sex was unbearable, because as much as I enjoyed and desired it I could not achieve orgasm, and I would go flat a lot.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	6/1/2009 9:01:10 PM	I have always had the normal bouts with anxiety but around 6 months ago, while I was away on a conference trip, I began having anxiety attacks (excelerated heatbeat, feeling of something bad was going to happen if I drive over the bridge). Then when I got home, the anxiety got worse.&#160; I felt like I was losing my mind, totally unlike myself. I decided I needed to see my doctor immediately because I knew something was not right.&#160; He gave me Effexor-I started on 37.5 dose for 10 days, then increased to 75mg a day.&#160; The first time I took it, I felt this overwhelming sensation of cool happiness and I knew it was going to help me.&#160; My anxiety didn't completely go away but it has made a huge difference in how I felt during that time.&#160; My doctor said he can increase the dosage but I didn't want to for fear of being overly medicated and too dependent on it.&#160; Now that I have been on it for 6 months, I feel okay to increase it, if need be.&#160; I am a little apprehensive of what type of withdrawal side effects I will feel, but I am confident in my doctor and will follow his instructions to decrease my dosage slowly.&#160; I know everybody has their own experience with this medication, but I wanted to share mine in hope's that it will help someone feel okay about taking it.&#160; I had not intended to write this review but I read the guy's experience who wrote on 5/30/09 @ 3:21pm and it touched me.&#160; So I hope this will help someone. Also, turning to my faith, family, and friends has been a tremendous help.

My teeth haave rotted out from the inside out and treatment for this has caused me constant pain and depression.  The Doctor who first set me on tjhis med did not tell me about the dry mouth so I am losing a mouthfull of what were perfectally good teeth.  Be sure your Doctor tells you EVERYTHING about this and anyother Psych med thew want you to take.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Got help, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	5/31/2009 3:04:46 AM	I must be lucky. I'm on 37.5mg 2x per day, have been for about 4 months. After 5 years of depressive symptoms &amp; then being diagnosed with PTSD, I have to say my life has completely turned around. The only side effect has been minor headaches, but thankfully not daily. It did take some time to work &amp; some days I am &quot;moody&quot; but I chalk that up to the normalacy of life. I get along better with everyone, can drive, be in groups &amp; deal with stressors better than I remember. If you are considering this med, give it a chance to work &amp; think about combining it with conventional therapy (talking to someone). I highly recommend!
Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	45-54	5/30/2009 3:21:48 PM	Had anx. most my life.  Then hit with some depression few months ago. Wow, that's no fun.  I will never say to someone, &quot;hey snap out of it&quot; Life works in funny ways sometimes.  Anyways, was forced to get help with the depression. Started with lowest dose 37.5 for 10 days, then 75mg for 14 days and to date at 75 + 37.5 = 112.5mg.  The hardest part was waiting for it to work, It took atleast 5/6 weeks. I wanted to quit many times, but stuck with it. Weird side effects along the way but help from Dr., Therapist and friends helped. The other problem was I expected when it did work to immediately make the depression just go away.  Found out &quot;it don't work that way&quot; I guess the depression came on slowly (thou I never realized) and it goes away slowly.  So I seemed to feel best in the evening and worst in the morning. Dr. said that's normal with depression. The other hurdle to get over is I'll be feeling like my old self for a day or two and &quot;boom&quot; out of the clear blue it creeps back.  Which at first really scared me and pissed me off.  How dare it, after all that hard work. But, with patience I slowly start feeling better again. Quite a roller coaster ride. To date, I have more better days than bad days. Having to work hard at feeling just &quot;normal&quot; does suck.  But life is worth it. With so many horrible things that can happen to us, I try to feel fortunate compared to those who have no real hope.  Regarding people with suicide thoughts, as long as you keep them as thoughts, just don't act on them.  I'm sure every adult has wondered about suicide at some point. Someone once told me that suicide is a &quot;Final solution to a Temporary problem&quot;. Think about it very true.Depression/Anx are the most treatable of mental disorders.  So hang in there, take baby steps, and believe in the BIG Guy.  That's all I'm doing. 
Depression	bert, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	5/29/2009 6:48:27 PM	I have been on effexor xr 225mg for 11-12 years now. i recently had a pharmacy mix up and have reduced my dosage to 150mg.  it took a couple of weeks to feel normal again but i am surprised at all the side effects that people report.  other than night sweats, weird dreams and lowered sexual desire, i don't notice many other symptoms. i fear going off of this completely though which is why i have been on it so long.
Depression	cold as ice, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	5/29/2009 5:31:15 PM	I have decided to stop taking Effexor. It has only been a month, however I have been eating like a pig, very drowsy, very irritable and I cant seem to get rid of this headache. I have been weaning myself off the Effexor for a few days now. The only thing that I have experienced so far is pain behind my eyes. Weird! I will begin Wellbutrin next month. I hope this one helps me!
Depression	jporter, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	5/29/2009 11:37:25 AM	Effexor XR worked great for my depression and anxiety but I need to come off it (it's too expensive) and the withdrawal is horrible. I have been off it for a week and I am constantly dizzy (even feel dizzy in my dreams) and often nauseous.  I am also really irritable and am trying to avoid my co-workers so I don't bite anyone's head off for no reason. When I'm not irritable I feel weepy and lately anxious and paranoid.  I have already started taking Wellbutrin and I think it is helping.  It is very frustrating that none of the literature talks about length of withdrawal symptoms.  I know it's different for everyone but surely someone has measured this in a test group and can publish the results from that group.  I haven't even been able to find a comment anywhere from someone saying they managed to get off it and are now finally feeling better.  Very disheartening.  Published tests of new drugs should include discontinuation symptoms and observed length of those symptoms. There is no good reason to exclude that data.    
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	5/29/2009 11:36:04 AM	I suffered from anxiety attacks and  depression for many years before accepting the fact that needed help controlling my emotions and (suicidal) thoughts.  It helps me get through the day and helps me sleep better at night.  I began taking Effexor 6 years ago, starting with the lowest dosage, currently I take the highest dosage.  It must be taken daily for it to be effective, and be warned, do NOT stop taking it cold turkey.  Missing a pill causes vertigo (dizziness), nausea and fatigue.  The drug does not mix well with alcohol.  If you do drink, be advised, you will 'hit the wall' rather quickly, and likely sprial into a depression episode.  If taken correctly it is a miracle drug and I plan on taking it the rest of my life. It may not be for everyone, but it probably saved my life.  
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/28/2009 9:11:03 PM	Went on this Med. in Dec.2008 and I have to say this medication worked for me. No side- effects that I notice. I am in no rush to get off. Anxiety does not happen over night, so it takes time and the medication will only do so much-the rest is up to you. you.

After going through a series of therapies for major depression, it was discovered that I had a major case of ADHD with anxiety and panic cohorts (at the age of 48!).  This diagnosis explained everything that was me.  I was referred to a PA (believe it or not!) who worked with Psych MD's and started me on Effexor.  It was almost an instant relief of my anxiety.  After two months, I was at 150mg per day.  Now, to get off ritalin without driving everyone mad.  Without ritalin, I am now on 300 mg per day, with 300 mg of Wellbutrin to boot!  Yes, I'm an extreme case, but it's disconcerting that most of the reviews are negative.First, I was on several drugs for a while that didn't really work.  I agree that Effexor shouldn't be a first line of defense.  But if it works, why worry about the withdrawals?  I don't ever want to stop taking Effexor.  My wife and kids can approach me 24/7 even with bad news.  I have no stress except eustress.  I can keep my cool, ignore messy people, gossip, and know it alls!One other thing - why is Effexor not advertised (by the doctors) more for treatment of moderate to severe AD/HD?I have nothing but high praise for Effexor.  It saved my marriage, my family, my work, among other things.

I was on Celexa for a few years before, and when I started menopause the Celexa didn't work as well.  My Dr. changed me to Effexor XR and I feel so much better.  I promptly packed on 15 pounds, but it is well worth it.

I would not say my depression has lifted 100%, which is a rare case, but probably about 80%, which gets me through most days. It was prescribed about 5-6 yrs ago by my PCP, when I saw him for the first time. I had been on Lexapro, Celexa and Paxil previously, (not at the same time), but with each of those meds, after taking them for about 6 months to a year, I began to have very very vivid dreams, not exactly nightmares, but vivid enough to really disturb my sleep and not allow me to function well the next day. This HAS NOT happened with EFFEXOR XR 150mg, even after all this time. Also, about 2 yrs ago I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia,and we tried taking me off Effexor a few months ago and going on Cymbalta, to kill two birds with 1 stone, so to speak, but I had a horrible reaction to the Cymbalta (the Fibro actually got much worse) and I went back to Effexor. This seems to be the best antidepressant for me with the fewest side effects, maybe dry mouth, and some sleepiness, nothing major. Unless I miss a dose. DO NOT MISS A DOSE! If you wish to reduce your dosage or get off the drug altogether, do not do so without a dr's advise, otherwise you will feel like a truck hit you.My conclusion, for me: it works, and I will continue to use it.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	5/21/2009 12:13:52 AM	Ok, basically when I was 14 my mom moved to Germany, and I was left to take care of my dad.  I started this medication after being severely depressed.  It was a great drug while I was on it.  I didnt cry all the time, or anything like that.  In fact, I was quite numb to everything around me.  But after 3 years or so of being on it, I was going to lose my insurance, and Effexor is way too expensive, so I decided to get off of it.  And let me tell you, that was the worst decision I have ever made.  The withdrawal effects were so severe.  I ended up checking into a psychiatric ward.  I had brain zaps, nausea, constant crying.  In fact, it is a year after I stopped taking this medication, and I still have severe nausea.  This medication was good while I was on it.  So basically, if you are prescribed this medication, plan on being on it for the rest of your life.I would not recommend this to anyone..

Now i am crying all the time for no reason,even when i first get up in the am !I don't know what I'm going to do now.I don't think all this is worth it just for helping hot flashes !

I'm being treated for PTSD related to 6 of my friends being killed in Iraq, including the man that I loved. I have been on Zoloft for a year and we kept upping the dosage, but there was still no releif from the depression and night terrors. I was VERY sleepy the first few days, but that has started to get better. I am more motivated to take care of myself and my home now. I do have some tingling in my fingers, though.

It worked almost immediately for about 1 year and then the hot flashes came back but not as severe.  My doctor wanted to increase my dose but I opted not to.  Thank goodness I made this decision.  I have been trying to wean myself off this drug for 2 months very gradually.  Every change came with symptoms.  I am now down to 37.5; on one day; off two.  Everytime I try to go to off 3 days I feel like I have the flu and worse is the fact that my brain is disfunctional.  I am dizzy, confused and cannot concentrate.  This in addition to nausea and fatigue.  I want off this drug so badly because it eventually made me feel &quot;nothing&quot;.  I went to a funeral of a very good friend and felt nothing.  I have not cried in over a year even though I want too.  I am miserable and I am going to try just not taking it again.  It should be offered in a lower dose for weaning off purposes.  If I knew that I would have to go through this, I would have put up with the hot flashes instead!  These symptoms are so severe, I don't feel like I should drive or work.  I am also irritable and my family is finding me difficult to live with.  The doctor who prescribed to me is a GYN and I don't think she had knowledge of these horrific side effects either.  How long will it take before I feel better?

I started off at 75 mg once a day, mostly for seasonal affective disorder and anxiety.  During my divorce, my doctor increased me to 150 mg a day.  It has helped.  However there are times when I don't feel like I have any emotions.  And if I am even a few hours late taking my medication, the withdraw sypmtoms are terrible.  However, I am glad that I am taking it, and feel like it saved my life after going through a nasty divorce and the death of my best friend.

I wanted to get off of it about eight months ago but my doctor increased it from 150mg to 300mg per day. I now have a new doctor and he is helping me to decrease and get off of it. I also take ativan and restroil . I'm in my first wk of taping off. So far I have not had too many problems

Depression	coachmom2, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	5/8/2009 12:06:17 PM	After trying other meds (wellbutrin, zoloft,celexa) without measurable success, my family doc put me on effexor xr. It's been almost 3 years. My depression and anxiety have actually increased so my psych wants to try something else. But the withdrawls are horrendous. My fam doc and accompanying info with the script did NOT talk about it; otherwise I would NEVER have taken it. And there's NOTHING to help with this nightmare but &quot;ride it out&quot;. And no one knows how long it will take; &quot;everyone is different&quot;. It's been 2 weeks, now I am homebound, can't drive, let alone take care of my kids. I cannot believe the FDA approved this drug!

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	5/7/2009 7:54:05 AM	I was on Effexor for Depression and Anxiety and suffering major side effects but did not realize it was the Effexor until I experienced excessive and embarrassing facial sweating and asked to come off it - knowing that my Dr would replace it with another drug if needed. I had headaches 5-7 times a week but thought that was just me - I've had headaches for years.  I was fatigued but thought I just had no will power to exercise, and improve my fitness.   I would only sleep about 5 hours a night, I had no energy.   I was slower in everything I did eg, speech, typing, decision making domestic chores.     During the Dr-scheduled withdrawal I had headaches, diarrhea, shakes and felt dreadful - I was sent home from work twice. AFTER withdrawing  the facial sweating and headaches STOPPED;  I had increased libido and upswings in moods.  My speed of speech, processing, decision making and implementation increased significantly (I work in an environment where constant statistics are taken throughout every shift.  I have gone from 'Performance Management&quot; - ie, your performance is below standard and your job is at risk - to beating targets in an incredibly short period of time - since withdrawing from the Effexor&#172;).The downside is that after a honeymoon period of about 10-12 days my anxiety increased so much that today I have been put on another medication  (Lexapro) to control it.  I'M HOPING my body will better tolerate it  however I will know better what to look for instead of assuming these problems are all personal attributes uninfluenced by medication side effects as everyone of them improved since coming off the Effexor.  SUMMARY:The Effexor definitely controlled depression and anxiety (though from time to time I still felt both) but the cost in side effects was VERY high and if the facial sweating had not started YEARS after taking the medication, indicating I was experiencing a side effect, I would still be taking Effexor &amp; suffering all of the side effects, whic

I tried multiple depression medications and until last october had been very unsuccessful!!! I got a new Dr. and he decided that I wasnt depressed, I had an anxiety disorder. He then started me on Effexor XR 75 for 14 days then Effexor XR 150 until now. I dont see myself getting off of it anytime soon. I'm very happy with the outcome. I dont make my self sick stressing over day to day occurences. I def give this medicine two thumbs up...I now have complete control of my life thanks to this medication!!!!

Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	5/3/2009 5:23:31 PM	I had a severe bout of depression after several traumatic events all at once. I also suffer from GAD. I started on Lexipro (nothing), Wellbutrin (bad experience), then Effexor which worked well. I started at 75mg and eventually increased to 150mg. Things are going well in my life now and I have learned a lot about coping (with God's help), so I have decided to get off Effexor after 4 years. I have reduced to 75mg with some of the side effects described. I am waiting on the next step from my doctor.

I've tried Paxil and Wellbutrin in the past without any benefit. I noticed a difference within the first few days of taking Effexor XR. No side effects...but I'm dreading the day that I have to get off this medication due to all the horror stories I've read. I don't plan on getting off it anytime soon!
Depression	??, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/3/2009 12:27:51 AM	Effexor XR has been the only consistent drug, when used in combination with others, to effectively control chronic depression. The side effects are dry mouth, an abundance of mental energy and feeling quite comfortable, not wanting to venture out of the house or do errands. It doesn't interfere with sexual activity (as it does for some). I can, but prefer not to drive for @ 2 hours after dosing. I am convinced that I have been in 2 minor fender benders due to rapid thinking and acting. Generally I am so glad not to be in a fetal position or wanting to sleep the entire day, that the side affects are &quot;doable&quot;

Depression	 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	4	3	4			5/2/2009 6:03:47 PM	I have been on 450mg for over a year when the medication stopped working. Up until then it was the only med that worked for my major depression. I tried many; Zoloft, Welbutrin, Paxil, Seroquel, Lithium, amoung others. I'm currently taking Limictil and tapering off Effexor 75mg at a time. So far I'm tired, but that's not uncommon for me. I'm getting sinus headaches. It's my time for allergies. My pattern is fall apart on Saturdays. Headache, sleep, fatigue. I've put up with so much from my depression and gone on with my life as best I can. If I have to sleep all day on Saturday, oh well. I plan to not do anything on Saturdays. I've stopped expecting miracles from medication. They help but I'll always deal with this disease.
Other	here2help, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	5/2/2009 12:31:26 AM	Hello like many others that have taken this drug I HATE it!!!! I began effexor to treat migraines. I suffered from many of the common side effects moodiness, constipation, inability to become sexually aroused, dehydration, and weight gain. The worst part about the drug is that it is next to impossible to get off of. But I DID IT!!! You need to start by weening yourself down to the lowest dose (37.5mg). Once there take the capsule pills only. Open the capsule and each day take out 5 of the small round balls. If you feel so sick from the removal stay at that level until you feel ok. Example remove 10 for three days instead of moving on to 15 if you are feeling sick. Keep doing this until you get down to 0. It took over three months but I am finally off this dreaded medication after 3 years. It is not easy but just after a month of not being on it i feel amazing and my sex life has already changed and i am having more frequent bowel movements. This is the ONLY way to get off it. Trust me i have tried cold turkey and the skipping tablets it does NOT work. Good luck and please get off of this medication and on to something else ASAP. I hope this helps :)
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/1/2009 6:27:48 PM	I have been on and off effexor xr for 10 years, works well. I have also taken the new Pristiq, it helps but less for GAD.(even though they are basically the same thing-and metabolize differently. The best way to get off the effexor xr is reduce your dose to 37.5 and take 5mg or 10mg prozac. After 1 week discontinue the effexor and continue to take the prozac for 3 to 4 weeks. This should help minimize the withdrawls, everyone is different so you can tweek it to your needs. I have done this many times... anyway this is food for thought for people that are having problems getting off of it!!I hope it helps!

Panic Disorder	Brain Zap Victim, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	4/30/2009 8:21:00 PM	This drug was very helpful with my depression, anxiety and panic attacks.  However, after 4 years of using this medication, I am now trying to come off of it and experiencing withdrawal symptoms that are beyond anything I would have imagined.  The &quot;brain zaps&quot; are the worst.  I will accept the fever, muscle pain, restless legs (which include muscle spasms), fatigue, nightmares, vertigo, crying spells and irrational outbursts - but - something that is truly best described as brain zaps - no, that I will not accept.  It is absolutely terrible that this drug is allowed on the market.  There has to be something else out there to treat depression, axiety and panic disorder that does not require such severe withdrawal symptoms.  I feel like a heroin addict or something... ridiculous!  It has been 6 days so far and everything that I have read says that I am no where near out of the woods.  I just pray that this feeling in my brain - that really feels like my brain has been pressed against an electric fence - will subside.  I have now missed days at work due to these symptoms.  I really hope that people consider the withdrawals before taking their doctors word at this drug.  There HAS to be something else.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	4/29/2009 10:35:38 PM	I was on Effexor 225mg for a coupl years, and I had a great experience. After trying a couple other medications to treat my depression and slight anxiety, Effexor worked wonders. However, I have since been weaned off of it in the past few months (trying to get pregnant), and I have found that, while my depression has lessened, my anxiety and irritablity has gown through the roof. It is far worse than it was before I was put on the effoexor in the first place. I am now taking Buspar for my anxiety because it may be a little safer for pregnancy, but I am still incredibly high strung. I plan to get back on it after my pregnancy. While I would recommend Effexor to others who suffer from depression, just beware of potential side effects if you ever have to taper off of the medication.

I find my anxiety worse now than it was before I was on this medication.  I am going back to the doctor to see what I can do about my anxiety but I would much rather be on 2 medications than none and feel the way I did for so many years! I have energy and am able to re-evaluate situations without feeling like the world is going to end!!

I was very hesitant to start taking this medication due to a bad episode with Lexapro about 5 years ago. I'm on 75 mg and getting used to this drug was no picnic. Although the side effects were rough, I had to admit that there were periods of &quot;calm&quot; that made me think if this is how I was going to feel when I was used to the medication, then this IS worth it.I've been on the medication for about 4 months now and it's been pretty good so far. I no longer have panic attacks and surprisingly rarely get nervous before giving presentations at work (something I could barely do before). One of the only things that I don't like is that I seem a bit &quot;numb&quot; and have become more forgetful. I sometimes have a hard time concentrating, too. I've read about the symptoms of withdrawal, which alone would make me stay on this drug...especially if it was like the side effects I had when I started it. My family says that I seem more happy and less anxious. I've had no problems facing situations that used to make me feel uncomfortable, which is a huge plus. I'm able to go to the theater, be in large crowds, and my &quot;nervous stomach&quot; seems to have disappeared! My next test is a plane trip we're taking late in May. If I can get through that trip without incident, then I feel almost &quot;cured.&quot; Overall, I'm glad I gave it a chance and wish I would have done this years ago.

Like i said it did a good job helping with the anxiety but BE AWARE of the serious side effects when stopping. All the i have listed that i have experienced are listed right in the official effexor xr website. I wish i would have know this stuff prior to because i would have seriously concidered not taking it. So i have been having &quot;withdrawals&quot; for 3 days now and they havent given at all. I hope this doesnt last much longer!

Weight loss and significant weight loss are side effects. If you are gaining weight my guess is you already were overweight and/or you are on a different mediciation that doesn't mix well. Unless they have fixed ingredients since everyone has used it. I had severe mood swings and anxiety before.

I was to go 2 weeks lower does of effexor and then 4 days later add the celexa. Well rollercoaster ride I was on the first three days of lowering the dose to 75mg I was wired with energy you wouldnt believe then slowly felt better with the celexa it took a little bit for me to get used to the medication switch and so forth. Well now its been two weeks off of the effexor and its a very hard drug to get off so just be careful. I have felt very dizzy, lightheadedness at times throughout the day. It feels as though you have had nothing to eat and your sugar is dropping even if you have eaten already. That shakey tingly feeling. You will have it in spurts for a few days, you might get panic attacks if you have had trouble with them in the past. They dont last long but they last for only about 10 minutes or so. I hope this was helpful for any of you getting off of it.

When i first Started this medication it work great there were no problems. Then about three months something was not right and I went to my doctor and i was given something else. THen three years later we tried it again because I was on different mood swings meds and it worked for three months and stop. So if you are on the medication and you seem more depressed it could be this medicine.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	4/17/2009 2:48:40 AM	I was 17 when I went on this, there wasn't even a generic out there yet, and while it managed to lessen the depression to where I could manage through the day, it didn't really make me feel all that better.  I was on the highest legal dosage at the time (I don't know if it's changed since then) and would get horrid nightmares if I forgot to take it, and it made me sleepy all the time.  Since going off, I can't remember a lot of what happened that year I was on it, and I developed intense sensitivity in my two front teeth, particularly troublesome as a clarinetist.  I discovered after a visit to an endodontist that they sometimes use this to block nerves to the teeth.  Had I been aware of this possible side effect, I never would have taken it.  My career as a clarinetist ended at 19 because the drug was too new and doctors didn't know it could do this to me.  I never wanted to go on anti-depressants in the first place, and I'm not happy I was on this.

Depression	BVM, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	4/16/2009 2:25:20 PM	I have been on Effexor XR 75 mg for 7 years after an deep depressive episode resulting from major life changes &amp; aging, as well as hereditary.  They started me on Paxil, but it was way too intense.   Effexor has worked well for me, a side benefit has been that it has reduced my anxiety tremondously which is also enherited.  The side effects have been some tinnitus (ringing in ears), undoubteldy due to elevated blood pressure, but not extreme.  Also lower libido but at my age I don't care.   I have not experienced signficant weight gain.  It is livable.  This drug as allowed me to function in a high stress workplace effectively.   I have no doubt I could not do this job without it, plus I am not stressed about homelife either.  A lifesaver.   I don't know if I could or should ever go off it knowing my hereditary traits, and reading about the withdrawal symptoms. No one seems to know if there are long term side effects, but at least I can live normally for now.
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	sudharris, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	65-74	4/16/2009 1:40:28 PM	I am a VA patient and have been hospitalized four times for depression associated with PTSD. I've been on so many antidepressants that I can't recall all the names. My first drug was Elivil; the night I took it was the first night I had slept 8 hours in years. For one reason or another, I tried and stopped using many other drugs. I was suicidal and homocidal on Prozac after 3 months of &quot;heaven,&quot; had horrible shakes and anxiety on Zoloft, no effect with Paxil and others. Finally, was put on Effexor and it worked to keep me alive. My rages began escalating about two years ago and my psychiatrist added buspirone. I am now &quot;in control&quot; but like others here, I gained 40 pounds, have no sex drive, sweat heavily (especially from the head), don't have much energy, have problems with memory, and my body lets me know when I forget to take my pills (dizzy, unbalanced). I may have severe withdrawals if I quit the drug, but I think I'll probably be on them for the rest of my life, so I'm not going to worry about.  In the long run, I would much rather have the side effects than feel like I'm in Hell day in and day out; have nightmares; wish (pray)for death; live alone because I can't get along with anyone; be a threat to anyone who tips my rage scale over the edge. It was a long road and many years (1995 from diagnosis to 2004) before my phyciatrists and I found the right antidepressant and the right dosage. Don't give up trying!
Panic Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	4/15/2009 2:23:06 PM	i've been on this medication for several years but last year I tried to go off it to see if I could be normal again but.. no chance I had the worst panic attach ever. I wish that my doctor had told me before I tried to go off it that it wouldn't be worth it.  Now if I forget to take my pill for the day I have terrible nightmares and night sweats but can't wake up from it.  Why would this happen from just missing one dose?  Does anyone know?  It never happened in the past before I tried going off it. I'm afraid to switch medication because I atleast know that this one works.

Then a few years after, I developed Breast Cancer and the doctor's kept me on it.  I am in complete remission from the cancer and but the drug is not helping now with any night sweats or hot flashes and I have gained 50 pounds.  I have decided to go off of it but the stories here are making me feel depressed and anxious. I have forgotten to take it on some days and have those &quot;zap&quot; flashes and extremely uncomfortable feelings of confusion, slurred speech, and a very short hot temper.  This is scaring me to death thinking about coming off of this stuff for good.  I panic if I forget to take it and I have taken an extra pill a time or two just in case I really did miss one just to starve off the weird side effects.  I know my doctor will wean me down but the thought of actually opening the pill to count the &quot;beads&quot; is unreal.  Will I really feel like a junkie in withdrawal?  HELP!!!!!!  
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	4/13/2009 2:56:39 PM	The drug worked for my depression and anxiety, but getting of it was not worth it. The withdrawal period was the worst time in my entire life. The best way to get off it, if you are looking, is to reduce the dose VERY SLOWLY. Talk to your doctor, and come up with a plan to reduce dosage. I have read on other sites that people just stopped after 75mg, but that is what I was on initially. I had to cut it in half every week over the course of several weeks. I would advise taking a different drug as this is seriously not worth the pain of getting off it.

I would not particularly recomment it as it has rasied my herat beat and blood pressure. The most serious side effect is self harming and feeling suicidal. I am an intelligent person and feel like I cannot understand what has happened to me....coming off is just horrendous...
Depression	readme, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	45-54	4/11/2009 11:37:23 PM	I have been on this med for about 5 years topping at 375mg a day. It worked well once I was regulated.After a year or so I tapered off I wanted to get off them eventually.I took 150mg for a long time.I tried getting off several times and trust me you never want to just stop which I did a few times because I ran out an just figured I would go off them,dont do that. Anyway I am still trying to get off them. I have been on about 17.5 mg for 8 months now. For about 5 months I have been only taking the 1/4 tablet every few days, just when I start getting the withdrawl symptoms. The symptoms are awful. I have tried and waited about 24-30 hours after symptoms start to see if they might go away but in that amount of time they never have and I end up taken the med. I had been told when I started them that I would just tapper off over a few weeks. Wow,years later. When I had told my Doctor about all the anxiety and other withdrawl symptoms he said I was just going to have to stay on them.....forever.that was not ok with me. Anyway just know I think I have read a few blogs from people at another site that had no problems getting off. Most were like me though so if you are reading up on theis drug before you take it you have been warned it is not fun at all getting off this.If you think how bad could it be, well if you think you are depressed now plus worse things and feelings. good luck

I have always complained to my dr. about the sweating and tiredness, some days I don't have the energy to even take a shower. Maybe it's because I don't want to start sweating (depressed w/meds)

I started at 37.5 and I am now at 150mg.  I reduced it to 75mg for about 2 weeks, but I could see my reactions to the lower dosage and returned to 150mg. Life it much easier to cope with.

Depression	Nancye, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	55-64	4/10/2009 5:29:10 PM	The reason I am not satisfied with this medication is the HOT spells that it gives me.  With any movement, I start sweating , am so hot I feel like I have hyperthermia. However to touch me, I just feel clamy and sweaty.  This situation is becoming unbearable and it is like that with every anti-depressant I have tried in this group does the same thing.  I am also on doxepin and remeron, they do not cause this.  I quit taking Effexor for 3 months and the hot spells completely stopped.  But then I was crying all the time and the depression had really set in.  I saw no purpose for anything.  I obviously was born with clinical depression.  The doxepin 50 mg. and the remeron 30 mg. did not seem to help, except with sleep. So, I started back on the Effexor 150mg. and in a few weeks all was fine, except the hot spells.  I am not getting enough exersize because of this and I am a very active person, or was. Please help, no one seems to know what is in the drugs that causes this.  I have tried, I suppose all of the new generation drugs and have this response to all, yet the others don't work. HELP
Depression	myfriend bela, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/9/2009 11:42:58 PM	I took Effexor for post-partum depression. I realized about a year after my delivery that I had PPD when i found myself crying in my son's closet with the door shut. Effexor worked pretty fast and allowed me to go back to being a new mommy. It also saved my marriage.  I had no side effects. I went off Effexor after a time and then tried it again years later for anxiety but did not respond to it.

It does help with depression and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are awful - drink lots of water. My biggest complaint is weight gain and food cravings - I seem to binge on this pill - I am thinking about looking for a new drug _ I need to lose weight as I am feeling very sluggish and unattractive - otherwise recommend it for depression and anxiety - nasty side effects when you start to feel &quot;well&quot;

My Dr. and I decided to get me off it and switch to Wellbutrin. He gave me a step down program to decrease gradually. It did NOT work. I had SEVERE problems, tingly all over my body, my head felt like I was having an out of body experience,nausea, exhausted, could not function, body aches. The worse was that horrible tingly feeling from head to toe! It took me a total of 10 months to successfully get off this nasty drug. I would NOT recommend this to anyone!
Depression	add1540, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	4	5	3	Female	55-64	4/3/2009 3:24:15 PM	I was prescribed this med in Jan 1998 for extreme depression.  After a month with no change, the Dr increased it to the maximum manufacturer's dosage (I was 95 lbs).  The depression lifted like magic and I felt alive again. The Dr insisted I remain on this med at this high dose and after 2 1/2 yrs my weight gain of 50 lbs...!!! became a depression in itself, had drawers and a closet full of clothes I couldn't fit into anymore. I was horrified. This med made me CRAVE food and especially sweets..and I'm not by nature a sweet eater.  I changed Drs in July 2000 and he was surprised at the large dose I was on, took me off of it completely.  My experience was that it worked, it had several side effects as they all do, but the huge dose for the extended time was detrimental in the long run.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/2/2009 9:32:35 PM	I have been on 37.5 for 3 months for anxiety no depression. At first there were some side effects like headache, hot flashes, and a couple of extreme panic attacks.  Those went away within the 1st week.  Now I have vivid nightmares but still sleep well.  I feel great overall.  I am a full time working mom of 3 and working on my master's degree.  I feel great. No more panic attacks. No more aches and pains or worries.  I am worried about coming off the meds when the time is right, but feel great. This is my first time taking any meds for this.  The most of anything I've taken is an antibiotic. It's great. I keep in contact with my doc with check ups, and the current lowest dose works for me.  It was difficult for me to admit I was having anxiety and panic attacks. good luck to all
Depression	mistala, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	4/2/2009 6:58:18 PM	At first WebMD REALLY freaked me out; reading all of the &quot;avoid this medicine&quot; reviews from users.  There were many stories from people that scared me.  I told my Dr. about them and of course he said, &quot;yeah, there are many skeptics out there ESPECIALLY on the web.&quot;  Well, he was right.The drug has been very effective.  I gradually built up to 150mg.  In the past I've taken lexapro (effective also, but gained weight) and wellbutrin (totally ineffective, lost weight).  This drug is a very happy medium. It's effective and I haven't gained weight.  I'm extremely satisfied with the results.  I feel a lot more stable, my anxiety has gone WAY WAY down, and overall I am really back to being myself. I started feeling the effects of it about 3 weeks into taking it.  My purpose of writing is really to say - everyone has their own experience with these drugs.  You may need to try a few.  The most important thing is to, when coming off, speak with your doctor and do it slowly - you should have a problem, really.

I would like to stop taking this medication because of the cost and not having insurance,  it is too expenisive for me.  I have read horror stories after horror storys about the withdrawl systems and I am scared to go off it now.  I wish my doctor would have warned me of this effect before putting me on this drug.  Also the mfg of this drug in my opion charges way to much for this drug.  
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	25-34	4/1/2009 5:32:30 AM	Was put on Effexor XR for anxiety gradually increased up to 150 mg 1x/day and have been on it for approx 3.5 years, after my life has calmed down I decided to get off.  My Dr took me off SLOWLY changing the dose every two weeks (2wks at 150/75 alt days, 2 wks at 75/day, 2 wks at 75/37.5 alt days, 2wks at 37.5/day, 2 wks at 37.5/nothing alt days, then off) I have now been Effexor freevfor one full week and I am still suffering from withdrawl symptoms that seem to be getting worse by the day.  I didn't have a problem with the withdrawl symptoms while transitioning until now.  I'm dizzy, my brain feels like its swimming, and my sleep schedule just depends on the day  (sometimes I can sleep sometimes I can't).  Being a nurse I realize that taking medication that alter mood and all that will have withdrawl symptoms but I NEVER realized that anything could be this bad.  The medication worked and served its purpose (without side effects) while taking it but I suggest talking to your doctor about what happens down the road when you try to get off.  Unfortunatley you never know how your body will react until that time comes but maybe there are other medications out there that are easier to transition off of without feeling like a zombie!  Hope this helps!

I have been on effexor xr for almost a year now. At first I had really bad side effects, I was tired, I could not stop yawning, and within 2 months I lost 20 pounds. I found that forcing myself to eat with the med made the side effects go away. Now that my body is used to the med it works great. I used to get anxiety attacks every day, now I don't get them anymore. I hope to get off of it soon so that I can resume life without being on medication!

Other	dor411, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	3/29/2009 6:27:15 AM	I was going through a very stressful period in my life and the doc felt very strongly that I should go on effexor xr(75mg) for a while.It really helped.The problem is,I have been trying to get off of this drug for 2 months now.I can't believe the withdrawal symptoms-headache,racing heartbeat,tingling tongue,nausea and lightheaded.I really think doctors should tell you ALL information about the DRUGS they are giving you.These reviews have been really helpful in ideas on how to stop.It is time for me to open up the capsules(I'm already on the lowest dosage-37.5mg)hopefully this will work.

Unfortunally I let my prescription run out and did not have for 3 days and by the second day it felt like electic pingpong ball was zapping around in my head. I DON''T run out anymore. My friend had her doctor ween her off her this drug.

I had high anxiety and panic attacks. Now I can go out enjoy life, friends and go shopping by myself! I have not experienced any side effects. It has helped me greatly.

Took this for a year, no real relief, tried to stop taking twice and the withdrawals were so bad I had to return to taking it. Most docs are unaware of the severe withdrawals. DO NOT try to stop cold turkey! Even forgetting a dose will start the brain &quot;zaps/shivers&quot; because of the short half-life of this med, and they are horrible! To get off of these with mild withdrawls, I had to break open the capsuls and SLOWLY start to decrease the amount inside. I took away about 1/4 and took 3/4 of the beads for a week or two, then brought it down to a half, then down to 1/2 of a 1/2, then to just however many would stick to a couple finger tips full, took about 6 weeks to wean myself off. It was awful. You couldn't pay me enough to take this drug EVER again!

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Chris84, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	3/26/2009 4:09:03 PM	  For the past few weeks I was suffering from anxiety and depression that came out of nowhere. I was having unwanted thoughts and fears that I knew didn't make any sense. I was so anxious to the point where I could no longer take it. So I decided to seek advice from a PA and he prescribed me Effexor XR 35mg. At first I did other things to try to avoid medication, such as herbal supplements, but those didnt last all day. One day I was so sad that I decided to go ahead and take the medication. What do I have to lose... This is only my faith day and I really do notice a difference. I no longer feel depressed or worried about things that don't make sense and I finally feel like myself again. I am very hopeful that I am going to feel even better after a few weeks when the medication really gets in my system. I am thankful to god! This gave me hope! And peace of mind! Good Luck and hold on you all can do!

But, I kept having panic attacks, so my dr upped my dosage to 225mg per day.  I've been taking that for almost a month, and OMG, I feel like a zombie...I'm constantly tired...never in a good mood...feel like my head is in a fog, can't focus or concentrate..it's horrible.  Then, I read all these stories of withdrawal ?? This is scaring me...I'm going to my dr today and see what she can do...I can't live like this...feeling sick everyday, and SOOOO tired. I'm usually a very energetic person, and this is the pits.

My main side effect was what I called &quot;brain shivers,&quot; like little shockwaves or bursts of static felt throughout the body.  I later found out this was not uncommon.  I found that the use of a dry sauna and increased water intake helped enormously!!
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	3/26/2009 2:26:31 AM	Been on Effexor for over 15 years.  Would be dead without it.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	3/26/2009 1:48:03 AM	Hi I'm a 24 years old,At first I felt like this was a good start for me. Being on Effexor for over a year my dosage was up to 75mg 3 times a day.  I was yawning all the time and felt tired and dizzy. When I go to sleep I sleep for 9 hrs.  I could never figure out why I was always feeling tired so I decided to start weening myself off the medication for 4 weeks I have been down to 1 pill, side effects I'm not as tired and not yawning, not feeling dizzy but I do have a headache.  Another thing is sex, Usually not in the mood, I feel like I'm always dry. Kinda hard to have an orgasm. Hope this helps.

I came to a stalemate with it about a month ago. My doctor increased my dosage an added  Abilify. I'm so pleased with the way I have turned the corner with my condition. Effexor has changed my outlook on life and myself. I have few side effects and none worth me stopping my treatment.

You must do under the care of a doctor,side effects so risky.. will only be on lower dose for about 4 more days,then try a different medication..I have tried so MANY anti depressants over the past 6 years.Remembering that one must work with the drug,via do your part daily also.. This drug did help me during the loss of my mother to cancer.Yes,I would recommend to others..But as I said,the weening effects are terrible.. best of luck to all that deal with some form of chemical imbalance.May our society be more nurturing to the illness that one can not see outside of the body. I also am a cancer survivor of almost 6 years.Take one day at a time,one step at a time..Life is good!

I have been taking this for about a month now and have increased to 75 mg. I have not had any bad side effects, however my anxiety has become..for the lack of a better word..sharper. I can not go to sleep on my own and have trouble focusing. Also very rapid speech and feeling very speedy all day. Talked to doctor and he recommended going up a dose which iam not willing to do. Iam going to wean myself of this. At first it worked great then symptoms got worse. Be Very careful before deciding to  taking this!
Other	John, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	19-24	3/23/2009 12:42:33 AM	I was diagnosed with OCD and put on Effexor. At first it worked ok but then later I began to gain weight and I was ALWAYS sleepy. The worst part came when I got off the medication. I did not taper off as slow as I should have, but,nevertheless, the withdrawl effects were horrible. The main withdrawl effect I had was anger. I became angry at everyone and evrything. My anger even ruined my relationship with my girlfriend. A few months after getting off it, I soon went into a deep depression and am now back on it.
Depression	karenkms320, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	3/22/2009 8:03:51 PM	Effexor XR combined with Prozac, another anti-depressant worked great for my depression, but the thing that worked best for my was keeping busy and getting involved in a project out of the home.  Productivity increases your confidence immensely.  Also good doctors that know the newest drugs on the market that are found to allieve depression.  My doctor discovered that Lamictal, a anti-seizxure medicine, helped sustain a better mood in patients.  A combination of the right medicines will help alleviate depression, but you must first help yourself and want to get well in order to defeat depression.

Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	55-64	3/22/2009 4:17:08 PM	I have been on this Effexor for a number of years--at one time at 375 mg. XR.  I have been trying to get off of it but can't break the barrier of 75 mg. plain.  Missing one day is the pits.  I can barely function that evening.  I have to take myevening dose and go to sleep.I would NEVER, NEVER, NEVER recommend this med to anyone. This med is a wolf in sheep's clothing, as far as I'm concerned.Is there a rehab center that would accept someone with this problem?I reported my problems to the FDA, but can't get hold of Wyeth to voice them there.My Medicare drug co. raised the copay for this drug, too-- now that I'm dependent upon it.My doc said I'll be on this all my life.  That's pretty &quot;depressing&quot; in itself.

I will never take it again now that I know what it must have been doing to my brain.  I took Effexor XR for several years. It seemed to suddenly 'stop working' so I needed to withdraw slowly, however, even taking it slow, it was terrible!  I would not recommend this drug to anyone unless they cannot find another medicate that works for them.

It has changed my life.  After the birth of my third child I developed PPD and really bad anxiety.  Since taking the meds I feel happier and have not been anxious at all.  I was nervous to begin the meds for fear of side effects, but have experienced none, other than some grogginess during the first week.  I actually forgot to take it yesterday for the first time, and am only now realizing that is why i felt slightly nauseous yesterday afternoon, I was in the car and thought i was car sick.

Then I developed panic disorder, so my doctor put me back on. I have had to wean myself off because I'm pregnant, and it the first time I tried it made me feel like I was going to die. I had to take full doses again (75mg) and empty the contents of the gelcaps into a bowl and count down a &quot;bead&quot; each day to very slowly ease myself off. I'm almost done, and have had no withdrawal, but I will not go back on after I give birth. It doesn't work for my panic attacks, anyway. It does work for depression, though.

I was put on this my first year of college and it really messed up my grades and attendance. After taking Effexor for a full month I lost sex drive and my ability to orgasm and when I missed a dose I would feel sick and would be in the worst mood. 2 weeks after stopping treatment I became a zombie. I am now a low does of fluoxetine and I am 110% better!!

Decided to get off the medication because I could no longer take the side effects when I missed a dose. Even though the doctor brought me down slow the withdrawals were still not good. It has now been 2 1/2 weeks since I have been off, things are better but I am still having the withdrawal symptoms. Even though this medication can help; make sure that the pros out way the cons, other wise try to find something else that gives the same relief.

I recommend doctors to go straight to this medication.  I also recommend getting th patient off sleep-aids if they are on them, asap! The reason is sandoz-buproprion or trazadone or panaxil etc. tends to be the culprit for the bad side-effects.  The patient needs to sleep, but might feel miserable and totally ineffective on them. As soon as they can sleep four hours or more regularly on their own, they need to get off the sleep-aids so they can see the effects of Effexor -XR working faster.  I have taken up to 262.5mg for over a year. There is not any problem with a higher suggested does as long as the patient is monitored every week in the increase phases. Even two times a week if they are a high risk patient.  Effexor is freedom that I haven't felt in years and I would not be here without it.  If you need it, take it!  If you had a malignant tumor, remove it! Same thing. Get proactive, take care of your depression, and get on with a normal happy life! Good Luck to you in your journey.

Depression	swker, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	3/15/2009 9:31:44 PM	Had been taking this medication for six years and asked MD for increase in dosage.  Felt better with increase but blood pressure increased also.  Withdrawl was very difficult - suicidal thoughts, mood swings, dizziness, sleeplessness throughout the month it took to wean from medicine.  No one should go on this, because eventually they will experience side effect and withdrawl is very bad.

It works well while you are on it, but if you miss a dose it is aweful!  I have been on this medicine for six years and I don't recommend it to anyone that can find another drug that works.  As soon as I miss a dose I get light headed and feel like I am going to pass out.  Then I develop flu-like symptoms.  I get body aches, fever, chills, and cannot move.  It is absolutely horrible. I have spoken with a few people about it and I might have to go to an actual detox facility if I want to get off of it all together. I have had issues with my insurance not wanting to cover this medicine and it has been a hassle since I started taking it.  If it didn't treat my depression at the same time I would not take it.  Definitely be causious is your doctor recommends it or if you are thinking about taking it.

Worked really well now my Dr is now having me discontinue it as I don't need it anymore. I feel awful my brain feels fuzzy and can't get motivated to do anything. I'm glad my hot flashs and sweats are gone but dang coming off this stuff is rough. Don't take it if you don't have to. I have never had a problem with any other medications that I have taken over the years this is bad stuff.
Depression	Alive and Well, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/12/2009 8:39:12 AM	I've been on 300 mgs for 4-5 years plus 100mg of Wellbutrin (counters the effect of low labido and inability to acheive orgasm). At this higher dose it is also effective for treating anxiety and OCD. Once the initial side effects have been resolved, which I found to be quite tolerable, the drug works well. It is very important to take this drug as directed. Missing a dose has unpleasant side effects. Missing 2 or more doses causes extreme negative side effects that are physically and mentally noticable. The key here is follow your Dr's direction for taking this drug to the letter and never self reduce without his/her approval. The drug is highly effective when taken as directed.

It has dramaticly changed my life. I had extreme depression until I started taking this medication. Now my depression is managable and I am doing much better. The only draw back to this medication is severe withdrawal symptoms if I miss a dose.

Recently I was diagnosed with Bipolar depression because I had a pretty bad episode while on this medication.  It is not working so well now that I'm also being treated for Bipolar disorder.  I've also had really bad withdrawal symptoms if I missed a couple of days taking this med... 
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	3/11/2009 2:46:21 AM	After two days on the medicine I was having sever panic attacks and the doctor said to keep taking Effexor. I knew I didn't have panic attacks until I srarted taking the medicine. In a week I quit taking it but for more than three years I still had side effects. It really messed me up.

I also was unable to reach orgasm.  Thankfully, the side effects all went away after the first few months ans I now feel like I am capable of being a better mother and wife!  
Other	Scared, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/10/2009 4:52:26 PM	Started this med last May for Migraines I gained 40lbs.I don't sleep at night the nightmares are so bad.My migraines are out of control.I will see the Doc and get off this nightmare drug.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	3/10/2009 10:25:30 AM	I have been on this medication for just over a year and it seemed to treat my depression okay, however,  during that time I developed regular migraines and high blood pressure.  If I accidentally missed a dose, the side effects were awful!!  I am now in my third week of weening off of this medication and it has been a terrible experience.  Nausea, dizziness, incredible tiredness, massive emotional roller coaster, terrifying dreams, etc... there are days I feel so sick I can't get out of bed.  I am glad Effexor works for some but don't feel the physical side effects are worth it for me.  I would recommend EXTREME CAUTION to anyone considering this med as an option.  I stayed on a relatively low dose (75mg), as well and still had this many problems with it.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	4	Female	35-44	3/10/2009 10:02:09 AM	I took a small dose (75mg) of Effexor, but for only a month. I heard a lot of bad things about it, but decided to go ahead and try it. The beginning was hard because of the side effects, (couldn't sleep, felt sick to my stomach, jaw clinching) I started out at 37.5mg, but after about 7-10 days moved to 75mg. As soon as I started the 75mg dose, I lost complete desire for sex and could not have an orgasm. That was it for me. I then decided to ween myself off of it. Again, read many bad things about going off the drug. I fortunately didn't have too many problems. I decreased my dose to 37.5 mg for a week from the 75 and experienced a little clinching of the jaw and maybe a little light-headedness. I'm now 4 days off completely. The only thing I notice is I'm having trouble sleeping at night. I am sure this will wear off soon. The good thing, my sexual desire is back. So overall the dug may have been fine if it didn't have the sexual side effect, and the weening off was fine as well. I may not have had any problems because I was on a low dose and only on the drug for a month. It's worth a try if you are wondering if it'll work for you. But if it doesn't, then I recommend going off of it sooner than later. PS. I read to take Fish Oil supplements and Super B complex while weening off, which I did. Hope this helps....

After about six weeks I noticed a general calming in situtations that used to panic me. The change was subtle and my wife was the first to notice. The only down side was the loss of ability to have an orgasm. The &quot;rest&quot; still works fine.

I have constant feelings of being on the verge of a panic attack. My Dr. started me on Zoloft and that worsened my symptons. Now the Effexor XR I am on 150 mg and I haven't felt a change. Some days are better than others, but I think I require something stronger. I see some reviews say to give it a few months, but I really can't take this anymore. Any suggestions? kburns0822@tmo.blackberry.net

However after approx. 6 months of use I developed night sweats and strange dreams.  I am now 48 yrs. old and dont know if it's because I'm perimenipausal or if the 75 mg. is too strong for me.  I am now taking xanax .25 until I can decide if I want to use the 37.5 mg. or change to something else.

I am probably not as good as I could be but I haven't had a panic attack in those 6 years. I've grown up with panic attacks and anxiety and at 31 years old I can say it feels so good to not worry about having one. 
Panic Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/6/2009 9:59:43 AM	I have severe panic and aniexity.  To the point, I would think I was dying and drive myself to the hospital, only to be told it was panic/aniexity.  I am on 150 mg of Effexor XR, have been on it for 6 years and my quality of life has been the best it ever has been.  It is true, if you forget a day or two, the side effects can be disturbing, nausea, etc., but not having the attacks OUTWEIGHS the side effects.  I hope someday to get weened off the Effexor, but for now, I can lead a productive life without worrying about death, sickness, suicidal thoughts EVERYDAY of my waking moment.

This drug, if it's not taken at a specific time every day, can send you into a violent manic tailspin, and no matter how much you know what you're doing is crazy, you can't stop it. If you have a sleep disorder, and cannot be sure of the exact time you take your meds, this drug is a death wish. It nearly cost me a husband, and my son, because this drug didn't help with my depression, and trying to come off of 300mg is a long process, and a dangerous one. I was suicidal, more so than ever, on this drug, and when I spoke to other members of my family, and friends, that took effexor xr, no one had anything good to say, whether they took 37.5 mg, or 300mg. Coming off XR, I had to lock myself in my bedroom, and pray that I wouldn't flip out because I was seriously scared of myself, and couldn't control my mood swings. This drug has done more harm than good in everyone that I've talked to.  DANGEROUS
Other	dreamjeanne, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	3/5/2009 5:51:46 PM	Withdrawal from this drug is very difficult. I would not recommend this drug for anyone. I have been weaning from this for almost 2 months. Severe nausea, anxiety and confusion have been a real problem for me. I am a nurse and was unaware of the withdrawal difficulty. It must be done slowly and with great care.

Also had to hold job for Ins.It has been 2 years, and they are gone. This drug was a life saver. I have been trying to get off the drug, but I get VERY sick, brain shivers, fatique,confusion, and nausea. My Phy. just says to gradually cut down the dosage. But if I take lower than half the 75mg doasage, I get sick. Dr. has no answers.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	3/4/2009 10:09:47 AM	The side effects of this drug were extreme for me. For the first few months I yawned constantly, never feeling like I was getting enough oxygen. The whole time that I was taking the meds I was tortured by nightmares that were not typical of any dreams that I'd ever had before. All of this I dealt with for the 1 1/2 years that I was on Effexor, but I feel compelled to tell my story of trying to ease off of the drug. I found the experience terrifying. I became instantly sad and angry. I also had &quot;brain zaps&quot; as I called them for several weeks. I could feel electrical shocks in my brain and legs and feet. I also had this strange sensation of being able to hear very loudly and feel my eyes moving. It all sounds silly, but was very scarey at the time. I started doing some research online, and found countless similar testimonials. Some people claimed that these 'Zaps' never went away. I was NEVER warned about any of this, and feel very betrayed by both my doctor and the drug industry. I suggest to anyone starting this med to be prepared.

I dont recommend taking in the evening. Morning is best. I have noticed an overall sense of well being and my anxiety is much better. I was on Paxil for 3 years but became immune to it. I have tried celexa.rimmeron and xanax. Celexa made me sick and dizzy,rimmeron made me a zombie,xanax worked great but is addictive. I am afraid of the withdrawals from this drug but was able to taper off Paxil well and my mother took this and did well with tapering off also. Its not for everyone so make sure you talk to your doctor. I have to say I am very happy with the overall effects. Iam also taking for change of life and it really helps the mood swings!

MDD (major depressive disorder) Self committed twice for suicidal thoughts in a two year period.  I would go into crying spells that may last between 12-48 hours.  I am taking 300mg each morning.  I have had one crying episode in two years and it only lasted for about 15-20 min. (and it was after some bad news I rec'd)Only negative is cost.  If I miss a dose one time and was very agitated the next day.  Totally a life saver and live changer.

I took one pill and within a few hours felt nauseous, got dry mouth. This morning woke up with a head ache. Then I read more about it and learned that it also creates a huge dependency. I'm not taking it any more because the potential and horrible dependency issues. It's just too scary.

I felt side effects for almost 2 years after stopping. The brain shivers, hotflashes, insomnia, strobe light moments, they seemed like they were never going to stop. Very expensive too, changed insurance and couldn't get it covered. It was a rough couple of days.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	2/27/2009 11:36:16 AM	I have always had slight problems with depression and anxiety my whole life, but after the birth of my first child, everything worsened dramatically! I also developed severe pms symptoms that would last 2 weeks straight. After trying a few other meds that didn't work well, my doc put me on 150 mg Effexor XR and it worked great for about 6-7 months, then I stared feeling like I was disconnected 24/7, not wanting to do anything except sleep and lay around all day.I started drinking alot and had to overcome an alcohol addiction! I told my doc I wanted off of the med and he suggested upping the dose to 225mg instead. BAD IDEA!!!! I felt way worse and couldn't even think straight! I was involved in a car accident shortly after that was caused by my poor judgement (failure to yield) and it has opened my eyes completely that I need to STOP taking it, so I took it upon myself to start lowering the dose... i'm down to 75 mg a day now and I feel pretty terrible considering I have a HIGH tolerance for pain and by no means am I a sissy!!! I have chills and body aches, ear ringing, and so many other things. I am going to quit completely in a few days and I will never go on this medication again!

I have taken it for about 18 mos.I take the lowest dose-- 37.5 mg/day and it has been a life-saver. The improvement in my overall mood/outlook has improved greatly. My doctor made me promise to stay on it at least 6 weeks; and that is about how long it took to kick in. STICK WITH IT AND GIVE IT A CHANCE! At first I felt very jittery, no appetite, insomnia. But that all leveled off....I now sleep better than ever and have been able to give up the Ambien.
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	2/24/2009 12:32:00 PM	I was increased from 75mg to 150mg and now my hair has begun falling out.

Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	2/23/2009 11:30:49 PM	Please think about other treatment options/medications before taking this medication.  I have been taking it for 2 years, 75mg increased to 150mg a day. Although it has helped ease my depression, it has had no effect on my anxiety or panic attacks.  The withdrawal symptoms I experience after missing one dose are horrible: dizziness, tingling feeling down  my arms to my fingertips, crying for no reason, and a strange feeling in my head, as if there is a magnet pulling me. There is no other way to describe it.  I am afraid to come off it, but the withdrawal symptoms scare me so much I have started to ween myself down.  I feel like I am addicted to it.

I started with75mgs and finally over a period of several months found that I need 300mgs. I feel good now and am thrilled to finally found a medication that works. I tried other meds for my depression but none did nearly as well as Effexor XR. Be sure and really quiz your doctor about all the medications and ask him or her why they feel a particular anti depressant is the one that they want to get you started on. Talk to others what has worked for them and go on line and get as much info as you can. One spcialist told me that he felt Effexor worked particulary well for women.

Tried getting off,but each time, after  3-4 days, I go into an extreme depression and can only cry. This last time, I totally lost control of my emotions.  My doctor switched me to Pristiq - not quite as effective, but so far, none of the side effects like Effexor. Effexor just more effective on my depression and anxiety. I was about to file for divorce and quit my job - all in that week I was off Effexor.  Not good to quit &quot;cold turkey!&quot;

I noticed it helping with my anxiety and depression about the 3rd day. I have not noticed any bad side affects yet. I cant take the medication at night because I will be up every hour, so I take it in the morning.  I am sleeping very good at night.  I have not missed a dose yet, but I am nervous about the possible withdrwl simptoms that others have mentioned, and I am nervous about the possible weight gain. Its working so far so I have my fingers crossed.  More to Come Latter.

Being on this drug is okay as long as you take it everyday. I have gained about 20 pounds and that is not okay. My emotions and panic disorders are much better. I slowly took myself of this medication. By reducing from 150 mg to 75 to 37.5. Now I have been off effexor xr for a week. My withdrawals symptoms are horrible. I am sick with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, can't concentrate and I have bad headaches. This drug makes me feel like I have a hangover. I am working, but it is very difficult. Does anybody know of anything that will help the withdrawals please? I am ready to but this behind me. Please Help!!

I went to see my Dr about a month ago to see if I could lower my dose to try to get off of this drug. Instead she incresed me to one 75mg and one 37.5mg a day. I have tried to quit &quot;cold turkey&quot; but the side effects are just too much! I have terrible dizziness and tunel vision. It is like I am addicted to effexor! Not a good feeling!  I want to stop taking these, I am just scared of the withdrawl side effects!  It did work well for me when I needed it, but now I don't need it anymore and they won't help me get off of it! Anyone have any suggestions?  jamlynns@yahoo.comThanks!!

Honestly I'd rather be overweight than deal with the anxiety attacks I had, but still it does stuck.  Also, at one time I thought I was cured and tried to get of the medicine.  I thought I would die!  I did exactly as the doctor told me and slowly weaned myself; but the nausea and headaches were too much to bear.  I decided I'd rather be on it and fat; then go through the pain.  I've found sites on the internet that have better plans for getting off of it than my doctor's, but I still don't think it is worth it.  I'm happy, anxiety free and have seen no adverse side effects other than the weight gain, and that I can live with.  I've been on effexor-xr for almost 4 years now.

Other	whitefeatherliz, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	2/18/2009 2:23:15 PM	I was placed on Effexor XR for Fibromyalgia and associated issues in Sept 2008. I started with 37.5 mg and worked my way to 75mg by Nov 2008. For the most part this medication worked for the pain and anxiety issues that come with Fibro... though the side effects were somewhat bothersome; hot flashes and sweating, my blood preasure became elevated requiring another med to lower it, I felt more tired than I did without the medication, and lacked motivation to do much of anything. I experienced dry mouth, dizzyness and stomach upset for the first several months then these subsided. I found this medication also caused me to become winded very easily, caused heart palpitations and muscle weakness when trying to walk any distance that would be part of everyday activities such as grocery shopping. I admit I do feel this med helped with mood and anxiety levels, since I have had to deal with serious family issues (my daughter was raped, and has been suicidal since the attack). I was able to calmly handle every aspect of the incident with great calm and focus. My reason for coming off the medication is because I am currently participating in a drug research program for Milnasipran so I had to detox off the effexor before starting the program / research. The worst part about the effexor was the coming off phase. The withdrawl from this medication was horiffic! My doctor advised me that because I was on a low dosage for a short period of time I could go cold turkey when coming off the med. I experienced terrible headaches, and zaps (the only way I can explain the effects my brain felt if I would move my head or eyes) this lasted for about 2 wks, I also was very ill; nausiated, diahrea, terrible body tremors, cold chills, and mood swings. All of these detox withdrawl symptoms I was advised can be normal. My brain (the zaps and headaches) was reacting to not having the chemicals that effexor balances out. Overall I believe this med works but I would not go back on it if I had to.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	2/18/2009 1:31:20 PM	I was on Effexor for about 2 months a few years ago and HATED it - weird dreams, felt really odd.  I'm currently on Wellbutrin and Lexapro and it works for me.  Everyone's different so if somethings not working try something else and if you're having trouble finding the right thing go to a psychiatrist!  PCPs don't know enough especially if you need to use more than one medication or an atypical dosage.  I wasted 8 years felling &quot;good enough&quot; but it wasn't!

It caused major weight, in excess of 50, and noticble side effects. Missed doses are extremely troublesome, as there are severe withdrawl symptoms, so don't miss a dose. 
Depression	ANGELA,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female		2/17/2009 12:56:14 PM	In the short term, Effexor XR was very effective in treating my depression and anxiety.  However, after being on this med for 8 months, I gained 35-40 lbs! The weight gain was not immediate, it just sneaks up on you.  There was abolutely no weight gain for the first 3 months or so, but then I noticed gaining a few pounds here and there and my clothes became tighter.  Even though I had not changed my eating habits at all, I was gaining weight!  I went from a size 8 to a size 12.  At that point, Effexor became counter-productive for me since the weight gain really depressed me.  I went off of it last week (cold turkey) and I've lost 4 lbs.  Luckily, I've had no withdrawal symptoms (even though you are not supposed to go cold turkey).  In summary, I guess for the short term (3 months or less), Effexor XR is great, but I would never EVER take it longer than that due to the weight gain.

I have spent yr.s with fear of meds., anxiety attacks, bipolar, social issues and so much more! I been thru several dr.s who couldn't find a way to treat me. I am now taking this med. everyday, sleeping at night and ready to start the day in the morn. with a smile. I have never felt better. I hope this is something that I can take the rest of my life! I have noticed feeling of pulsating in my head and some blurried vision. I just have found so many great reason to take it then reasons not to, like remember things from day to day, I finally have patients for the little things and I am so much more organized. Finally a medicaton made for all my disorders in one, and finally the end of all those stressful test! Without trying this med. I don't think they'd ever figured out how to give me my life back, my kids a better mom, or my husband a wife that wanted to live another day. I enjoy going out in public and for the first time in 13 yr.s and I look forward to finding a job in public dealing with people. Something I have only wished to do finally about to come true! Thanks to this med!!!

Depression	Jackey, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	2/15/2009 6:28:53 PM	I have been on Effexor for 6 years for anxiety/depression. The Effexor got me out of a hell hole. But for the last year, I have been experiencing advancing blurriness, aggitation and finally jaundice. Because of my moods going up and down, I thought and also my psychiatrist thought that I was bipolar so he put me on Lamictal.I couldn't tolerate this med. because it caused severe joint pain. I had blood work checked last March and the results were all normal except for my cholesterol and triglycerides were  elevated. These are side effects of Effexor XR. I wish I had read all this information when all the symptoms started happening to my body. I should have gone on the computer and read all the side effects instead of being naive. I questioned my psychiatrist and he thought that I was rationalizing too much between an elevated blood pressure and an increase with my aggitation. (Jee, I am not bipolar after all). I guess I was right and he was definately wrong. Even though we have &quot;mental issues&quot;, we should take all the changes in our behavior seriously after we are put on these medications. Our chemical imbalances lead us to take these chemicals. I have been off the med for almost 2 weeks after cutting myself down (I work in a doctor's office) and the main withdrawal was dizziness and I had to really concentrate on what I was saying. I feel great right now, no depression or anxiety. I hope and pray I remain this way and I hope that everyone pays attention to each and every day while on this med. Keep a diary.

I would have to be hospitilized if I came off of it due to the &quot;brain shivers&quot;, dizziness, and vomiting it causes me. I have these effects even if I miss one dose. If thee is something else that will work for you take it. Stay away from this medication.

My lips and tongue go numb, I feel like I am always on the verge of vomiting. I cant deal with the sweats and speedy heart but not the withdrawal symtoms. If I could I would ask for a different drug.

Depression	Jody, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male	55-64	2/12/2009 4:38:21 PM	I was on Effexor for over 7 years, and it worked extremely well at controlling my ragism and depression.  I had to stop taking it once I realized it was causing my violent dreams.  The very real problem with the violent dreams is that I was acting them out in my sleep.  This resulted in my hitting and kicking my wife in bed, and then throwing myself out of my bed resulting in back surgery after one episode, and neck rehab after another.  The dream side effects can be very dangerous!  I have tried several other antidepressants, resulting in other side effects, none have included the violent dreams.  Anafril still involved acting out my dreams, but they were not nearly as violent.  Luvox does not seem to control the anger, so I am trying Lexapro next.

I do not get the exersize I need, period.  I am afraid to move because of the hot spells.  No, it is not menapause, been there done that.  I am 65 and have been on antidepressants for 30 years.  The diagnois is just clinical depression.. If I quit taking this drug the I see no point to living, although I am not sucidal.  I have tried so many of these new generation anti-depressants and they all have the same HOT EFFECT, so, there is something in all of them that is the same and the second generation anti-depressants do not work for me.  I need an answer but I know I will not get one.

Ive been on Effexor for about a year and this drug has been a God send for me. I am able to manage my life. If it were not for this medication I would not be able to enjoy life not be able to hold down the management position I have; never mind be able to function in the day-to-day world. Ive tried Zoloft, Paxil, Prozac which are also good medications however each person is different as each medication is as well. As far as side affects  if you miss a day you may experience what called brain shivers. Not a good feeling at all however goes away after you get back on schedule. To suffer and do nothing feels much worse then any side affect you may experience. I would strongly suggest not stop Effoxor cold turkey. As with all antidepressants, patients will need to be weaned off. Regardless, Effexor works well and is well tolerated. Hope this helps.

I gained 50 pounds in a really short time period once I started taking this.  I took myself off back in 09/2008 because of this.  Withdrawal symptoms EVER!!!  PLEASE let me know if the weight gain has been an issue for anyone else and HOW LONG does it take to lose it.  I have tried everything and my weight just hovers at 173.  Please let me know.

Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	45-54	2/4/2009 5:17:43 AM	TIP- If you are trying to get off the drug, ask your doctor about prescribing Prozac to take as you ween off Effexor. It was the only thing that helped me to get off of it and not suffer the extreme withdrawal symptoms. It took me about 3 weeks to ween off. I am back on it again, though. It seems to work. Same as many others- very bizarre dreams! Can be very funny. No nightmares, though. Sometimes, lack of energy. Definitely lack of desire, but not lack of ability to have sex. I have noticed memory issues, but not sure it's related to this drug or Ambien.

Depression	big momma, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	2/2/2009 10:07:21 PM	After taking first Zoloft for a long period of time I switched to Celexa because of the lack of sex drive. I recently began taking the generic Effexor when the Celexa seemed to stop working. There were a lot of side effects initially which eventually went away and the antidepressant seemed to be working. I've recently been having problems with exessive fatigue ( after a full nights sleep, I can still sleep all day and have fallen asleep mid sentence sitting on the couch!)I've begun to suspect the Effexor may be the cause of this because I see no other reason for this constant tiredness and have not had this problem before. However, I had no idea that the withdrawls lasted so long so I am afraid to discontinue use. I am the only person at home with my three young children and I have an idea what I am in for because I have forgotten a dose before and the dizziness and heart palpitations were awful and appeared very randomly. I wouldn't recommend this medication if you have any other choices.

However, it has come to a point that it isnt as effective as it once was, and I'm wondering what the next step is. Also, I have a much diminished sex drive.

It caused wild dreams at first, but seemed to control the hot flashes.  Recently fainted, was hospitalized and EKG showed a new blip; doctor thought might be from Effexor.  Had to go off cold turkey and have all kinds of issues.  Itchy skin, lightheaded, nausea, etc.  Anyone else had this problem?

Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	1/29/2009 6:57:47 PM	Before taking Effexor XR, I suffered from severe panic attacks, agorophobia, and had generalized anxiety disorder.  First I tried Zoloft, which made me feel horrible and I would literally wake up in the middle of the night having panic attacks.  After starting Effexor XR (give it a chance for your body to adjust to the medication, about a month) I have not had a major panic attack in years!  NOT ONE.  Started on 37.5 mg for a few weeks, then moved up to 75, the to 150, and took 225 mg for a few years.  You will have decreased energy, increased sweating, and lucid dreams.  All of these went away for me after using it for a few months.  When my dose was being increased, the symptoms would return for a week or so.  Not for high BP patients.Wean slowly...slower than you think.  I've been weaning for months now and have had great success.  DO NOT CUT YOUR DOSES IN HALF when trying to get off the med.  Instead, go down by 37.5 mg each month or so.  Seems conservative, but the side effects aren't as severe.  Unfortunately, this med is outrageously expensive.  I was paying as much as $240 a month at one point (with excellent insurance).  No generic!  When I missed a dose, I also paid the price.  Your head feels very &quot;swimmy&quot;.  Light and sound was almost unbearable.  Take it in the morning with a light breakfast to curb insomnia in the evening.  Effexor XR has honestly changed my life.  I can leave my house, drive, be a good mom, and maintain healthy relationships again.  Hang in there!             
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	brunswickmom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	1/29/2009 5:52:40 PM	I have taken Cymbalta and gained 35 lbs., went on Celexa and it did not work, now I'm on Effexor and experiencing the WORST side effects ever! Effexor has helped with anxiety attacks and mood swings, but the side effects are unbearable, and are 10 times worse if I don't take it at the EXACT same time everyday. Horrible nightmares, chronic constipation, dizziness, headaches and TOTAL loss of sex drive. If you are considering this drug, PLEASE think twice and talk to your doctor about other treatment options. I hope to ween myself off soon, but I'll need lots of help, this is a VERY powerful drug.

Yet It has become more difficult then one can imagine. Night sweats, terribile nightmares, dizzy spells, overall lack of energy are a few things to name from its nasty withdrawl. Although Effexor stabely helped my depression the withdrawl is just not worth it. Even If I missed one dose in the morning I begin to feel sick within 12 hours. Do not even begin to take this drun unless you have tried everything.

Unfortunately I became very ill when I tried to reduce my dose and if I miss a dose I become very unwell. I do suffer from bizarre dreams and occasional sweating at night, but this is a small price to pay as the benefits outweigh the negatives. My day to day life has been much improved by this medication.

I was on it for a year before I had my son and have been on it for 2 years after he was born. I have ADHD with anxiety and depression. I started out at 75mg and am now at 225mg. This has been the only medication that has worked for all of my symptoms. I couldn't believe how well it worked in the beginning. My concentration was amazing. I didn't even know that it was possible to feel like that. I had tried Zoloft, Cymbalta, Aderall and many others that I don't even remember. I feel like I've tried everything. I do have to say that there are terrible withdrawal symptoms when you go off of it. I went off of it cold turkey off of 150mg when I was trying to get pregnant. Now that I have been on it for 2 years straight I am scared of going through the withdrawal again but I have started noticing a resistance to it.

I started at 75m and made my way to 225. I found that I actually became tolerant to Effexor. This visit, the doctor put me on Buspar also with the Effexor, with the intention of discontinuing the Effexor.  I have to say, I have actually weaned myself back to 150. The Buspar seems to quell my anxiety and I feel great. I am peaceful and calm for the first time in years. 3 months now! Coming back down from the 225m I was pretty nauseated and tired alot. Some headaches. I cant say either way about the Effexor being harmful or good. Hope this helps somebody out there. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	sborror, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	1/22/2009 12:32:28 PM	I have been taking Effexor XR for 3 months now.  I have taken Cymbalta and Buspar and neither of them have worked as well as this.  I think everyone is different and you should listen to your dr. when he/she prescribes something.  Maybe this isn't right for everyone.  I take 37.5 mg a day.  My dr. said that I could easily go to 75 mg a day, since that is the usual dose but I feel like this works for me.  At least for now.  I still have minor anxiety but nothing like I had before.  I have missed a dose now and then and when I do my biggest complaint is nightmares.  I realize when I decide to stop taking Effexor that I will experience awful side effects, but I think all medications have this.  When I went off of Cymbalta (took it for 6 months) I had brain zaps, dizziness, and other terrible symptoms that took a few months to get through.  But I did get through it.  This works for me now and I will continue to use it as long as I feel the need.  If your dr. recommends it, try it to see if it right for you.

Im terrified of the side effects when I decide to get off it. I also take Ativan and wonder if can interfere with the other med. Does alcohol make matters worse? so far no problems have come up. Dr. said I would lose weight as I gained 30# on Lexapro. time will tell.  
&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs	susiet, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	45-54	1/22/2009 10:35:57 AM	While I used this drug successfully to treat my PMS and post-hysterectomy menopausal symptoms, I strongly urge anyone who is considering using Effexor to carefully weigh other options.  When I would miss just ONE DOSE I would get headaches and a &quot;whooshing&quot; sound in my head accompanied with dizziness.  I tried to wean myself off of my 75 mg. daily dose and experienced HORRENDOUS nightmares, along with the previously mentioned symptoms.  This drug works for it's intended use, but definitely has some potential serious side effects.  I'm currently trying to get off this medication.
&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	1/21/2009 7:48:41 PM	I had a total hysterectomy 4 years ago (dr left one ovary for some hormones). Recently, I started feeling menopausal hot flashes, and moodiness so dr put me on this. Immediately started out with headache but as my body adjusted it went away, however I could never shake the all day tiredness. The tiredness was really interfering with my daily tasks. However, the moodiness and hot flashes went away. I couldnt take being tired anymore and was yawning all day all the time. Dr. weaned me off of it after being on it for only 2 &amp;1/2 months! and had the absolute worst drug withdrawel symptoms ever. I had severe uncontrollable shaking episodes and extreme disorientation, even if I went to bed to &quot;shake it off&quot; I shook and felt terrible.  It took me about a month just to feel a little normal again. 
Bipolar Depression	Bev, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	1/21/2009 2:00:22 PM	After the death of my son and his three children in a house fire, I found it hard to cope.  This drug has been wonderful for me.  Yes it has some side effects but they are manageable for me. I am so much better now. Just Listen to your Doctor and decide what is best for YOU. Do wish the cost of drug would go down!
Depression	Ashbug20, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	19-24	1/21/2009 11:25:35 AM	I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, Anxiety/Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia and Emetophobia when I was 16 years old, even though these problems have been going on since I was about 11. For the first 2 years or so, it helped. I was able to leave the house and do the things I used to do with ease. Then things started to change. Now I constantly have nausea, insomnia, tremors, brain zaps, vertigo (dizziness) and mood swings. I take it every other day, and I still have the same result. It has effected my job, I have more panic attacks, I am slowly starting to not be able to leave the house, and I seem to be more irritable after its been in my system. After I take it, I am miserable the whole day. I can't eat, sleep, function, I feel like a zombie.When I don't take it, I have severe brain zaps, I cry if someone looks at me cross-eyed, I become more violent, and I can't leave the house. Even going to the grocery store makes it worse.I've tried a wide range of medicine to help relieve some of these symptoms, and so far nothing has worked: Celexa, Paxil, Depakote, Wellbutrin, Gapabentin, Neurontin, Topamax, Klonopin, Seroquel.Mind you, I was around 17-18 during the time that I was taking all these, so it could have been my age, and maybe the fact that I had raging hormones and &quot;nothing worked&quot;. I don't have health insurance, so it's been quite hard for me to change medications, so I've stuck to this medication. Why? I have no idea. All I do know is that I need to get on something different. It doesn't seem to help me anymore, only make things worse. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. It would really help me out a lot. I just want my life back.
Bipolar Depression	JesiRox, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	1/21/2009 12:11:59 AM	I've been on this medication now for a while and for the most part it has helped me. I don't cry as much when I am on it and I seem to be more fun to be around as well. However I do get some panic attacks and times where I just want to be left alone. The worst part of this medication is when I run out. I get the WORST withdrawal symptoms ever. I can't focus on anything. I get weird feelings throughout my whole body and my brain seems to &quot;flutter&quot;. I don't know any other way to describe it. 
Bipolar Depression	beagleluvr, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	1/20/2009 4:06:50 AM	stomach cramps, gas,  diarrhea still after 6 months.tried all but cymbalta and wellbutrin, i mean ALL.still fell depressed, worse, hopeless.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	1/19/2009 9:59:33 PM	This medication was the best thing for my anxiety &amp; panic disorder, I have tried a few others but this was by far the best. The only side effects I had were falling down, falling asleep spontaneously and bleeding (like i was on a blood thinner). But when I could no longer afford the medication I went through the worst withdraw symptoms and pain I had ever been through in my life, it took me almost 2 months to completly get over the nausea and headaches (I had them everyday). I literally could not get the strength to get out of bed to take care of my children, if I did I was dizzy and out of sorts. It felt like I had a hang over everyday, it was horrible! I was only on this medication for a total of 5 months and need to get back on some type of anxiety/panic medication.
Depression	SayNOtoEffexor!, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	1/19/2009 4:00:51 PM	I was on this medication for about a year and was somewhat pleased with my results. Until the day I decided I no longer wanted to be on meds. I have never in my life suffered with withdrawal and never want to again. The withdrawl from this med is so horrible, the brain &quot;zaps&quot;, the sobbing jags, suicidal and the list goes on. Now I am afraid I may have seratonin syndrome. Nothing can make me happy or smile anymore and I totally blame this drug. DO NOT TAKE THIS!!!! Ask you dr. for something else. This drug should not even be allowed anymore.
Depression	KAK, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	1/19/2009 11:08:01 AM	Worked shortly after I took it.  Felt depressive symptoms lighten up.  Did not take depression totally away.  Still have depression but not as bad.  Life circumstances have also caused depression while on Effexor.
Depression	Willow1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	35-44	1/18/2009 9:22:05 PM	This medication helped my depression tremendously, but there is definitely withdrawl symptoms even after only missing one dose.  Severe dizziness, heart flutters, feelings of passing out brain zaps. Within an hour of taking the next dose, the symptoms stop but it is very scary. I found a website where other users state they have all had withdrawl symptoms also.  I do wish my doctor would have advised me of this prior to my using this medication. The information from the pharmacy does not say anything either. I have tried other brands that also helped my depression and not had these symptoms.  
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/18/2009 4:44:24 PM	Miracle drug with nearly immediate results.loved it( but fairly costly), after 1 yr. I felt cured, but had to take it because of tremendous physical withdrawl.standard reduction not tolerable. So I did it my own way, zoloft was cheaper. I continued my Rx of Effexor as ordered &amp; started zoloft at 25mg.(sort of did it like a starter pack). As I increased the Zoloft, I decreased the Effexor. Took me about 2 wks just listening to my body &amp; emotions.Had to go for 150mg of zoloft initially &amp; now have been able to decrease that without the nasty withdrawls. I started Effexor cause I was a mess &amp; the Zoloft just wouldnt cut it at first. I have improved my ways through counseling &amp; feel better, but initially I do believe the Effexor was a much need lifesaver. I have noticed a little less 'drive/motivation' since switching meds but for now I've got a handle on it. I prefer Effexor XR--bless the day it ever goes generic!

No other has been able to decrease my depression and anxiety like it.  My depression decreased by about 75% and my anxiety about 90%.  I am now a motivated and happy woman!
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	55-64	1/16/2009 8:00:54 PM	It is an easy drug to use, just swallow it once a day. I have been on it for 12 years. I've tried to self wean myself off of it but can't.  The original prescribing doctor left the state six months after putting me on it but said it would only take a year for me to stablize emotionally and be taken off of it. Since going on it I have been diagnosed with Disassociative Personality Disorder; I have also become an alcoholic. When I told my doctor how much I drank, he told me I really shouldn't do that any more. I am suicidal but benefit from the personality disorder since part of me remains the caretaker of human beings and animals and birds that I have been for my whole life. My brother shot his rifle at me because I had refused to let him molest me at less than 9 years of age, my father both sexually assualted and abused me at an early age and also told me that I should have been killed as a defective being; my mother told me from an early age that as the second born twin I would have been killed at birth had I been born in Africa. (note: I'm not African). I thought Effexor RX would help me get through a difficult stage as a government whistle blower. Instead I am addicted to it and lorazapan and alcohol. If I didn't have the ability and opportunity to care for beings and creatures less fortunate, I would have left this world.  No, I don't think any medicene that requires taking it for 12 years and with no end in sight is good. Treating a symptom does not treat the person or the cause.  And anyone on these meds should realize that most medical studies only look at the complications of usage for 6 months or less. The analytical side of me tells me that there is something very wrong in an advanced society that perpetuates drug usage rather than helping individuals to overcome emotional trauma.   
Depression	susantoo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	1/15/2009 6:49:30 PM	I was prescribed Effexor (not the XR) a few years back.  I tried half of a pill, and had the feeling that I was wound up so tight, I could snap like a rubber band! I couldn't even urinate, my body felt so tense! It was terrifying.  I went to bed, and slept for 15 hours, staying in bed until I was sure it had all worn off.  Its a shame, because nothing really has worked well for me, and this sounded promising.  I'm way to scared to take any other drugs in the same class. SNRI?

Bipolar Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	2	5	1	Female	19-24	1/15/2009 12:33:26 PM	I was going through a tough time, but i think it is just one of those high school teenage phases. My mom was convinced that there was something wrong and we went to the doctor and she made it seem like i was literally going crazy. Well they put me on 150 mgs at 17 years old and i definitly noticed a difference, but it wasnt a good one. I felt like the drug made me severely depressed and i would have night sweats and couldnt sleep. I became a person i didnt know anymore, but my mom made me take the pills. I was on them for almost 2 years and then i got pregnant and stopped immediately. Now im not on any meds and i've never been happier in my life. I dont think i ever needed to be on effexor or any medication for that matter. So my advice is, dont give this medication to teenagers. 
Bipolar Depression	sue h, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	45-54	1/15/2009 7:36:16 AM	Effexor XR has caused me to feel a bit manic. It has lessened my appetite and in 2 weeks I have lost 4 pounds. I find I need to supplement with Seroquel to keep my mania in check. I have had one episode of severe shakiness and my blood pressure rose as did my pulse rate. My blood pressure returned to normal, but my heart rate stayed elevated all day--87, as opposed to 68. I am only on 75 mgs a day. I like Effexor, but I do have to worry about this manic feeling I have all the time. It's not good for me to feel this way. Seroquel works, but it makes me gain weight. I don't want to have to take both consistently. Anyone else have feelings of mania with Effexor XR?
Panic Disorder	scampbe2, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	1/14/2009 10:54:01 PM	I'm not sure about this drug for real young people but for me at 65, it has been a lifesaver.  I suffered for over 50 yrs with panic dissorder, anxiety and depression.  I never had a normal life since 5 yrs old. Now I can do anything and go anywhere.  I had tried 6 or 7 others with poor results.  I will probably be on this for life and I don't care.  Before Effexor Xr - must be XR - I had no life and shook in my shoes.  My problem is the price; as a Senior I hope to get some better pricing - I hope.

I had severe depression and anxiety.  I tried 3 other antidepressants before the Effexor XR.  For the first few weeks, I had mild nausea and then after 4 weeks began to feel the effects of the Effexor XR.  The depression faded but I still continue to have some anxiety.

It worked great for the symptoms, however I lost the coverage of this drug from my insurance and had to stop taking it. and the withdrawl symptoms are horrible. I cannot get down to the lowest dose to quit. The doctor says I may be on it for life. It is a expencive drug that I would use with caution and not start unless there is no other choice.

Depression	mpenkava, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	1/9/2009 4:36:27 PM	I am currently taking Effexor XR, and I have been taking it for the past 3-4 years (at least). I became depressed early in High School when I underwent extensive back surgery and my parents got a divorce. These two events happened simultaneously, and my father falsely blamed me for the divorce. This led to my severe depression and self-hatred. I convinced my father to let me talk to my General Practitioner about depression, because he doesn't believe in &quot;Shrinks.&quot; After trying many other antidepressants (Prozac, Lexapro, Elavil, and others), my GP decided to start me on Effexor. I was 15 years old at the time. I was not made aware of the drug's short half-life, nor was I told of the extreme dependence I would develop. I have been taking a very high dose (300mg daily) since I began the drug, and I absolutely hate it. As far as my depression symptoms go, this drug has been very effective in controlling them. However, if I miss just one dose, I suffer extreme &quot;brain shocks,&quot; dizziness, chills, shaking, and other withdrawal symptoms. I have talked with my GP about stopping this drug, but she will not assist me with it, because she believes I need to take it at least until I graduate from college. I am currently searching for a Psychiatrist who will understand this drug more thoroughly and who will help me break my addiction. I do not want to live my life dependent on a drug, and I wish I had never begun taking Effexor. Please consider VERY carefully the side effects and the dependence-causing qualities of this drug before you agree to take it. Also, be sure your doctor fully understands your condition. If you are suffering from a mental illness, speak to a Psychiatrist or Mental Therapist, not just your Family Doctor or General Practitioner. This medication is highly habit-forming. Please beware.

Started out noticing a reduction in the occurrence and intensity and now I am down to very few per &quot;week&quot; if any!  However, I am concerned for the withdrawals when I come off as I have read some nasty stories.
Depression	anon, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	1/8/2009 11:31:11 PM	I've taken several medications for recurrent severe depression over the last 15 years. My experience with Effexor has been the worst. I had been taking 150mg for about 3 months and felt better. The depression &quot;broke through&quot; again and my doc increased the dose to 300mg. I began to experience terrible side-effects: headaches, irritability and even though I do not drink alcohol I felt hung-over every morning. Called the doctor and started cutting back the dosage over a few weeks. Now that I am not taking the drug at all I am miserable. I cannot sleep at night, I feel anxious, I'm experiencing what others have described as &quot;brain shivers&quot; and I just feel like my brain is not working properly. I'm having a lot of short-term memory problems too. It's the worst withdrawal I've ever experienced. I wish I had learned more about this drug before I began taking it. Any benefit I had during the first 3 months do not outweigh the side-effects and horrible withdrawal. This is a drug of last resort. Use with caution.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	1	2	Female	19-24	1/7/2009 11:18:18 PM	I started taking this medicine in 1999 and had no side effects ever. I got off of it in 2005 and was fine after weaning off for just a week from 75 mg to 35mg to nothing. Then I got pregnant and had my daughter in 2007 and I was fine for like three months, then started to have anxiety. I went back on effexor. I started with 150 mg then went to 75 4 months later. I did fine ecxept I was tired alot. Then about six months after that, only being on it less then a year, I tried to get off it. I took 35mg for 2 weeks and was fine. Then boom, it just hit me. This medicine is a nightmare to get off of. I had severe nausea, brain zaps, dizziness,crying,fear.etc. I just tried to get off it again in Nov 2008 with no sucess. Sme thing happened. I dont know why I was ok getting off it in 2005 but not now. Why is it different? It has helped me alot with anxiety, but it is horrible to get off. The withdrawls are unbearable.

Bipolar Depression	MsSunnie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	45-54	1/7/2009 9:22:07 PM	I've been on Effexor and lamictal for about 3 yrs now.  It is the best for my depression and bipolar tendencies. I will still have down days but not the low-end of the world depressions, I can feel happy and sad.  I feel normal. I have gained some weight but can't blame Effexor for all of it.  I prefer to take at night, I sleep better-altho the doc says that is highly unusual. If I miss a dose, I will get a severe headache, occasionally they turn into migraines. so I take my meds. I like that I haven't needed to &quot;readjust&quot; or that the meds stop working. 3 yrs vs. 3 months is awesome!

Depression	karenhillisme, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	1/7/2009 1:31:11 PM	If you plan on taking this medication for the rest of your life, it will probably work to help with depression.  I took it for 2 years and then found out that I was pregnant and my OB asked me to quit cold turkey and I was literally suicidal because of the terrible, unexplainable side effects.  I felt bewildered, like my head wasn't on right, random sweating rages, and other things that aren't describable unless you have to go through it.  I saw my OB and he allowed me to wean myself off of the medication, but my life was a living hell for about a month.  Fortunately I was finally off of it totally and my baby (now 2) is happy and healthy.  I am on celexa now, which works as good or better than the effexor.  I can honestly say that time was the worst time i my life.
Depression	mommyof3girls, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/7/2009 12:50:29 PM	Ive taken Lexapro for 3 years but had to change due to my insurance co so my dr gave me effexor xr.  This medication had been horrible for me, after taking it for two weeks my blood pressure went through the roof (with no previous bp problems) and I got terrible migraines.  When I stopped taking it the withdrawls were horrific!! Ive never had to withdraw from any medication and never want to feel that again.  So for now I either deal with high bp and migraines OR my head feeling foggy and tingling that feels like electrical shocks in my head, my lips and my hands.  Which one is better? Neither!  I think this drug should be taken off the market for good! I just hope to feel better soon!

Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	1/7/2009 6:22:09 AM	This is a very dangerous drug which should not be used lightly.  My experience was that it was not very effective for treating the symptoms of depression, and once I made the decision with my doctor to discontinue use, the side effects of withdrawal were absolutely unbearable. It took almost a year to come off the drug with very small reductions in dosage because any larger reductions caused me to not be able to function properly. Even going from the smallest available dose (37.5 mg) to nothing was almost impossible - I had to break the capsules apart and count out the little pellets inside to make smaller reductions in dose. The doctor's suggestion to take 37.5 mg every other day was not helpful - it just meant that the &quot;day off&quot; was terrible. Please, please consider the severe side effects of this drug before using it. It may be able to help you, but if it doesn't, you will pay a very high price for taking it.

My dr first started me on 37.5mg for one week, 75mg the following week, and 150mg after that. I've been on this medicine for a little over a month and it's actually made my depression worse. My dr wanted me to drop back down to 75mg for a week and begin me on 20mg of Prozac. OMG!!! The withdrawal symptoms are awful!! I feel like my head is spinning, feel faint, sick to my stomach...this list goes on. It's been a week today that I've dropped the dosage and I'm not for sure if I'm going to be able to handle this. It's making me feel like I'm dieing! UGH! I do not recommend this medicine to anyone. Please think about it!

I felt alot better, I wasn't getting so irritated all the time and I wasn't crying.  When I missed a dose, it was awful! I didn't know how to describe it, but after reading these, someone hit it on the hear. BRAIN ZAPS!  It was too freaky! I have only been on this for under a year and I don't drink and never really have and after a blood test, my liver is damaged.  I highly recommend anyone who is on this to have that checked.  I was told it was suppose to be between 4-40 and it was 58 and a month later its at 70.  I'm weening off the med, and not having too hard of a time, went to 75mg for 2 days and nothing today.  Also doing a body clense of water and only chicken and vegs.  No Addatives or preservative to get the liver flushed.

And trying to stop taking it is like trying to stop taking heroin. The worst withdrawal symptoms of any medication on the market today. Brain shivers, a sensation you will never feel again in you life. Look it up

Dr started me on 37.5mg/day then up to 75mg/day.  It has worked wonderfully!  I no longer have night sweats and my hot flashes are now hot flushes.  I didn't have any emotional ups and downs, but Dr told me it should keep me on an even level.  And it does!  I have been on it for 2 years and will be on for another 3 years.  If I forget to take it I do not feel any different.

It has been 4 months that I started reducing the dose and have suffered with many of the side effects.  When I was first put on this drug I was told that the side effects were rare. This was not the case at all.  PLEASE RESEARCH this med carefully before taking.  If I would have I would have never started taking it.
Depression	Lisa Pooh, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/3/2009 2:05:48 PM	This medication was very hard on me. My doctor had me on this medication for over 7 years and he told me that I shouldn't stay on this medication for over 2 years but couldn't get off because of bad side effects that kept me on taking it. When I finally got off of this horable medication I had severe withdraws, migraine headaches, saw things that was not there, body shook for 30 days (including with the 30 days of seeing things that was not there &amp; headaches). Everytime I would move my body and head I would get a &quot;shock&quot; that would go up to the top of my head like it was an electrical shock. I felt as if my brain was moving. Sounds scarey, you should feel it to experience it. How can any company make this pill for any human being is just cruel. I think if the doctors would take this pill for 1 month and get off of the pill they would not recommend this pill for nobody! This pill is the most physical addicting pill I have ever been on and highly recommend that no one to take this pill. It made me have sucidial thoughts and actually did overdose and was put in rehab different times over this medication. I went off this pill with out my doctor's permission because I didn't want this in my system anymore. I feel so much better now then when I was taking that medication. I have been off Effexor for now over 2 years. Thank God for taking this in my own hands and getting off this nasty medication. Xanax is much better for me and I only take it when I need it not like the Effexor. Plus I have no side effects with Xanax. I hope that I could help someone with this and encourage people not to attempt to take Effexor. This pill will ruin your life if you stay on it. I know too many other people who went thru the same as I with Effexor.

Some side effects went away at higher doses, and some side effects were worse at higher doses.The highest dose I used was 375mg, and at that level I lost my ability to concentrate on anything.Now I take a 150mg dose/ day and have little or no side effects, but see no benefits as far as depression or anxiety symptoms.

I wanted to get off but then my fiance died of cancer so the doc put me on 150 mg, where I am today, almost 4 years later.  I HATE the prison this med has sentenced me to.  It is hellish coming off of this stuff - I tried 7 months ago and I am gathering all my strength to try again.  Even the doctors don't know how to get me off of this, just lower the dosage and MAYBE, I can quit, EVENTUALLY.  It is dangerous driving while in withdrawal, I am afraid to take walks alone - I feel like a kid running with scissors - everything is dangerous because I can't focus, I am constantly going in and out of dizziness, nausea and crying spells.  Effexor and effexor by any other name should be BANNED.

My doctor recommended it as she felt I had PTSD.  I had never taken any medicine like this before and was resistant to starting it as I felt I couldn't handle the side effects, if there were any.  At the start I felt so much better and it seemed like the &quot;event&quot; happened a long time ago.  But my sex life is zero and I am sort of numb.  I want to feel something but the something I feel when I try to stop taking the meds is miserable.  I have tried to stop taking it 3 times and haven't suceeded.  Every time I try I have worsening problems when I miss a dose.  I'm trying again and not telling my family because I don't want to hear &quot;have you taken your medicine?&quot;. Don't know if I'll make it this time or not.  I don't like feeling dependent on meds.

Depression	hugzz54, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/30/2008 8:17:32 PM	This medication was first prescribed for me in 1999, after an old spinal injury flared up. From the very beginning The medication did exactly what it's supposed to do. I started out taking the Effexor XR at a very low dose and was &quot;built up&quot; to the 150 mg a day,that I've taken for so long. About 4 years ago the medication was increased to 150 mg Am &amp; 150 mg PM. About 1 year ago I noticed that the medication didn't seem to be working as effectively as it always had. So, about 8 months ago, my Dr added Wellbutrin SR 150 mg to my medications. I don't take the wellbutrin every day, just on those days that I feel is gonna be a really bad day. On those days I take 150 mg Effexor XR &amp; 150 mg Wellbutrin SR AM and if I feel that I need it I take it the same way at night, before I go to bed. Over all The medication has worked very well for me.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	55-64	12/30/2008 12:15:59 PM	This is a follow up to my 11/25/2008 1:57:57PM coments (read it first if you haven't already). I've just finished my second month of withdrawl down from 75mg to 0 mg of effexor. The last 4 or 5 days have turned out to be worse than any other. A lot of back and forth feelings of neverousness and calmness (it's more like my nerves are becoming more active, in a very unconfortable way, and directly reacting to the change in my body chemistry (Effexor withdrawl?). These nerveous reactions  do not seem to be related to my state of mind or thought process they just change directions at ramdom. There are periods when my nervious system calms down and I feel just fine. I have to admit the last few days (not counting today) I all most gave up, I believe the Effexor web site said it takes up to 3 months to clear out of your system so I plan to ride out the whole 3 months and decide then.On one hand if I go back on the effexor I face nite terrors (screaming in my sleep, diving out of bed, waking up with bumps and bruses and having little or no memory of the event)(my wife and kids tell me about it in the morning) (my wife sleeps in a different bed room so she avoids any injury). On effexor, I have no memory of having any normal dreams. To be honest I love having  normal dreams (not nightmares) over the past two months, since I've been off effexor. I'm done for now and need to take a break.

Depression	wagirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	12/27/2008 1:53:29 AM	I started taking Effexor 2 years ago to treat severe depression and anxiety with heart palpitations.  My doc also put me on atenolol to control the palpitations, which is a nice combo because it reduces your blood pressure and prevents migraines.    After a year I felt better, like many of you who complained about wanting to get off it, and slowly tapered off.  What I have learned in the last year of horrible depression trying to do it &quot;on my own&quot; with diet, exercise, counseling, and the atenolol - is that going off was a horrible mistake.  I was feeling better BECAUSE of the Effexor XR.  I stopped working out, gardening, doing the things I love this year.  I am now back on it and committed to staying on it for at least two years straight this time.  I had tried Prozac, Celexa, Wellbutrin before with limited results on my depression and increased anxiety.  Effexor XR is the only one that has really helped both my depression and anxiety at the same time.  Within 24 hrs of starting it again, I already feel calmer, happier, more hopeful and at peace.  Life seems worth living and I am thankful for everyone in my life again too instead of ready to walk away from them all, lock myself in a hotel room, and cry for a few months like I was before I started it again.  Yes, decreased libido, difficulty achieving orgasm, don't drink more than one alcoholic drink or you will be sick and have the worst migraines and nausea ever, vivid dreams and some difficulty sleeping.  Overall, it has definitely been worth it. Definitely not a &quot;starter&quot; antidepressant, but it can be very effective when others don't work for you.  I recommend the XR version over the others to reduce side effects.  I am a therapist myself and sometimes people have biological causes of depressions that need something strong like this.  Commit to taking this one if you need it, and withdraw VERY slowly.  It can save lives.  It did mine.
Extreme Apprehension or Fear of Social Interaction	MissyV, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	12/27/2008 1:32:43 AM	I was on Effexor XR before and weaned myself off with less trouble than getting off Paxil, but still hated the brain zaps.  I found gradually lowering the dose helps you get off.  I recently started back on the meds after I was diagnosed with Severe ADHD, BiPolar,Panic attacks, severe anxiety especially social, agorophobia, and Schizo-affective disorder.  I could not tolerate the psychotic (sp) meds side effects and my depression was kicking in (attempted suicide twice) so doc put me back on Effexor.  (Got off due to sexual side effects) Still hate the side effects, but would rather be happy and more healthy.  All is heriditary, lucky me!  So, I am on Effexor XR for depression and anxiety, another anxiety medication, and adderal for my ADHD.  So far, I feel okay, some shakes here and there, especially if I forget to eat since both meds decrease appetite.  Daugther (yes, it got passed down from my dad, to me, to by girls) is on prozac and seems to help with her high anxiety level and anger/depression.  Took her off Adderal after she became moody and irratable on it.  Would definately recommend finding which meds work for you.  Life is too short to spend it depressed and living with anxiety and panic attacks.  There is hope.  Good luck to all and God bless!

I have been on Effexor for about 10 years and it has been a miracle drug for me.  I experienced a night and day change in my IBS symptoms, depression and anxiety.  I do have a loss of libido and I feel horrible the next day if I forget to take it, but I don't think I'll ever stop taking it.  I imagine the withdrawal symptoms are like what I feel when I skip a day x 10.

The expense of the drug, even with insurance, is amazing.  Also trying to wean yourself off of this is like being on that spinning ride at the local fair.  Feels good while you're on it, but once you get off the dizziness sets in.  Also caused me severe panic attacks, to the point i had to leave work.  Cut down to 1 a day for a week, and now slowly going over to Wellbutrin.  Not sure how that will work, but i would NEVER NEVER NEVER recommend Effexor XR to anyone!!!!!!!!!!

I wanted to dress, shower and live.  Anyone who deals with depressions knows what i'm talking about--I'm not so gloomy all the time.  I do have some anxiety issues still...but i contribute that to being around people again after being at home for months straight without leaving the house (except to grocery shop).life outside of the house is scary, and i am learning how to deal with people again.  And there are some pretty stupid people in the world...
Depression	FinallyThere, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	12/23/2008 6:15:55 AM	Well, I have to say that if it had been available to me 40 years ago; I would have taken it then. It has been of SO much help to me. The difference in my life is unbelievable. I am so much more confident and assertive now. I am not the &quot;wallflower&quot; that I have been most of my life. It helped me, to no end; to continue my education and do something with my life!
Depression	catlover, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	12/23/2008 1:23:03 AM	I've been on Effexor for about 10 years, only because I can't get off this stuff. My doctor put me on it after a loss of a pet 10 years ago!! The withdraw is so bad and I've tried so many times. For anyone that's on it, you'll be on it for a long long time.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	None, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	45-54	12/23/2008 1:05:14 AM	I can't remember if I started taking it for depression or anxiety or maybe both. I've taken it for so many years. I've tried to stop, but can't. I have dizziness really bad and just don't feel right the times of i've tried. I feel depressed but dare not up the dosage any higher then 75mg. I would have to take off work to come off of this drug. I have a hard time becoming sexually aroused and thats when i'm lucky enough to feel like sex. Bottom line, it took care of one thing but brought on new issues. I wish I could go away for about 3 months and get off of this stuff to see who i am again.

Initially, it worked.  Wore off after a few months, after which my ob-gyn raised the dose. Again, it worked, and wore off.  Raised again.  Gained 30 lbs, was constantly tired, and couldn't delay taking a dose, or I'd feel horrible. The sweats became unbearable.  IT TOOK 3 FULL MONTHS TO WITHDRAW FROM THIS AWFUL MEDICATION!!! Brain zaps, muscle spasms, lack of coordination, memory issues, bad dreams.  Missed a full week from work, as I could not drive. Save yourself and avoid it at any cost!!!!

It works wonderfully for panic but YOU CAN NEVER GET OFF IT! They have tried several times for me now and I end up in the ER with violent mood swings and horrible &quot;brain zaps&quot;. You literally feel like there is a live wire attached to your brain and its being zapped constantly. My therapist agrees as well she doesnt know why anyone would put someone on this drug anymore. I am on other drugs for bi-polar disorder and am having issues being on the effexor as well. I wish I had never started it!

Although I still have issues with depression, Effexor has worked better than Paxil, Lexapro, or Prozac.  All of those seemed to help for a while, and then stop working over time.  I have been on Effexor for 4 years now and have has continued sucess with &quot;not as severe depression&quot;.  If that makes any sense.  It doesn't make all the pain go away, but it makes it where you can live with it.  And for me that is better than before...

Panic Disorder	NoExcuses, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	12/21/2008 6:32:39 PM	I started having panic attacks 7 years ago. I tried Zoloft, and Celexa and now Effexor XR. The Effexor XR works the best for me for panic attacks.  I have to take the pill with food or it will make me queasy. I am tired and have very vivid dreams. My main complaint is that I am unable to achieve an orgasm. I know that it is the Effexor XR, because I never had a problem before, and a few months back I weened off the Effexor XR for a few months and was immediately able to achieve an orgasm.  But then I had to start taking it again because I started having panic attacks.  My Dr. suggested Lexapro - it supposedly has less sexual side effects, but I am happy with Effexor XR for the effectiveness on the panic attacks.  My regular life is fairly normal, but my sex life is the pits!  I wish I could find a medicine without the sexual side effects, but every medicine effects everyone differently.  
Depression	 , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	12/21/2008 2:38:35 PM	Excellent medication. My psychiatristand I work together to monitor the dosage.Sometimes I need more-sometimes less.It's extremely important to work with a doctor who is 100% knowledgeable of allthe Serotonin drugs. Not a primary care-but someone who specializes in depressionand anxiety disorders.

I have taken Tofranil,Prozac, Paxil in the past 20yrs. It was veryuncomfortable when changing from one med to another. The plus side to the meds is my reading and retaining imformation. I can go out in public places. The negative is weight gain and thinning hair and not able to take asprin. My hemroids start bleeding.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	12/19/2008 2:12:33 AM	I have been on Effexor for several years and it is very hard to get off of.  The dizziness is unbearable.  It makes it so one has to stay on it to avoid the awful withdrawals.  I like to drink wine and I have terrible fast heart rate and pounding in my head when I drink even two glasses of wine.  It helps my depression but I still feel easily ready to snap at people or be irritable.  Recommend if you do not drink alcohol at all and plan on being on it for a long time b/c you cannot get off of it.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	12/18/2008 7:17:59 PM	I would say it helped steady my emotions but to agree with others, the withdraws are horrible,dizziness and funny sushing noises in my hearing when I turn my head or look around. this is my third day off of it after going from 150mg to a week of 75mg and then a week of 35mg. I personally would not take it again.ever.
Depression	randa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	35-44	12/18/2008 12:07:10 PM	If i had never been put on effexor, i cant imagine where or what i would b doing today. it is a wonderful drug, saved my life.but, after being on it for 4 yrs, i want off of it and i will tell you that it is pure hell getting off this drug. the withdrawals are awful!! and, honestly, that is the reason i want off of it. there have been days that i have gone w/out b/c it is very expensive. i am now transitioning to paxil-i am on a low dose of both rt now so the change wont b so bad- but, i am telling you- n e one that is considering treatment for depression, you should really consider the withdrawals and the cost beforehand. not joking!!!

I am currently coming off of the drug and it has definitely been it interesting time. Between the severe cravings of protein, trying to build up my immune system, and extreme fatigue I feel as though I am coming apart at the seams. Although this drug basically helped save my life it is horrible to get off of.

I would have to say that it has, to a degree ruined my life. It is impossible to get off it. I have tried many times but the withdrawl is horrible. I would advise anyone going on this drug to think long and hard about it.

Depression	B-Man, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	19-24	12/15/2008 5:54:32 PM	after taking just 1 effexor pill, within hours felt very irritable and aggitated. later became very dizzy, tired, nautious, experienced loss of appetite, involuntary twitching and shaking (especially with my jaw) stopped taking effexor and still 1 day later am experiencing some symptoms such as slight chest pain and troubles breathing, dialated pupils increased anxiety and depression as well as dizzyness and exhaustion. many of theses symptoms i live with everyday due to depression and anxiety, but after taking just one effexor pill all my symptoms were much worse and unbearable. This has happend before after 3 days of taking paxil, but it was a normal dosage of paxil where this was the lowest dosage of effexor available, and it happend immediately instead of within 3 days. hopefuly if you do decide to take this drug it works for you without these horrible side effects, cause i would not wish this upon my worst enemy.

Depression	Kansas, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	12/10/2008 6:28:54 PM	I was put on this medication after an extreme reaction to being on Zoloft for quite some time, as my side effects began to worsen. I started at a 37.5 dose, and was escalated to the 75 dose. I have been on Effexor for a little less than a year, and am terrified to ever go off, as even when I dont take my medication at the same time each day, it is a miserable reaction. The 'dizzies', as I like to call them, are by far one of the worst feelings I have ever experienced within a medication. They are so severe that it feels as though the room is jerking left to right. My advice: Take this medication close to the same time each day - and good luck to us all if anyone ever have to go off this medication.
Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	12/10/2008 3:55:23 PM	So after my son was born I had extream anxiety, I was afraid of everything.  My dr. suggested this medicine.  It took me a month even to try it.  They started me off on 75mg and then put me to 150mg, it seems to work but my son is now 2 and I am ready to get off.  So I tried to get off of the medicine and that was hell.  I had &quot;ZAPS&quot; bad, shakes omg i thought I was dying.  I could not take it anymore so i started taking them again.  I am going to take myself off of them very slowly I have now been taking 75 mg for three months I am going to start taking 35mg next month and do that for 3 months and then do every other day for a month, and then maybe I will be free of this medicine.  I would never recomend this medicine to anyone.  If I do I will be sure to tell them about the withdraws they will have when they try and get off!!!!!

I'm now coming off of it and alternating between 75mg and 37.5 and the Dr. added lexapro so i wouldn't have such bad side effects. But i can feel them already. I mostly have brain tremors and dizziness.  Haven't put on any weight and haven't gotten any sicker.  I know its going to be tough but nothing will ever compare to coming off of paxil and having the &quot;shocks&quot; i had on a daily basis severly times a day.

I returned to the Dr. and she prescribed Effexor XR beginning at 37.5MG to increase to 75MG. The HOT FLASHES stopped for about 8 months but then returned, and I was more miserable than ever. I returned to the Dr. She INCREASED the dosage to 150MG and I was miserable, still hot flashing and my face began breaking out, making me look like some kind of meth junkie.My face was constantly breaking out after being on the lower dose but now I was a PIZZA FACE. I began to decrease the dosage and then I stopped the  madness by stopping the drug. I am getting dizzy and have a hard time concentrating BUT my face started clearing up in three days after stopping. I will put up with the Flashes and  the dizziness but never will I go back on this CRAP for HOT FLASHES. My next letter is going to be to the FDA. This is the only medication I was on and I have no other illnesses so the drug companies and my own DR. cannot  say it was a reaction to  anything else.

I started off taking 37.5 and then 75 and now i'm up to 112.5 a day.  Today was the first day taking three 37.5(112.5) and so far i am so sleepy and that's the last thing i need is to be falling asleep at work.  My doc says that this is suppose to give me energy and help me with my concentration, but so far i don't see any changes.  I'm also on Xanax because i have panic attacks and they seem to work, but i'm now having trouble sleeping at night, having crazy dreams, and a severe pain in my leg while i'm sleeping and i'm not sure if the effexor is causing this.  I go back to the doctor soon and i just hope that he hears me out and take my symptoms into consideration, b/c effexor may not be the drug for me.
Depression	Geebee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/4/2008 11:15:10 AM	Laid off after 36 yrs, I could barely function due to depression.  Other drugs made me groggy.  Effexor worked within a few days. Until this year, I managed on only 37.5 mg. Major life stresses increased it to 75 mg; working very well.  I have been off and on it for over 5 years - BUT - you cannot just stop taking it - or any anti-depressant! You have to taper the dosage slowly - which I have done several times over the years and have had no side effects or withdrawal.  I was shocked to see the comments where people &quot;forgot&quot; to take it, or didn't get a refill.  Very dangerous to fool around with medications and therefore, your health. Talk to your doctor!

I do better taking it before bed.  If I take in the morning I got restless legs at night. It has worked well with the anxiety.  I do get extremely nauseous, dizzy and vomit if I run out or don't get to refill script.  I would like to be weaned off because I think I can handle the anxiety after all this time.  Hopefully I can handle the withdrawal. Does anyone have any suggestions on managing syptoms?
Depression	Ally , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	12/2/2008 7:50:07 PM	My experience has been extremely positive. I believe this medication effectively relieved my depression symptoms. my energy level increased and my overall happiness increased dramatically. However, I have one side effect that is displeasing for me...weight gain. I gained 20 pounds with this medication; although some of the weight i would like to believe is due to my exercising everyday. i must say that I am now tapering off the medication because of the weight gain, and I have noticed that some of my depression symptoms are surfacing again. I can only hope that by taking this medication, I have developed alternative means of dealing with my depression because I am unwilling to accept the weight gain associated with effexor (at least for me that is). 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	12/1/2008 6:52:08 PM	I was diagnosed with PMDD after years of struggling with frequent mood swings. My mother says it is like she's dealing with a brand new/sane person.  My only dissatisfaction is the weight gain. Though it is labeled an &quot;infrequent&quot; side effect, I have gained about 15 pounds since I began taking it. The only advice my doctor gave was to increase exercise which has been difficult, but at least the weight gain is at a halt. 
Depression	erica, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	11/30/2008 5:14:29 PM	The ratings of one star for each of the required categories is premature insofar as I have only taken the first capsule of the generic version of Effexor(venlafaxine hcl/75mg.) However, taking it in the evening after dinner (instructed to take with food), I found several initial side effects; nausea, frequent urination, trouble sleeping, diarrhea. A few months ago I stopped a three month course of Cipralex because of side effects. Most troubling is the anecdotes refering to the withdrawal symptoms. It may be that having suffered almost lifelong melencholia, I should prepare myself to stay on one medication or another to improve my mood, but I'm concerned that the side effects and withdrawal, (should I chooose to stop) are not worth it. Currently I am experiencing a serious bout of 'situational' depression, (illness of my son), and this problem is long term and has little chance of resolving. Can an anti-depressant, such as Effexor, be helpful in dealing with this problem?

But please read all the descriptions of brain freezes. You will not be able to stop taking it, so I don't recommend ever trying it even once. Eight years in, I am hooked for life, and that's very scary. What if I wanted to get pregnant?

Is totally my 'fit'! It has helped so much, though it took about a year of taking it before I stopped cycling. I have no side effects if I take it on time, but missing just one dose does a number on me the next day. But as long as I take it on time, I'm great! Of course, not a fit for everyone.

Only experienced side effects the first few days - felt drowsy, dry mouth, hot flashes and difficulty sleeping.  Am having problems with constipation.  If i continue to feel the way i do now - will consider my experience a success.  Will review again later on.

Depression	Web MD, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	11/25/2008 4:37:32 PM	I have taken 75MG for 6 years. Just changed to 150 MG after depression an anxiety returned. No sexual side effects for me. I do have unusual vibrant dreams which can both me horrible and amazing. Dizziness,  slight nausea, blurred vision but overall this med has made my life &amp; emotions better. Best to all taking this med.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	55-64	11/25/2008 1:57:57 PM	I started at 350mg after the intial month of side effects it worked well for Anxiety, but made sleeping difficult and dreams or at least remembering dreams became nonexistent. I lost all ability to have a spontaneous erection and performance on command was extremely difficult. About 1 year ago I successfully attempted to decrease my dose down to 75 mg over several months with little side effects, my sexuall function improved as I decreased the dose. When I tried to advance from 75mg down to 37.5mg I felt a mild form of intermitant Anxiety, started to have/remember  nightmarish dreams and desided to regroup at 75mg for several more months. At the begining of November 08 I decided to go from 75mg to 0. After a nite or two I started to have/remember my dreams and still do after about 30 days no nightmares that I can recall and I 've had my first natural spontaneous erection since starting effexor 5 years ago. The down sides: the first 8 to 10 days I was extremely emotional I mean I cried at sad car tunes, movies it was embarrassing but that went away after 10 days: I also had unusual sounds in my head (kinda hard to describe WHAAA Whaaa?)that disapeared after 10 days also. The last few days (27th to 29th I've started to have(unprompted by any events) intermittent,very mild anxiety, alternating with spells of peace and calm and last for several minuntes each and then disapate. I don't know how long withdrawal last, any feed back on that? Some people have mentioned it takes months. I hope not.

I love this stuff!! :)
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	35-44	11/24/2008 9:05:16 PM	This drug worked great (much better than other antidepressants) for me for a few years, then the good effects seemed to wear off.  Sexual side effects were awful also.Also, this is not a scientific claim at all, but I and others have noticed that it seems to make you smoke a LOT more (if you smoke already)- I tried another bout w/ this drug recently and it didn't work how it did the first time - still made me smoke like a fiend though, and maybe even made me crave alcohol more, too.  This drug is VERY hard to get off of.  I had the &quot;brain shivers&quot; for several MONTHS after reaching a 0 dose after tapering down off of it as slowly as possible. Looking back on this drug, considering its withdrawal symptoms and the fact that it didn't feel the same when I &quot;retried&quot; it is that I sort of felt/feel nervous that it changed my brain or something.  I feel like I am not nearly as smart/quick as I was before I ever took it.  I can't say that this drug caused that, but it seems to be the determining factor.  So, I would say that anyone should be careful taking this drug b/c it is very powerful.  It can help a lot, but it is very easy to become dependent on, and might end up changing you.  It's not a good first choice for folks who just need &quot;a little help getting through the holidays&quot; or need a little help after a bad event.  It is more appropriate (in my opinion) for someone willing and able to continue w/ it (if it works well) for chronic/serious depression. 
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	19-24	11/24/2008 4:30:09 PM	Throughout taking Effexor XR many things have happened. I have terrible side effects if I miss even one dose, my mood swings still happen strongly but infrequently and I fear that the effectiveness of the drug is fading after my prolonged useage.

Depression	Gutaemma, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	11/22/2008 9:41:56 PM	Worked very well to relieve my depression. I noticed a change in mood the day after I started it. I have a few side effects, including a diminished appetite, and for the first week I was wired and shaky and woke up a lot during the night, but those went away after my body adjusted to the drug.  The trade-off was definitely worth it.

I was very depressed, lose concentration, no energy, just out of it. The side effects were that my eyes felt as if they were stretched open a bit more. I had to decide whether to take it at night or in the morning because it did adjust my sleeping hours. But when I woke up I felt refreshed. Like my body was fully energized and ready for the day. I didn't get any weird come down or sleeplessness. I have tried Wellbutrin, regular Effexor, and other depression medications that didn't work as well.

This is the best thing out there.  I am on 150 mg Effexor XR.  I am considering asking to increase the dosage but not sure what the average dosage is recommended.
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/20/2008 7:51:25 PM	I suffered from depression and some anxiety.  This drug relieved the depression and lessoned the anxiety.  I could tell if I forgot to take it, because I would start crying at the drop of a hat.  I had no problems when I quit the medication.  After awhile, my doctor worried that my weight gain might be an unusual side effect of the medication so I quit using it.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	11/19/2008 7:22:25 PM	Horrible, horrible side effects. I had to quit almost immediately after starting treatment. Apparently, side effects are relatively rare with this medication, but I got it all and then some...Couldn't sleep, constantly clenching and grinding teeth, shaking, crying, severely dilated pupils to the point where my eyes hurt and I couldn't see. Takes about a month for the meds to work, but only eight hours to get the side effects. I understand it works for a lot of people, but obviously not me. I'm on zoloft now and that is working much better for me.
Bipolar Depression	 Female  (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female		11/19/2008 7:12:24 PM	Was effective but the side effects were too severe.  I heard it nicknamed &quot;Side Effexor.&quot;
Depression	M, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/18/2008 8:56:08 PM	I have suffered from Chronic Depression, Panic Disorder, and Social Anxiety for a very long time now and it has only gotten worse over the years. Effexor has worked the best of any drug I have tried in regards to Depression and Panic treatment. I am now up to 225mg per day, and I think I found my correct dosage. It has been months since I have experienced any panic attacks, and severe depression bouts are virtually gone as well. If you have started this medication, be sure to converse with your doctor frequently to find the dose that is best for you. Also, this is an SNRI drug- which means it works for serotonin and norepinephran- but, the benefits of norepinephran cannot be seen at a low dose; if you stop increasing at an early stage, you may as well be taking an ordinary SSRI like Zoloft, etc.

Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	11/15/2008 11:47:15 AM	I took it for depression and as far as I am concerned it was ok if I took over 375 mg per day, but if I missed even one dose it wzas the most horrible experience I ever had.  My brain felt like a marble that was banging around in my head, ears rang really bad, I could hear my eyes blink really loud.  It was as bad as I imagine someone withdrawing from heroin.  I won't ever tak it again and chimed in on the research on it in bethesda maryland and told them how aweful it was for me.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	11/13/2008 11:52:34 PM	I was first prescribed zoloft which made me nothing but tired and &quot;numb&quot; to everything. Effexor was a great change. It immediatly gave me new found energy and helped ready to get back to my life. I pretty much took this at the same time every day so I never had side effects. When I got close to being able to come down off, I took it each day but only when I remembered I forgot to take it. I have finally downgraded myself to 37.5 mg on the next 2 weeks. You need to try this medicine if you are feeing depressed.

I tried Effexor XR and it seemed to work well but I came to a point where I really wanted to stop medication. I began to feel like a zombie and realized how can I really know what I'm like without meds when its been this long? I have been weaning myself off and its EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DO!! Make sure you think about this before starting on a medication because the doctors certainly do NOT tell you how difficult these meds are to stop when you are ready to do so, especially after over 10 YEARS:(

I don't notice any major side effects. It does cause me to yawn though. This combined with Wellbutrin and Klonopin has been a great treatment so far and has worked quite well. I am much more laid back and myself again. The only thing I don't like is the high cost since it isn't in genric yet. I pay 30-40 a month for just this medication. I reccomend this.

I am up to 225mg daily and it has helped me to live a somewhat normal life again. I had very few side effects in the first few weeks, and the only persistent side effect is breaking into sweats, which happens maybe a couple times a day or every few days. It's an amazing medication and it has really helped with my anxiety.

I was finally happy like having sunshine after rain and darkness (I even lost weight!)... however after about 7-10 days it stoped working.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/9/2008 6:24:16 PM	This medication was extremely difficult to get off of once I was on it.  I slowly got off, but experienced horrible nausea and dizziness in the process and had to go back on the medication due to the side effects.  I wish I had never started taking this medication!
Depression	Boyd, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/9/2008 2:03:54 PM	I originally started taking &quot;Effexor&quot; almost ten years ago.  I am now on &quot;Effexor XR&quot; and believe me, it has helped so much in my life.  My husband can tolerate me more, my depression only comes a few times a year, my panic attacks are less and I have a good feeling most times.  Have noticed no side effects; if I miss a dosage I do not know who that person is, but I do not like her and I feel she is dangerous.  Has to be taken daily everyday and it really has helped me.  Ask my children.

Just noticeing after people told me how she has become moody and a pathalogical liar I have major new concerns about this drug I have been trying to get her off of. She has become hostile to her family and I dont even think she realizes waht she is doing anymore. It may b ruining my marriage and my wife's life. I am worried about why she was given this in the first place and now am going to call her doctor to tell him what he did to this beautiful person.

Actually, I was ashamed that I couldn't master this problem.  Doctor prescribed Effexor 75 mg.  It's been like night and day.  I still do have a panic attack maybe once a year  but it is so much milder as compared.  Sometimes I talk about getting off this drug, but my husband discourages it.  He says I am much calmer and easy going.  I do wake up each morning thinking this is a new, great day, in a good mood, and very upbeat.

At first it was ok then it made me feel like a zombie. My cousin died and I could not even cry. I stopped taking it and it felt like I should have been in rehab. I didn't sleep, I would sweat so much that I had to change my sheets every night. Also I was so mean to all the people in my life. If you are going to stop taking this med, tell your doctor so you don't have to do it alone!

I took it first thing this morning around 6:00am and it's now 11:00am and i'm feeling very nauseated, my hands are shaking and i really don't know what to do.  Earlier i had symptoms of blurred vision, but that has subsided.  The doctor gave me this for depression, from me being so stressed at work.  Hopefully i will start to feeling better by the time i go back to the doc in 2 weeks, but as for now, i really don't like this feeling.  Does anyone know if this med will cause weight gain?  I don't need to get any bigger than what i am.  I was on Lexapro, but it did nothing for me, so i guess i will wait and see how Effexor does.

Depression	Hackreploid, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	25-34	11/6/2008 2:31:01 AM	I have been on this script for 8 years.  Never being told the side effects my Dr. decided to start me on this HORRIBLE treatment shortly after the death of my daughter.  It worked well at first (2 years).  Now it does not work at all.  The only reason I still take it is to prevent the head surges, nausea, muscle twitches, tunnel vision, and &quot;mini seizures&quot; associated with &quot;weening&quot; off the meds.  Every time I have tried to get off this drug and I begin to have any episodes the doctors ALL think I am Imagining it!!!!!!!    
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/4/2008 10:03:24 PM	Effexor has worked for me and made my life bearable on, what is considered a &quot;low dose.&quot;  But it effects my blood pressure so much, that if I do not take it everyday I feel dizzy and weak. I feel so good and like I have a handle on my life and can't get off of it now!  I want to &quot;taper&quot; off and I am so scared because I am no longer covered under health insurance.  If/when I run out I will be forced to deal with the withdrawal symptoms. I don't like to be &quot;stuck&quot; on a drug, but I am glad that I found something that works with minimal side effects.  The one that I hate the most....the vivid dreams. But, it is better than weight gain, headaches or sleeplessness.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/4/2008 11:38:20 AM	I HAVE BEEN READING THE REVIEWS OF THIS MED.  I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR 1.5 YRS AND HAS BEEN VERY USEFUL FOR MY DEPRESSION.  I DO KNOW THAT IT IS NOT ADVISED TO TAKE YOURSELF OFF ANY MEDICATION W/O DR. APPROVAL OR HELP.  MISSING 2 DOSES I EXPERIENCE ALL THOSE BAD SIDE EFFECTS.  IT IS WORTH IS BECAUSE I WAS WANTING TO KILL MYSELF AND GIVE MY SON TO SOMEONE ELSE THAT I THOUGHT COULD TAKE BETTER CARE OF HIM.  TURNS OUT THAT I JUST NEEDED BETTER MEDS.  EFFX DID IT FOR ME AND I AM A GREAT MOTHER BECAUSE OF IT AND WILL NEVER GIVE MY CHILD TO SOMEONE ELSE.  I TRIED OTHER MEDS BEFORE BUT I WAS STILL VERY DEPRESSED.  IN LIFE THERE ARE ALWAYS UPS AND DOWNS.  IM READY TO GET OFF THE MED NOW BUT I CRY SO BAD AND FEEL HORRIBLE MISSING ONE DOSE.  IM NOT SURE I WILL EVER GET OFF THEM.  I LIKE TO BE HAPPY. IVE TOLD MYSELF I MUST HAVE A CHRONIC CONDITION AND NEED MEDS FOR NOW ON.  I WILL TALK TO MY DR BEFORE I JUST STOP TAKING ANYTHING.  AS FOR THE CONSTIPATION, MORE FIBER IS WHAT MY DR PRESCRIBED.  APPLE JUICE WORKS BEST.

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	11/4/2008 12:53:48 AM	I took this medication for anxiety and depression, but mostly for anxiety. During my teen years it helped me concentrate in class as well. I started taking it at age 17 and recently stopped it due to pregnancy. Tapering off of it was not hard for me and I notice only slight physical symptoms of anxiety currently. (Since I learned how to cope without the medicine) It is category C for pregnancy so I decided to stop using it because the baby would be exposed to it. I believe it is worth it for my child's brain to function normally while in the womb. I had no side effects. The extended release capsules were a 'life saver' compared to the generic venlafaxin because the generic I had to take twice a day and I could not sleep; it disrupted my daily life. I tried 3 brands before this one and after 3-4 years of switching my doctor gave me this and it along with counseling helped me to learn to cope with life in a healthy way. My mother takes the same brand and it works for both of us better than any other brand. I keep suggesting it to my sister since I think depression could be hereditary in our family. I would recommend this medicine to anyone. I did not feel like it took over my mood or personality, it only allowed me to try to function normally and get my life back on track in a positive way. 
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	11/3/2008 8:54:31 PM	Effexor has saved my life. Before I was put on this, I was a complete mess-- attempting sucicide frequently, self-injuring to the point of needing stitches regularly, starving myself, multiple hospitalizations. During my very last hospitalization over a year ago, I was taken off all of my meds (high doses of Abilify, Seroquel, Lamictal, Trazadone, Prozac, Lithium, and Inderal) and put on Effexor. I do not remember the early days on Effexor (that period is kind of blurry, and I was withdrawing from the other medications), but I have been on Effexor ever since. I have had one dose increase, but now at 225 mg, I am doing amazing. I realize the poteniality of life and the little wonders each person has inside. This medication has really helped keep the depression at bay and allowed me to re-enter my life.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/3/2008 5:24:05 PM	To me, this drug has been beyond helpful.  Before deciding to finally treat my depression and hopefully get rid of it once and for all, I tried Paxil with limited response.  In addition to my 150mg a day dose of Effexor XR, I do talk therapy once a week and try to exercise about three times a week.  I haven't noticed any adverse effects but I am diligent about taking it in the morning and also working out and not emotional overeating.  I totally understand that some people have had bad experiences with the drug; however, for me it does work and that is just something to keep in mind.  I actually feel like myself and am out enjoying things that I did before my depression took over.  
Depression	sun2moon, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	55-64	11/3/2008 4:32:10 PM	My pain mgt. dr. put me on these 3 months ago for my depression. I do suffer from major neuropathic pain also and take a handful of other major meds. Initially, it worked pretty well, cutting down on my night sweating and hot flashes also. Well, I ran out before I could refill(mail order), and my monthly appt. was just a week away so I decided to hold off til then, hoping to get a cheaper(generic) form.BAD DECISION! Now 5 days into cold turkey and I am totally exhausted! My husband has had to wake me up out of horrible, fitful nightmares 4/5 of those nights, some only to continue when I fall asleep again. Mornings~ my body is sore from my minds' activities; running from..., inability to scream, though vocal(he says), flailing of arms and legs, night sweats, and just total mind and body exhaustion from the night's events. I have just left a message with my GP, after finding these posts, to see if he can help me to detox from this OR modify my rx.  My pain mgt. doctor doesn't like prescribing antidepressants anyway, nor did he even remember doing so, although he has been doing so for 3 yrs. I feel I should've been warned about these sorts of things happening, tho I do know that cold turkey isn't usually the right way to get off any medication. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	11/3/2008 9:07:48 AM	At the beginning I was put on 75mg per day. I noticed a huge difference and then it taperd off. My doctor increased my dose to 75mg twice a day. After about 2 weeks of taking this I have had a non stop period and currently am taking birth control. This drug helped in the beginning but after a dosage change I am going back to the doctor for a med change!

When change of life started a few years ago my pms became worse. 5 times docs told me to start some kind of antidressant but my husband and my program did not view that as a solution. Once I finally started taking effexor, my anger toned down, i don't fight inside my head anymore. My sponsor told me I should have started taking this a few years ago, like the docs suggested. My marriage is better. I have gained 15 pounds so that is a problem but it's something I do have power over. I am grateful for effexor.

I got very I'll  vomiting Dizziness, headachs, I could not see or move, without getting sick. I called the drug co. myself and told them  what was going on, I asked how long these symptoms would last, they did not know. after many trips to the DR. and hospitals I was told that my so called panic attacks wern't panic they were mini siezures. any way I stayed off the meds and it was pure Hell for about 2 or 3 months. one thing that did help ease the dizziness ,vomiting ect... was the hospital gave me a script for motion sickness, I don't remember the name but you can ask your DR. I don't know what it feels like to be an addict of heroine but I watched someone very close to me come off of it and in my opinion effexor is an addiction just as bad, the only difference is your not aware of what your your about to put yourself through. I 'm off about 3 years now, I have my up and downs and during my downs I remember what effexor did to me and I continue Drug free. I wish you all well and I pray this gives you enough info for you to say no to effexor.

Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	10/31/2008 9:56:10 AM	I was an alcoholic and became suicidal. After a overdose of prescription drugs and a ER hospital stay I entered a Live-In rehab for a week. My Dr. prescribed EFFEXOR (150mg) daily. That was 4 yrs. ago, I don't drink anymore, seeming to be better but not making my life better. I tried Double the dose but I felt very angry towards friends who said the wrong thing or extreme Road Rage. I have went back to 150mg on  my own, but yet to see a Dr. about this. I like to be calm but I feel like life is passing me by at this point. I either want to take drug and feel happier or not at all. I'm open to try a much larger dose but I'm afraid I might go crazy! I am a 62 year old female, lost 2 jobs in 2 yrs., unemployed at the present, no boyfriend since 1998, and a Breast Cancer survivor of 7 yrs. I used to have anxiety issues to the extreme, but those went away after cancer treatment. I credit Effexor for &quot;evening me out&quot;, but I feel like I need something more. My original Dr. moved away last year and I don't think the one I have now is that good. But now, with no insurance and limited income, it's not easy to try out different things. I have gotten Effexor from Canada Drugs for 4 yrs. to be able to afford them, but now I'm going to the County for help on that this Nov. Hopefully, the new Dr. I'll see will be able to help me realize WHAT I need!

I feel worse now then when I started this crap. I have only been on this for about 10 months. I take 75mg a day. What I thought would be a tempory fix as turned into a nightmare. I am a week and a half into getting off this and it has been the worse experence in my life. Between the sweating, nausia, dieherria, and the brain surges in my head, I feel like I am looking thru a tunnel and if I move my head or eyes on have these brain surges that drive me nuts. I have not been able to sleep either. I can't imagine any doctor offering this to someone that is just having trouble with sleeping and being short tempered because of being premenopausal. I hope this doesn't go on for months like some of you have said. I am determined to get off of this completly. I have been 5 days without any at all. Very hard to drive and work but am doing the best that I can. 
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/29/2008 3:21:26 PM	I am quite happy It has helped me a lot especially in the first year I took them.

Panic Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	10/29/2008 5:24:23 AM	I took this for 5 years. For the first 4 years it worked well, then seemed to stop working. My doctor increased the dose but that didn't help.  I was experiencing withdrawal symptoms if i was even a couple hours late taking my dose, or if i took it on a full stomach.  My doctor said it is common for drugs to loose effectiveness over time like this as your body gets used to it, so we decided to try a different medication, but when it came time to ween off the trouble really started. It has been nine months and I am still trying to ween off. The side effects are terrible. It causes horrible nightmares, nausea, sweating, irritability, and much more. If I had known how difficult it would be to stop taking this medication I never would have started it.

I have been on it for 3 weeks and it is by far the most powerful anti-depressant I have ever tried. I am only on 75 mg. and I throw up every few days from it. One day I spent the entire day throwing up. I am so scared to even try to get off of it. The side effects are going to be HORRIBLE!!!! Please try another anti-depressant if you are thinking about going on this drug. I think it should be BANNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The medication works amazingly, but like a lot of other people have stated it's extremely hard on you if you stop or forget to take you medicine.  If she forgets a dose she suffers from severe headaches, dizziness/vertigo, irritability, sweating and sharp &quot;lightning like&quot; flashes going from her head to her toes.Please if you are attempting to stop taking this medication, do yourself a favor and speak to your doctor first.  I'm sure they'll be able to give you a good guideline about how to correctly stop taking it.  Otherwise prepare yourself for a tough journey if you're trying to go &quot;cold turkey&quot;.

Horrible feeling!I have insomnia, irritability, get agitated easily, feel severe vertigo, i could keep going.

I hate feeling like this, i don't even miss a dose, i just need to take it before noon or these extreme symptoms start and even after i take it, i still feel like crap for at least a few hours. I'm trying to find a way to get off this and find a comparible med. Still lookin. Good luck to all and PLEASE do your research before gettin on this. I wish i would have!

Although at first it seemed like it worked, I found that I did things and was becoming someone that I am not . After two years I had a terribly time coming off.I followed the doctors instructions and ended up having to break up the medication into much smaller doses for over a month to get off. Even still I had terrible withdrawal.
Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	10/27/2008 10:11:54 PM	Prior to effexor I was depressed almost my whole life. It was a chronic depression that just lingered. I tried alternative therapies, diet, wellbutrin, paxil, ect with no results. Effexor is the only thing that has helped. For the first year it was a little up and down but it eventually smoothed out and I feel completely normal now. I do agree going off the medicine is difficult and am not sure if I will ever try. If I miss a dose, sometimes I feel terrible the next day (like a super hangover). Nothing is perfect, but so far this has worked the best for me.

I used to for Anxiety attacks and depression.At first it really helped me, then I got these weird brain &quot;zaps&quot; This medication was horrible to quit taking.  It took took almost six months to quit completely.   I would get panic attacks, anxiety and have weird vivid dreams.  Please consult your doctor before taking this medication.   Several other people I know had the same problems with this medication.  I stayed on it so long because at that point in my life I was just trying to function at work and in life.     Please read all reviews and precautions about this medication.  
Depression	Jules, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	10/25/2008 11:24:46 AM	I was prescribed an antidepressant called 'dothep' after my 1st baby was about 3mths old and I nearly shook her. They did NOTHING I was just really sad, and sleepy (not good with a new baby)I tried all sorts of things to make me feel a bit better, including exercise, acupuncture, herbal mixtures, smoking, counseling.  I think that Effexor was new on the market at the time and my Doc asked if I would like to give it a try which was about 10 years ago when my 1st child was nearly two, I couldn't believe the difference. I FINALLY felt 'alive' again, unfortunately when I fell pregnant with my 2nd one in 1998 the Doc took me off and put me on some other drug. I had terrible neck pain and low blood pressure - I even gave up smoking I felt so ill. When she was born I went straight back on the Effexor and have been on them ever since. In 2002 I had got myself down to 37.2mg and doing alot of exercise I never felt any withdrawal side effects. I then hit a 'BIG WALL' in my life and had to get the dose put back up, but then baby #3 decided to come along, Doc said stay on my Effexor since I'd been on it for so long - he didn't like my side effects from last pregnancy either.I am currently on 150mg which I take every morning. If I don't take it by 1pm my fingertips go all tingly and funny and I soon remember, the longest that I have gone without is three days and I didn't know that I had forgotten them. Over the years my doses have varied, alot has to do with what's happening in my life.I have been on these with drinking alcohol, and that was not too good, I now just have them every day and I find that even though life's little tests can make me feel like it is all up and down, I know that the Effexor is keeping me on an even keel and I believe that I am staying pretty level in my day to day feelings, and not going to extremes, as I had previously experienced.I hope this review helps someone else, as I believe that you can't just 'solve' depression/anxiety in a few months.
Depression	noozdude, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	10/25/2008 11:23:36 AM	I take it for depression. My wife notices improvement in me, but I don't really notice. I'm supposed to take it daily but I usually take it 3-4 times a week. The reason I don't take it daily is because I notice when I take it, I tend to involuntarily clench my jaw for some reason. That side effect is more of an annoyance that can lead to soreness in my jaw muscle.

My family, friends, co-workers have all commented on how less stressed and happy I am.  Initial upset stomach subsided quickly, been taking for 3 months and have experienced a truly positive life change.  I am able to cope with stress better, moodes have evened out.  I find enjoyment in so many areas of my life that I had always tended to put a negative spin on....Feeling positive and upbeat,it's amazing!  Have gained a little weight, but I am hoping this is too much social eating, as I havn't enjoyed being out in a long time!

I walked around in a haze, had no sense of balance, did nothing but sleep, had no appetite, ruminating and worsening thoughts of dying or death.  If you can avoid it, don't take this one.  Try celexa instead.
Depression	DEE DEE, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	3	3	2	Female	45-54	10/22/2008 7:24:58 PM	I have been on Effexor for approx 5 years. It worked well for the 1st 2yrs. Then it seems like it works on and off. Mood is normal for awhile, then the worst depression will set in. The depression lows are 2-3 times a year and for no apparent reason. I am not missing doses. I have often wondered if the pharmacy is not putting the correct amount of effexor in the capsules. I have no sex drive anymore and am also constipated. My doctor suggested cutting my 150mg down to 75mg. That only lasted about a week until I went back to the 150mg. I can't afford to taper down as I can not function properly at work. This must be what it is like to be addicted to crack...NO WAY OUT!

The 2nd-4th were the best days I've had IN YEARS!!! It was spectacular! Unfournatly, it didn't stay that was even after taking 150mg in the am and 75 in the pm. I was just feeling the same as before and now on Wellbutrin. That also seems the same as effexor now.

However, she has lost feelings for loved ones, stating that she has no feeling for us. She also suffers from several of the negative side effects (headaches, bladder problems, chills/hot flashes, muscular twitching, rash, and anxiety). Due to the influence of this drug she refuses to listen to my sugestion that she see her Doctor about trying a different medication. I strongly do not recommend this drug.

It helped with the migraines, however, I gained 30 lbs in 6 months! So I asked my doc to wean me off. I am on my 3rd week of weaning off. I was only taking 75 mlg to begin with and he put me on 37.5 mlg. 1st week wasn't bad, but last week was from hell! I was all loopy, couldn't focus, had vertigo, and was having hot flashes. Now I am still having vertigo problems but not as bad. The hot flashes are worse than ever (and it's currently 50 degrees outside). I tell you what, had I known this would happen if I ever decided to go off this med, I wouldn've never taken it. It's awful! If you're not on this drug now - don't take it!!!
Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	10/20/2008 2:12:58 PM	To those saying Effexor should be removed from the market, let's be fair - different meds work in different ways for different people. It is your (along with your doctor's) responsibility to research new medications before starting to put them into your body. My doctor warned me about the side effects and let me make the decision to try Effexor to determine if the benefits outweigh the detriments. I have experienced increased sweating (I knew that to be a possible side effect) as well as the withdrawal symptoms many have described (&quot;electrical storm in the head&quot;, dizziness, etc.) but luckily, I knew what to expect and the effects were manageable. It is absolutely IMPERATIVE that you discuss ramping the dosage up/down when you start/stop Effexor XR. If your health care provider does not mention the possible withdrawal symptoms associated with missing a dosage or stopping Effexor &quot;cold turkey&quot;, they do not know enough about this medication to be prescribing it. If this medication does not work for you (give it 6-10 weeks for full effect), taper the dosage and get off - try something else. I only remain on Effexor because it works to manage my depression. As common sense would indicate, do not stay on this medication if the benefits do not outweigh the side effects. The withdrawal symptoms will be worse than any of the side effects you experience on Effexor, but they ARE temporary (so far as we know) and will go away after ~ one week. I have been on and off different dosages for years and can tell you that it's not a drug to put in your body unless you are aware of and understand the potential undesired effects.

However, try going off this.  The neurological symptoms in my brain are horrible; swishing sounds, vertigo, headache pain, ringing in ears.

It did help the night sweats, not so much during the day tho.  I was not depressed when I began taking it, but was very stressed due to job, adult children moving away, etc. and I did notice I could cope with those situations better. I had alot more patience too, but had sexual side effects (unable to achieve orgasms).  After being on it for 6 months I decided I didn't like my moods being controlled and the expense.After just 3 days off,I was so dizzy and nauseated and cried all day one day.It made me angry at my Dr for not telling me the side effects &amp; withdrawals.  He now has me on 37.5 dosage for 10 days then one every other day.  Hopefully I will get along better with that.  Definitely do not quit &quot;cold turkey&quot;!

All of my symptoms have disappeared....I am able to sleep all night and fall asleep with no problem. I have had no pain, no stiffness at all. So far it has been a lifesaver and I am able to get up and reasonable enjoy my day.  The down side is it does make me feel alittle dizzy and sick when I take it so I'm taking it at 7:30pm and just laying down for the night.  I do feel a little &quot;funny&quot; when I wake up in the morning but nothing realy bad at all.  I am very pleased with this so far, even though I am very new to it.  The things everyone is saying about how hard it is to get off really concerns me ofcourse.  I am just going to take one day at a time and see how it goes. Good luck everyone!Amanda

After going through and reading all of the comments for &quot;Change of Life&quot; treatment I am going home and throwing this drug away.  The negatives far outweigh the positives!

I was only taking 75mg....so My Dr just changed me to 37.5mg.... My Sister in Laws Therapist said she never puts anyone on this drug.....it is the HARDEST medication to wean off of......  I tried weaning off of it over the Holidays last year and ended up with Seratonin Syndrome... I want completely off this medication....but I'm not sure I can get off......Right now I feel as if someone is squeezing my head and it's about to explode...I have elevated blood pressure since being on this medication.......

Has really helped with the depression but if I forget to take it one day, the symptoms are AWFUL! I feel like a prisoner to the drug because forgetting to take it feels worse than a hangover. Although it has helped tremendously, I am looking forward to being weaned off of it (and scared too). Have read too many scary comments about dependency to the drug.

Initially, I was put on Effexor XR for horrible hot flashes occurring both day and night and disrupting my entire life. Effexor XR is wonderful for treating COL and restoring one's sense of well being BUT the problem occurs when you attempt to wean yourself from the medication. Make sure you do this at a time when little is required of you and you have time to rest up and understand that this medication does indeed carry significant withdrawal symptoms.  All or most of them have been covered in this section from other users of Effexor.Wonderful drug for symptoms of menopause just be careful and follow your Dr.'s instructions when you do decide to stop this medication.

My DR switched me to the non xr so I could get the generic. Now Im down to 50mg twice a day. I HATE THIS DRUG! Could someone PLEASE email me and go more into detail about what this &quot;Brain Shock&quot; feeling is? Maybe that is what Im feeling and I need to tell my DR. My head feels like someone is grabbing it and squeezing off and on. Plus my vision is weird and I feel dizzy all the time. rob.hines@insightbb.com

I have to say, when it comes to the migraines, it has done wonders. I only get slight headaches and a migraine here and there. HOWEVER, despite exercise and eating healthy asI was before I starting taking this drug, I have gained 30+ pounds in just 6 short months. NOT FUN. I am currently being weaned off. Not looking forward to any withdrawal symptoms, but it's worth it if I can lose this weight!

Why did my doctor not tell me about this. i only took this drug for one week and i feel worse now than i have ever felt in my entire life, i can't even tell if i am awake or just haeving another nightmare. if i ever get back to normal i will go through the change of life without the assistance of druges.

I have the same &quot;electric shocks&quot; by afternoon if I miss my usual morning dose.  I have not tried to stop taking the medication but I read somewhere that the easiest way is to take it REALLY SLOWLY.  Open up the capsule and take out 1 grain the first day.  Each day take out one more grain than the day before, until you are completely weaned.  I am not ready to stop taking it yet, but when I do, I hope that method works!

Other	migraine1,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		10/6/2008 11:34:20 AM	never take this drug. your body will become dependent on it and the withdrawl includes brain  zaps and brain shocks. i took it to calm down my migraines ,it  was prescribed by another doctor instead of my regular neurologist. i had to go back to the neurologists office because i thought i was having seizures. i gained sixy lbs that ive been fighting to loose. its a miserable drug with no redeeming qualities. and, it didnt help the condition.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	10/6/2008 4:24:55 AM	This drug was the absolute worst medication I have ever been prescribed, and due to the fact that I have lupus, I've been prescribed plenty over the years. If I had a flare up, and slept for too long, therefore not taking my pill at the exact time every day, I had horrible mood swings that became progressively more violent, and I could not control them, even knowing that I was being outrageous. I had terrible headaches that rendered me useless at times. I felt suicidal, and it became increasingly worse. I became paranoid, and developed sleeping problems. Trying to come off of this dangerous drug was an equally terrifying experience. I was told that I couldn't start a different drug in the same &quot;category&quot; because of what these drugs-pain relieving antidepressants-are made of. And I just had to fight my way through it, tapering off from 300 mgs. daily. Luckily, a doctor prescribed depakote, and that has helped. 3 people in my family have been prescribed effexor at varying dosages through the years, from 37.5 mgs, to my 300 mgs., and not a single one of them has had a good thing to say about the experience. I would strongly recommend, if someone's dr prescribes them effexor, say NO and find a new dr.

Specifically if I miss a dose I go through the WORST withdrawals.  I get nauseous, dizzy, sweaty, nervous.  It is torture.  I want to get off of it but I can`t.  Beware before you start this drug.  It works but it is hell to get off of.  I`ve been on it for 3.5 years.
Other	roxanne9, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	10/5/2008 4:16:10 PM	I have been on this medication for about 3 months now for irritability and anger issues. I has worked wonders for me! Not only do I feel less irritable and angry all the time, I also have a boost of energy and have lost weight. My husband and kids are sooo happy! I have had no side effects other than vivid dreams. It is a bit pricey, but my mental well being is worth it. 
Depression	bravodingo, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male	25-34	10/5/2008 4:33:23 AM	I've been taking Effexor XR (75mg) for about 3-4 months now, and while I definitely noticed a change in my attitude (not nearly as many mood swings, etc.), the side effects were rough.  I often experienced nightmares, sleeplessness borderlining on insomnia, and inability to achieve orgasm.  In addition to this, I do NOT like the idea of possibly having to increase my dosage, making me even more dependant on a drug that I personally do not believe was necessary in the first place.  I have missed doses in the past, and experience even worse side-effects, i.e. these 'electric shocks' that everyone seems to mention, strong mood swings, and even worse cases of insomnia.  Noting this only helps reinforce my decision to stop taking this medication, as the side effects will eventually cease...the only question being - how long?  I last took this medication 48 hours ago, and the electric shock feeling is the worst of the bunch.  
Depression	SwetDreamsPance, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	13-18	10/4/2008 7:11:52 PM	Although Effexor worked wonders for me for years, after I moved out I was cut from my parents' insurance plan and could no longer afford treatment--and the withdrawal was insane. I was dizzy, had anxiety attacks, cried for no reason, was angry at everything, or verged on manic. These changes in mood were rapid and unexplainable...also felt hungry but threw up most everything I ate. I was tired and weak all the time and had disturbingly vivid dreams...it was enough to keep me from trying it again once I got insurance through my job. I dont want to be on it forever, but stopping is out of the question--the cons outweigh the pros with this med, I think. 
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	10/4/2008 1:49:07 PM	I started this a week ago. I haven't slept much all week. It's making my insomnia worse. My head feels numb and I've had a headache all week. I feel sick all the time and can't eat much. I've lost about 5lbs already. I get really shaky and my legs will involuntarily shake. I feel kind of numb.. I don't feel like me. But I'm not sad or mad much anymore.
Depression	kchilds, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	10/3/2008 7:22:39 PM	FOR THOSE WHO STOPPED TAKING EFFEXOR XR:  I have now been off this medication for 4+ weeks.  I promised to keep up to date what my withdrawal symptoms were and how long they lasted.  ALL WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS ARE GONE!!!  It was THE MOST difficult thing I had ever gone through, but now I am ME again!!  I just want those suffering to know that there IS an end!!!!!  I went through a few weeks so sick to my stomach.  The body aches, sweating, twitching and SEVERE Muscle spasms lasted for about 4 weeks.  The muscle spasms STARTED after about two weeks of being off medication.  That was actually the worst of all.  I was taking Clonazapam to help with that, which it did.  Again, I just need for people to know that all the terrible withdrawal symptoms will end.  Don't start taking them again just because you can't take it.  TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR about what you can do and take to ease these symptoms.  I can never say how happy I am to finally be off Effexor XR.....  FOREVER!  I wish everyone on here the best, and hope that the information provided might help those looking for answers.Good luck to all!K. Childs
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		35-44	10/3/2008 4:19:35 PM	It is a wonderful medication.  I have been on it for 5 years.  I have gone off of it before when I was pregnant and it was relatively easy...just make sure to wean yourself.  Don;t stop suddenly... the withdrawl is NASTY... vivid dreams and night sweats...moodiness.  just to name a few

Sickening headaches, nausea, insomnia etc. Now 6 months later, I have vivid dreams,and spasms in my limbs but nothing serious at all. I have previously taken valpro, lovan and Mirtazon. Effexor is the only medication that has helped me function as a normal happy person. I would love to be able to go off them, but as another person commented, it's better than the alternative.

My insurance provider HMO though county health care.  My coverage has been suspended and I cannot afford my medicine and I will be taking my last dose today about 9am.  After that I don't know what I will do.  I know your not supposed to stop taking it abruptly. I have ran out before and 2 two days later, my lips were numb, my brain was pausing, and I felt like I was outside of myself. I may only live another couple of days, because it can be fatal to just stop taking it. My insurance is gone and I do not have 180.00 to 225.00 dollars to have it refilled.  Before County cancelled my coverage, my perscriptions were only $1.00.  Anybody have any ideas as to what I can do about the Dr. who also let me go, (the one that gave me the scrip)who said she can't help me since my coverage was cancelled.  It sure seems like she would be responsible to at least try to contact the County Health Dept. to explain to them that she put me on meds that I JUST CANNOT STOP TAKING WITHOUT BECOMING A FATALITY. i MEAN DOES IT SEEM LIKE SHE WOULD BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT MY LIFE ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE PHONE CALL, JUST TO COVER MY PERSCRIPTIONS OR EXTEND MY COVERAGE UNTIL SHE CAN WEEN ME OFF EFFEREX XR oral?
Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	10/3/2008 1:19:43 AM	I've been taking it for about 5 years and it has really worked for me.  My Dr. increased my dosage to 300mg last year and that has kept me from sleeping well but overall this drug has been a life saver for me.  The side effects of missing a dose are pretty harsh though.  Dizziness, electric sensations by afternoon if I forget to take it in the morning.  I think it may be contributing to mild claustrophobia that I've just recently developed - getting hot, woozy, anxious on long plane rides.

The first try was unsuccessful, obviously. The withdrawl symptoms were so overwhelming, I had to get back on the medication, after being slowly weaned off over a five week period. I gave in after being off for one month.  Now I'm trying again, was taking 300 mgs a day. Down to 150 and don't feel much, good or bad. Wish I had know 5 years ago what Iknow now!!

The dose has had to be increased 4 times in five years. My only complaint is if you ever have to come off of this drug for any reason, it is horrid. The withdrawl symptoms are unbearable. I tried to come off of them when I was pregnant and couldn't. Therefore I could not breast feed.

I have tried probably 6 or 7 other antidepressants and not one made me feel as good about life and energy to do things again than Effexor. I have never tried to stop taking the medication ... but after about two days without it i have gotten dizzy, tingly feeling in my fingers, light headed, and the electric shock feeling in my head and body. It's not soo bad, but it is uncomfortable. So take it when your doctor tells you to!

I have been on celexa, prozac weekly, and zyprexa. The only thing I'm not a fan of is if I run out, and can't get more for a few days, I do experience the withdrawl symptoms (vertigo, numbness, being frazzled easily, and non-stop talking..I don't know if the last 2 are listed, but that's what everyone tell me when I don't take it). I have been on this medication for almost 2 years now. It is the best thing ever.

I am also on Inderal (80 mg) for same condition. My b.p. is perfect, no hot flashes( but also on Ortho Low) both meds work well for condition, but want to get off of Effexor cause of cost. Have had disturbing dreams and cry easily,when I miss a day. Have leg restlessness, but otherwise like my improved outlook and mood, along with no tremors. Worried about withdrawal.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	9/30/2008 3:08:01 PM	Being ON Effexor wasn't so bad.  I had slight improvement in depression.  Had to go off of it because I wanted to get pregnant.  There are no words to describe the horrors of withdrawal.  It is horrendous.  I felt like I had the worst flu imaginable for 6 weeks.  And I went off of it very slowly for the 4 weeks prior to that.  I was vomiting, had vertigo, fever, exhausted, achy, literally unable to move a muscle without serious pain.  What saved me was that I got hold of a few non XR tablets of Effexor and I would take a very small bite (probably 5 mgs?) of it when I felt horrible.  That relieved my withdrawal for a few hours usually.  They don't make non XR anymore as far as I know but I would also call up the toll free Effexor line and scream at them whenever possible.  I would suggest that the company make the non-XR for this reason.

This med was very effective in managing my depression symptoms, but it raised my blood pressure and heart rate off the charts.  I had to switch to a combination of Lexapro and Welbutrin, and haven taken them for 2 years. While on these meds, I have gained 35 lbs. and my depression isn't nearly as well managed.  If I had a choice, I would go back to Effexor.

Depression	K in Santa Cruz Mtns, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	3	3	1	Female	35-44	9/29/2008 1:57:34 AM	Ever since taking this medication, my jaw has been clamped down tight and I have experienced several of the side effects (severe headache, inability to achieve orgasm, sweating for no reason, etc.).  My doctor immediately ordered I stop taking this drug, but the withdrawal was AWFUL.  I was openly weeping in front of my small children, felt like my head was in a fog, and extremely nauseaus.  Am working with my doctor to gradually step off this medication.  I would strongly caution against the use of it.  I am at 75mg daily, stepping down to 37.5 every other day.

My brain has felt like it has been in a fog the entire time. I get headaches, nausea, loss of appetite, extremely blurry vision and I just feel numb. However, knowing I will be off this in 3 weeks gives me hope. I was prescribed effexor for depression and GAD. I think effexor should only be prescribed for severe cases. The side effects have been awful and your body goes into withdrawal even if you're late. I would say if your symptoms are not life-threatening (yourself or others)try something else!

My doctor prescibed EffexorXr and the effects were wonderful. I don't like the idea of having to take a drug everyday for the rest of my life,  but the alternative is worse.

It has helped so much and gave me some of my life back.  My pain is not as intense and my legs do not feel like lead weights anymore.  It also has lifted some of the fatique that I have had for years.  At present , I do not have any side effects.

Depression	lomi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	9/27/2008 2:47:53 AM	I've had a horrible experience with Effexor! This drug is not worth it!!!  I am in the process of quitting Effexor after about 1 year. While it did help at first with my depression and anxiety the withdrawal process is horrible! I did not receive any information about addiction/withdrawal from my doctor, pharmacist or the medication guide. According to the Effexor website this drug is not addictive - totally false! When I talked to my doctor about the lightheadedness I experienced each day as I would get close to the time to take the pills, she just said &quot;oh that's odd you are so sensitive to it&quot; and recommended that I take the pills at a different time. I also experienced extreme sleepiness daily. After slowly cutting down my dose over the last month I have now been off Effexor for 3 days. I am ok as long as I don't move my head or eyes which is impossible. I have a feeling somewhere between sea-sickness and electric shocks running through my brain. Combined with muscle aches and tension, nausea, insomnia and spontaneous crying I am not functional at this point. A nurse at my health provider told me today to expect these withdrawal symptoms to last at least one week. This experience has more than undone any good that Effexor has done for me. I am glad that the drug has helped some people, but i feel that it should be taken off the market. I'm afraid that what I'm experiencing now may be causing some damage to my brain that will come back to haunt me later. Although i have been diagnosed as dysthymic with several episodes of major depression since childhood, I am through with anti-depressants and all prescription drugs for now. My doctor had recommended that I try Cymbalta after getting off Effexor, but it reportedly also has strong withdrawal symptoms for many people. I don't want to go through this again. Don't risk your mental and physical health with Effexor!
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	9/27/2008 1:15:06 AM	Good and bad experiences with Effexor. I was on this drug for about 2 yrs. I was on 75mg for one year and 150 the 2nd. It immediately helped with the depression/anxiety. It did affect my sleep, made me able to sleep an abnormal amount. Also, after waking I could wave my hand in front of my face and experience tracers, sometimes more intense than other times. One summer I went home from college and ran out of meds, withdrawal symptoms were intense!  Intense restlessness, weird vision, odd dizziness, mood swings, etc.  Mostly made my head feel strangely terrible and unlike it ever had before.  Resumed meds and returned to normal.  Now, I have been coming off the meds and have just fully come off them.  Withdrawal symptoms have been weird feeling in head, intense moods, lots of crying at one point, and now have been experiencing some stabbing pains in my torso that I am pretty sure have to do with the changes in meds. BASICALLY, this med can help but coming off is difficult and will make you experience things you never have before. Every person experiences it differently and lucky for me I think my case was not too bad.  Doctors should be educating their patients more thoroughly about this drug and it's effects.  This is a drug for mental conditions, and treating such a thing should not be treated lightly.  These are our lives we are dealing with.  Patients have the right to know more about what we are taking.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Pam, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	9/26/2008 1:56:37 AM	generalized anxiety, fibromyalgia was on 37.5 mg for 2 yrs. went off, comin off ain't too wonderful even at that dose, although i only had the head skipping thing, or the feeling I was having a stroke.  Although I've never had one so I'm not really sure how that feels.  Very beneficial for chronic pain, dep, and anxiety. now on 225mg after going through a divorce, went back on. do experience a sweat issue, and restless legs sometimes.  When i miss one dose i know it.  That feeling comes like my head is skipping in and out of reality, very annoying. last time this went on bout 2 wks at 37.5, so i thinkin lots of wheenin to get off this crap. I like the ladies ideal of busting the capsules, may help more severe sufferers.But the med does kick butt, feel my old self again, i felt ok for bout a year last time i went off then slowly crept back up with the symptoms.  Added stress.  Good luck, o by the way no side effects going on by week 3 started to feel betterno nightmares, or headaches for me i am a 35 yr old female.128 lbs.  no issue with gaining wt either.but if i miss a dose i can sleep forever, feel very lax.

It made me too tired,worked my dose down to 75mg a day and it was just right I gained my life back and can not see myself living without it. I have tried but it was not the same and therefore,I recomend it to all of you out there who are in need for a relief. Let me put it this way, use it right and you'll never have to suffer again with your signs and symtomsI even used it when i was 4 months pregnant and my son came out just fine......I work in the mental health field and it is a medication highly recomended for it's use I take my dose in the evenings, I sleep wellno other side effects other than a decreased apetite...Oh!!! be carefull do not stop taking it suddenlly you wouldn't like the side effects &quot;dizziness, light headed and stomach cramps &quot;if you wish to stop it, talk with your doctor and titrate slowly to avoid any discomfortGood Luck,Arizona

I am on 300 mg daily and I am scared to even try to get off, nor do I want to. It has saved my life. I was going through a divorce and I also have an eating disorder... I got down to 80 lbs... granted I am now weighing 110 lbs... normal wight for me - but wanna know if the weight gain subsides or stops after long periods of use. This drug has helped me so much in life that thought of laying it down terrifies me. However, like I have read - COMING OFF THIS DRUG is a nightmare... I havent experienced all the symptoms everyone else has such as twitches bc I am frantic and get right back on it... but my biggest thing is tingling in my face and moodiness. I always get it back into my system b4 it progresses.

I have missed taking the medication before and even tried to ween myself off of it myself and the side effects were so horrible, and the comments about getting weened off of it sounds awful too. I wish the doctors would tell you before you took it. For anyone who has been weened off, why did you get off the medication and how are you feeling now? I am very apprehensive.

I can't say I've had relief, surely not total relief, from the depression.  Sometimes I wonder if this latest med is why my throat consistently feels like it's bleeding (didn't have that before I started taking Effexor) but the dr. doesn't think so.  Also have bp issues - take Toprol XL for that; not sure if the two work together well.

When both of your parents died of aneurysms the last thing you want to feel is like your head is about to explode.  Stopped taking the drug and stopped getting the headaches.

You will have a rough time for a little while.  But, YOU WILL GET THROUGH IT!!!!!  I PROMISE!  I have been trying to keep my posts up to date on when certain things are happening as well as how long they last in the hopes of helping others out there like YOU!  Talk to your doctor about maybe something for anxiety to help with some of your symptoms.  The stomach issues lasted less than a week.  Take Pepto Bismo or something like that to help ease that part.  I was just given Clonazapam, which has helped a lot with my twitching and muscle spasms.  It also helped me to actually get some sleep.  We are all here for you, OK?  If you have any other questions, ask it here and i will keep checking back.Please know... This will not last forever.  OK??????KChilds

Let me first say: It DOES work. My depression and especially my anxiety have been non-existent while taking. However, the withdrawal symptoms are THE WORSE EVER. Even if I was late taking a dose (I usually take in the morning) by the afternoon, I would be nauseus, BRAIN ZAPS, headache, and very weak. When I take my meds, it goes away. I hate what this has done to me. I think this drug really needs to be taken off the market. It may work for depression and anxiety but the price you pay is not worth it. There are  other ways to deal with depression and others meds that don't cause such horrible side effects. I've gained 30lbs in 8 mos. I just talked to my DR. 2 days ago and he's starting me on a plan to start weaning off. I am so scared because I've read the horror withdrawal stories. But I am so desperate to get off this drug, that I'm willing to deal with the symptoms. If you are thinking about taking this drug: DON'T DO IT!!!
Depression	kchilds, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	9/20/2008 2:47:51 PM	I am going to try and keep up with posting my withdrawal symptoms and how long they are lasting.  I hope this will be useful for others going through that hell.  Just returned from the doctor about my SEVERE muscle spasms.  I MEAN SEVERE!!!!  They started two days ago.  You can't sleep.  It HURTS!!!!!  :/  He put me on Clonazapam to ease that and said I may have to endure another week of this.  The headaches are going away.  I am no longer sick to my stomach all the time.  Sweating has eased up a lot.  AllI can say is, if you are trying to stop taking this medication, you will need to endure some awful side effects.  DO NOT GIVE IN and start taking them again.  It will be hard, but it will end.I hope and pray someone will find some confort with this information.  Again, you are not alone and it WILL go away.  I will post again once I am ME again.  I just wish this information was available when I first tried to get off it!!!!Good luck to everyone!!!!

Hard to say with the other meds I have to take, but it has most likely been very helpful in stabilizing my anxiety somewhat, as well as my depression.  Hate it, though--Withdrawal symptoms begin if I take one dose even a few hours later than usual: shaking, twitching, skin feels like it's crawling, headaches...I want to stop taking this as soon as possible, but getting off it, even with my psychiatrist's help, isn't going to be nice.

If you just accept it and begin to accept the feeling and get back into the grove of things you find it's not so bad...eventually the &quot;pink cloud&quot; feeling fades away but you are yourself much of the time now and have the energy to thrive again.

Depression	kchilds, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	9/17/2008 10:27:22 AM	First, I wish that people would state if they are male or female while posting these comments.  I think the side effects are different in males and females. Effexor XR DID help with my depression and anxiety, BUT, I did GAIN WEIGHT!!!  I went from 120 pounds to almost 160 in a very short time frame.  THAT made me more depressed.  I was not eating a lot.  So while the medication did help make me feel better and ease my anxiety attacks, I did suffer from weight gain and dry mouth.  Due to losing my job, no insurance and no money, I have been OFF Effexor XR for 10 days now.  THIS IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER FELT IN MY LIFE!!!!.  My Doctor DID NOT tell me about the side effects of coming off Effxor XR.  I have been throwing up constantly, dizzy all the time, flu like symptoms, can't sleep, severe body aches.........  It is amazing how horrible the withdrawal symptoms are.  I just want others to know that they are NOT CRAZY and are NOT ALONE.  I have been trying to find out how long this will last to no avail.  I feel suicidal because I do not know what to do to ease these symptoms, but I WILL NEVER GO BACK to Effexor XR....EVER!!!!!  DO NOT TAKE unless you intend to be on it for a LONG time and understand all possible side effects.

Late dose or missed dose'end of the world'.Never felt such a terrible side effects.I get nausea,dizziness,pounding head,light headed,buzzing head oh God terrible feeling.I have even put on 5kg weight and feel tired and sleepy most of the time. Just tried to come off it but it wouldn't let me,even had to call the Ambulance to go to hospital and spent a night there due to the symptomsI experienced.I had to go back on it.Slowly reduced to 37.5 mg then now I open up the capsule and divide them further more to around 18 mg because I am pregnant and am so concerned to what effect it can have on unborn. I wish I wean off it and wish there was some help availabe to quickly come off it. Doctors should explain more on side effects and symptomps when starting and weaning off and should be mentioned on the packs as well.

God Bless anyone who can tolerate the side effects.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Deb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	9/16/2008 3:07:36 PM	Works well to manage my anxiety.  Helps with depression as well.  Weight gain might be a side effect and it is difficult if you miss a day - you feel like you have the flu.  Some sleepiness during the day as well; fatigue.  For the most part, it works very well for me.

Depression	 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female		9/16/2008 10:50:16 AM	I have been taking this medication for about 3 years now. It works well with the depression. It made me a different person. However, it did cause weight gain; about 25 pounds I put on. Also it does make me sweat more than normal. Don't ever forget to take a pill because you will experience the worst feeling in the world. I want to wean myself off of this medication but I am to terrified of its side effects. I do not recommend this medication to someone who isn't looking to be on an anti depressant for awhile.

Depression	cancam, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/12/2008 3:01:30 PM	I have been on several medications for depression since the birth of my first son in 2003.  (i.e.  lexapro, celexa, zoloft, and cymbalta).  I have found that effexor has the been the most effective at treating my mood swings, irritability, and sadness.  Cymbalta was by far the worst thing i have ever taken, it seemed to intensify the emotions I was having.  But, effexor has worked wonders for me.  The only side effect that I have experienced is that if I don't remember to take the pill at the same time daily, I wind up with dizziness.

I cannot watch ads for lyrica-I thought this would be my answer for my fibromaylgia, and it kick my butt. It set me back badly, from 1 pill. I have been doing wonderful with effexor xr 150mg

I have found this drug worked well for me (75mg dose) with the hot flashes and I lost almost 25lbs in a month - loved that - I didn't experience any of the other side effects listed.  I did go off of it for a couple of months cold turkey (due to cost)and I did not suffer the side effects most people are talking about except for the &quot;brain zaps&quot; which at the time didn't realize was from going off the med's until reading that on here.  But the hot flashes are back and and going back on med's.
Depression	bankermom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	9/11/2008 1:34:32 PM	I have been on Effexor XR 75 mg for about 2 years. Finally decided to wean off by taking the 1/2 dose (37 mg) for 3 weeks. Still had horrible withdrawal symptoms after stopping that for only a day and a half: dizziness, nausea, headache, buzzing in head, diarrhea. My husband had the idea to open the capsule and divide up the medicine even further, so it's an even more gradual modification than stopping the 37 mg. Just sprinkle it on applesauce, but don't crunch or chew. I've been on approx. 25 mg. for about 5 days now. Getting ready to lower that even more. The side effects are not nearly as bad. Still get a bit of headache, dizziness, and nausea after about 12 hours, but it's much more tolerable. I'm hoping this will be an easier way to stop completely. I'll know more in another week or so. Good luck to everyone.

I eventually found that the med was very useful for me and am now back on a lower dosage in combination with prozac and psychotherapy.  Don't be intimidated by all of the comments you read- everyone is different.  Just be open &amp; persistent with your dr. Unfortunately with antidepressants, sometimes it takes some experimenting but don't give up b/c when you find the right one, it is simply amazing how your life will change!!! Good luck!
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/8/2008 5:27:03 PM	I guess the fact that a drug doesn't work on some individuals doesn't make it a BAD or DANGEROUS drug then, when it DOES help or work on some others. I've read up the reviews on most antidepressants &amp; can see that almost everyone experiences side-effects &amp; withdrawal symptoms - some none, some mild, &amp; others severe. They say &quot;No pain no gain.&quot;Doctors aren't know-all, so it's best if one does some research on their own &amp; not rely fully on their doctor for info. One has to weigh the pros. &amp; cons. of taking a drug themselves, not getting discouraged by others' unpleasant experiences. For example, before taking Effexor, I was sad 24/7. I would curl up in bed whole day, re-playing hurtful &amp; unpleasant memories from past,&amp; getting so worked up over them (angry/sad) all over again. I kept thinking of all sorts of sad things &amp; just cried &amp; cried. I wanted my husband to stay with me all the time; I was so demanding. I didn't want to go out or do anything. My world was so dark &amp; gloomy. I even got suicidal, thinking of quick &amp; painless ways to die. Everything seemed hopeless, like I was never going to get better, ever. I just wanted to die. Or I believed I was seriously going insane. Now, although Effexor mostly makes me so drowsy &amp; fatigued &amp; causes some other inconveniences, I'd rather suffer from these for a while than go back to the miserable &amp; horrifying state I was in, which was a whole lot more difficult for others to deal with.One last thing, if you can afford it, try counseling by a psychologist. It sped up my recovery by miles.

I am now off Elavil cut back on xanax and can get off nexium.  I cannot get off codeine.  I have extreme pain .  I want to try it again because it was wonderful to feel whole again.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/3/2008 7:50:26 PM	Been on this med. for more than 2 years now. It's true as some said that doctors don't seem very informed about the full scope of side-effects of this drug, or they hesitate to tell because they're afraid to scare off the patients.:) My doctor only told me about having dry mouth &amp; sweating more, but you probably agree that those are the least of concerns. I did look up more on all possible side-effects on the net; was shocked at how bad they can be, but since the med. did help me feel better mentally &amp; emotionally (coupled with psychotherapy), I didn't bother trying to see how I'd do on other drugs. Doctor increased my dose slowly,&amp; I experienced almost all the side-effects, particularly extreme drowsiness &amp; fatigue. Now my dose is very slowly being reduced; had some mild withdrawal symptoms for about 10 days, &amp; feeling so much better (less sleepy &amp; tired) afterwards. Now on 112.5mg &amp; things seem to be going pretty well. Good med. in general for me. Personally, I don't mind the withdrawal symptoms, though severe, as long as I can get rid of depression, which is a more serious concern to me &amp; debilitate me more in all sense than any side-effects/ withdrawal symptoms, which are mainly physical.

The effect is dimenishing.  I now find myself withdrawing from extended family and friends.  I spoke with my Dr. this week and told him that I would like to get off of it and he told me to take it very slow because of terrible withdrawl symptoms.  I feel like that should have been something that I was made aware of before taking this.

Depression		5	5	1			8/31/2008 1:36:52 AM	I was on this medication for several years.  It made me sleep 18 out of 24 hrs. which made it impossible to get things done.  If I missed a dose by an hr. I would get dizzy.  My new Dr. weaned me off by decreasing my dosage for 4 days.  Withdrawals were agonizing.  This drug worked great for my anxiety but not for depression.  I would not recomment this drug.  Since comming off I am a totally different person, for the better!
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	8/29/2008 11:43:14 PM	I did have some side effects while on effexor..sexual and weight issues.  I work out 5-6 times a week at the gym, and eat semi-healthy 80% of the time.  I couldn't figure out why I would gain instead of lose weight.  So I added a running regimen into my workouts....same thing- no lose of pounds.  In between all of that, my sexual desire went to nothing.  So, for the sake of my marriage I called my ob/gyn who put me on effexor for bad pms(I did ask to be put on something)  I was told my only option was to lower my dose, so we did.  I went back down to 75mg- then ot was no sleep, bad dreams,short-tempered.  So, I called back two weeks later and stated that I wanted to switch to a drug that had NO sexual side effects.  After 8 days, i finally got an answer(because of my moodiness, I had called 4 more times in that period)  I was told okat to switch, and I had asked for wellbutrin, since there was suppose to be no sexual side effects.  All good, until day 3- thats when the real bad moodiness, and lots of tears came in. 4th day dizzy, and nauseated all day.  My eyes had a glassy look to them.  Couldn't even stay the whole day at work.  Called my sister who is a pharmacist, and told her what was going on I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAPERED OFF OF THE EFFEXOR!!!!  My doctor never said a word about it.  NEVER even mentioned that I might have drug withdrawals from the effexor.  I ended up having serious withdrawals- hot flashes, dizzy, nauseated, terrible lfe like dreams.Crying over nothing and everything.It was one of the WORST experiences I have ever been through. Today I am on day 12 of NO EFFEXOR!!!  I would never recommend this drug to anyone.  The drug withdrawals can last anywhere from 10 days to 3 weeks.  I had started taking the wellburtin, and on day 5 I called my doc. office crying, and the told be to add another half a pill.  I did, and now I want to be on nothing, so I am down to half a pill a day!!!!!  No drug should ever make a person feel that way.

Upon swallowing the tablets it burns all the way down my throat.  I do take food with it, and have nausea afterwards.  Recently had an endoscopy &amp; it showed erosive esophagoitis.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Should I purchase empty gelatin capsules &amp; crush this med to put in and swallow it?

Depression	alb, 45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		45-54	8/19/2008 8:39:52 AM	I have worked for several years with my doctor and mental health therapist to find ways to minimize the symptoms of chronic depression with exacerbations of seasonal affective disorder.  After much experimentation we hit on the combination of taking Wellbutrin year-round for the chronic depression and adding Effexor XR in varying doses throughout 9 months of the year to treat the seasonl affective disorder.  I start taking 37.5 mg of Effexor in the middle of August, increasing to 75 mg at the middle of October and to 112.5 mg at the end of November.  I maintain that dose all winter, until the beginning of April when I begin decreasing the dose at about 3-week intervals so that I'm off the Effexor by the middle of May.I have tried decreasing the dose more quickly than that, but like many others have reported, the side effects made me very uncomfortable.  (I have learned, when weaning off, to carry one 37.5 mg capsule with me to take if I'm feeling especially uncomfortable, but find I have rarely needed to take it.)While the medicine has been indispensable in relieving my suffering, I also must report the importance of behavioral interventions  showering and getting dressed every day, getting outside daily (even if its just to sit on the porch), calling or visiting friends when Im feeling down, and seeing my mental health therapist and/or doctor when Im feeling overwhelmed.  They help me to see how my thoughts may be contributing to the depression and how I can get back on track.If you are suffering, dont give up.  Try the interventions your doctor suggests, and let him or her know what works and what doesnt so that your treatment can be tailored to you.

When I talked to my doctor about discontinuing use he put me on a &quot;step down&quot; pack.  One week at 75mg, then one week at 37.5mg then nothing.  At 75mg and 37.5mg I felt a little nausea, lightheadedness, and tired for a few days after starting each dose.  I too wondered what &quot;brain zaps&quot; were. I found out after the drug was out of my system. For one week I experienced what I could only describe as like &quot;little seizures&quot;. Like little electrical &quot;zaps&quot; in my head &amp; ears, accompanied by &quot;zaps&quot; of tingling sensations in my lips, face,neck and hands. I have never experienced anything like this, ever. I am now in week two..8 days off of the med., these symptoms seem to be getting gradually better.  Its been frightening. I have researched Effexor, trying to find info. about the withdrawal symptoms, but wouldn't you know it.. there's hardly any mention..&quot;sensory symptoms&quot;. Effexor is an effective medication, but there should be more info. put out there to doctors,and patients about what happens when this drug is discontinued. I was told &quot;flu like symptoms&quot;, not neurological disturbances, and I'm feeling pretty angry about that. There should be more straight forward patient information put out there by this drug mfr. Doctors need to be better educated about side effects of these types of meds, not just relying on the pharm. salesperson.

I suffered from Panic attacks after i discovered that I had heart and low/high blood pressure problems due to stress and exhaustion.  I call Effexor my happy pill. I &quot;think&quot; it did raise my blood pressure a little and i did gain some weight but not sure if i can blame the drug. It has NEVER affected my sex drive. I still have amazing gay sex at 30 years old :) But, missing a dose is BAD! It feels like a hangover and food poisoning. I don't know what missing more than one feels like but the thought absolutely terrifies me.  I've thought about weening off for months now since it ain't cheap and I really hate the idea of depending on this kind of drug. I keep reading the horror stories of brain zaps and months of withdrawal sypmtoms and I think I'd have to be broke and desparate to get off Effexor, especially after two years!  Not sure what to do...

This has been a wonder drug for me although I do not have a sex drive, which in part is due to menopause, and I am unable to lose weight. I told my doctor that I wanted to come off of it to see if it will help me to lose the weight. I had been taking 150 mg., now taking 75 mg. The first week of the 75 mg. I was dizzy and extremely tired. This week hasn't been quite as bad. I have one more week of the 75 mg. and then I drop to 37.5 for three weeks. Reading the other reviews has me concerned about the symptoms and do not quite understand what is meant by the &quot;brain zaps.' Would appreciate it if someone would explain this.I have also noticed body aches and joint pain. Has anyone else?

W, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	8/13/2008 12:50:46 PM	I have been on many anxiety meds in the past all of which would leave me with extreme dizziness, nausea. I took Lexapro when going through a divorce and it worked very well but then one day the panic attacks and worrying showed it;s ugly symptoms. I have just started the Effexor and am currently at 75mg in addition with Atarex and Klonipin 2 mgs. So far the tension in my head and neck have left and i can take a deep breath , finally. Understand what works for one may not work for another. Sometimes an additional drug, such as Adarex, may alleviate these probs.
Depression	LORIMM, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/12/2008 7:30:14 PM	I took Effexor Xr 75mg for a year and loved it! I just had to wean myself off of it a couple of months ago because my insurance is changing and I can no longer afford it. I did have weird dreams when I first started taking it and I would sweat alot in my sleep. I'm assuming this was caused by the Effexor because I'm no longer having those problems. As far as weight gain, I lost and gained weight on it, so I believe it has no effect on weight. I believe I gained weight by eating lots of fast food and rarely exercising. I do believe it slowed down my weight lost process making it harder to lose weight. I start on Celexa tomorrow and hoping it works as well as Effexor!
Depression	clbrgs, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	8/12/2008 3:23:21 PM	I have been on 150mg since 1999. Rather than make me feel better, it has made me not feel at all.  I finally realized how much I was missing in life because I could not enjoy things while taking this med, so my doctor is very slowly taking me off of it. I have quit taking it before, and because of life circumstances, I was put on it again.  The withdrawal I experienced from this med is unlike anything I ever experienced before.  I got all of the usual things; flu-like symptoms, brain shocks, anger, sadness, hopelessness, and more.  This time I am taking Geodon and Wellbutrin SR to help with the withdrawal.  It has helped quite a bit to take these meds!  I do still have some withdrawal symptoms, but not even close to as much as I had before.In all, I think that Effexor XR can be very helpful to a depressed person, but  people need to know about the withdrawal BEFORE they start it!
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	2	4	2	Female	25-34	8/12/2008 1:19:46 PM	As a collegiate athlete, initially this medication worked for me. Then, I begin to have anxiety attacks out of the blue. I was taken off this medication immediately. If you have ever had an anxiety attack, it feels just like the words suggest, AN ATTACK. That was the scariest feeling in my life. I was in Walmart doing what I normally do (look around) and instantly I felt beyond overwhelmed with all that was going on around me. I am so grateful that my roommate was with me. She was there to calm me and escort me back home. So, in a nutshell, I would say pay close attention to the side affects on this medication because they can pull you out of your element. I hope this helped.
Depression	Oceanchild, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	8/10/2008 11:46:53 PM	I wouldn't recommend Effexor for anyone. The drug just made me go crazy, I can't even explain it. With the mental condition I was in at the time of taking this, there was no room for the downslide I took from taking this drug. And the withdrawal when I stopped taking it was the worst experience I have ever been through.

LACK OF SLEEP MADE THE ANXIETY MUCH WORSE.  WELL,  THE MEDICINE WAS NOT HARD TO TAKE AT ALL.  I HAD NO INITIAL SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL FROM THE DRUG.  AFTER READING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT ALL THE POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS, I DECIDED TO WEAN MYSELF FROM THIS MED.  BOY, THE TESTIMONIALS HERE ABOUT THE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS ARE SOOOOO TRUE!  I EVEN BROKE DOWN EACH CAPSULE AND REMOVED A FEW MORE &quot;BEADS&quot; EACH DAY UNTIL I ONLY HAD A FEW LEFT.  THE SIDE EFFECTS WERE STILL HORRIBLE.  THE BRAIN ZAPS AND SHUDDERS WERE NOT PLEASANT AT ALL, IN FACT VERY DIZZYING.  I WILL DEFINITELY BE MORE AWARE OF SIDE EFFECTS BEFORE TAKING ANYTHING AFFECTING MY BRAIN!!!I FELT LIKE A TRUE SPACE CADET.  I AM CURREBNTLY NOT ON ANY MEDICATION THERAPY.  I'LL JUST DEAL WITH IT!

I lost my health insurance and I no longer can afford Effexor XR.  Coming off the medicine has been a true nightmare!&quot;Brain Zaps,&quot; as I call them are frequent.I was warned that coming off Effexor XR is much harder than using it.  I agree!
Depression	lkbets, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	8/7/2008 4:07:03 PM	I was prescribed Effexor 150mg for menopausal symptoms and severe situational depression. It really helped me. Regretably my doctor never told me that there would be withdrawl symptoms until after I had been on the med. for 2 months. Since it was giving me my life back, I have stayed on it for 2yrs. I never planned on remaining on the drug forever, so after talking with my doctor, I have been &quot;stepping down&quot; over the past 2wks. I have 3 days left on 37.5 mg. then I'm done. I've had mild withdrawl symptoms such as fatique ,slight nausea, and lightheadedness.  Most often the symptoms are greatly minimized by late afternoon. Eventhough the med. really helped me get through a horrible time in my life I will be glad to be totally off of it.I will be all the wiser the next time I am prescribed medication for anything. I will make certain that I am knowledgable of a drugs side effects and potential for dependency before I ever start taking it, no matter how bennificial it may be. Instead of solely trusting the doctor to inform me.

The zaps are gone and so are all the &quot;after shocks&quot;.  It helped while I was taking it, however, it wasn't suppose to be a long-term deal for me.  Be like a doctor and have &quot;patience&quot; while weaning off.  I'm so much happier now that I'm off meds.  Stay strong, blessings to all.
Bipolar Depression	Maggy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	8/5/2008 10:07:05 AM	Hey Ya'll. Have been taking Effexor for 10 months. Am goin'thru the cold-turkey withdrawal stuff. It ain't pretty! Was diagnosed as being bi-polar/depressed when having anxiety over our $$$ woes. My doc sent me to a psych who wanted to put me on Trazadone for sleep, Stay on Effexor(75 mg.),and add 3 mg.Invega (the &quot;new&quot; lithium). Hmmm, well folks I felt like a zombie-just numb. No thanks, would rather feel sad or anything but that &quot;zoned-out&quot; thing. And really don't think I am bi-polar. Have never experienced that mania thing you read about where you don't sleep for days. Guess the best thing I have learned from this is get educated before you take anything. My doc did not discuss the withdrawal fun. Will be so glad when my ears quit ringing! And got so queasy on day 2 that I threw up a salad. Yuck. Am making a committment to myself to eat better and exercise. Work on my relationship with God, my husband, friends, and spoil my dogs. Try living in the moment and being thankful. This is what really works for me. Best of luck to all ya'll struggling with mood swings. Sending you happy thoughts!       
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	19-24	8/3/2008 11:05:54 PM	I've been on Effexor for 3.5 months (worked up to 150 mg / day over a period of 4 weeks) and I'm convinced it hasn't done anything for me moodwise.  I used to feel too tired and depressed to exercise, and it didn't help me.  It only made me want to eat more, and I gained about 20 lbs over that time period.  I am NOT prone to such weight gain. I've felt a bit better, but that's because my situation has changed and I've moved to a better place.  If I continue to gain weight, I will be really upset.  My clothes don't fit anymore.  I was really scared to stop the drugs, but since I moved I'm no longer on the same health care plan, so I can't see the doctor who prescribed Effexor.  I noticed that I didn't feel any side effects when I was late taking Effexor, so 3 days ago I thought I'd try to see what would happen if I waited a few more hours.  I felt none of the really frightening side effects that users on this site and others have reported.  I figure better to get off it before my body becomes dependant.  I did get some uncomfortable stomach cramping when eating dinner last night, so I took some pepto bismol and took about 1/3 of my 150 mg capsule and woke up feeling great.  More energy than I've had while on Effexor.  I'm scared that I'll feel some scary side effects soon, but so far, thank God, I feel fine.  I wouldn't recommend going cold turkey, as most folks seem to have experienced absolute hell.  I wonder why I was so lucky.

My daily anxiety has improved dramatically, and I rarely have panic attacks anymore; I used to get them roughly 4 times a week, now I have one on rare occasion.

I had about every withdrawl symptom including &quot;brain shocks&quot; or whatever it's called when it feels like I'm being shocked with electricity and my vision tweaks out. This was severe and went on for a month or two and through this process, I never felt like myself.

Depression	Rowan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	8/3/2008 3:57:16 AM	I started taking this medication due to situational depression. For the most part it was good. I stopped crying and could go to work. The first week I took it I slept very little and couldn't go to work. After that week I was fine. I took the medication for about a year. I'm currently off of it. All I can say is UGH! This has not been fun. I stopped taking it about a week ago. It's 3am and I can't sleep. My stomach is upset 80% of the time I am wake. I suddenly get very hungry. I'm dizzy everytime I turn my head. I tapered off the medication like I was told to by my Nurse Practioner. Sadly, my Nurse did not warn me about the side effects of withdrawal. I was only taking 75mg. It worked well while I was on it though.

Side effects are crazy:  bizarre dreams, jaw clenching at night, overwhelming urge to drink (and drink a lot), shaking, night sweats, mania, weight loss, personality changes and flat affect.  Withdrawal is beyond awful and I find it to be less effective upon withdrawal and returning to it.

Depression	Mollyest, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/30/2008 1:10:57 PM	I have suffered from anxiety, depression, panic, stress and alcoholism my entire adult life.  Four years ago, I began taking Prozac for depression and Klonopin for anxiety.  I did really well with that combination except for one thing: my sex drive died. As a result, I asked my Dr to change my medication, and he reluctantly changed me to Wellbutrin and Lexapro.  My sex drive returned but I was miserable.  I ended up in Detox.  After that, I tried Cymbalta and Amitriptyline which did not help and had bad side effects.  Finally, I tried Effexor.  Its a miracle.  The very next day I felt 'normal'....something I hadn't felt in years but instinctively knew was right.  I have experienced no weight gain with  Effexor, my sex drive has returned, and I am 15 months sober.  I want to make 3 points.  1)Effexor is great for ME, 2)don't give up until you find what's right for you...its worth it, 3) some side effects aren't as bad as you think if you weigh all the consequences (i.e. no sex drive would have been better than ending up in Detox).  Good Luck!

It helped me tremendously back then.  Now I have had 3 children on it and am putting my husbanc through grad school, and it just doesn't seem to do anything for me any more.  My Doc has taken me from 300mg down to 150mg to get me off of it, and has started me on Cymbalta. I think that after 10+ years, it just doesn't affect me as well anymore. Differnt stresses, and anxieties now.

Depression	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	7/24/2008 6:50:57 AM	I have tried a number of drugs for depression. I asked my doctor if I could try Effexor because of the profound effect it had on my sister. It has not had as drastic an effect on me, but I am functioning, and the depression is no longer debilitating as it once was. I take 300 mg. per day, and tried to go higher, but couldn't tolerate the side effects of a higher dose, esp. nausea. The downside is that I understand Effexor is a very difficult drug to stop taking (there is a &quot;discontinuance syndrome&quot;), so I'm likely to be on it for life.

Depression	Marledell, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	55-64	7/23/2008 1:59:39 PM	7/23/08 Started Effexor 13yrs ago and now take 225mg daily. Prescribed for depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia, perimenopause. It has numbed me.  Side effects include: nightmares, much weight gain, blurred vision, loss of sex drive, confusion to the point of not being able to function, lost motivation. No longer want to be with people. Hard to feel any emotion except saddness/hopelessness. I'm certain it caused a problem with sleeping and got to the point that I was extremely fatigued.  Tests showed extremely low oxygen level when resting.  No energy.  Now sleep with a bi-pap machine which helps.  I was not overweight at the time. At first felt calm, but developed into talking too much, almost an excited/silly behavior that eventually passed after a few years. Tried to discontinue with the following side effects: extreme anxiety, anger over little things, aggressiveness,  crying spells, fearful (not my personality). I retired early due to not being able to function at my job. Now I feel really ignorant for not realizing the medication was causing many of these symptoms. I stayed on the drug because other meds hadn't worked for depression. My doctor said to ease off dosage by decreasing one pill per month.  Still horrible side effects and after two months of being completly off started back on meds.  You are asking why?  I just got tired of feeling so anxious and tearful or angry.  Not feeling was easier.  Guess I am very weak.  Am planning on changing doctors and again asking for help in discontinuing it.  I have a loving husband and children, but life is just too hard.   
Depression	dixie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/23/2008 12:44:10 PM	Unlike Paxil, I did not have the side effects of the weight gain and the tiredness.  Effexor has no side effects for me even when the dose was doubled.  I am so pleased with this drug.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	mishac811, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	7/22/2008 11:31:37 PM	Thank you to everybody who reviewed this drug. I thought I am going crazy - which is a pretty short ride for me. W/o Effexor- I just have panic atacks quite severe. BUT with Effexor, I got anxiety episodes - when I would worry about global warming, wars, weather -, vivid dreams/ nightmares which make Stephen King's books look like bedtime stories, debilitating physical symptoms - I would have to stay in bed for hours. Scarier though are the emotional and cognitive symptoms.I would feel like a stranger in my own body, in my own house and even in my own life. I never did drugs - but all the symptoms I have on Effexor are very close to what I imagine someone feels when stoned. BUT THE WORST IS I STARTED DRINKING - AND I NEVER IN MY LIFE HAD THIS PROBLEM. I FELT IN MY GUT THAT I AM NOT AN ALCOHOLIC, BUT COULDN'T EXPLAIN BEYOND THIS. AND I STARTED SMOKING AGAIN, ALTHOUGH I QUITTED 9 YR AGO. I want off this drug ASAP - anxiety and panic attacks are nothing compared to the living hell this med got me in. 
Depression	elimo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	7/22/2008 11:31:36 PM	Overall I had been somewhat satisfied with Effexor.  I switched to it about a year ago d/t my low sex drive caused by the previous anti-depressant.  I have to say that Effexor did not help with that.  I was recently weened off of effexor and I have to say that although I am not experiencing withdraw as bad as others...it is NOT good!  Headaches, dizziness, and nausea.  Also I could not figure out what people meant by these &quot;brain zaps&quot;  I think I know now...walking down the hallway and you almost fall over... not from pain but all of the sudden you are dizzy and disorientated...  I have been experiencing this for two weeks now and hope that it comes to an end soon!  How long does this last?

Other		3	2	2			7/21/2008 4:41:04 PM	I have been on Effexor XR for 3 years for depression. At first it was a great drug to help with my anxiety and depression. However it never really took away the anxiety. I would feel no emotion whatsoever and had no sex drive at all. I am currently getting off of it and have brain zaps. I did this because I am not depressed anymore as well as I started a new job with no insurance. Due to money issues I cannot afford the full price of this medication. I weeded myself off of it per week and have been feeling these side effects for 3 weeks now. I feel dizzy, nausea, major anxiety (I cry 3 times a day at the drop of a hat), tired, and angry because of these symptoms. After reading some reviews I guess I will feel like this for a long period of time. I swear I feel like a crack head. Please use another medication because it is horrible to get off of it. I feel completely addicted.

I run out and forgot to refill it for almost a month, and my intire mental life changed.  I became moody, mean natured, didn't want to be with anyone, including family, and then I realized I had forgotten to fill my script.  I got it filled, went back on my regular daily rutine, and my mind is now back in the order it belongs in.  I am aware it is my mistake but knowing it did not make my life any easier.  Moral of this story (Listen to your Doctor, and stay on your med's as they are prescribed)&gt;

THis medication has really leveled me out and yes, I am not nearly as emotional but I feel so much more in control.  The bad parts of this med is there's no generic, and if you miss a dose you get a dizzy, wacked-out feeling.
Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	2	3	Male	19-24	7/20/2008 10:34:09 AM	I was on Effexor for about a year and a half. I was taking 150mg at breakfast and 75mg with supper. (225mg a day). I felt almost emotionless. Which could be a good thing for some. I recently quit taking effoxor because i didnt think i had deppression. Just anxiety.  I have been doing horrible. The brain shockls are unberable, I cannot think straight. I hate everhything. I am unsure on what to do. I am so confused. I take pain meds just to cope. I am either going to try another antideppresant or go back on Effexor XR.

Stopped working after 3 months.  Increased dose.  Worked for another 3 months.  Increased dose.  Sweating UNBEARABLE!!!  Weight gain of some 30lbs after a little over a year of using it at 112.5mgs daily.  Tired constantly.  AWFUL!  Withdrawal was HELL and had to gradually come down over a 3 month period.  Left with weight to lose.  A real mess!!!!  NEVER would I recommend this to ANYONE!

Now I take this purely for my anxiety and can tell if I missed a day.  If I forget to take it I get all teary eyed and am more likely to just start crying for no reason.  I notice dizzyness and fatigue as a side effect.  I also notice I yawn more often.  I've been on the medication for about 4 years now and it's the only thing that's worked for me.
Depression	sammyed, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	7/18/2008 1:06:59 PM	Having been diagnosed with major depression in my teens and now almost 50, I have tried numerous antidepressants. Effexor is best, although I fall in to denial of needing medication at all. It's true it has side effects, especially when you try to go off it, but weaning and keeping to as low a dose as possible should be the norm for ANY med! It helped me more than Prozac because it is a SNRI and not just a SSRI. That makes a difference for me. I still cried a lot on Prozac and lost sleep. For us diehard depressives, the worst side effect of all is committing suicide, right? Effexor helped me feel positive and productive. My BP med is also necessary though it has side effects--beats having a stroke! Sure, sexual interest declines but that happens without meds, to me. I say be grateful for the medication advances of this era, it sure beats the 1970-80's or earlier! I do manage side effects of Effexor by staying on 75 rather than the 150 I was on, to feel less robotic, as I saw it. 300 certainly sounds like a big dose to me and I've been hospitalized with depression 3 times. When &quot;weaning&quot;, give yourself at least 3-4 weeks to gradually go off. I laugh that it is like a nuclear reactor going on and coming off line. But I don't want to go hang from a tree anymore. One day, maybe I will show true acceptance and quit going off my meds!

I am taking Prozac in hopes that it will help with the withdrawal symptoms. I'm on day two and the brain zaps aren't too bad, but the emotional impact I feel from the withdrawal is overwhelming. I hope anyone reading this will try to get off this HORRIBLE NARCOTIC and try something else that may help with the withdrawal. I have been on Prozac before and never had any problems before, so I sure hope this works. My prayers to all of you that are suffering, this drug NEVER shoulf have been placed on the market. If you can, try Prozac to wean, I am on my second day and am down to 37.5 from 150 mg per day. W/O the Proazc, I would get the brain zaps after only ONE hour of not taking Effexor 150mg. I will keep you updated, keep trying everyone! If no one takes this horrible drug and we warn enough people, they will no longer make any money off of it! DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!

Panic Disorder	Keri, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	7/15/2008 9:54:45 PM	The medication is great when you first take it.  Totally made me feel better and my stress level went down considerably.  Side effect when taking the medication-no sex drive whatsoever.  The REAL problem is the side effects when you GET OFF the medicine.  I never knew that I was truly addicted to Effexor.  Basically, it is legal crack!  I had SEVERE &quot;brain shocks&quot; and headaches, restlessness, and my husband had to be my &quot;nurse&quot; for a month.  He seriously thought I was going crazy and needed mental help.  I can't describe the pain I was in.  Basically I was in bed all the time.  I was totally addicted, but luckily, I studied the internet and learned how doctors tell their patients to &quot;ween&quot; off the medicine.  1.  Weekly gradually taper down dosage.  (ex-Week one I went every other day 300mg and 150mg.  Week 2 I took 150mg daily.  Week 3 every other day 150mg and 75mg.  Week 4 I took 75mg daily.  Week 5 I went every other day 75mg and 0mg.  Week 6 I was Effexor free!  DO NOT suddenly stop taking this medication.  Hope this helps.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	19-24	7/15/2008 5:51:10 PM	I took this medication for anxiety. I was on it for about a month and quit taking it all at once. I didnt have any of the symptoms of withdrawal others had except for the dizziness. I hated this med. It made me feel nauseated ALL the time. The sight or smell of food made me cringe. I lost 15 pounds, but this is not a good way to lose weight. I didnt want to leave the house. I am a very social person, but Effexor made me dread going anywhere. It helped me with anxiety but it made me not care about anything. I was completely emotionless. I didnt want to go anywhere, talk to anyone, or even eat. All I wanted to do was sleep or lay in the bed. NOT worth it!

When looking at reviews, read comments made by people who have taken Effexor XR for a significant amount of time.  This more accurately explains side effects, etc.  I have taken Effexor 300mg for over 7 years.  While in the beginning it was a God sent, with time I'm learning that the side effects are horrible.  I tried to &quot;ween&quot; myself off this med, and was in the &quot;brain shocks&quot; were the worst pain possible.  I was bed-ridden for 3 weeks and ended up caving in.  I am still on the medicine today and once again am going to try and &quot;ween&quot; myself off-because I want to get pregnant.  I'm scared to once again go through the withdrawal, but it is the only choice I have.

For the past week I have been weaning myself down to 150 mg because of the side effects, mainly 0 sex drive.  I got my doctor to give me 75 mg caps instead of 150 mg caps.  I went down to 225 mg by only taking (3) 75 mg caps.  At the end of two weeks, I will go down 75 mg more, which will put me at 150 mg daily.  I have had no withdrawal sysmtoms doing it this way.

Depression	 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male		7/14/2008 10:39:59 AM	It has done an adequate job of stabilizing my moods for a while now, but the side effects can get pretty bad.  They started with a few headaches and a bit of nausea after eating and turned into insomnia and a complete loss of sex drive.  The withdrawal symptoms aren't pretty either - at 225mg, your body will DEFINITELY let you know when you miss a dose.

It has changed me. I am a more positive worry free person. I don't get afraid anymore. I used to have bad nervous panic attacks. I could not deal with negative and stressful issues at work. Now i am more livelier (my co-workers have noticed), I laugh more. Joke more and feel so much more RELAXED. Social gatherings are so much easier to be in. My hangups and fears are no minimal. As for side effects I did have headaches and blurred vision. Seems like the have subsided.. I only take the medication when I am &quot;PMS&quot;ing. I don't take it on a daily basis and my body does not feel side effect from that. Everyone is different Physiologically and tht is what we must understand!!!

If only I had read these reviews first!  I started at 37.5 then up to 75...still had night sweats, still was irritable and now I have gained an additional 15 lbs or so in the 2 months I have taken this drug.  I also picked up restless leg syndrom, extremely vivid nightmares and absolutely no sex drive or ability to fullfill a sexual experience if you get my drift...this stuff is horrible.  so I started weening myself off by taking one every other day to finally off completely.  I have experienced severe dizziness, brain zingers, nausea but I discovered DRAMAMINE...it does not make the dizziness go away completely but it is at least tolerable and the nausea is gone.  I am focusing now on excercise and a completely healthy diet to avoid going through this ever again with any other magical pill a Dr. can prescribe....so I guess I could say Effexor helped me get a perspective on how important my health is and I am determined to self medicate through diet and excercise...  Good luck to all of you trying to get off this horrible horrible drug.

I had chest pressure, my blood pressure would go up a lot and my vision was blurred.  That was at 75mg.  When I began to taper down, the withdrawls suck too.  You have to gradually wean yourself off till you're down to a crumb or you will have dizziness as well as other symptoms.

Initially, the drug seemed to work well for improving mood, only side effects were weird vivid dreams, loss of sex drive, and more episodes of restless leg syndrome.  After taking the Effexor for about 2 mos, noticed it was not helping as much with the moodiness, and restless leg syndrome was so bad I couldn't sleep at night.  I decided to &quot;wean&quot; myself off the drug..taking 37 mg for about two weeks, as SOON as I stopped, dizziness and nausea.  My doctor has now prescribed Lexapro, have only been taking two days...will update later.

It has literally been a life-saver for me! I've suffered with depression for many years but never had treatment for it.I was able to adapt to every day living, but the depression became worse as I became older.My physician prescribed a different antidepressant at first but I could not tolerate it. The second one,Effexor XR, is the winner!I now feel like I have a second chance at life.

I also have suffered for years from extreme premenstrual pain due to sever e adhesions. Once I got past my first week and getting used to the drug it felt like a great weight was lifted off of me. I have had no side effects. But 1 thing that has astounded me is the relief from my premenstrual pain. I have been on it for 4 months and as each new month comes the pain is greatly lessened. my last period I had no pain what so ever. I had been on vicadone for pain just so I could sleep through the night and now I no longer need even iburpophen. Has anyone else had this happen?I want to scream it from the rooftops. But after reading the other comments I am worried about getting off of them if I need to. But at this point , if it keeps the debilitating pain away I will continue to take it.

Other	Renne, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	7/8/2008 12:31:53 PM	Get off these drugs!!I have been taking Trazodone for years to help with sleep and combat Fibromyalgia.  I was prescribed Effexor several years ago when the long Minnesota got to me. It was supposed to reduce the pain from the FMS also.  I have never gone above the minimum dose of 37.5 mg.  I have gradually gotten sicker and sicker and have gained a huge amount of weight. I have taken a circuitous route in searching for my health again and started a Ph balancing program which saved my life. I have been hearing bad things about SSRI's and really want off of them. Did you know that seratonin comes from the digestive track? Anyway,I stopped the meds and suffered horrible withdrawals! After 2 weeks I finally got some St. John's wart and doubled the dose.  It helped a bunch!  But just yesterday I listened to an audio by Ann Blake Tracy (www.drugawareness.org)which scared me into a different approach to wean off. It's day 2 of taking a reduced dose of Effexor and all of the physical health benefits I've gained in the past weeks are gone. Okay,  they just feel gone.  But it is critical that you wean off very slowly. If not,  the withdrawal can come back even 6 months later.  These drugs get out of the system but remain in the brain for several years.In summary, it helped for a short time.  But the long term effects are not worth it.  I am lucky to still be married.  And alive.

Neuropathic Pain	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	7/3/2008 10:34:49 PM	For about 3 years I was dealing with pain, mainly on my back and neck. This together with hot flashes, stomach cramps, bowel problems, and a sense of great fatigue. I thought it was all due to menopause. I had had a thyroid extraction 13 years ago due to cancer. Finally, one doctor told me I had a chemical imbalance and that Effexor would be good for me. I'm very pessimist what concerns medications, but after so much aggravation I decided to give it a try. In one week I had no pain, my 15 HF/day had gonne down to 2 or 3 (much milder though), and all the other symptoms desappeared. I miss one day and they all come back. I am on 75mg for 5 months now and the dr. didn't tell me nothing about increasing the dose. She did tell me I may start withdrawing from it after one year... I pray for that. If I will have to stay on it for the rest of my life (as I have to take my med for the thyroid everyday for the rest of my life) I'll do so. I have been having very vivid dreams, but none agressive or nightmares. Actually they are quite intricate and funny, like if I were watching a movie.I didn't put 5 starts for satisfaction because of all the reviews I've been reading and the problems with withdrawl. I surely won't be satisfied if I'll have so much trouble to get out of it!I do feel this drug is better for pshycosomatic illnesses than for mental ones only.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	3	1	2	Female	19-24	7/3/2008 3:06:51 PM	Does anyone have any advice on what to do for the side affects?  I'm trying to get off this medication as I am pregnant, and it's not safe to use.  I can't even skip a day and I feel sick as a dog.  I wish there were something the Dr's could give to balance this out.  Besides trying to work, and go through the withdrawls it's the worst thing ever.

However, over time my depression only worsened. Withdrawal from this drug has made me regret seeking help in the first place .
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	6/29/2008 9:52:28 PM	Has really pulled me out of my depression and worked very quickly to improve my mood and energy level.  Night sweats are an annoyance, restlessness, not really experiencing deep emotion (good and bad).  Lack of sex drive is particularly frustrating and had become more pronounced the longer I'm on it.
Panic Disorder	nm, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	6/30/2008 7:35:13 PM	I just took 1 dose at bed time and woke up the next morning in a full blown panic attack like never before.  I thought I had lost my mind and was going to end up in Pschyatric Ward.  The smallest sound, touch was unbearable.  I wanted to crawl out of my skin and there was no controlling it.  I felt like I was having a breakdown!!!  Dr. immediately said discontinue the medication.  It took me a full day and a half to recover and come out of it.  I can definitely see now how people get suicidal thoughts with these meds.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	6/26/2008 1:57:35 PM	I'm coming up on about 2 yrs. on Effexor XR, currently 225mg. I'm noticing lately that the side effects are out weighing anything positive about this drug. I feel as if I'm addicted-If I miss even one dose I'll suffer extreme vertigo and disorientation, almost like mini seizure episodes. This has scared the living hell out of me. I've tryed to go off it myself now that my insurance recently dropped me-but i've become so dependent. I'm in the worst dilemma. I want more than anything to be off this drug. I myself would not recommend this one-it's a killer. Everyone's comments have helped me immensely-it's comforting to feel your not alone through this horrible struggle.

Depression	Star, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	6/25/2008 1:33:22 PM	The sweats were really bad. They would just drip of me all over. I first thought it was menopause but then I realized that the night sweats from menopause were nothing compared to this. When I weaned myself off the headaches, nausea, vomiting and the unbearable stomach cramps were so intense I was unable to eat or do anthing for over two weeks. My doctor said the withdrawl symptoms could last up to one month. I don't know how anyone can work and go through the withdrawl. It's really bad. They need to provide something to ease the withdrawl.

I clinched my teeth so hard my jaws hurt. My teeth chattered like I was cold. I was sicker than any flu I ever had. I sweat gallons of water, then was cold. It was the worst drug I have ever been on. It should be off the market.
Other	Escaping, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	35-44	6/24/2008 3:33:33 PM	Effexor xr has turned my life inside - out; and not for the good. I'm glad we have the chance to warn the public about this horrible drug. I don't care which experts say this medication is not addictive - they lie!!! It helps you in the beginning after you get passed the initial side effects. You then feel almost euphoric and happy. As you progress with the 'treatment' then I (along with many others) began to notice a change. You think you're just more confident and can't understand why everyone else thinks you've become an arrogant ass. That's because you are and don't realize it. You may become angry and act like a complete fool at 'the drop of a hat'. Then the darkness begins to cloud you're mind and you realize you've become a 'legal' junkie. You need this to feel in control. Nightmares may occur whenever you are able to actually sleep, dry mouth, weight gain, constipation, mood swings, dizzy spells and migraine headaches begin to occur more often; until you realize you're lost in a drug induced maze. I'm am fighting the worst battle of my life coming off of the Devil's candy. It will eventually destroy you.

Depression	Vase, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	6/23/2008 9:40:21 PM	I have been taking effexor for about 15 years, along with other antidepressants. (I've been on antidepressants since 1975.) I take 300mg in the morning and 75mg at night, along with Wellbutrin. . Effexor has worked very well most of the time. I still have the chronic crashes occasionally that can last for months, but that is the nature of the disease. I have none of the nausea, dizzy, or aggressive etc symptoms I read about here. The addictiveness is the only negative. I have gone into severe and dibilitating withdrawal when trying to trim down the dosage.  If I miss a dose I start wringing my hands, and become jumpy and fearful - even irrational. That makes me paranoid about running out, not being able to afford it, etc. even to the point of panic attacks. Antidepressants are also sneaky because you can think you are well and don't need it, when actually it is the pills themselves that make you better. If given a choice, I would still take the medication. It keeps me mostly non-suicidal (very rare - usually if pill supply is threatened) and as stable as one can expect. Yes I get angry about addictiveness, but I really appreciate not being so severely depressed, and being able to be functional, and at times even happy. I know too well the opposite.

&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs	Zuzi, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	6/22/2008 4:02:38 PM	My Dr. prescibed this drug for me...low dose 37.5 mg, saying it woulld help my hot flashes, mood swings and also my IBS and maybe my Fibromyalgia.  Sounded like a wonder drug to me, and you know what they say about that.... if it sounds too good to be true, it is!  Well, I suffered through 2 weeks of nausea, a feeling of being in a light fog and restless nights.  After one month the nausea had disappeared and my dreams became weird causing me to wake up in a cold sweat and my mood swings were worse and the fogginess never went away.  This is the low dose, remember?  I came to WEB-MD and read what everyone else was saying and decided I did not want to continue on with this drug, which had done nothing for my meopause symptoms, IBS or Fibro...and in fact I had no appetite and lost 10 lbs...only plus I can think of! I don't think one drug is a miracle wonder for everyone.  I'm glad to see it helped some people, but I think I rather handle my problems more on a natural level.  I'm just happy that I was able to read all these reviews before taking anymore.  Brain zaps.....ugh! No thank you! 
Depression	Momma, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	6/20/2008 9:56:22 PM	Very unstable while on Effexor. Taking it am and pm and not able to mantain a normal life. My husband hated me and so did everyone who I cam in contact with. Very suicidal while weaning off the drug. Please be very cautious.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Concerned, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	6/20/2008 2:47:22 PM	When I first began Effexor XR 37.5 dose I was sick and unable to sleep but I noticed that I was improving emotionally. Then I progressed to the 75 dose I began experiencing fatigue and headaches; but I was beginning to feel more at ease and had better concentration and I was ready for the 150 dose, according go my doctor. When on the  150 dose I was at times experiencing extreme fatigue and weight gain, along with headaches and chronic constipation. However, I was extremely happy with the results in the beginning. I had self confidence that I never had before and was convinced that I would use this drug forever. I was calm and level headed and for once liked myself. Over a period of time I noticed my growing dependence on this drug. My weight gain was out of control and I bruised very easily. My self confidence turned into aggression that raged out of control. My family would not accompany me anywhere during this time because my temper was out of control and I would 'mouth off' to anyone who looked at me wrong. Then the dizzy spells started to occur and nightmares started. It has been a long road to hell and back trying to get off this drug. I will succeed in getting my life and family back. I'm now at the 75 dose again and my body is craving more Effexor - it's unreal. Next week I'll try to cut the dose to 37.5 but I am afraid because of all the hell I'm going through to get off these pills. Effexor XR will make a 'junkie' out of you - just because it's legal doesn't make it any better than the illegal street drugs. The symptoms are the same and it can eventually ruin your life.

I realized I needed to be treated for depression when I was in my early 30's. I finally went to a doctor and asked for help. After trying some different medications and dosages we finally decided on Wellbutrin XL 450mg with Effexor XR 225mg. I've been on this for about 2 years. IT WAS THE BEST THING I EVER DID! My anxiety and anger was gone after a few weeks. I stopped fighting with my husband and co-workers everyday. I was able to take difficult situations in stride. The worst side effect was dry mouth. I will say that after reading some of these reviews I'm terrified to ever go off of the Effexor XR.

Panic Disorder		4	3	3			6/18/2008 3:09:13 AM	This medication has helped with depression, anxiety and ocd, but the side effects are causing me to look to change to another medication. My symptoms were better with Effexor, but not quite good enough, but I cannot tolerate a higher dosage due to increased side effects.I have become more hot natured - needing the air conditioner up higher or a fan - I am having great difficulty loosing the weight I out on while taking another antidepressant 0 and the worst one - I forget words in the middle of a sentence and my brain gets foggy and my concentration is very bad.

Depression	addicted, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	6/16/2008 12:47:08 PM	My doctor prescribed Effexor xr do to depression and anxiety during a family crisis. Now at 150mg dose this medication has helped me to be calm in the beginning and I have more self-confidence now. The downside is I've become more of an aggressive, rude and outspoken person. Normally, I'm not rude or aggressive at all and my temper is flaring very often and the calm feeling is diminishing. It's almost as if I'm looking to be challenged and I've got to win at any cost. I've had chronic constipation, night sweats and arguments with my husband over petty things. He's asked me to please stop taking this medication. I want to stop but I'm afraid that I'm now a 'legal' drug addict. My dependence on this medication makes me feel weak and ashamed; but I panic if I miss a dose and I keep some in my car, purse and work just in case I forget it. I tried to stop taking it by cutting down on the dose and I cried for two days. This is a nightmare and I promised myself that I would never be dependent on anything or let anything control me; a promise now broken.

The hazy feeling along with the muscle aches and zaps slowly went away. The longer side effects that I still have are moodiness and extreme irritability. I decided to stop taking it because of the weight gain. I went from 115lbs to 150lbs!! I just wanted to share, to let you all know there is an end to the agonizing withdrawal symptoms, you just have to tough it out. Besides that, I loved the medication and would recommend it to anyone with anxiety or depression. It worked wonders for me and its to bad the weigh gain made decide to stop taking it.
Depression		4	5	3			6/10/2008 8:50:19 PM	I have been on the medication for about 2.5 yrs and it was amazing in the beginning.  I am taking the 75 mg but I don't want to increase the dose b/c I am ....scared.  Sounds silly to be scared, I know, but if I miss one dose I feel like I can't function.  I get extremely emotional, feel like my &quot;brain&quot; is on fire, and I have constant headaches.  I don't wanna take a stronger dose and be even more dependent on it and I don't know how well I could tolerate &quot;weening&quot; off.  It did help in the beginning though.  Hope it works for you.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/5/2008 2:55:58 PM	My stress, anxiety &amp; depression became so severe my MD put me on short-term disability from work to straighten it out. Lexapro made me worse, not better. Effexor has been a godsend. 1 week at 37.5mg, 2 weeks at 75mg, now stabilized at 150mg.  The nausea was the worst, but it disappeared when I moved to 75mg, and after the first few weeks, the other side effects have been minimal; mostly dry mouth and vivid dreams. I take Trazadone to combat the insomnia caused by the Effexor, and together, they work like a charm. I'm 8 weeks in, and I feel like myself for the first time in ten years.

Panic Disorder	jules, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	6/5/2008 11:34:06 AM	Effexor has worked great for me since I got on it 2 years ago. It very much stabilized my mood swings and my hot flashes came to a hault. The only side effect I had was the extreme itching. I had to take Benadryl at night to offset the itching allergy. But, now I'm trying to come off of the drug. I tapered down slowly and now I have been totally off for 2 weeks.  I still get the brain zaps three or five times a day, but they are pretty mild and manageable. Biggest concern is the EXTREME IRRITABILNESS and ANGER I am experiencing. I was wondering how long I will have these irritabilness and anger issues??? Does this go away within a month, two months of stopping the drug? HELP! 
Depression	flipflopfanatic, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	45-54	6/4/2008 8:20:30 PM	I have tried several different types of anti-depressent medicine and not many have worked.  Effexor seems to help but my insurance company doesn't pay much so I try and make my month supply last a couple of months and then I start getting stressed and angry with anyone and everyone.  I hate that feeling. I wish there was a cheaper drug that worked good.
Depression	Kenny Barringer, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	6/4/2008 12:12:57 AM	I have taken 75mg for about 3yrs. know. I am 29 and have a 60yr old mans lower back (Lots of sugery and shots) I do not get to do the things guys my age do and it is VERY DEPRESSING!!! It helps me ALOT!!! The only drawback is when you forget a dose YOU BETTER FIND ONE QUICK!!! I feel like my brain is miss firing. Like I have a bunch of bad spark plugs in my head. I literaly cannot function if I miss a dose. It is kinda scary. Also I do not know if this has anything to do with it but at night after I started it I have spells where I will wake up and can't move for up to 30 or 45 mins. I can see the clock but I cannot move my Body AT ALL!!! A little scary but I still choose to take it. Scared to stop!!
Panic Disorder	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	6/3/2008 2:29:11 PM	Well I see I am not alone.  I was up to 75  &amp; a 37.5...for 2 years, I supposes I felt alright, but wanted to not take these types of drugs at all, I then backed off to 75 and felt alright,,,that was 9 months ago,,,I was &quot;convinced&quot; to up the dose again...this is when I had the massive problems...worst thoughts...sucide...etc...brain zinners&quot;...headaches..almost out of controll...I backd off to 75 again for 4 weeks,,,today I', back down to 37.5....this is the worst drug in the world...the only reason I have gotton through this drug...either uping the dose or backing off , as I am now, is my experience as a boy { teen ager} with LSD...and that was not good...but it made me understand that it is this drug, and not me,,,thats making me feel &quot;this way&quot;...I am an artist, composer,,,the only peace I get, is to &quot;keep working&quot;....for it helps me &quot;forget&quot; this drug....as I read the withdrawls people are having, I hear all of you loud and clear...these drugs should be outlawed, and I feel they are as dangerous as LSD...And I know.....Oh...I hope all of you can get through  the &quot;backdown&quot;,,,of this drug,,,please please, do not increase the dose either, as this is when I knew...either I stop taking this drug...or it will kill me....bottom line....
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety		4	4	2			6/3/2008 1:42:54 PM	I have been on this med at 75mg for a little while, and with a change of insurance- it was not covered for me anymore and VERY expensive at a cash price, so I thought I would go back to live without an antianxiety medication.  The withdrawls and coming off are HORRIBLE!  I am having reactions to situations that I wold NEVER have done!  Terrible headaches, sweats, depession, suicidal thoughts (that I have never had in my life!), nose bleeds from highblood pressure, diahra.  I am at day 4 of no dose and I called in work today.  It just has to be better tomorrow!!!

I begin having weak spells, tremors, clammy sweats , not just at night,-anytime, irreg. heart beats/tacycardia and elevated bloodpressure.Then I began to bruise easily; scratching an itch on my leg moderately ,producted a 4 to 5 cm. size dark bruise and leaning on a ladder for about ten minutes left the print of the step/round on my leg in a dark bruise.  I was told by my Md to stop the med. immediately and was give Prozac, one capsule to off set the withdrawal side effects.I too am having the head spins, sweats, weak spells,and feeling like I am going to faint at intervals. It's day 5 since my last dose. Hope the side effects quit soon; I feel badly.
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	6/1/2008 7:51:13 PM	i have been taking this drug for over 2 years and just noticed over the past few months that i have been gaining quite a bit of weight. wondering if this medication is causing this weight gain?

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	35-44	6/1/2008 11:21:26 PM	Really bad side effects whenever trying to cut back on dosage, or if late in taking daily meds.  Bad head &quot;zoomies&quot; like dizziness (but worse!) and so on. 
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	35-44	6/1/2008 9:50:36 PM	I thought the side effects from coming off of the drug would never end. Severe night sweats, shaking hands, insomnia (literally days without sleeping) and the most painful &quot;dizziness/head spins&quot; I have ever felt. I had to lay in bed and not move for days. I went from 75 mg down to 35 mg and then skip a day to get off. FINALLY after 9 days after the last dose, the side effects are gone. I would not recommend this drug. It didnt make me feel like my old self- in fact it made me feel worse and I looked puffy and gained weight. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  (Caregiver) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	6/1/2008 8:46:41 PM	I felt that the medication was working--I was not as irritable in the &quot;irritable&quot; working conditions I had at the time of being placed on Effexor XR.  It calmed me and took the edge off, so to speak.  BUT, jumping from 125 lbs to 155 lbs and having none of my scrubs to fit any longer and looking &quot;puffy&quot;--its not the drug of choice for me.  I have NEVER had a &quot;weight&quot; problem...so this is very new and difficult for me--its a puffy, bloated look..very noticable in photos.  I am coming off of it as I type this.  I need it, but will consult dr. for something else.  Funny thing is, I read in the article on this site that Effexor  was one that didn't cause weight gain...NOT TRUE.  I have, and so have several of my friends who are on it and trying to stop it.  I wouldn't recommend it. 
Depression	Bud, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	45-54	5/30/2008 8:54:20 PM	For the first time since I was 8 (I'm 52), I've had days when I didn't consider suicide.  Obviously I wasn't all that serious about it, since I'm still here, but, even though it's not every day, it's nice to have some days when it doesn't cross my mind (believe it or not I thought everyone had those thoughts).  And my chronic disorganization has improved somewhat, too.  Effexor is the third drug &quot;we&quot; have tried (my doctor and I) and the first that didn't make the suicidal thoughts more prevalent.I've experienced no noticeable side effects; most simply I would just say my outlook is more positive than I can ever remember, and I am more open and friendly to people, especially strangers.
Bipolar Depression	13-18 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	13-18	5/30/2008 7:55:09 PM	I Was on Effexor Xr 75mg for three years. Effexor never really made me feel myself again. I didn't know untill I came off of it the side effects I was having. Constipation and bad bad sweats. The last year I was on the med, my depression really started to get worse,  fast! So I made an appt. with a psychotherapist. She is amazing! She diagnosed me with bipolar disorder #2. My old pcp don't beleave in bipolar disorder, so I changed doctors. My new doctor knew my psycotherapist very well, he knew that she knew what she was doing. He took me off Effexor XR, and put me on lamictal 100 mg 2x a day. You can't start on that dose you have to work your way up to it. Coming off the Effexor was hell! My brain was having withdraws. My hands would shake uncontrollably! I had the worst head aches too. I was so dizzy coming off of it, I hit the floor one morning in church! This medication was very ineffective for me, and I had bad side effects.

I tried going off the med after 5 yrs to see if I needed it - hot flashes came back big time!  I am now back on Effexor and not planning to go off anytime in the next few years.
Panic Disorder	Tommi, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	5/29/2008 6:46:55 PM	I have had panic disorder for 40+ years.  I have been on same medication all that time until about six months ago.  Dr. changed to Effexor.  No side effects.  It manages panic entirely; have very small amount of aniexty ocasionally.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	2	5	2			5/28/2008 10:59:15 PM	I tried this instead of Dexedrine for ADD (no hyperactivity) last summer, and it made me sleepy (NOT a good sign of an ANTI-depressant!) and my jaw would &quot;shiver&quot;.  I went back to Dexedrine after 2 months of Effexor.
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	55-64	5/28/2008 9:50:34 PM	My doctor prescribed Effexor XR 75MG for my OCD/depression.  I didn't notice any improvement over previous treatment with Cymbalta.  The doctor then increased the dosage to 150MG.  I still haven't seen any great improvement over previous treatment, and am now extremely constipated and have gained 4 pounds (don't want to think what those four pounds might be...)  I had some Cymbalta left and have switched back to that to help relieve the constipation - along with Metamucil and Dulcolax.  Effexor just didn't work for me.

My sex-drive disappeared and my emotions went numb... I had no choice but to taper off when my husbands insurance stopped covering this drug. To pay cash was over $600/month. I took 225 mg originally, went to 150 mg for 1 month and then 75 mg for 1 month. What a roller coaster this has been! I feel like my life has been put on hold as i experience constant brain shocks, dizziness, nausea, severe fatigue and major mood swings. A drug that causees this severity of withdrawl symtoms shouldn't be on the market period. How miserable this has been! I just hope that I don't loose my family over this!
Depression	Suzzy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/27/2008 3:46:01 PM	Positive:  I feel so much better.  I have not had any episodes of nausea, &quot;brain shocks&quot;, migraines, etc. No weight gain or loss.Negative:  Big issues with constipation.  I was having issues with clenching my jaw, but that seems to have gone away.All in all, this seems to be a very effective drug.  I was a little bit scared of taking it due to all the negative posts on here, but so far I haven't had any major issues.  I take it at the same time every day, however, I did travel outside of my time zone and was several hours late in taking my meds.  I had no ill effects other than &quot;Shoot, I forgot to take my pill!&quot;On a side note:  Before starting on this medication, I was having problems with pains in my legs and leg jerking while sleeping.  Both of these issues have completely stopped (my husband is thrilled that the night leg jerking has ceased)So far, I highly recommend this drug.  It has made my life better.
Depression	fearlessjoe, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	65-74	5/27/2008 9:42:53 AM	I have had frequent headaches with some migraine headache experiences, that were very severe.  A combination of aspirin and caffeine has worked with a medication called &quot;pain away&quot;.  Usually the headache is gone within a 1/2 hour, but a heaviness in the head is the result and fatigue, as well.  Since reducing my intake from 225 to 75 mg nightly, the headaches have practically disappeared.
Depression	hondaman, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	1	1	1	Male	19-24	5/27/2008 12:05:57 AM	After taking antidepressants for well over a decade, I believe they are prescribed carelessly.  I have been prescibed prozac, zoloft, lexapro, and effexor xr.  The complete loss of sex drive i have had related to all these medications made me more depressed than ever.  All of these medications are effective for a while then plateau. The same with effexor. I havent been taking any mood altering medications for over six months.  The doctors wanted to counteract side effects with more pills! (ridiculous)  I feel more stable than ever, (life is supposed to have ups and downs).  Keeping eating and sleeping habits in check, I feel great.  I would reccomend steering clear of pills if at all possible.   
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/25/2008 10:47:59 AM	The first day I took this med it felt like someone drugged me. I was so nauseaous I couldn't properly take care of my kids. Crackers &amp; water did help the nausea, but I felt very heavy, over-tired, I was clenching my jaw A LOT, got the chills bad &amp; had quivers. I took a 75mg dose &amp; I've never taken any other kind of drug before. My doc failed to tell me about the commoness/severity of the nausea. He had said that I would probably be more irritable &amp; have higher anxiety.

This was prescribed for me to deal with the stress due to low seretonin levels. This drug has done wonders and I feel great while on it. I now handle stress great with few mood swings and have more patience than I ever thought possible. However, I've tried to come off it twice and accidentally stopped taking it once. Each time, I got so dizzy that it was hard to function and the mood swings were horrible. I had little weight gain and enjoy the great feeling while on it so I have no desire to stop taking and no need to stop. But, the withdrawl symptoms are horrible. I've tried several different meds until I found this. But none of them had the withdraw symptoms that this does. Great if you want/need to stay on it, but horrible to come off it.

Feels like shocks are coming from your brain down into your whole body.  Worst headache I've ever had.  EVEN WHEN I ONLY MISS ONE DOSE!! I'm down to 25mg a day and still.  And what amazes me most is that my doctor told me NOTHING about this!  If your not diagnosed with major depression disorder, do not take it.  It pretty much ruined 2 years of my life.  
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	5/23/2008 7:39:58 PM	Although this drug was highly effective in treating the symptoms of my depression, it was not worth the agony tapering off.  Constant nausea, headaches and dizziness made me feel what a a drug addict mush feel like having withdrawals.  Had I know these side effects were even possible, I would've asked my doctor for an alternative anti-depressant.  Come to find out, these side effects are more likely in women.

Had nightmares,crazy-out-right stupid dreams. All I wanted to do was sleep and I just felt worse. I stopped taking this medication and refused to continue even after my doctor told me to continue. I slowly decreased my med until I was completely off of it.

Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	5/22/2008 11:29:42 AM	Withdrawing from Effexor XR is very difficult, leaving me feeling more ill than I ever have. According to other reports, I may have MONTHS of tinnitus, dizziness, nausea, night sweats, weakness, headache. This information NEEDS to be on the Wyeth website, THIS website, on the medication inserts, available to pharmacies, common knowledge to  prescribing physicians. A nurse practitioner understood I needed to withdraw slowly, but I didn't expect that after a week on the lowest dose I would which I could die. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE INTERNET TO FIND THIS OUT! I am agreeing to the site terms under duress because more readers need to have this information. Web MD is negligent in  not providing it in an immediately accessible way.

Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	M.V.W-R, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	5/21/2008 12:34:16 AM	I am very pleased with Effexor and how it helped me through some of my darkest hours.  The only issue I had while taking it was the side effects when a dose was taken late or missed.  I experienced tingling fingers and lips, my brain would feel like it was in a fish bowl that got seriously jostled.  I would feel discoordinated and would sometimes slur my words.  However, when taken routinely, with out missing a dose I would have no problems.  I did gain 30 pounds on it.  Now that I have stopped I have already lost 20 of those pounds.  The one question I would like to see asked is: &quot;How hard is the drug to come off of.&quot;  I don't think enough people realize just how hard it is.  I have never been a drug user, so I cannot make the comparison, but imagine it is very similar to detoxing.  And I decreased slowly from 225mg at the direction and supervision of my psychiatrist.  It was horrible.  However, given where I was when I started the Effexor, I would do it all over again because it probably saved my life.  But be prepared for when your are ready to stop this medication.  Get your family prepared, come up with a plan of action and have constant support.  Coming off of the Effexor has definetly been one of the hardest things I have ever had to do.

I have been on it for several years but, an now getting off and onto Celexa.  I am doing it slowly with Dr. help and so far doing great.  I can out sweat anyone which drives me crazy.  If you can take a lower dose maybe you could handle it.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	5/17/2008 3:01:01 PM	Been depressed for many years &amp; after a suicide attempt I was put on this drug. I'm now on 150 mg. It has helped me so far but the withdrawal symptoms of just missing one dose scare me. I've been on prozac, wellbutrin, celexa, lexapro and have never felt the withdrawal symptoms so quickly and dramatically. Emotionally, I get very anxious and feel like a caged animal. Physically, I get these little &quot;shocks&quot; through my body. Don't want to be a slave to this drug the rest of my life. My current psychiatrist was upset when I told him my primary prescribed this to me. He said once you start it's very difficult to get off of. Will talk to him about weaning me off this. Maybe will try cymbalta next.

After 4 days I actually felt suicidal for the first time in my life. Very scary. I called my doc and was immediately taken off. This can be very helpful, but use with caution and take a few days off work at first, the nausea is bad.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	5/16/2008 11:04:31 PM	I took it for 2 days and I couldn't URINATE!  I was terrified.  Finally, a call to my doc in panic got me off of it.  Apparently, the &quot;inability to void&quot; is a serious side effect.  Needless to say, I never took that one again!
Depression		4	5	4			5/16/2008 12:45:07 PM	When my dosage was increased from 75 mg. to 150, I experienced intense itching all over.  The itching stopped when I returned to my lower dose.  Hope this is of help to others-
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	19-24	5/16/2008 9:23:51 AM	This is the worst pill I have evr taken in my life! I was taking 225MG everyday for a year and a half and I had very little side affects while I was taking it (trouble sleeping,nightmares,profuse sweating)but it seemed to lose effectivness very quickly. Rather than continue to up my dosage I was switched to 300MG of Wellbutrin once a day. I felt better while taking both medications but now that I am trying to get off of the Effoxor Xr I feel like I'm dying! I have gone from super happy to crying to total rage all within the last 2 hours. I was instructed to slowly lower my dosage over 2 weeks which I did and I don't think that was slow enough. I can not focus and I feel like I am going to vomit every second of the day. The pain in my head is not even comparable to a headache or migrain. Everytime I turn my head I feel like I am going to fall over and driving HA! thats a joke.I have been completley off of this pill for only 3 days and I have fully come to understand why addicts relapse. This should not be on the market and it should not be given out as quickly as it is. Doctors don't tell you that hey it may work for awhile but then when you come off of it you are worse than before you started taking it. I would NEVER recommend taking this regardless of how bad you think your depression is. Trust me it is much harder to deal with the thoughts and feelings while coming off this drug than it is to deal with the depression. If you do feel you need medication which I agree some do such as myself all I can say is do your research before you take anything, I wish I had done that.I would love to know if there is anything I can do to ease the withdrawl symptoms, please if anyone can help let me know before I end up taking another pill to make it stop!

Depression	ld, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/15/2008 6:23:48 PM	I have suffered from depression for years.  In the past, I have used various anti-depressant drugs, with no success.  By using this drug, I have been able to lift  the dark veil from my life, I can see clearly, make better decisions, and have experienced happiness and satisfaction for the first time in my adult life.  I am amazed, and grateful.
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	Nina, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	19-24	5/15/2008 3:04:46 PM	At the beginning when my PTSD was very severe to the point of suicide and psych wards this drug worked WONDERS controling my mood... but then they increased it... and I started numbing out... And that was leading to worse depression than my PTSD!!!!Now trying to come off it, even really slowly, it is not worth starting it. The headaches, nausea, mood swings... luckily I know they are side effects and not ME! but it's terrible. Throwing up... Not good for anyone who has also had an eating disorder. And nightmares, which Ive had problems with before effexor, are now worse than they ever have been. GAH! Makes me not want to sleep.Also, I agree in that I was also really really really tired.... all the time on it. And NO SEX DRIVE. Really harsh on a relationship. I didn't feel my self. I wouldnt take this again if they paid me to.
Depression	Carole, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	5/15/2008 2:30:25 AM	Effexor XR has been a never-ending nightmare; my husband after taking this drug for 3 months, was suicidal, and even after discontinuing, still has &quot;brain shocks&quot;, no sleep, and a permanent irregular heartbeat. This drug needs to be taken off the market, immediately. If you read other reviews on this site, you will find that the majority of people have these same problems. My husband ended up in a crisis center, after going to the hospital, for the side effects. He is still undergoing treatment for psyche problems.

I will continue to use it for one month then decide.  I have noticed a tiny bit of improvement with my mood swings and have'nt reall had any hot flashes.  I have how ever,for the first time,feel like I am tired ALLLLL DAYYY LONGGG!! It's weired because I'm so tired but It still keeps me up untill about 4 every morning then I dont want to do anythig the next day.

I am trying to come off the drug because I want to depend on my faith instead of a pill. The side effects are terrible. I do not beleive my doctor knew all the facts when it was first prescribed to me. I have now been off the drug for a week.  The pulsating feeling in my head is awful.  I have also had a very upset stomach. I am usally cold natured but I have felt like I was going to sufficate.  I have wanted to cry all the time.  My vision is weird along with terrible dreams. I pray to God that this will soon pass.  Please do not take this medicine unless you know all the facts.
Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	5/10/2008 1:28:04 PM	I have been taking Effexor XR 75mg for 4.5 years now.  It has given me my life back.  It took me a long time to admit that I might be depressed, as I didn't want to face what I perceived as a stigma against depressed folks as deficient in character, lacking in faith, or &quot;crazy.&quot;  Finally things got so bad (not getting out of bed on the weekends, suicidal thoughts), that I &quot;gave up&quot; and went to see a counselor.  That was the best decision of my life (other than marrying my wife.. although I guess you could say that THAT wouldn't have happened had I not sought help!).So after seeking help seven years ago I was diagnosed with double depression and started off with Prozac.  That didn't work, so switched to Zoloft.  Zoloft worked on my depression and I can vividly remember the joy of seeing leaves rustle in sunlight about 5 weeks after starting Zoloft and feeling happy for the first time years.  I gained 20 pounds of fat and lost my sex drive almost completely, but I was so happy to be &quot;alive&quot; again that I lived with those side effects for a couple of years.  Eventually I wanted more, so I dropped Zoloft cold turkey, lost weight, sex drive came back, but so did depression.  Finally got on Effexor XR and it has been a miracle.  A little sex drive lessening but not a lot, and no sexual function problems at all.  My depression has stayed away for the 4 years I've been on this drug.  This drug has worked wonders for me, and I hope that it will for you.  Realize that no one drug works for everyone, and that you do have to try out different medications to find the one for you.One thing -- if I skip a dose I can immediately tell, because I get a little dizzy, a little headache, etc.  I've heard that trying to go off Effexor can be very tricky.  Apparently if you want to go off you need to gradually lower the dose or switch to another med that can help while you're coming off of Effexor and then &quot;wean&quot; off of that.God bless.

Depression	sunlova04, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	5/9/2008 8:13:32 PM	Worked as good as any antidepressant,maybe even better, HOWEVER...When it came time to stop taking it more than 2 years ago, the withdrawals are THE WORSE thing I've ever experienced! It has been two years and I still get brain tremors, not a good feeling! Should take it off the market.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	5/9/2008 1:02:37 AM	I started taking Effexor to treat my Depression and GAD. My doctor told me that I would experience some nausia, but by the third day I felt like I had a stomach virus and my anxiety was at it's peak. I felt like I was crawling in my skin. I continued to take it, but I noticed it seemed like my depression was getting worse and I had no ambition to do anything except lay on the couch and watch tv. I also had increased thoughts of death. This medicine also increased my heart rate. I was only on this med for 11 days but decided to stop because of all the negtive side effects. Also, I read all the reviews about the horrible withdrawal symptoms from this drug (even if you miss one dose) and it scared me. I was uncomortable taking a drug that my body could become so dependent on. I might as well have been given crack as far as I am concerned.
Depression	tsweetsunshine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/8/2008 8:52:46 PM	I started this medicine for severe depression collapsing on the floor and not being able to take care of my kids! My Dr.Finally talked me into trying a med. I noticed within 1 day a HUGE difference! WOW I was normal, woke up feeling great,more patient and happy. I was able to spend the time I needed with my kids and life after seperation with hubby. I so would have had a better life if I took this drug when I was a teen I am 38 now. I have been on the effexor xr for 4 years and do have extreme night mares and grinding my teeth but I had some before the drug,I can live with that. I am now going through divorce and find myself needing to increase the dose from 150 to 225. I do notice that with coffee or sudafed I get hyper and irritable. So I am concerned that I am leveling off I  am experiencing social anxiety and OCD a bit with saddness , who knows I will see my Dr next week. My sister age 38 has been on the effexor ER for 6 years and loves it! My other sister age 17 is doing so much better in her life,I truly believe this drug is great if the benefits outweigh the risks ya know?! 
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	Kimberly, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/8/2008 5:30:05 PM	I also experience anxiety and panic attacks.  I have been taking effexor XR for approx. 2.5 years. 225 mg/day.  I am questioning the difference I might feel as I believe the VA has mistakenly (what a surprise)prescribed the regular effexor vs. the XR version.  Anyone know the difference in the way I might feel if they had switched?  I recently moved and am seeing a PCP who I believe nonchalantly made a mistake.  By the way, of all of the anti-depressants I have taken in the ssri group, the effexor belongs to the ssni (neouptake inhibitor) works best for me and I have actually lost weight.  Thanks for any help.

Depression	t-ray, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/7/2008 9:11:20 PM	i am a 34 yr old female who has suffered from major depression for about 5 years and effexor xr is the first medication that actually worked, it is the first medication that actually made me feel happiness and joy that i had been unable to feel for many years, it has in my opinion saved my life and given my sense of self back to me. it took about 7 days before i had felt anything after treatment started and i take 150mg every day and fully intend to take this medication for the rest of my life. it honestly saved my life because before i started this medication i honestly could not have continued living the way that i was before, i was empty and actually had no feeling at all in me but sadness, anxiety and dispair. i have no idea why i became so depressed in my late 20's it was after i gave birth to my last child and i know that as a teen and in my 20's i suffered from mild depression that progressed to the deepest darkest place that i have ever been and have no intent on ever going back there.

It worked well; my hot flashes all but subsided within a few days.  However, now a few years later, my blood pressure rose very high(up to 240/150) over the month of April 2008 with headaches and loss of conciousness twice from blood pressure elevation while driving.  I am now not allowed to drive, climb ladders, steps(which means I can't sleep in my bed but fold out couch which is uncomfortable, mow grass because of the possibility of passing out. This is horrible since we live in a small town 1/2 hour from nearest medical facility.Within the past month, my blood pressure meds have been increased or new ones added multiple times to try to lower my pressure.  In the meantime, multiple tests were done for the obvious reasons for high BP---all negative.  These included brain tumor, adrenal tumor, kidney problems, hormonal. Last week of April and beginning of May had adverse effect from a blood pressure med causing my pressure to drop up to 100 points which caused me to pass out and to be hospitalized for IV fluids to bring my pressure back up to 100.  It was like a yoyo.  Horrible month.In hospital for another battery of tests, with all negative.  Effexor stopped and most of BP meds stopped.  Then blood pressure was too low.  Am now very tired, shaky, lip tremors, antsy since med stopped after tapering.  This is not worth the hot flashes--I would rather have them than what I have gone through the past month and half and more since I can't drive.

Bipolar Depression	Laura, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	5/7/2008 7:21:53 AM	The problem was that it was too easy to use and not easy to stop using.  It has created side effects worse than the depression I first started taking it for.  I now have episodes of extreme anger, and self harm and fear that I may one day harm one of my young children.  I am very distressed with the fact that I have tried to taper off and have severe withdrawals.  I am more depressed because of the side effects and withdrawals than I was before I began taking Effexor. I wish I had sought a more natural approach to depression such as diet changes, exercise, and support groups.  I am disappointed that my insurance will pay for this drug and not for the herbal supplements that have been more effective and not detrimental to my health?  Why do they allow me to take a medication that is causing me physical and mental harm and yet shun the very things that could improve my health in every arena?  I am angered that I have lost ten years of my life and have damaged the relationships with my loved ones due to side effects and inability to quit taking this medication. Those who promote this drug need to know that I fully regret taking Effexor when there are other avenues. More natural, healthy and effective methods should be actively encouraged before prescribing such a  damaging drug. This should be a LAST alternative, if not totally banned.

This makes me want to sleep alot and I feel kind of unmotivated I guess . I still feel depressed but not as bad as before taking this. I did experience some stomach upset but its gone now . I think I may have gained weight . Overall I feel its helped I feel calmer . I am scared of coming off the drug now because of the reviews I have read .......

Has helped me w/ my depression, shyness, and anxieties. I have to keep the dosage low because the Effexor causes extreme shaking of my hands, to the point I can't hold a spoon or write. I also gained 20 pounds in a month and it has not come off. My sweating was reduced thanks to Effexor. After so many years it does not seem to be helping me as much as it used to. Need to go back to Dr to try something new. 
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	5/4/2008 11:33:00 AM	Was placed on low dose for depression in 1999, over past 9 years went to 75mg, then 150mg, but side effects scared me. Went back to 75mg for several more years.  Positives - no noticeable depression.  Negatives:  Insomnia, anxiety, vivid &amp; strange dreams, severe headaches, lashing out at loved ones, night sweats and diminished sex drive. Finally had enough and wanted off.  With doc's advice, was weaned to lower dosage of 37.5mg, then advised to take 1 XR every other day until the drugs were gone.  It's been 2 months and I've noticed fewer headaches and less blurred vision; slight increase in sex drive. But, I am dealing with increased anxiety and almost hypersenstive emotions - quick to anger; quick to cry.  Can't bear the idea of going back to drugs so I'm exploring other ways to deal with this.  Please explore other methods of dealing with your depression or anxiety before becoming too dependant on a &quot;magic pill.&quot;  
Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	5/3/2008 9:38:51 PM	I am not only dissapointed with this medication, but I am also diturbed by it. I lost best friends, fell into the wrong croud, and fell totally behind in school. I grew up singing, dancing, and involved myself in art all my life until soon after I started taking the meddication. Coming off the meddication I did what my doctors told me to do, but during the intense withdrawl I tried to committ suicide three times - something totally out of character for me. I have stablized somewhat now, but I am still fell the both harsh physical and mental pain and frustration coming off of it. My doctor didn't think twice when she raised my dose after I became severly depressed and cut my arm open to such an extent I passed out from blood loss. I never felt that way before the medds. During this time I never thought something could do so much damage, and I trusted my doctors and parents. It's sad to think of myself naive when I decieded to finally try meddiction to help my at the time non-sucidal depression. My mom went on effexor to and I feel like I dont even know her any more. So far no one I have talked to believes me or cares to hear about the situation. This drug has piosoned my life, and it scares me that other people could have half the problems I did with it. For this drug to be put out on the market makes the world of XR even yet worse than it already does. This cover-up attempt at &quot;wellness&quot; is just another drug deal except now the government can claim their share half publicly. Drugs are not disapearing any time soon, but this is rediculous.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	MeBooNZoo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/1/2008 9:38:07 AM	All my life I have suffered from depression, anxiety, anger and ADD.  I have tried Zoloft, Wellbutrin, and Prozac but they just didn't do the trick.  Effexor XR has made me a new person with zero side effects.  I felt better from the first day I started the 37.5 dose and I'm now at 75. Along with ALL my symptoms being relieved, I have the added benifit of reduced hunger and carb cravings.  For the first time in a long time, I don't obsess over food, feel like I'm starving even though I just ate or only feel satisfied eating high carb things.  I sleep better and wake up refreshed.  I've never felt so normal and productive in my life!  I'm drinking more water, I'm more motivated which means more active and in 2 weeks, I've lost 7 pounds without much effort or depriving myself. I've read all the horror stories on the net and just thought this medicine needed some positive feedback.  Just because it gave you some horrible side effects doesn't mean it's bad.  It just means its not for you.  Please don't use scare tactics to keep someone from trying it as it could change their life they way it has mine.  I am aware of the withdrawal symptoms but because I feel so much better, I look forward to taking my pill in the morning so I don't miss a dose and I never plan on going off of it.

Was prescribed Xanax for panic attacks and have used it nightly to sleep. Have lost 15 lbs in 2 months and appetite just now returning. Not fun to wean off of- dizzy, strange dreams, etc and gastrointestinal trouble.

Panic Disorder	justfyne, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/28/2008 12:14:55 AM	Taking this for depression and anxiety. My anxiety attacks stopped almost immediately. I still get depressed, but only now usually before my monthly cycle which is common for women. I have more energy and way more patience. I too have the &quot;zaps&quot; when I miss a dose. The major downside for me to this med. is the weight gain. I've gained 17lbs in 3 mos. However I must admit my diet is not good so that probably has alot to do with it. I started out taking Celexa first, that helped a little with the depression but did nothing for the panic attacks. This drug has worked great for me. But keep in mind, everyone is different. What works for one may not work for another. I would also like to add its the combination of this med. and intensive counseling that has helped me. Just taking medication without getting to the root of your depression and/or anxiety attacks is just going to leave you going in circles.

I was constipated not just for days but weeks.  I tried everything and the only thing to ease it was enemas which was not pleasant by any means.  I also could no longer enjoy even half a glass of wine because I would be violently ill for an entire day.

I became very depressed during my recovery.  Effexor did help me.  I did however have many of the side effects mentioned.  Low sex drive, migraine, dizziness.  That was not as bad as going off of Effexor though, I am now off for 6 days. I am very foggy, dizzy, tired, and everything I eat, drink comes out the other end.

I was even having bouts of crying and feeling like I just couldn't do anyting right.  My self-worth was nothing.  After I was diagnoised, I immediately started feeling better.  No side affects.  Thank God for this medicine.

Depression	USMC wife, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	4/25/2008 12:22:50 AM	I have been taking Effexor for 12 days using the 35mg/75mg 2 week packet.  I have definitely noticed a huge difference in my thinking.  I have suffered from mild depression since a young child but finally seeked medical help.  At the moment my mind wants to drift to negative, pesimistic thoughts I can literally feel Effexor perk me up.  Unfortunately, I am also beginning to feel the side effects.  For the past 2 days, I feel like I am extremely hungry one minute, and within a split second I'm nausious.  For the past 5 days, I have been experiencing dreams that range from weird to deathly scary.  Within 3 days of my first dosage, I could tell my sex drive was gone.  After reading the numerous comments (good and bad) about Effexor, I have decided to come off of it.  Luckily I haven't been using it for very long.  For anyone considering Effexor, I strongly suggest that you do your homework on this medication; and if you do decide to try it, promise yourself that you will not let a doctor tell you that you need more mg to fix the problem.  Trust yourself and listen to your body.
Panic Disorder	sheree,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female		4/24/2008 10:14:39 PM	I can not afford effexor for I lost my health insurance, and I can not come off the meds.

I have tried celexa, and other meds, but I start getting dizzy, lips go numb, heart palipations, fingers tingle, and am in the fetal position crying, and unable to control the shakes.

Depression	 Female  (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female		4/23/2008 10:04:00 PM	It has worked alright. I was just wondering if ones body gets used to the drug after using it for so long (in my case 6 years) that it starts to not to work as well. If we need to switch to a different brand of medicine. Maybe our bodies need a &quot;break&quot; though it probably would feel like hell from medicines. Start again at a smaller dose.

It helped greatly while taking tamoxifen for 5 years with menopause symtoms.  I came off Effexor XR in the 6th year...Oh My Goodness..was awful!  In 6 months of being off the RX I felt awful again.  Was put back on, feel fine except for one thing....My short term memory suffers, and seems to be getting worse.  I only take 75 mg Effexor, .88mg of synthroid (thyroid) and infusion of reclast once per year for otheoporisis (chemo/radiation backlash).  Does anyone know of any of these Rx's having a memory loss effect?
Depression		5	5	4			4/23/2008 11:09:34 AM	I just wanted to give an update on my experience with this med after having my dosage increased from 75mg to 150mg.  I am still very satisfied with how this medication has helped my depression and my ability to deal with things.  The major side effect I have noticed is stomach problems.  I had severe cramping for the first week after the dosage increase and problems with reflux.  The cramping has subsided and antacids are helping with the reflux.  I forgot to take my medicine yesterday and I suffered!!  Night sweats like you wouldn't believe and yesterday I was ticked off at the whole world.  No fun.  I fear the day when I decide to stop taking this med, I guess I'll have to take it for the rest of my life.
Other	stummee, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	35-44	4/23/2008 9:57:32 AM	Anytime a drug lists tons of side affects on a medication it makes me question it. I have a family history of having high cholesterol and it surprised me that my doctor increased my dose to 225 mg. Grrrrr! Case studies show that Effexor can increase cholesterol and triglyceride levels. My cholesterol has gone up 25 points and triglyceride level went up 100 points. I don't think doctors really look into the effects of medications enough! I'm tired of playing doctor with myself and doing their job. I'm the one who has to look into drug interactions and side-affects, they don't. Also, I found out you are not to mix it with Zyrtec because it increases somnolence. I was wondering why I was extremely tired and dizzy. Again, I had to play doctor with myself! I am tired of it!!!

I have taken effexor XR for almost 8 months. It has made my condition a lot worse. I ended up severly depressed and hospitalized for a suicide attempt. My dose was then increased. I'm currently still depressed and I am having a difficult time doing anything. I'm in the process of getting off of Effexor. I tried to stop cold turkey but had really bad withdrawal effects including dizziness, headaches, body weakness, and low energy (flu-like symptoms). I was unable to get out of bed and ended up sleeping for 3 days straight! I could not function so I'm back at the 300 mg dose. I'm going to try and get off of it slowly.

I am now finding it has really bad withdrawal symtoms. I'm dizzy alot and find myself feeling &quot;out of&quot; it. On the medicine, I was moody all the time, would snap at my kids for no reason, and overall was worse than when I started it.

I am married and have 2 boys (15 &amp; soon to be 12).  This is my second round of Effexor XR.  I took it a few years ago and had no problems with it.  I started taking the 37.5mg Effexor XR packet that increased to 75mg.  I feel I have more patience with everything than without E XR.  Some of these people are talking about 300mg.  I would hope I won't need that.  After reading all of these reviews, it really makes me worry.  I have lost weight - which I welcomed.  I don't really atttribute my other &quot;symptoms&quot; as side effects.  I do get headaches - but I had them before.  I probably do have a lower sex drive, but I have other worries - money and such - that all of that combined is probably part of it.  I do feel like a better person.  Believe me - I don't need medication enough to gain 25 lbs!  I hope I can continue to fair well with this.

Depression	elephantlover, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	1	5	Female	25-34	4/21/2008 5:48:53 PM	I've been taking effexor xr for 7 or 8 years. It has worked wonders, but in the long-term I find that the side effects become overwhelming. I'm now maxed out at 300mg and have severe withdrawl symptoms every night. Because the med makes me a little hyperactive, I take it around 2:30am so that when it reaches full strength in my system it's time to wake up. The bummer about this schedule is that I have terrible nightmares and the worst night-sweats (soaking my sheets and pajama's) because of the withdrawl symptoms. If I miss a dose (god forbid!!) the withdrawls are crippling - headaches; shooting electricity type feelings originating from inside my skull and radiating out into my entire body; drastic mood swings; violent outbursts and uncontrolable anger; feeling unawake and groggy. This is just a partial list. I would like to taper off this medication, but I'm afraid of the withdrawls. Effexor has been great at treating my depression and helping me to take control. If anyone has successfuly gone off of effexor, I would appreciate any tips or advice you could share.

Had to move up to 150mg due to unable to cope. Seemed to work okay. though when I would miss a dose if I wasn't carefull would end up in the ER. This med lets you drink way to much alcohol with little or no effect. Also takes away all sex drive.Trust me. Just had to come off it.The longer you take it the worst the coming off is.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/19/2008 3:15:36 PM	I have been taking this drug for over two years now and am extremely satisfied with the way that it works for me. The withdrawl effects however are VERY hard to handle. I would caution anyone going on this drug about the withdrawl symptoms. My experience includes intense mood swings, very strange dreams, headaches, general depression symptoms, crying, lashing out at loved ones, violence to name a few. All of this on just missing one pill. I have also taken a couple of drug tests since being on Effexor and have NOT had a positive result for PCP or any other narcotics as reported from others. If you take this drug and need to take a Urine Analysis then disclose that you are taking the drug!  
Depression	NoOrdinaryGirl, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	4/18/2008 2:00:43 PM	Effexor- I've tried it, tried to come off of it, and come back again and again.  It keeps me functioning, and that's a big plus.  On the down side, withdrawal from Effexor is pretty tough- nausea and dark moods/anger- even if I miss one dose, it happens.  If you do taper, work with your doc, and GO SLOW!
Depression	sam, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/18/2008 10:12:48 AM	I have had a very good outcome with taking this prescription.  I have been taking anti depressents for several years now and effexor had helped in many ways of hostility and anger I would go into.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	4/18/2008 12:06:04 AM	I have been taking 75 mg of Effexor for about a year and a half. I have loved everything about the medication. I have generalized anxiety disorder as well as social anxiety. I have had these symptoms my entire life but I started to have frequent panic attacks, so I started to take this medication. (I have tried several other prescriptions but this one worked wonders for me!) I now suffer less anxiety attacks, I have become more outgoing and less nervous in social situations and my mild depression has diminished. The down side to this was the fact that I have gain a significant amount of weight (25lbs) while taking Effexor and decided about two months ago that I wanted to try life without it. I have been having the worst withdrawals!! I started to take it every other day and would feel constantly slightly dizzy throughout the day. But I pushed through it and it is now IMPOSSIBLE to try and take it every three days. My body is physically addicted to this medication! I can not explain how awful the withdrawl symptoms are. My head feels fuzzy along with my vision, I have awful headaches and feel so dizzy it makes me extremely nauseous. I just lost my insurance and had to pay $150.00 for the prescription because I can't make it three days without taking it. This is a great medication but the symptoms and side effects are tough to deal with. 
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	4/17/2008 6:05:08 PM	I switched from Zoloft to 75mg of Effexor XR about 6 months ago and I have been very happy with the results.  Insomnia is a problem however and I have to take Ambien CR to sleep and I have some mild sexual effects.  Headaches are a problem if I miss a dose.  In my opinion the benefits of this drug far outweigh the side effects.  My dose has just been increased to 150mg due to some mild loss of effectiveness at the lower dose, but given my current life circumstances this is not surprising.  Since starting Effexor I have lost the weight the Zoloft made me gain, I have less social anxiety, and I am able to deal with things MUCH better.  I am generally happier with life in general and I would recommend this medication.

Depression	IBburnedout, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	4/14/2008 7:58:21 PM	I tried Effexor as my 9th drug attempt. Sadly, instead of getting relief, I ended up with what felt like a psychotic break. I had severe mood swings, moving between a complete lack of emotion and severe crying spells. I couldn't control my emotions, I couldn't make decisions, I ended up almost attempting suicide (my friend caught me). I ended up in the hospital because of this medicine. As soon as I stopped the medicine I started feeling better. By far the worst and scariest reaction I have ever had to a drug, and I have had lots of horrible ones.

I just thought I was just an emotional person. But when uncontrollable crying started to occur for no apparent reason, I sought help. It was effecting my job, my family, and my activity level. I found myself opting out of social engagements simply because I never knew when I would break into tears.I've been taking 37.5 dosage of Effexor for 2 years. I was worried that I would be emotionally dead. But that hasn't occurred. I still find myself in unexplained emotional moments, but now I can get it under control. My family life, work life, and social life have dramatically improved. I'm no longer the introvert that I had become.I do have very vivid dreams, but no problem sleeping. I did gain weight, so I increased the length of my daily walking routine and that helped. I have noticed less sex drive, but now that my husband and I recognize what's causing it, we're able to work through it with no problems. I do get hot flashes, but I'm learning how to deal with that, too. All in all, I'm a much happier, even-tempered person. It's a relief. Effexor is simply be a part of my life from now on.

I suffer from Anxiety and this only made things worse.  It didn't give a  calming feeling like the medication I am taking now.  The worst part about Effexor is the when you stop taking it!! The withdrawal symptoms are TERRIBLE.  I missed work because of dizziness and horrible, uncontrollable mood swings that affected my ability to do my job.  PLEASE ask your doctor and research the withdrawal symptoms of Effexor- I did this after taking the medicine and not before, so now I am paying for it.

Not hot flashes, these were worse. Got worse when I winged myself off of them. I would stand on my back porch in freezing weather for 20 minutes before I could cool my body down. 
Depression	 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male		4/11/2008 9:01:54 PM	Effexor XL worked wonders for me.  I really felt normal.  The only draw back was sexual side effects.  I was a very happy person without a sex drive.  I had to change meds.  Now taking Wellbutrin XL.  Not feeling that great but sex is great!!

Stopped cold turkey last week and my emotions/rage have been out of control, along with the brain/ear &quot;zings.&quot;    Glad to know others experience this, too.  Am going to try to stick it out for another week and see if it gets better.  please email any advise on withdrawals to emerson279@yahoo.com.  thanks.

The combination of Lamictal 200mg and Effexor 37.5mg has finally helped my mood swings and depression. Various combinations of other meds failed to work.

Depression	Lloyd, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male		4/9/2008 7:50:37 PM	I came from a family with a lot of mental disorders on my mothers side. Of my 81 years of age, I have been depressed for over half my life. I have been through all kinds of depression medication. So far I believe that effexor has helped me more than the others. Not wanting to be on medication, when I started feeling better I started cutting back on the dosage from 5 tablets of 75mg to 2 tablets of 75 mg. This was without my doctor's approval. While on a trip, I ran out of medication for about 3 days. I went into a deep depression which I describe as a living hell. After I saw my doctor, and he chewed my ass out for cutting back on the medicatin without his knowledge, he thought I would be on the maximum amount and dossage the rest of my life.Rather than going back down into that deep dark valley,although I dont feel that I am complety over my depression, I wil stay with his recommendations.
Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	35-44	4/9/2008 6:57:16 PM	I have had depression for as long as I can remember and was diagnosed with it early in my adult life. I had been through prozac, which I loved at first, but after a few years lost its effectiveness. Apparently antidepressants do that after prolonged use. I have been thought Zoloft, Wellbutrin and I think Cymbalta, I'm not real sure about Cymbalta.Anyhow, the Effexor has been working, I'm actually taking its generic version Veneflexine (I think that's how it's spelled)  It was slow to work at first and I think my Dr got a little crazy with the dosages as he had me taking 5 pills a day. Although I convinced him I could get by with less and I'm taking 300 mg, or 3 a day. It's somewhat inconvenient in that I take 2 in the morning and 1 at night, but aside from that I have been happy with it. No real side effects, possibly insomnia, but I've had that before I started taking it.I just know what I was like before I started taking it, and what I'm like now and it does work. I never really had a major problem with anxiety, perhaps once very rarely usually situational in cause, however I can't say that I've experienced in anxiety since I've taken it, but then again haven't had much situations to cause it either....whew!I personally would give the medication a thumbs up.  It does work, however everyone's wired slightly different. So if it doesn't work, don't give up on your treatment. There are a lot of medications out there, and keep searching until you find the right one, it will definitely make life worth living again.

Also, the withdrawal symptoms are the absolute WORST!!!
Panic Disorder		1	5	1			4/6/2008 2:00:15 PM	I have anxiety issues and was put on effexor xr after trying citalopram. Effexor is for bipolar/depression.. I am not depressed, and my anxiety has gotten worse. My insurance wont pay for it, and they wont even approve it. I have been on this about 2 months and they keep giving me samples so I dont have to just stop taking it.. but my anxiety is soo bad, this just sucks. Plus I feel stoned and dizzy all day. Lame.

I'm not sure if my anxiety causes my depression or the other way around. But I've been dealing with both for many years. I began Effexor XR at the lowest dosage, then increased to 75. Used that dosage for a year. Just recently increased to 150. The reason I tried the increase was because of anxiety. At 75, it helped with most of my depression symptoms. However, I still needed to sometimes take Ativan for anxiety attacks. At 150, Effexor seems to be helping with my anxiety problems as well. I would not take drugs for mental health unless my situation was serious. I have two children, marriage and a full-time job.  With help, I can handle it all.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	4/4/2008 8:12:53 PM	I took my first dose in the morning, by that night I was in the hospital.  I was not able to sleep, extremly nervous, sweating, almost passed out, blurred vison, chest pains, very thirsty, and the list goes on.  It really scared me, I wouldnt recommend it.
Depression	Flash, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/3/2008 5:15:55 PM	I have been taking Effexor for about 4 years now and I'm very pleased with it.  I was to the point of losing my job due to my inability to control my attitude and anger at work.  I started at the smallest dosage and had to continue having my dosage increased until I hit 300 mg a day which works just great for me.  I have had no side effects; I drink a glass of red wine every night with dinner, have no problem with my sex drive, and an advid walker.  This pill has saved my career!

After I tried to harm myself for he put me in the hospital. This was my second trip. My doctor started me on 37.5mg then 75mg now it's being incressed again. So far I no longer want to hurt myself and I am more able to listen to my 10 year old and I feel calm, maybe to calm. So far this medication seem to be working, I just wish I didn't have to push myself to have moor energy. After I do something like clean the house or go shopping I am so tired. My husband helps me alot.

Since taking 75 mg twice a day he has been a pleasure to live with. It has also helped with the nerve pain. His side effects are loss of sex drive , constipation and headaches when he doesnt take it at the smae time every day.

It took me 2 months to get off of it and the withdrawl symptoms were so bad I thought i was going crazy. I was switched to Prozac and have been fine ever since. I do not recommend Effexor to ANYONE, its a terrible and addictive drug. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	4/1/2008 5:02:34 PM	Effexor XR has made my anxiety double. I'm in a constant state of paranoia and I feel like I'm stoned 24/7....like my head is in a bubble. I am even scared to drive. I am experiencing the same side affects as others have previously listed.... tremors, skin crawling, trouble sleeping, horrible nightmares, always sweating, feels like I am going crazy!!!I've been on this for almost 2 months and I  am seeing my Dr. tomorrow because I need to be taken off of this. PLEASE BE CAREFUL if you are considering taking this medication!!!! I regret not reading the reviews prior to taking effexor!

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	shell, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	3/31/2008 6:50:54 PM	I suffer from anxiety, panic attacks and NOW depression. I was on Lexapro for about 2 years and I felt &quot;normal&quot;. I miss that. I guess my body got used to it b/c I started getting the same episodes back. So my Dr. switched my medication. I have been off of Lexapro for a few months now and I have been on only 75MG of Effexor XR for about 2 months. I feel worse than when I started. I am 26 years old... I'm engaged..and I have absolutely NO sex drive at all. My mood swings are indescribable. I cry more now than EVER before. Whats worse is that my anxiety has doubled since starting Effexor and I have become severely depressed. I feel like I am in a fog... like I'm &quot;drugged up&quot;. I am always nauseous, I have no appetite. I am always sweating, feel shaky, I can't sleep anymore... I am a mess. I am experiencing feelings I have never felt before. I know these drugs are not overnight wonders... I know I will not feel better overnight. But I also know, I shouldn't be feeling as worse as I am. After reading all of the comments, I have made an appointment with my Dr. I need to be taken off of this ASAP!!! The side effects are just making me feel worse. I feel like hell.
Depression	Effective, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	3/31/2008 6:30:24 PM	I have had no problem with Effexor XR, it fact it is a life saver to me. I was suffering from severe panic attacks and did try to commit suicide. I have been on this medication for 5 years now. I am 59 years old, and suffered from depression since my 30's. My only warning about this medication is DO NOT RUN OUT OF IT, always make sure you have your prescription, just one day without Effexor and it feels as though electric shocks are going off in my brain every 2 to 3 minutes, I cannot relax but I am able to focus. It is not a pleasant experience, so I always make sure I don't run out of it.
Depression	silvero333, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	3/30/2008 11:00:58 PM	I started taking Effexor at 14 for Major Depression. The dosage was increased steadily until I switched to Zoloft at 21. While I credit the Effexor with helping me avoid survive my depression, it wasn't until I stopped taking it that I realized the severity of the side effects. From the age of 14 to 21, I experienced no sex drive. I would not recomend this drug for teens.
Depression	Dwayne, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	3/30/2008 2:17:37 PM	For about 3-4 years I was on 225mg a day then it started not to work as well then I started to not care if I lived or died, very lethargic,apathetic about everything and unable to function working (basically the same as before I was taking the meds).  I am now on 300mgs Efexor and 300mgs of Wellbutrin a day and am ok again. However, with the increased meds I do suffer with some ED and lack of sexual desire and some lack of overall emotions.  So beware at about 3 to 5 years as you may need an increase in dosage(not just me, read through the reviews and you will see). The &quot;great&quot; thing about efexor if I miss a dosage after about 4 hours extreme headaches and dizziness remind me to take it. I do not look forward to the day I ever try to get off this med, as just taking a pill late can give me such a killer headache, and taking the dose does not immediately take it away. So even if the drug works well for a long time, keep an eye on yourself as you may need an increase later on!

Have been on 300mg for most of that time. Major side effects for me have been SWEATING, constipation, trouble sleeping and decreased sex drive. Dr. prescribed Trazadone 50mg to help with sleep. Did need to lower my dose to 37.5 mg for two pregnancies and didn't seem to have major issues at the lower dose.

I have had SAD but it was never dianosed as such until three years ago. I have had anxiety that has effected my life for many years and chronic depression. Nothing has made much of a difference. In the past three years on Effexor XR I have experienced a steady improvement in my relationships with my family and the people I work with, both clients and staff. The greatest change has been in the last year. I am excited by the world and nature and people for the first time in my life. I have finally found something that works.

I have had terrible side effects and weaned myself off of it, and am having withdrawal. I have never felt this bad in my life. I called my ins. co. and complained to 8 people over a period of 6 weeks, before I could speak to a supervisor.I will not tke a drug made in a foreign country in light of what has just happened with heprin. As a result of taking the generic,I felt like I was leaving my body physically and mentally. The generic form of Effexor just about did me in, as I was told I had to tke 150 mg.of it to get the same benefits of the brand. I was also  told that paroxitine was a generic for Effexor. I worked in the health care industry for over forty years and know better.How sad that we have people deciding what meds our ins. will pay for who have no more drug education than this.Because I still work, I do not qualify for a $0 copay and because my ins. will not pay for the brand. The brand Effexor was on the formulary at the beginning of 2008, but disappeared a week after I tried to fill my Rx. I guess i grew up in a time when peoples lives had some meaning and money wasn't the priority.

Depression	ARJ, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	4	5	Female	25-34	3/28/2008 9:07:33 AM	I found myself in a DEEP depression after my sister was killed and after a period of time, I decided that I could not handle my feelings alone, and that the way I was acting was NOT fair to those I loved-so I sought MEDICAL HELP! It came in the form of Effexor XR Oral and counseling. My recover has been very effective, the counseling is progressing forward, and the Effexor XR has helped level me out and return me to the type of person I WANT to be and not always mean and hateful, It has also allowed me to better deal with my loss, it will never be completely okay but I can better accept it (most days) and get through the pain.

I started on 75 mg and finished with 150mg.  I too had a Dr. that just wanted to keep uping my dosage.  I have lost 3 jobs because of &quot;my attitude&quot; and still don't qualify for disability.  Without insurance I can't afford this medication and have tried to wean off.  Only to be very sick.  Dizzy doesn't explain it.  It's very scary and my Dr. had no clue what to do the last time this happened.  So this time I didn't waste the money to go see her.  I don't want to leave the house for fear of anyone seeing me in this state.  I feel helpless.

I started at 75mg, but I had extreme dissiness and a &quot;floaty&quot; feeling so for the next week I only took 32mg. Each time I went back to the doctor and I would tell him I feel no different he increase my MG. Now I am taking 225mg and I really want to try something else but I am really scared to stop. One night I forgot to take it and I woke up at 5am in extreme pain (headache) like I've never felt before. It felt like my head was going to split open. I am very disappointed that I fear coming off the drug

Doesn't make any sense to me. But I do have a few side effects,major watery eyes for most of the day early morning touch of diaharrea, still not much energy at all , still only one friend in my life , no desire to leave the house, I'd rather get some one else go to the store for me, low self steem still,so I guess I am satisfied with it since I've never taken anything like this before , nothing to compare it to.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/24/2008 1:41:52 PM	My docotor told me to try effexor because I was complaining that I often felt angry and had trouble contolling it.  She started me out on 75 mg.  It made me EXTREMELY tired all the time.  It also seemed to lower my sex drive.  She told me I needed to increase it to 150 mg.  After about 4 days of 150 mg, I noticed no change and was still always tired and yawning all the time.  I decided to stop taking it all together.  The fist day I stopped taking it, I had a horrible headache.  The second day I felt nausous.  The third day I was vomitting.  Today is day 4 and I am starting to feel better.  I was only on Effexor for about a month and regret ever taking it.  HORRIBLE DRUG!  I can't believe my doctor prescribed this for me!!!  I wish I had read these reviews before I took it!

He always wanted to increase the dose instead.  Finally, after losing my job I told him I could no longer afford it and he put me on generic Wellbutrin.  I have felt absolutely terrible physically as a result of stopping the Effexor.  Hopefully this will pass and I will be free of antidepressants soon!  Wellbutrin is easy to stop.

I have almost no anxiety.  I have also lost all cravings for alcohol.  I am even returning to things I used to enjoy and feeling more balanced.  I feel like a normal person again.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Shelly, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	35-44	3/23/2008 5:04:35 AM	BEWARE~ I Had to stop taking Effexor XR 150mg abruptly (did not have the money to get my prescription). I have experienced EXTREMELY HORRIBLE side affects. My brain feels like I have an electrical shortage (7 days--continuously). My family is falling apart because they CANNOT help me. I hurt all over--from head to toe. These &quot;jolts&quot; in my brain make me feel awful, which naturally alters my mood because there is NOTHING that can be done to take this away! Not to mention that after I started taking Effexor XR several years ago, it decreased my sex drive; resulting in difficulty having an orgasm (something I did not have a problem with before taking Effexor)!  I have no desire for sex, even though I find my husband so very sexy! Additionally, I struggle with constipation; have abnormal dreams; weight loss was great (at the beginning) but not withstanding; my cholesterol and blood pressure have been up and down like my weight; and I forget a lot details and dates (something that is not conducive to my family or profession). There are times I feel like in my effort to try to minimize my anxiety, I developed something much worsean Effexor XR addiction!  If you plan to stop taking Effexor XR abruptly, I strongly urge you to consider the side affects (withdrawal symptoms) with your doctor. I do not know how long this will last, but I am fighting it--barely. I feel completely helpless against these symptoms, and I do not ever want to go through this again.

I was leary but is has worked very well.  Suggest others looking to get off Prempro talk to their doctor.

My hot flashes were out of control and my life was miserable. I was constantly turning my fan off and on at my desk causing a lot of embarrassment. My sleep was constantly disrupted. My cancer was not estrogen receptive, but since I tested positive for BRCA1, I was unable (nor did I want) to take any type of estrogen. My gynecologist prescribed Effexor XR and within a very short period of time, the hot flashes disappeared by at least 95%. Thanks Wyeth for making this drug available to those of us that need it for this reason!

It seemed like after a few years that it wasn't working as effectively with my monthly PMS,too.  The doctors asked me if I wanted to increase the dosage(sure glad I didn't).  Now five years later, I want to discontinue taking Effexor and I feel horrible.  I have been decreasing the dosage as my doctor instructed and only stopped taking it all together for five days and feel HORRIBLE.  I have all the symptoms that everyone else describes.  It is really sad to hear that one writer says he/she feels the withdrawal symptoms still have 6 months.  I wish I had known about the terrible withdrawl symptoms when I first started taking it.  I would have reconsidered.  I would definitely tell anyone out there to try other anti-depressants before taking this drug.  My doctor is putting me back on the low dose 37.5 mg because of my symptoms.  I am determined to get off this drug sooner or later.  I think I will try the antioxidants that other writers have been talking about and perhaps suggest to my doctor to take Prozac.

My father is also and has been most of his life. My sister told both dad and I that we needed to check into some type of drug that could help us through our every day living. We were both prescribed effexor and it has changed our lives. My father calls it his &quot;happy pill&quot;! We both feel that this drug has changed our lives and outlook on life for the better.

The start-up side effects weren't bad, a little weight loss, night sweats, loss of sexual desire. THe kicker is coming off this medicine.  Wish I had been warned of the withdrawls.  Nausea, whirling, forgetfullness, exhaustion, moodiness, crying, blurry vision, dizziness, the list goes on. A friend told me when I decided to stop taking the medicine that it would be hell - wish the doctor had told me that when I started taking it. They got me - either I pay the extreme monthly cost (since there is no generic and I have no rx insurance any longer) or I suffer the withdrawls.  If you plan on taking this drug - get informed first.

I have not had any major side effects or issues with the medicine. it has helped my energy level and concentration. i feel happier than i did when i started on effexor..i call it my happy pill. My mother tried the medicine but she could not tolerate it at all. One thing to keep in mind is that you need to make sure that you take it everyday and do not run out...withdrawals are horrid...imaginge your whole body feeling like u just hit your funny bone...that kicks in for me if i miss more than one day.

I have been diagnosed with &quot;double depression&quot; and the Effexor XR really helps me control the symptoms of these two types of depression. However, if I dont take the drug within 8 hours of normally taking it or I forget all together, I have bad withdrawl symptoms...crying,over emotional, nightmares,night sweats

Depression	ohbiteme, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	3/16/2008 10:25:11 PM	I've been on Effexor for over four years.  The dosage was increased 12/10/07 to 225 mg / day.  My psychiatrist pulled me off the medication as of 3/5/08.  I'm going through some serious withdrawals due to the elimination of this medication.  I'm in a partial hospitalization program for treatment of bi-polar, however, I was told there was nothing that could be done regarding the withdrawal symptoms.  Everyone I've talked to say that quitting Effexor cold turkey is EXTREMELY bad due to side affects.  I hurt from hair to toe nail.  I experience &quot;jolts&quot; in my brain; I have constant ringing in my ears; my mood changes are awful.  If you are ever instructed to cease this medication immediately and abruptly, I strongly urge you to discuss the side affects (withdrawal symptoms) with your MD--it's the hardest thing I've ever done and I don't know how long it will take before the medication is completely out of my system.  I feel completely helpless against these symptoms.  I don't ever want to go through something like this again.

My Dr. finally put me on 75mg XL and within 4 days I could tell a difference. I have some GAD, OCD, and depression with insomnia to boot. This medication has help so much!! I take it every night before bed and it has defiantly helped with the insomnia.  I'm a nursing student under enormous amount of stress and I am able to function fine. In the 7 months that I have been on this I've had no panic attacks and no depression that has effected my daily life. I can't say enough good things about this medication.

I hated it at first because all I wanted to do was sleep all the time, but then my MD told me to take it at night and I'll tell you it has made a huge dofference in my life, it works great for me. No side effects when taken as PERSCRIBED. I did forget to get my RX refill at my MD's office one friday and went all weekend without it and I can honestly say I'll never forget again, it was a hell weekend.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	3/16/2008 7:19:23 PM	It worked extremely well at first.  I took it because I was having difficulty handling my 3 yr old ADHD son and a marriage filled with a lot of conflict.  After a while some of the despression came back but the rage and anger I felt during PMS has not come back.  After about 1.5 yrs I went down to 32.5 mg because I noticed at 75 mg I just didn't have much ambition.  My house wasn't as clean as I wanted and I just didn't get much done except what absolutely had to get done.  I feel better on the 32.5.  After about a month adjustment..I am back to feeling pretty even most of the time...still feel PMS some but it is manageable and I have much more energy to do things and I feel more organized than I have since I first started taking it.  Right now...the 32.5 works well for me.
Depression	Courtney, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	4	4	4	Female	55-64	3/16/2008 7:04:37 AM	I took Effexor XR for 9 years.  I decided to go off of the drug, cold turkey.  During the process I went from crying all the time.  I couldn't say anything without crying.  My brain felt like electroyde were going off all the time.  I felt very bad.  The worst thing that it did was take away my taste buds for over a month.  I couldn't taste ANYTHING.  I found a web site that mentioned this reaction and showed it to my doctor.  He called the drug company.  They were not aware of this happening.  I had printed out the artical on the web site and the drug company were really surprised.  I'm off on Effexor XR but couldn't handle the return of depression and anixety so am now on Lexapro.  Not sure if I like it yet.  I've been on this a year.
Depression	philwzen, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	45-54	3/15/2008 4:27:07 PM	Oringinally presribed for depresion over 12 years ago. It has an immediate effect  20 mins afer taking first dose i was laughing !!! longer term removed some of the deperesssio and most of the anxiety sysptoms. Caused high blood presure and increase in weight, total suppression of any sex drive, impotence. benefits did not last and extreme discontinuation symptoms when trying to stop even though tapered off over several months and finally replaced with prozac which was then tappered off as well. withdrawal symptoms persist still after 6 months of not taking effexor. one dose of prozac or effexor removes symptoms immediately so not a recurrance of original problem. i Would only recommend using effexor as a last resort it is virtually impossible to stop taking it once you start. Withdrawal efects i have had are worse than original problem. I now have severe confusion, mania, violent outbursts and physical manifestations include dizzyness , trembling limbs, sweats, stomach problems. The original depression is still present and the anxiety is if anything worse. however i have been on virtually all the different types of medications in the past 30 years and effexor was the firt to make a difference, but at what a price?!.

It felt like I was having periodic heart attacks.  Initially  I was prescribed Zoloft, but totally freaked out with the side effects.  I have been on 75 mg Effexor for two months, with great results.  No more chest pains!   The only side effect has been minimal constipation. Many have mentioned how hard it is to get off.  I don't really care because I haven't felt better in years.  So if I'm on it for the rest of my life....

Terrible whirling feeling.  I have taken this for 7 years.  This is the second time I've tried to get off this drug.  1st time the doctor and I assumed that I just wasn't ready and the symptoms were the depression.  This past month I am going to get off the medication come hell or high water.   Enough is enough.  I feel terrible, have gained 50 lbs since I started it, problems with blood pressure and I see someone is having issues with liver.  Bingo, so am I.  Don't know quiet yet, I am being tested.I feel like hell right now.  Body aches, ringing in ears, whirling ,felling like crying, bolting,  almost like a flu, muscles hurt.   But have reading all these reactions, I am going to give it all I have to get off of this stuff.   Aren't the drug companies at fault for this kind of problem.  I was not told, read, heard anything that this was a possibility.   I would have tried something else for the depression.  I glad to see that I'm not alone, but also sorry to hear so many are having the same problem.  I tried to tell my doctor that I read how difficult it was to get off this, but she said, yes you can.   I didn't think to ask, at what expense.   On the flip side, if she didn't give a positive attitude you might wallow in that idea.   All in all, this stinks.   I feel like hell and hoping that I'll make it out of this drug.All the best to those who are trying as well.Kathie, NY

I have recently decided to go off since the side effects are not worth the effectiveness. I began clenching my chaw constantly, I was very lethargic and yawning all the time, and my ability to concentrate and remember things was impossible. I have begun going off the pill. Since I was at 75mg XR, I began by opening the capsule and removing 25-30 &quot;beads&quot; each week. I am half way there! I'm glad to see that people are taking fish oils as well because I also take 1200 mg a day and I believe this has helped tremendously. Good luck for anybody trying to go off!

Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	3/11/2008 11:45:35 AM	Have been taking 225 mg of Effexor XR daily for 18 months. Have had many of the same side effects others mentioned, but the one bothering me most (and the one least mentioned by others) is memory loss!  Words are completely lost to me at times...I know the word I want to use is somewhere in my brain, but can't come up with it.  I mix up words, forget names, can't remember where I put things.  Sense of time also seems &quot;off&quot;.  Something that happened yesterday can feel like years ago and vice versa.  More tired now than ever.  I could sleep most of the day.  In general my mood is much improved, but sometimes I feel like I'm loosing my mind.  My husband says I've improved incredibly on Effexor, so I guess I'm staying on it. I'd like to think there's something better out there, but I'm afraid of withdrawing from Effexor.  Have been on Prozac and Paxil over the years before switching to Effexor.

However, even though I feel I no longer need it, I'm afraid to stop taking it, especially when I am reminded of the horrible withdrawls I will go through.  Just missing one pill makes me feel awful, so I'm scared I may be taking this forever.

I have been coming off it for about 2 weeks now and I feel like a junkie.  I've had nausea, and something that feels like muscle spasms in my brain.  I have noticed that my vision isn't what it used to be but I thought that was just because I am 41 now, but after reading other experiences I am thinking it may be because of the effexor XR I was only taking 75 mg daily because I couldn't stand the 150 mg my doctor suggested I go up to.

I felt extremelly hot in my chest area and the only way to stop that feeling was to jump into a cold pool or take a cold shower.  I did not see any changes accept that my attention was more on how hot I was feeling than anything else.

Depression	CAM, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	55-64	3/9/2008 11:57:29 AM	I was on Prozac for fibromyalgia when some life changes left me very depressed.  Dr. changed me to Effexor 9-10 mo. ago.  Recently started having (panic or anxiety?) attacks and crying alot.  Saw ad on TV for study on people on Effexor &amp; having these symptoms.  I put 2+2 together and called Dr. to go back on Prozac.  Nurse said &quot;no problem with withdrawl, stop now and start Prozac in 4 days.&quot;  Withdrawl symptoms started 2nd day (nausea, ringing in ears, pain all over).  I found this website and started crying!  I'm not imagining things! Thank God! I would never have started this drug if I had known that stopping it would be so miserable.  I'm going to get the Prozac filled NOW.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	lawstudent, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	3/8/2008 2:46:26 PM	this has really worked for me; it has relieved the stress and anxiety associated with it so I can function in a marriage with an alcoholic and going to law school while working full time. I understand there are side effects when you drink too much, already been there, and with withdrawals. I do not intend to stop in the ext couple years so the standard dose of 75 mg is ok. It is helped me remain calm and handle situations previously which would have become physically violent.

Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	25-34	3/8/2008 2:09:08 AM	I was givin this drug for minor depression.  If anything it just made me feel numb to my emotions.  I understand the need for mood stablizers, but I feel they're made available too easily.  Doctors seem too ready to hand out medication to mask the problem rather than work it out.  The worst part of this drug (beside the minor, but annoying side effects) was the withdrawl.
Depression		3	3	1			3/7/2008 12:23:51 PM	Do NOT take this drug. It worked while I was on it for a while. Then I began to feel flat and couldn't experience any type of emotions. I couldn't be happy or sad. My doctor began to taper me off of it and it's been hell.I NEVER would have taken effexor to begin with if I had known how severe the withdrawal symptoms were. I did fine tapering off until I quit altogether after being on the lowest dose for 2 weeks. I can't function, I can't think, I feel dizzy, hot flashes, headaches and I pretty much just feel like I'm going crazy. I felt better being depressed. I have a whole new respect for drug addicts. If detox is anything like this, no wonder the relapse rate is so high.
Panic Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/7/2008 10:00:53 AM	I had previously been on Paxil and Zoloft.  Neither of which worked as well as Effexor.  I had no real side effects going onto Efferox which was great.  I always hated going onto something for my anxiety and panic attacks only to experience worse ones for the first couple of weeks.  I did not feel emotionally numb which I have experienced with other drugs.  I did have some trouble sleeping at first.  Unfortunately they are taking me off of the Effexor because it caused hypertension, my blood pressure has skyrocketed over the course of the last couple of weeks.  All in all I am sad to see Effexor go I am very happy with it.  
Depression	JJor, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	35-44	3/5/2008 4:06:38 PM	I took this med for a little over 3 months. The fatigue it caused overshadowed any benefits. I was up to 150mg for over a month. I tapered off over about 1 week then went off completely. I had no side effects from stopping. However, I have since read that taking fish oil and B complex can help ease the bad mojo while getting off this med. I just happened to have been taking these supplements for years, so maybe this helped?
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	JW, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/4/2008 10:26:18 PM	Effexor XR changed my life. Going on 6 years taking it, and I even reduced from 150mg to 75mg a few years ago. I have trouble with the sweating and a little sleep trouble - but I am more than happy to deal with that rather than the panic attacks and fits of rage, depression and hyperness... I live my days very calm now, and my relationships don't suffer anymore. I can't imagine going back to those extreme highs and lows.  The only thing I worry about are the long term effects - I would eventually like to trial a 'natural' solution, but for now I won't risk the contentment.
Depression		2	5	2			3/3/2008 11:01:37 PM	I meant to add that my doc mentioned if I had any real problems coming off the Effexor XR she'd put me on 20 mg of Prozac daily for a week and then discontinue all meds.  With the very long half-life of Prozac and its active by-products you'll come off very gradually without having to do anything else.
Depression		2	5	2			3/3/2008 8:37:38 PM	Wasn't working well, so decided to try and get off it after a couple of years.  Awful!!  So I'm now trying again, reducing dosage by dividing granules in 75 mg XR capsules, taking 37.5 mg for a week, then about half that or 18 mg for a second week, and then zero after that.  I read several posts in rx.com that people were having success boosting their antioxidants during coming off Effexor, so I'm also doing that and having a much easier time of it this time around.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	35-44	3/3/2008 1:09:22 AM	i have been taking the medication for about 6months. In these 6 months i have gained 25lbs,lost my desire to have sex, sleep late  and have no energy.   if i skip a day, i get so dizzy it cancels out the effectiveness of the medication because i worry if there is some thing else wrong with me. I think its time to change.

Depression	Tracy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	3/2/2008 12:29:51 PM	This medicine worked well for me. I took 75 mg for about a year. I have been trying to get off it for 2 weeks and it's the WORST thing in the world. Please do not take this medicine if you have other options the withdrawal side effects are not worth it. I am so dizzy and disoriented I can barely function to go to work. It also caused me to gain 25 pounds in a year. Please ask your Dr. about the effects of getting off thid drug before you start taking it. So not worth the withdrawal effects.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/2/2008 10:43:33 AM	I've lived with chronic depression my whole life.  I have struggled with it, tried to get help a couple times but it never worked.  I was always cynical about anti-depressant drugs but after having bad PPD I knew I had to try something.  This drug has made an amazing difference in my life.  It doesn't make me feel like a zombie like other ones had.  I can think clearly and I'm not constantly worrying.  My whole life has improved now that I can see through the fog.  I feel like I can get through each day better.  I'm more able to appreciate what I have.  It's done wonders for me and for my family.
Depression		5	4	4			3/2/2008 2:17:44 AM	I have been on and off Effexor for over 11 years. It does an excellent job on GAD and Depression. I feel better within the first week, only side effect is drowsiness, but it goes away in time. I usually will take it for a couple of months and then wing off of it when i feel better. The best way to get off Effexor is take a low dose of prozac for a couple of week, this really does help with the withdrawl symptoms..

I started in a low dose and gradual increas until I was at a level that decresed my symptoms. I have had no side effects from this medication and I now can sleep thru the night without having to get get out of bed to change my p.j.'s I had my doubts about taking this but now Iam glad I did.
Depression	Physiology, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	65-74	3/1/2008 6:12:12 PM	I too was having a terrible time trying to get through the terrible withdrawal symptoms after several years on Effexor. I am now taking some OTC items which are helping tremendously. I saw that some people trying to escape the Effexor demon were taking fish oil supplements and multivitamin/minerals, so I'm now taking Organic Flaxseed Oil and a Mega Vitamin/Mineral Complex with an additional boost of B-Complex Vitamins which I purchase cheaply with very low shipping costs from http://www.VitaCost.com. Some treatment programs are stating that with the depletion of antioxidants, one needs to add a product such as gluathione supplementation. This is also available from VitaCost very cheaply. I've added another super antioxidant, Acai pure freeze-dried pure organic powder from Amazon Thunder, the provider of Acai for the Oprah Show documentary. I take my scoopful daily in juice, but some people like it in applesauce, yogurt, etc. It has no sugar added and is completely organic. It's available from http://www.amazonthunder.com/members/coonmartranc h. I've been using these dietary boosters during the entire time and will continue to do so for several months after I'm completely off the Effexor as my withdrawal symptoms have been minimal. Let me know if this suggestion helps or not. Best wishes.........

I have taken one pill, felt like I was going crazy last night. My tongue feels swollen, and my pupils were dialated. I also had a dry mouth and lack of taste when eating. I will not take this anymore after reading everyone's reviews. Thank you everyone!

Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	2/28/2008 6:29:44 PM	I have been taking this drug for almost 3 years.  It has helped me be more productive and less anxious.  The side effects when I run out of pills are terrible, including extreme sleepiness, horrific nightmares, and dizziness.  I cannot believe that this drug was approved because these side effects are so bad.  I am very afraid to change meds because of these effects.  
Panic Disorder	Jodi, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	2/28/2008 5:47:36 PM	I was on effexor for about one year.  I took it for a panic disorder. my panic 'attacks' make me very sick to my stomach. I was on 37.5mg dosage which is not considered a theraputic treatment, but i am a small female.  the effexor was good for me for the first few months until i experienced uncontrollable crying and mood swings.  Before talking to my dr.  in a rage one day I threw all of my pills away and have refused to take them since.  withdrawing from the medicine was one of the worst things I have been through and I was only on 37mg .  My advice is if you want off this medicine please talk to your doctor first.  I would not recommend this medicine to a friend or worst enemy for that matter.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	2/26/2008 5:44:27 PM	So I take this for symptoms of anxiety and depression. It's amazing what it has done for me in terms of treating the depression. I've been on it for almost 6 years now. The thing I absolutely HATE about it is that my body is physiologically dependent on it. Like other users, if I don't take it within a 36 hour window, I begin to experience terrible withdrawl symptoms. It feels like a really bad flu. There is dizziness, nausea, and aches/pains. I really don't like the fact that I've become dependent on the drug. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	2/26/2008 5:23:41 PM	The Effexor itself works wonderful.  The withdrawal symptoms are terrible though.  I feel like a druggie not being on these.  Dr.s really should warn people about the horrible withdrawal affects on a person taking this med.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Kimaro88, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	45-54	2/26/2008 2:19:00 PM	This medication helped my symtoms at first but then I found that if I didn't take it right on schedule I would have severe headaches and nausea. I would feel like I had a hangover which would keep me from taking the dose even longer since I was vomiting. This is a very bad trip...I had to decrease dosage and switch to another drug to get away from the misery. I am now dealing with things but at least I'm not tied down to a medication that can mess up your life that quickly. Good luck to thoughs that decide it's time to get off it:)

I have had a recent severe panic attack this week. Also for the last month my depression has worsened. I,also, experience dizziness, severe headache, nausea, blurred vision, and now an increase in anxiety. I also am depersonalizing again and feeling out of control..like I am loosing my mind. My doctor just tells me to take Xanex round the clock but will not take me off the Effexor. I am going tomorrow to see him and make the necessary changes I need to overcome this..including switching medications.

It was great for the hot flashes, but it caused me to gain 35 pounds in a year.  Gradually coming off of it has been horrible.  I needed Prosac to lessen the withdrawal symtoms.

I have noticed some sexual side affects as well which I am not thrilled about I will give this one more week or so and then I dont know what? it is very tiresome...the constant question on my mind is whether or not what I think and what i do is normal, but these days what is.good luck to all and if you think you will have trouble getting off go to an inpatient hospitol where you can be monitored.oh and i have noticed my vision getting worse! never linked that to this med till now thanks for the posts!

It helps my depression really well but I have to take it at EXACTLY the same time each day - I get a splitting headache if I am an hour late. Also, if I miss one daily dose, I have terrible nightsweats that night. Occasionally, I still get that helpless feeling for no reason - sort of bummed about this but it is much less often than before taking meds.

Depression	Deb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/22/2008 9:00:53 AM	I took Effexor for a couple of years, it made me feel great, my depression got so much better.  When I decided to come of them it was aweful, it took me about 3 months before I felt normal.  The feelings I had coming off them were unbalancing, dizziness and weird feeling in my head.  I would never again take Effexor as when I first starting taking them I lost some of my eyesight and now 2 years after coming off them my eyesight is returning.  I have enquired about this and have now been in touch with someone this has happened too, if this has happened to you I would love to know.

I also have restless legs which have been getting worse and that may be because of effexor. I am thinking about getting off it. Can anyone with RLS and GAD tell me how it is with them?
Depression	riverwalk, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	2/21/2008 4:19:21 AM	I despise effexor and the way it has made me feel for over a year, but I can't stop taking it because of what happens to me when I stop.  I am trying to go to half a capsule and feel better already.  It never worked as an antidepressent, plus I lost all sex drive and have twitching and agitation and higher anxiety. I despise it. My psychiatrist says just keep taking it.

Depression	pamntx, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	2/20/2008 2:12:46 PM	Before I go on I want to give my email address because I need help/answers quickly. It is welchdn1953@aol.com. This is my second attempt to try and take Effexor XR. I was on Wellbutrin and Paxil. Over a month ago I started taking effexor, my doctor told me to wean myself off wellbutrin, so I have slowly trying. Back to effexor, I don't like it and would not recommend it to anyone. I have had suicidal feelings, frequent crying spells, so tired, anxiety worse, affraid to make decisions, paranoid, burden on my family and a constant feeling of despair and hopelessness. I tried to relate these feelings to the only person in my life who would listen (my sister) and it only back-fired on me. My wording is all off and I'm so scared. I'm getting off this stuff or I'm just going to lose it. I live alone and don't have anyone close to me (got my sister mad) and afraid to go anywhere or be around people. Can anyone tell me how to do this without feeling crazier than I already feel? Please help!

I have been taking this dosage for approximately three years.  I asked my doctor about getting off of this drug.   His suggestion was to take 37.5mg every other day for a month.  This is what I am planning on doing.  I was wondering if anyone had any problems or side effects getting off of Effexor XR completely?  Thank you.
Depression	harley mama, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	2/19/2008 11:38:08 PM	I have taken Paxil, Zoloft, Wellbrutrin (that's one suicidal med) and Effexor. My spouse told me &quot;it's all in your head&quot;, so I quit taking the effexor and I could feel myself going down and down, would cry if someone looked at me wrong. About the third day off Effexor my husband asked me &quot;What is wrong with you?&quot; Told him that I had gone off the antidepressant and needless to say he told me &quot;to go back on it.&quot; Which I have and I have been taking it for the last 3 years and it's helped more than all the others, but I still think I could be happier than I am. I'm always being told to laugh to smile, but it's not in me. But the most important thing is I am not as suicidal as I was once.

Depression	TF, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	2/19/2008 6:25:13 PM	I have been on this since early Jan. 2008.  firtst the lowest dose and now have been on 75 since the last week of Jan.  I did notice a change, but I did not lose ANY weight!!  actually gained some.  My mood is better (much better) BUT, I still lash out verbily and then feel calmer after.  I want off this drug now and maybe back on Prozak.  It's 1 forth the  cost and I think it works better, just not faster.I have noticed my memory has been slipping lately.  Like I have been forgetting works that I know easily.  I have been dizzy, bad dreams, even good dreams.  Dreams I haven't been able to finish for years.  but, these side effects, and the withdrawl symptoms, are what  is going to make me quit everything all together.  wish me luck!!TF
Depression	sokermom5, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	55-64	2/19/2008 1:12:12 PM	I've taken this medicine for about 2 years.  I'm up to 300 mg in the morning.  I guess it's okay, but I'm sick of taking it.  After reading the stories of withdrawals, I don't know if I can stop or not.  This medicine just makes me feel blah - not happy, not sad - just like I'm a lump taking up space.  I took many other anti-depressants and they didn't work.  I also take an anti-anxiety medication which I like and would continue to use.  I just wish to quit taking Effexor.  If I didn't have to work, I would definitely do the cold turkey way.  I would think long and hard about taking this medication.  I had no problems at all coming off the other anti-depressants.
Depression	nk, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	13-18	2/19/2008 1:40:51 AM	Ultimately, this drug sent me from a state of depression and anxiety to a constant state of suicidal behavior. Also, this drug was very difficult to discontinue. I'm 18.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	2/19/2008 1:01:49 AM	Just thought I would write an update: I went off this drug cold turkey 11 days ago.  I had terrible withdrawal symptoms: severe mood swings, crying fits, brain zings. Now, 11 days later the side effects are finally subsiding.  I notice the reduction of these side effects maybe 2-3 days ago, and now they are almost gone.  So, if you have gone off of Effexor recently and are suffering, please hang in there...it does get better.

Depression	leetlebitt, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	2/18/2008 4:18:39 PM	I just read a million posts explaining the same exact thing I am going through.  I have been on this medication for a few years (I think) and I have experienced weight gain, I have no sexual desire at all and I still get/have (less frequent, however) really bad despair, crying fits, I cant get out of bed to save my life, I am constantly tired or completely wired, I sweat pretty badly (which is really sexy for a girl)and I can be pretty moody. I experience the dizziness and tingling in my head, face, tongue, arms, etc if I miss only one dose.  This is not a good drug for me anymore.  I hope that I will be able to transition to something better.  I am getting married in May and I can't risk having anxiety and depression get to me at a time like this.  Any suggestions for a transition treatment?
&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs	Ancaster, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	2/18/2008 9:30:44 AM	I wrote of my experience on day 5 and remember just wishing someone would write further into the withdrawl.  I am now on day 20 and things have really improved. It was not until day 17 that I actually noticed some of the symptoms that were always present, had minimized.  I did try Benedryl and it helped the dissiness for me. I also take Omega 3 along with vitamins and alot of water, and working out a few times a week. Things are so much better than they were a week ago.  I still have a way to go...but after feeling so horrible ...this is a relief that lets you believe there is light at the end of the tunnel...in my opinion, this drug should NEVER be prescribed for Menopause Symptons or for the depression associated with it...the withdrawl effects and prior side effects are far too extreme...I weaned down 6 months at a time to the lowest dose and it was still overwhelming coming off this last dose...my heart goes out to those beginning the cold turkey phase...but know that at the point you're sure going back on it will be better, that if you persevere you will be free of it's horrible hold on you...I am hoping for the symtom free day ... but right now this is sooooo much better....

I also take Adderall 20MG. I havefelt great taking these medications! Diagnosed with ADD/Dep/Sad I have feltthat I cope better than I would withouthaving them. For the first time EVER Imissed 2 days in a row. Wow, I could notbelieve how TERRIBLE I felt....thats whyI decided to check out what others were saying about this drug. Very vivid strangedreams, night sweats,aggitated and a generalfeelings of despair are the symptoms I experienced!! I am addicted to this medication without being aware of it formany years. I have not noticed anything decribed as the head-tingles. I will continue on these meds as long as I feelmy quality of life is better day to day!!
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	25-34	2/16/2008 6:10:10 AM	Been on it for 9 years. Was a pain at first with the side effects and the 4 weeks it took to start working. I gained 30 lbs in 3 months. Had decreaesd sex drive for the 1st 6 months but was able to combat that with wellbutrin and viagra. Dr. tried once to take me off it by gradually decreasing dose and then taking one Prozac on the last day. Had the common withdrawl symtoms and the anxiety came back. Love this drug because it gave me a normal lfe back. At first it was rough going but for the last 8 yrs I have had no side effects except for extra wieght I battle to keep off. My brother is now on effexor and has only had a decreased sex drive. Would definately recommend giving this drug a try if your doctor suggests it.
Depression	melanie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	2/16/2008 12:44:59 AM	I don't like being on this drug.  I have experienced the withdrawl symptoms more than once.  I am concerned if this drug is doing is damage to my body.  I have had weight gain, headaches.  If I don't take this by a certin time everyday I feel the withdrawl symptoms that day. It also causes severe constipation, tiredness, low sexual drive. When most doseage was raised to 150mg I felt more suicidal for quite a while.  Please consider other medications before trying effexor xr.
Depression	Helen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/13/2008 10:31:44 PM	It's helped a great deal!  I still have bouts of depression, PTSD, and GAD but not nearly as many as before I started taking Effexor XR.  I can vouch for the horrible flu-like sideaffects of not taking them.  I ran out when there was a mix up on my mail order perscription.  I didn't take any for 2 days and the 3rd day I felt like I had the worst flu in the world!!!!!  Fortunately my perscription came that day.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	2/13/2008 10:52:59 AM	I was on Effexor for about two years, it really helped my feeling down a lot. But starting around my 2nd year it became increasingly hard to exercise, I felt tired all the time and running a mile was terribly hard.  My heart would beat so fast during aerobic exercise that my instructor was concerned. I went off cold turkey when I was without insurance. I would have bad headaches and numbness and tingling in my fingers and lips.  I now get extremely bad headaches and still my chest feels funny at times.  It was helpful at first but I am worried that it cause some serious long- term damage.

No where does it tell that you will cry, feel like you have the &quot;flu&quot; and have zinging pains in your head. Scary stuff!!!
Depression	doin alright, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	35-44	2/13/2008 5:04:06 AM	My doctor took me off Paxil several years ago when I began having some anxiety attacks. He instead prescribed Effexor. 3 words. LUCY, SKY, DIAMONDS. When I wasnt so paraniod I was staring into the mirror thinking &quot;I know you..Im inside&quot;, I was trying to mask out the sounds of little girls singing like on a playground with a soft orchistra in the background. I would run to the bathroom several times a day and look at that poor guy in the mirror having a bad trip and say &quot;I'm you and your messed up&quot;. When I called my doctor and said what was going on he said &quot;double the dose&quot;. For some reason I didnt think of it but after crying for 48 hours and begging the doctor to stop it he just said &quot;dont take anymore&quot;. In 7-8 hours I was fine. daaa. oh, and all that happened in 4 days. Going back to Paxil was like inviting in an old friend....  
Depression	Healed4good, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male	35-44	2/12/2008 9:46:00 PM	Treatment wasn't bad...until I decided to go off of it. I was given a heavy dose 300 mg/day. On it for ~18 months. Started to reduce the dosage and what I call 'neurochemelectrical discharges' started zapping my brain. It was tolerable and expected. Kept reducing the dosage slowly as directed. Finally made it down to 37.5mg/1x day and the 'neurochemeletrical' circus was raging...but slightly tolerable. Went totally off and felt like I was back in college having the worst psychadelic experience of my life. Called the Dr. and picked up two more titration packets with the 37.5s and eased them back in and then started staggering them every other day and longer. My brain finally settled down a little. I was ready to stop again, and did so. I was still seeing (and mostly feeling...tracers) but they were tolerable. I was off for 8 days...yes 8 (eight, 7+1, etc.) so it was out of my system but the psychadelic party was still going. I broke down and took a 75mg capsule I had...just in case... Bottom line. THIS STUFF IS REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET OFF OF! Please consider this if your Dr. suggests it. Believe me, I know how bad things may seem, but please consider all options. I now have to start the original (or generic) Effexor at 25 mg for 7 days and then split them to 12.5 mg for 7 days. I am pretty tough (now anyway...) by most standards but this (withdrawl) is, in my opinion, worse than depression. I know how to take care of that now without meds. Just please look into it before getting on it.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	2/11/2008 12:12:15 AM	I took this for 6 months to for migraine prevention.  It did a great job of preventing the migraines (only one in 6 months compared to 3-4 a month before I started taking it.) However, I put on 20 pounds since I started taking it.  I am not a tall person, so the weight gain really shows and REALLY bothered me.  So, I decided to go off of it.  I went off cold turkey 3 days ago and WOW what a surprise. I have been having estremely severe mood swings (not good when you have 3 children under the age of 6), crying at the drop of a hat, and a weird buzzing in my head.  I thought I was having a nervous breakdown - I couldn't figure out what was wrong with me.  This whole episode has scared me (and my husband.)  I just now have read all of the posts regarding withdrawal symptoms and am so thankful that they are there and that everyone has shared their stories;  now I know that there is a reason that I am acting so irrational.  I just hope the withdrawal symptoms end soon. 
Depression		3	3	3			2/10/2008 9:25:14 PM	I have been taking this medication for about four years now. While taking the medication, I have had the dosage adjusted several times. The most prevalent side effect for me was hot flashes and weight gain. Under medical supervision, I tried to decrease the dosage of the medication in an attempt to ultimately stop taking it. Yet, as the dosage was decreased I found myself becoming more depressed and even suicidal. Therefore, I had to increase the dosage again. I feel that this medication has contributed to my hypersomnia. However, my doctor disagrees. I will continue to seek a change in my medication. Yet, I will continue to take this medication for the time being. I take three 75 mg tabs once a day.

Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	19-24	2/9/2008 4:36:20 AM	Well I took this drug for a month and the side effects are not worth taking these med. I got on wedmd and read all these disturbing review and decieded to quit the drug on my own (cold turkey). I was a little scared and it was a long week, i felt sick but the worst was these brain zaps everyone is talking about, it felt like you would be doing something and someone would punch you in the brain or loose a few moments of lost consciousness i cant really describe it, but thats how long it took me to feel no withdrawls. I also took benadril when i felt bad and that helped. It also mad me feel like i dont need a drug to enjoy life. So im happy im off of effexor it wasnt for me.. 
Depression	CJ, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	2/9/2008 4:21:23 AM	I am a recovering alcoholic and suffer from depression.  I have tried:  Zoloft, Paxil, Wellbutrin, Lexapro.  None seemed to work.  I have been on Effexor for about a month now, and this is the best I've felt in years, if not ever!  It really is helping me!!

I may have missed several dosages do to running out of RX.The following symptoms started. In addition to ringing in both ears, I have sounds in my ears or brain sounding like two or more short circuit connections, (NIT NIT) every so often. I also feel slightly dizzy. Making me think I may have high blood presser, but results of taking pressure were normal. I had bad dreams and could not sleep. I have been very depressed, crying  and tired. After taking and continuing my EFFEXOR XR these symptoms faded away.

I stopped taking and blood pressure leveled off and my head cleared up. I thought I had a brain tumor or serious problem with my head and it was obviously the effexor.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	2/5/2008 12:22:43 PM	I began taking it for about a week and had horrible nightmares and sweated alot at night. I would wake up every morning at about 3:00 am and could not go back to sleep. I had horrible dry mouth and could not sit still throughout the day. It was hard to focus on my work. Sometimes I feel like my body is becoming numb. I have lost my appetite and feel horrible when I don't take it for one day and I just started taking it. This shows how addictive this medication can be. I'm going to stop taking it already.
Panic Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	2/5/2008 8:19:15 AM	This medication drove me CRAZY! It made me feel like my heart was going to explode! I was very high, cleaning, I couldn't control myself. For like 5 hours, like I was on speed.  Then Bam I was so depressed I felt like there was no way out.  MY doctor says I'm 1 out of 150 people this has done this to.  I thought Effexor was going to litterly kill me if I took it one more time. I only took 5 doses, and it had this effect on me.  I think it can be a very dangerous drug, exspecially if you may be bipolar.

I have found the constant worrying chatter in my mind gone. I can focus, my irritablity is gone, and my suicidal thoughts have disappeared. I am still not the happiest person in the world, but boy....I would never go off this if I had to go back to the way I was before. I don't notice missing 1 pill to much, but 2 for sure. The world is just a little &quot;off&quot;.  I too am nervous about ever getting off this after reading the withdrawal issues. But I am very happy I found this medication when I did.  I was put on Welbutrin too for anxiety, that did help and I just stopped taking it when it was time and I was fine.

I was on a very low dose and it has been terribel weaning off it.  BAD withdrawal effects.

I have spent the past year trying to wean off  of it.  This has been a difficult process due to the side effects that present themselves.I stopped taking the lowest dose 5 days ago and it has been such an unpleasant experience, I would never recommend taking this product.  I am glad to have read others experiences...I would like to read where someone can express when this stopped for them.  I've learned I will pay more attention to what I take before I take it.

Effexor XR seemed to really help me. It's not always pleasant - I have withdrawal symptoms if I miss a dose, which is probably the worst thing that happens. I think I may have a slight decrease in sexual desire, but not much. What I have recently noticed as being an actual side effect, however, is sweating! I thought it was just due to being overweight, but apparently it is one of the common side effects.
Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male	25-34	2/2/2008 12:13:12 PM	I've only been on this medication for five days, and already I'm experiencing some rather unnerving side effects.  I take 75mg once every morning.  I have been increasingly fidgety, and there are times when I can't stop tapping my feet.  Sleep is more difficult.  My doctor says that this is normal when starting Effexor and it will go away within a week or so.  I hope he's right.  I've never had such strong side effects from a psych med.

I wrote earlier about having the severe pms..........well my Dr. told me to just stop taking it. OMG!!! I have been so sick for 3 days. Let me tell you about it. I have brain zaps so bad that I have to sit still and cant get up to do anything. The 2nd day w/o the med I cryed for hours. Im now on the 3rd day w/o it and I can talk right, I cant function right, I had to call my Dr to get something to relax me so I could get through the day. I now am on Zanax just to help me get through the day. I cant sleep. Oh and did I mention once again, the brain zaps. These things are just unreal. They are happening about 15-20 times in one single minute. Its aweful. I really would love to know when this is gonna quit. I want everyone to know I really wish I would have checked the med out 1st or at least got on here to read about getting off the medicine.  I have to say this is one of the worst things I have ever gone through in my life. It makes you wanna cry because I dont know if I will ever be normal again. Ive asked the drs and the pharmacist about these brain zaps and they say they dont know what Im talking about. PLease someone tell me if they truely end and when. Or if theres any relief from them.

This medication not only isn't working well on my depression, but the side effects are horrible. I'm dizzy during the day, have night sweats where I wake up drenched and have headaches every day. I'm definitely switching to a better medication.  Of course, after reading about the withdral sysmptoms, I'm a bit nervous.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/31/2008 12:58:14 AM	I have been using Effexor XR in conjunction with Klonopin for anxiety attacks that started 2 years ago (I take 300 mg at night).  I tried Zoloft first, and it was great for the anxiety, but gave me the attention span of a gnat.  Unlike most of these reviewers, I take it at night, because it makes me sleepy (it has really helped me sleep well, actually).  I am weaning off the Klonopin now, because the XR has been really effective.  I have not experienced sexual side effects or weight gain on this drug - the only noticable side effect I've had is dry mouth - and that just makes me drink more water, which is good for you anyway.  The best thing I've done besides the medication for anxiety is quitting the caffeine entirely.  If you have any kind of panic or anxiety disorder, this is probably the best thing you can do for yourself after getting medical help!  And even though I am not very &quot;new agey&quot;, I've taken up Kundalini Yoga, which focuses primarily on breathing (good for when you're feeling anxious) and Hatha Yoga (which is great for relieving stress).  Try it, you'll like it! While I was happy with the zoloft besides being a bit flighty, this just goes to show that if the first drug you try doesn't work, there are others to try - don't give up!  Be honest with your doctor, and you WILL find something that helps you!
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	wisconsinite, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5		45-54	1/30/2008 10:44:43 PM	Been on Effexor XR 75 mgs for about 2 yrs for anxiety which I suffered from since 5th grade.   It completely changed my life.  Don't obsess about little stuff anymore, I feel more alive and in tune that I have in a very long time. Dry mouth side effect is a small price to pay.  Helps my peri-menoupasal symptoms also very much. I sleep very well. I can tell when I've missed a pill.  I tried Zoloft and Celexa before being put on this and neither had the effect the effexor has. To those who have been on depression anxiety medication that hasn't help, ask your Dr. to switch you, it's worth trying more than one kind.  It's been a godsend for me.
Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	1/31/2008 12:52:17 PM	The Effexor has helped my depression very much but the side effect of sexual dysfunction is troubeling.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	1/28/2008 9:01:20 PM	I was on Effexor for a year and 3 months at dose of 150mg/day for treatment of depression and it did little to help me.  I was weaned off the medication, but the withdrawal was very difficult.  For those that are on this medication, all I can say is please be sure to wean off of it slowly when it's time.  The process is difficult, but by the 8th day or so, you will start feeling better.  I still experience the &quot;electric shocks&quot; in my head from time to time, but that is the only side effect left after 4 months.  I am physically better and much happier being off the Effexor.  It was a bad experience.

I have been getting more side effects now!  I have trouble sleeping and the dry mouth is worse.  I have night sweats and a desire to chew ice. The side effect that is really troubling in inability to orgasm which I also had with Celexa.  Latley my urine has a peculiar odor.  I don't know if that is from the Effexor or not.

I have read a lot about the drug and am slightly worried about when it's time to come off it. I have missed a pill here and there and I do notice that I missed it. I get a little sluggish and a slight headache. But nothing that is terrible to deal with. My mood swings have become much more manageable. I have noticed a big change in my appetite (I eat much less than before). I haven't had an libido problems at this point. Overall this has been a good choice for my depression/schizophrenia.

I suffered a back injury that has rendered my extremely limited in my mobility causing weight gain. The effexor has been wonderful. Not only am I sharp, alert and focused, I am happy, upbeat and energetic. Initially I had trouble sleeping and felt strange the 1st 2 weeks but I can't imagine going back to who I was before this med. I do get minor headaches if I don't tkate my dose when scheduled. It helps to take it spread out during the most actice portion of your day as to not hinder sleep and take advantage of the alertness. Love it!

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/25/2008 5:45:46 PM	I was put on Effexor for hot flashes and depression.  I was on it for about a year with no improvement other than diminished hot flashes.  The whole time I took this drug I experienced zaps in my head, flatness, and I felt like a zombie.  I quit cold turkey and it took several months for me to feel better.  The zaps in my head, nervousness, and feeling out of my skin  was much worse after I stopped for a couple of months.  I know you are supposed to slowly wean off, I tried that with the same results.  I am glad I am off it, am amazed with the ease that this drug is prescribed and would not recommend it for anyone.  It was a very unpleasant experience for me.

My doctor put me on this drug. I felt odd initially for the first 2 weeks or so, but since then I have been back to myself - if not better. I been on this for 4.5 yrs, and at a 75mg dose I take nightly. I have missed the odd pill - no problem. I'm in no hurry to go off this drug as long as I feel this good. Plus I NEVER want to feel like I did prior to taking the drug. I'm so glad I recognised I was depressed and took myself to my doctor.I do get night sweats - I sometimes sleep on a a towel.My vision has changed, but having a baby caused the same change in vision. It's been fantastic for me and my family and friends

Have been gradually increased from 75 mg/d to 300 mg/d of Effexor XR and have noticed only 2 things: it is an awesome appetite suppressant. I eat less than half of what I did before starting tx :) The only other thing is that since being on the drug, I have resumed self-harming after stopping for a year. Related? No improvment in any depression or anxiety symptoms
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	1/23/2008 5:29:20 PM	I've been on it for 5 years since Celexa made all my symptoms worse.  It's worked incredibly well to get me over my anxiety (I had to leave public school then but recently graduated from college in a different city).    Now I'm having panic attacks and mild bouts of depression again and found out it's not good to be on it if you're under 18.  I started taking it when I was 15 and am now 20 so I'm having to re-evaluate everything and find out what's happening.As far as side effects, my weight was unaffected and my libido hasn't slowed down but my ability to be satisfied in bed is non-existent.  It's a small price to pay for eliminate thoughts of suicide though.

I have been on it for several years. I have not experienced much side effects. I find I have lost quite a bit of interest in sex. This is probably my only problem. This is a physically addictive drug so OBVIOUSLY DONT MISS A DOSE! You will feel side effects. BUT I am planning on going off the drug gradually under a physician so I can do it properly without experiencing terrible effects.

He started the medication after he became depressed, paranoid, accusatory, started having panic attacks in social situations. He went from being very irritable, and untrusting to a sweet, thoughtful, animated person. It worked so well for him, when I had a bad day or pms, he would jokingly offer to share it with me. I liked the results it gave him. He did not have the problems that others have described when getting off the medication. He weaned off it over about 2-3 weeks and had no adverse effects. The important thing about these types of medication is to be open and honest with your doctor about how you feel. It will do you no good to hide your embarrasing symptoms, like decreased sex drive or mood swings or crying from your doctor. Sometimes these things are hard to talk about, but that is why you are paying him for his opinion.

Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	1/21/2008 4:10:37 PM	I was a basket of nerves with anxiety, and then suffered depression after my partner and I split. Started out on Effexor 37.5 and worked my way up gradually to 150 milligrams. It has calmed my anxiety to some degree ( I am a single mom to 7 children) and I am more patient with my boys. Depression syptoms lessened, but now I never cry and my emotions seem stifled. My sex life is non-existent as I have no libido and cannot orgasm. I tried going off of this drug for a couple of days so I could share maybe some intimate time with my partner, but withdrawal syptoms began, and I got a terrible headache, felt lost and anxious, and became nauseous. As soon as I took the pill I felt better. I want off of this drug, but am scared to quit. I saw just from that one day the consequences I faced for 2 missed doses. I almost wish I would've never taken this, or done more research on it first. 
Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	3	Male	25-34	1/21/2008 6:21:53 AM	This medication was fast acting and I saw mild results in the first few days of taking the medication.  Since then I have had trouble with sleeping odd hours and a constant feeling of being dehydrated.  My energy levels have remained low unfortunately, and I have been unable to return to normal social interaction.

This is hard to get off of and if you don't take it on time every day the brain zaps/tingling let you know it.  That I do not like.  Lexapro is more like what your body really uses and creates on its own so i am going back to that.  Paxil and Effexor are Hell to come off of. Do it slowly decreasing.  
Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	1/20/2008 1:08:54 PM	After about 8-10 days I started feeling so much better. My sad feelings seem to ,pretty much, disappear. My chronic pain has showed some improvement. That was a welcome surprise. I am taking oxycodone for pain for over a year and Effexor has taken my mind off the pain. My Dad died 1 1/2 years ago and I have finally moved on from that life changing part of my life. I do get a dry mouth, some constipation and have become forgetful. I feel though the side effects are worth it.
Depression	nami, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	65-74	1/20/2008 12:01:02 PM	Have been having excessive diarrhea.  I am post sigmoid colon resection for diverticulitis.30 years ago I suffered from peritonitis and was in shock.  I don't ever want to experience this again.My Dr. started me on 75 mg.  I reported I hadn't felt any different on this dose.  He doubled the dose to 150 mg. and I have been using this for approx. 2 1/2 weeks and have had this diarrhea (severe) for 5 days now.  Our county, however, is experiencing a viral enteritis that is lasting a long time.I'm rather afraid the Effexor XR 150 mg. is causing this in me.On a positive note, the dosage does seem to help anxiety symptoms and I feel calmer.

No weight gain as most people wrote. Feel much better don't dwell on the little things. Have skipped a dosage with no side effect. The cost is high but now there is a generic form which is about 15.00 less.

While taking, the medication was extremely helpful with keeping my emotions in line, however, I experienced weight gain because during the 7 months, I seemed to go through the &quot;never feeling full&quot; episode. No cravings or anything abnormal, but I could eat and not be satisfied everyday. I currently was just weined off the medication with lower dosages. My feeling of not being full is gone already but now I am experiencing a lot of dizziness, or head rushes constantly as a withdrawl from this medication which is why I am researching this further on this website. Be very careful with any medication, it is only a bandaid for things sometimes. Make life changes - Your thoughts most of all. That's what I have done and IT IS WORKING! That is my success in my depression/ unhappiness. It DOESN't HAVE to be like that.

Depression	Rae, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	1/19/2008 7:15:26 PM	I'be been taking antidepressents for over 10 years.  I've been taking this medication for 3 years.  The dose needed to be increased a couple times.  Do not take this medication while pregnant or breastfeeding....I had a colicy baby - but as soon as I quit breastfeeding, he was okay.  I have tried to go off of this medication twice and gained weight each time I started and quit.  I have been eating healthy and exercising 5 times/week for 1 year but unable to lose the weight.  The withdrawl from this drug is horrific.  If I could go back in time, I would choose to be depressed and run the risk of suicide over the risk and struggle with being fat.  It's also caused me to have feelings of dizziness and feeling like I'm out of it.

Not really pleasant feeling when changing or forgetting dose but this med has really helped my panic disorder and not going to emergency thinking i was dying of a heart attack.The side effects I can do without,heavy sweating,headaches,dizziness,dry mouth and trouble sleeping is better than waking up in the middle of the night with a heart rate of 150BPM ... Good medication for me but not for everyone. Good Luck

Not pleased with results and wanted to stop taking.  Dr. said to come off slowly.  It was a total nightmare.  Horrible withdrawal symptoms!!!  Withdrawal landed me in ER but they wouldn't do anything to help me (or maybe they didn't know what to do to help me.)  I did research myself and read one Benadryl or one 20 mg does of Prozac may help.  Took one Benadryl and withdrawal stopped!  Thank goodness.

I was then diagnosed with an underactive thyroid, along with change of life.  Raised Paxil dose. Stopped working for me.  Been on Effexor since Oct 07.  Not sure if I like it or not.  Currently on 225mgs.  Not sure if staying on drug is the way to go or trying something else.  I am kind of worried about the detox part. After reading about the side effects of getting off, I am thinking about getting out now while I have been on for such a short time.

After a little over a year of taking it at a dose of 112.5, it stopped working.  I refuse to increase it due to what I've understood to be withdrawal effects. I'm on a schedule to discontinue, and I'm a bit worried.  No problems yet. But the flashes are back with a vengence, whether or not I take it.  I did notice weight gain, too, which I hope will remit once I'm off of it completely.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	1/16/2008 1:10:11 PM	I have been on Effexor XR for 3 months.   At first I took it at the 37.5 dose then I went to the 75 dosage and I could not handle the nausea, intense tightening of the neck, constipation, lack of appitite, sleepiness and vertigo. I have to take this medicine mid morning so that the &quot;Yarning Effect&quot; will not start until I get home.  I asked my doctor to just take be down to 37.5 and that has seemed to help.   I take this drug for PMDD.  My husband says that I am sweet otherwise but during this time I am really upset over small things and at times have very very negative thoughts.  I have read the side effects and read the comments prior to my taking the Effexor XR.  I now take the medicine every other day or as needed.  I know that it is supposed to be taken daily but if I take it daily even in the small dosages, I have Vertigo after about a week and have little emotion at all. When trying to go to a smaller dosage after about a week or 2 on the 75 dosage, I felt a bad shocking sensation in my head. This was alarming but I was glad to know that I was not the only one.  The medicine does help me with my over all mood and I don't get as anxious or concern about things as much as I used to.  I may be able to take this medicine like this due to the fact that I am a petite woman, I am not sure. I hope that the medicine works for you.  
Other	alcat, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	1/16/2008 12:35:47 AM	I took 300mg of EffexorXR for almost 4 years under a psych doc's care for depression.  Yes, it helped with libido, sex drive, very high energy.  I realized that over time my hours of sleep were decreasing, especially after the birth of my little one.  My moods were swinging way outer limits, I obsessed about huge global, national, and biblical superstorms.  I know that sounds crazy, and I was.  I checked myself into a mental unit at a local hospital two months after 9/11/2001.  I have seen several psychiatrists, I have been diagnosed with BPD.  I've had three episodes all while taking EffexorXR, which put me inpatient again.  I have now found a wonderful university hospital in the state I live in, the residents are brilliant.  I no longer am a victim to Effexor.  I'm  happy for those who have found solace with Effexor, but feel also heart-broken for those who have suffered its horrible long term usage, and the process to get off of it. Thank you for reading this, peace be upon you.

Took only 2 days for sexual problems, and stopped taking it after 17 days.  Hard a bit to withdrawal.  I became almost like a zombie after awhile, though I played basketball and was much less achy and more flexible.

Over last three years have gained 25 lbs., what sex life?  my poor husband, not even remotely interested.... and I found since increasing dose and also taking blood press. meds all I want to do is sleep, if given opportunity I would sleep all day and night, seriously no energy at all... It is the worst drug I have ever tried to ease off of, the side effects are scary. My doc wants to up dosage and am gonna suggest we detox and tru something else or try cold turkey. All it helps with is PMS symptoms makes me less moody.

My doctor put me on this drug. It helps me with my depression and makes me happy and want to get out of bed and look foward to my night at work. The drug does decrease my appettie and i dont smoke as much as I use to. I also have very realistic dreams. I forgot to take one dose and felt nausea and had a headache and couldnt sleep so I makes me alittle scarred to get off this  drug in the future
Depression	pennsylvania76, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	1/15/2008 1:09:37 AM	Effexor eliminated my symptoms of depression (crying spells, anxiety) within days, but the side effects kicked in within two weeks. I have night sweats (soaking the bed!), bloating and constipation (went through a full cycle of diagnostics for gall bladder disease -- all negative -- before realizing it could be the Effexor!), weight gain (5 lbs in 2 weeks), bloating, &quot;hypoglycemia&quot; episodes if I go too long without food, and the usual sexual side effects (have zero desire). I miss a pill about once a week, and rarely notice the withdrawal, so I'm now looking forward to getting off of this drug. I am going to try solar therapy, mood therapy and St. Johns Wort before going back on an SSRI.

Depression	Edana, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	1/13/2008 1:02:21 AM	I was given EffexorXR 300mg daily for Severe Depression five years ago. The only real effect I had from it was suicidal ideation! I was sent to a Psychiatrist who specializes in drug usage. He wanted me off the EffexorXR, but insisted I would have to spend 3-4 weeks in a psych ward to detox. I refused to go any place where I would be locked in, so he prescribed Wellbutrin along with the EffexorXR. I have multiple diseases, and daily take some 15 different drugs, including opiates for pain. I have been seeing this man for almost 5 years quarterly for scripts for a controlled med. I wanted off the Effexor, I beleived it was causing the Weight Loss,(130 lbs to 89lbs) Drooling, Hallucinationsand Nausea. He finally, after getting to know me, gave me a plan to teeter off the drug. I have been free of the capsules for 12 weeks, the first three weeks I barely remember. I am so glad to be off, my memory is better, and cognation is coming back!Edana
Depression	MsN, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	35-44	1/11/2008 10:20:11 PM	I have been on Effexor for approximately 4 years now. Overall I really have really liked this medication. It has had an impact on my life. I had social anxiety disorder as well as depression. Both of them were cleared up for a long time. Unfortunately, I burned out at my job last year and have ended up in the hospital for depression. I don't really want to say that my medication didn't work because I think I really caused my burnout (working 80+ hours/week, volunteering, etc.) My doctor bumped up my dosage from 150 to 225 and that seems to have helped me (along with a lot of therapy). Sometimes I am concerned though that maybe it is losing its effect on me. I hope not... I am not sure what I would change to. It was sort of rough in the beginning of taking this medication - I was hyper and it was harder to sleep. Those effects wore off after a couple of months. Now my side effects seem to include night sweats (sometimes the sheets are wet), weight gain (some, but it could just be that I am getting older), and my orgasms are different (its like I feel them through a filter). If I miss taking it for a few hours I feel vertigo and sort of out of body. Miss two days and I just quit moving. It sucks. I try to avoid that at all costs now :)Overall I am pleased with this medication. I was on Paxil before and all I felt like doing was stare at the wall. 
Other		3	4	1			1/10/2008 10:02:02 AM	fewer hot flashes, severe side effects!!!felt wired and restless, very nauseous, unable to sleep, and shaky. truthfully, i would rather have the hot flashes. i will not be finishing this drug. what the hell are these drug companies doing??????
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	1/10/2008 12:29:44 AM	I experienced severe depression due to chronic pain.  After failing Lexapro, Paxil, and Cymbalta due to multiple side effects, my MD put me on Effexor. Although it did help w/ my crying spells and was able to get out of bed. Over a 7 month period of time I went from 120 lbs to 170 lbs !!! Now I'm depressed about about my extreme weight gain. I've never weighed this much in my life.  I've also had side effects such as amnesia, diff. concentrating, blurred vision, joint pain, abdominal bloating, and swelling all over.I'm getting off this med and would really think twice about having your MD starting you on it. Best of luck to all.
&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs	Lisa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	1/9/2008 6:06:15 PM	I was fed up with my constant heavy sweating while everyone else was comfortable.  I went thru the change at age 49, but would not use synthetic estrogen to help me (I have heart disease).  Effexor was an immediate relief...within two days I noticed the difference.  What a relief!!But now after 8 months, I suspect some side effects, i.e.: sleeping too much, eye blurriness, sore throat.  I plan to test it, but will heed everyone's warning about the withdrawals.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	doodlebugsmom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	1/9/2008 11:07:24 AM	The first week it made me feel a little strange.  I wasn't sure that I wanted to continue, but after talking to my doctor she advised me to continue.  My side effects have been constipation and trouble sleeping, but those have somewhat subsided and I am feeling much better now.  Before the small things would upset me and I would be very anxious and upset.  Now I feel like I am more on an even keel and don't get upset and anxious anymore.  For me, Effexor has been very helpful as there has been much stress in my life the past couple of years and now I feel like I can cope with what life throws at me.  I recommend it.
Depression	nomore, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	1/9/2008 4:23:50 AM	Like many others, at first it worked well, as time went on- lost it's effect.  My labido stinks, I am emotionless(which I hate because I know I am, but can do nothing about it). It makes me tired, so I take it before I go to bed. I have a job where I work nights so I miss doses. I missed a few before christmas, I started taking it again and I now have had a bad rash, that makes me feel like bugs are crawling under my skin(worst feeling ever), joint pain, chills, night sweats, insomnia in the middle of the night. I would not recommend this for anyone, but everyone is different.
Depression	tmsl2, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/9/2008 1:19:37 AM	I have mild depression; started Effexor XR 6 months ago; no side effects; take in evening about 2 hours before bed; has worked wonderfully for me.  Have missed an occasional dose and no problem; have taken Celexa in the past.  Effexor works for me with minimal side effects; at the 75mg level and that's fine.  It has made a tremendous difference in my outlook overall..back to my happy, positive self..I feel like the old me when I was younger.  I do believe some of the depression is related to premenopause - I just turned 50.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	1/8/2008 10:34:26 PM	I've been on Effexor XR 300mg/day for at least two years now (used Zoloft for years, have also been prescribed buproprion/wellbutrin, trazadone, zyprexa, gabitril).I like effexor because I had no side effects and it seemed to work well.  I felt a bit numb and still have some trouble concentrating and cannot hold extreme emotions for very long, but I think this drug is effective.  The negative is that the withdrawal symptoms SUCK.  Unfortunately this drug does not 'build up' in the system, so after 24 hours, you will definitely feel the missed dose.  I am miserable and won't even drive when I feel that way.  The worst part is that it makes me sleep, and not really wake up.  I've missed work, classes, etc.  If you are forgetful or cannot remember to take meds daily (missing more than 3 days a month), or even a little undisciplined (like me) I'd say don't do Effexor XR.  Once you take the missed dose, though, it kicks in a few hours later.  I'm looking to switch again, as I feel it does not work nearly as good as at the beginning of treatment (2+ years ago).
Panic Disorder	jiggy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/8/2008 4:28:28 PM	I took this medication for 3 months and it was horrible.  The doctor took me off and before I could begin a new drug had to detox from this one AFTER ONLY 3 MONTHS! The withdraw symptoms were the worst and it took almost 2 months to leave my system.  I will never again take this.  I was told it was not additive YEAH RIGHT.  I now take Prozac and love it, it is much cheaper (can get at Walmart for $4) and works much better, plus if you miss a dose you don't go crazy!

It has been 8 years and I am only taking 75mg now, but I have tried to get off it and noticed that I become extra agitated and dizzy. It scares me to be without it and that scares me. I have to take it everyday, because if I don't I can tell by the afternoon that I an headed toward a problem. This drug changed my life for the better, but is there ever a way off of it?

The first few I had no problems then I started getting all kinds of side effects headaches dizziness constant sinus infections. The worst is detoxing it is the most HORRIBLE experience, laying on the couch and all I had to do was move my eyes from left to right and the whole room would spin for minutes. Would not suggest to anyone.

Worked great, although now it seems to become less effective. Added complementary drug Abilfy. Have only taken add on for 10 days and so far have noticed a difference. Cymbalta is a great alternative to Effexer XR. Only because of side effects I could not use. Does not seem to help with depression for myself.
Depression	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	1/6/2008 10:24:39 PM	Dizziness seemed to be the primary side effect for me.  Made it particularily difficult to drive for a few weeks.

At one point she switcfhed me to Effexor, and it wss the worst thing that ever happened to me.  I would fly into rages over minor things, had short-term memory losses that felt like the way people describe Alzheimers, could not concentrate, and developed blurry vision.  My doctor switched me back to Prozac, which took care of the depression, but the brain &quot;hiccups&quot; lasted for over 5 years, only slowly decreasing.

As a 70 year old, having been on hrt for over 20 years, these interrupted my sleep to the point of being exhausted and overwhelmed with life.  Effexor was very effective in controlling the hot flashes and I got my life and energy back. I did have some bruising, but could stop that by not taking the medication for a day or two every 10 days.

I'm only taking 75 mg. per day, so I can't imagine what it must be like for people that are taking higher does. Sure, it helped my anxiety/panic attacks and made me worry less, but it has made me forgetful, exhausted and at times, emotionless. I thnk now I don't worry ENOUGH. I have become a compulsive shopper and have completely lost interest in sex. I was always a very conscientious person at work and at home, but since taking this drug for over a year now, I have progressively become a slacker in every sense of the word. If I am even LATE by a few hours taking a dose, I begin having strange sensations and tremors all over my body and am extremely confused. My mouth jerks, I grind my teeth, I get so dizzy I can barely stand. I become paranoid and start to panic horribly. I am so angry that I was not warned that this drug was so life altering. I feel like a drug addict. I intend to start weaning off of it this weekend, but I'm very concerned about the withdrawal symptoms. If anyone reading this is considering taking this drug, DON'T DO IT!!

I was taking as much as 112.5 mg/day and am back down to 75 mg/day and will be moving down to 37.5 mg/day in the near future.  Even though I my dosage is decreasing, the side effects do not change.  The weight gain only started happening when I increased my dose to 112.5 in November, but continues to climb even though I am on a lower dose.  It seems odd that a drug that is supposed to help with &quot;depression&quot; would cause weight gain, which in itself could be depressing.  Needless to say, I can't wait to get off this drug.

I have tried Paxil, Prozac, Celexa, Buspar &amp; Lexapro previously w/o good results. I still have some panic attacks but they are manageable. Sometimes my thoughts race though.  I am somewhat nervous if I ever have to go off this drug.  I have heard it is very difficult.

This medication does help depression, however the side effects are not pleasant.  I have to take this at night because if taken in the AM I get severe nausea prior to eating lunch.  I have missed a dose here and there and get the weirdest feeling in my head (I call it mini seizures).  It feels kinda euphoric but in a bad way.  As soon as I start taking it again, it goes away almost immediately.  I don't think I'll ever be able to stop taking it, and that scares me worse than depression.

My legs started brusing the size of grapefruits all over my legs and just my legs. Plu I had a allergic reaction to this medication and itched like I had bug bites or something and that is when all the brusing took place. I was immediately instructed to stop all together NOT wein off..this has been abt 3 weeks and ever since then the brusing has gone down ALOT! This medicine was not for me, just make sure you really talk to your dr about your side effects...I waited weeks to long and my legs were then at that stage just painful!

However, I am slowly weening off of it....so far, from 300mg to 150mg, no side effects have been experienced.  I did run out of it for a day, and, by the next day, I was vomiting and very sick for the rest of the day. Once I began to take it again, the sickness went away.  That's been the only down side to it.

Took 75mg daily for the first year, but then the depression and PMS became stronger, so the Dr. increased the dose to 150mg once per day.  I do have side effects of increased sweating, slight dizziness and mild nausea, but compared to how I was mentally and physically feeling before the medicine, it is worth it for me.  My career, my marriage, and my child have all benefited from my treatment.  I wish I would have seeked help sooner instead of feeling like I am weak if I need medication to handle daily life.  Instead I feel empowered to live a happy life again.

Depression	35-44 Male  (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	35-44	12/31/2007 6:30:03 PM	I have been using this medicine for approximately 3 years, a long time, I know.  It took quite a while to understand how it effected my body, and the proper times to take it, so that its side effects fit my schedule.  To avoid being tired, I started taking the medication at 5:00 AM (150mg) so that I could sleep for an hour after taking it, thereby avoiding the exhausted feeling mid-morning.  I take my other dose (150mg) at 10:00 PM, or right before bed.  IMPORTANT - Do not stop taking this medicine &quot;cold turkey&quot; and definitely talk to your doctor before you change the dosage.  Contrary to early studies, this drug has addictive properties that manifest themselves in the form of EXTREME vertigo.  I ran out of medicine for two days, by the morning of the third day, I could barely walk without weaving and bumping into things.  The emergency room doctor told me this was due to my abrupt change in dosage, and after a day of taking my medicine, I was fine.

&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs	45-54 Female 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	12/31/2007 12:15:09 AM	My doctor prescribed this drug for my premenopause symptoms. At first it took the edge off my irritability like my doc said it would. At 6 months it wasn't working any longer &amp; I had some hopeless feelings &amp; thoughts. My doc wouldn't chat with me on the phone so I decided to get off the meds myself. What awful withdrawal symptoms - dizziness, nausea, in general feeling crappy. When getting off of this drug decrease the amount slowly.  This is not a good medication - beware of doctors who prescribe anti-depressants for premenopause symptoms.

I will take this the rest of my life if it continues to provide the opportunity to function with normal, not severe, levels of depression and anxiety.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	12/29/2007 5:30:43 PM	I am now on 150mg, after being reduced from 225mg.  Originally this drug worked out great for my depression, but after a few months it seemed to not work as well.  My doctor went from 75mg, to 150mg, to 225mg. Since I have been on effexor I have gained about 70lbs and have lost most of my normal energy, which is straining my marriage.  Now I have visted a psychiatric physcian who wants me off of effexor and has bumped me down to 150mg to start the taper.  I have been experiencing major withdrawl effects from dizziness to migraines to feelig extremely bloated.  It has only been about two weeks since I have stepped down so I hope the withdrawl symptoms will start to dissipate as time goes on.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	12/29/2007 5:53:31 AM	The main problem is not being on it - it is an amazingly effective drug. The problem is coming off it. It seriously dumps you.I have taken it twice now and the second time around I reduced the daily dose slowly, right down to breaking open the tablets and seperating the individual beads - it was a much easier withdrawal that way.

Constant extreme sweat (I've been wearing a T-shirt during winter times in Canada), headaches if missed a dose, felt dizzy in the beginning.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/28/2007 10:06:49 PM	This drug took about 8 to 10 weeks until I felt the full effects, however it has been wonderful.  I have some mild side effects such as dry mouth and gas.  I was on Celexa for 5 years and this change has been great for me.

Overall I'm not as depressed as I use to be. Doctor upped my dosage to 300mg. If I missed a dose, I get tingling in my lips and get a terrible headache.
Depression	dutch waterman, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	12/28/2007 4:15:05 PM	I was prescribed Effexor XR (150mg) which I took in conjunction with Zoloft (200mg) and valium (5mg x 3) to treat my depression and anxiety.  Initially I experienced benefits from the medication, but eventually these benefits were replaced by negative side-effecs which crippled me.  I gradually discontinued the Zoloft (against medical advice) and my health improved dramatically!  I continued to take the Effexor, although the therapeutic benefits diminished and I was plagued with dark, destructive and suicidal thoughts.  I decided to wean myself off of the Effexor (against doctor's advice again).  It took me about 2 months gradually reducing the dosage (sometimes increasing it again when withdrawal symptoms occurred).  Today I use only diazepam (5mg x 3) to control anxiety and panic.  My experience with prescription antidepressants is that the initial benefits diminish over time to be replaced by negative side-effects.  Effexor may be a good short-term therapy, but over time the side-effects increased and the benefits disappeared.  Diazepam in the only prescription that has provided consistent, continuous and effective treatment.
Depression	cindy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/28/2007 12:09:02 AM	I have been on effexor for seasonal depression (SAD) for about 20 years now. I have had great luck -no side effects. It took me quite awhile to find which anti-depressant worked well for me. This was the 3rd one I tried before I had felt &quot;myself&quot; again. I believe everyone is different and not all medicines are for every-body

I thought I was dying. The ambulance came all stats normal, blood sugar, blood pressure, ekg.  I finally felt ok after a while.  I thought it was from diest pills.  stayed dizzy for 2 weeks. Went to the doctor, he said it ws dizziness and gave me Anti-Vert for dizziness.  Another &quot;attack came along&quot; and back to dizzy again.  Hated it and stayed in bed for a week, was terrfified to get out of bed.  Went to another doctor.  Checked my thyroid and heart rate by wearing EKG for 24 hours.  Normal. Went to a ENT speacilast.  Then went through a dizziness battery test (ENG and audiology test) thougt it was an inner ear problem..Normal.  Went back to my normal doctor.  He said it was anxiety.  Put me on Ativant and Effexor XR 37.5 for a week then 75 mg.  Started to feel better.  First few nights couldn't sleep, but no major side effects.  Oh yeah, my pupils were huge fora week. It took like 5 weeks to begin working.  Had two more panic attacks in the 3rd week.  Scared it wouldn't work.  Used my emergency Ativant in case of these attacks.  Just went up to 150 mg.  Been on it for a week now at this dosage, and finally my dizziness is gone.  I feel great.  Im glad I was patient.  I was frustrated at first.  No weight gain and my relatinoships with others has improved. My mood swings are gone, anxiety about going to the gym is gone, and now I feel normal again.  I was scared I had a brain tumor due from the dizziness.  Guess it was anxiety and panic attacks after all.  Come to find out my sister and aunt have it too.  hereditary.  Anyways feel great now, JUST WATCH THE CAFFINE. IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL AS IF YOU ARE HAVING AN ATTACK.  No more caffine for me. Anyways ..good luck.  A life saver!

I have been on Effexor RX for at least 8 years if not more. I have been on Paxil, Prozac (these drugs made me suicidal), Zoloft, Xanax and more but these drugs did absolutely nothing to help my depression. The drug works great most of the time; however since my husband also suffers from depression and refuses to take medication, there are times when nothing works.  My therapist is a great help.

I tried to get off of this one because of the high cost, and felt much more pain, migraines, much worse depression, and I wanted to commit suicide. I had to write to the company itself and I am now getting the meds for free, but I am afraid to take 2 instead of just one, because I feel like this is a very hard drug to stop.  I am still depressed, and feel suicidal, but my Dr. does not seem to think I should change anything.  I just give up.  I am sick of the pain.

The first night I took it, I couldn't sleep and I felt very light headed and dizzy. I lowered my dosage and then bumped it back up after a couple days. Now all my side effects have gone away and I feel much better. I can make light of situations rather than worrying and feeling scared.

I am on 150mg/day and getting ready to decrease to 75mg/day. This drug (along with prayer) has worked miracles for me. I am in my last year of college and will soon graduate with my teaching degree. Everyone reacts differently but I am SO thankful to have found this medication. It took a good 6-8 weeks to get past the initial side effects, which was a little rough, but I'm glad I stuck it out.
Depression	RecoveryGirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/23/2007 5:53:31 PM	Effexor XR has helped to stabalize me greatly!  It takes some getting use to when the doc is trying to find the right dosage.  You will experience dizziness, nausea and any other symptoms you may have had previously.  If you do miss a dose and please try not to, ginger gum or dramamin work good until you can get your prescription filled.  I still get very tired at times and sometime cry out of the blue -- but again, I am 10 times better than before.
Depression	powder, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	12/23/2007 1:49:18 PM	I was on Wellbutron for 6 years, told my doctor I possibly needed something else, he prescribe Effexor, the first day I took it in the morning, 3 hours later I had such a bad reaction, violently ill, my employer had to call 911 and I was in the emergency room for 4 hours, extremely ill.   This is frightening!  No way I would take that again, ambulance ride and a day in the emergency room was not cool.  My docotor said he had never heard of anyone getting this reaction, well now you have.  I then tried lexapro, and bad anixety within hours, could not function, had to go home from work.   Back on the Wellbutron, doubled the dosage, and I feel happier now.Yikes what an experience!
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	JennThomas87, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	12/22/2007 10:37:42 PM	Effexor has been very helpful in alleviating my anxiety and depression issues. My only compliant is that missing the dose even once results in terrible withdrawal symptoms. Crying fits, anxious thoughts and severe nausea. However, my anxiety comes back so severe that it allows me to see that Effexor is controlling my anxiety. I have not gained weight or lost my sex drive while on this medication. 
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/21/2007 2:56:44 PM	I have tried Prozac, and Wellbutrin in the past with little success. Prozac correlated (seemed to have caused) suicidal ideation and Wellbutrin worked for about 3 weeks and then ceased to improve my mood. For someone with a history of 3 separate depressive episodes, Effexor has increased my energy, decreased my appetite, made me less agitated, improved my mood and did not adversely affect my libido. All in all, I highly recommend this psychotropic!

If you start, be prepared to stay on it for life.  I got down to a bare minimum but if I cut it clear out got very sick.  Noise in ears and hurt when I turned my eyes even.  I finally upped the dose when I had a bad time and I'm back up on the higher dose again now.

Depression	Jackie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	12/20/2007 3:57:19 PM	I have been taking Effexor XR for a long time, over 10 years, and this worries me.  It works very well, however, after taking it for so long I am starting to get very undesirable side effects - constant sweating, sore mouth with tongue getting cracks in it, like it was cut with a knife.  Thes side effects are bad enough that I wanted to stop taking Effexor.  I did for a while and replaced it with Wellbutrin, but that only helped with the depression.  It didn't help my headaches.  They came back.  I need more serotonin to take care of the headaches.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety		1	1	1			12/20/2007 9:15:49 AM	This medicine is Awful.  Been using about 7 months and suddenly I have been itching all over.  Made my blood pressure go up, so now I am on 3 different meds instead of 2.  Someone should be shot for making such a med.  My research shows that itching is a common side effect of this med. AND they say that it is not addicting, well explain to me why I have to be tapered off slowly.  I was taking 225 mg per day and for the last couple day down to 150mg.  Nausea, dizzy, etc. They also had me on Risperdal at bedtime, so I am going through withdrawals from that also.  If I ever get off this med.....no more for me.  Doctors should take it for a few months and then try to go off to experience the side affects.  I have had BAD headaches every since I started this stupid med.  I just pray to God that I can get off this med and stay off.  If you are going through similar side effects, I feel for you and understand.  Oh, by the way, I was on .25 of risperdal and they took me off cold turkey.  How can the FDA approve such mean drugs?!?!  I hope if you are trying to decide whether to take this drug or not, you do some serious research before deciding unlike me.  Now I am among the thousands of others who are trying to get off this and have a normal life.  Friends say &quot;quit scratching&quot; but you cannot quit.  I am taking benadryl to try to help with the itching.  Search effexor and itching on the net and see what you find.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!  Good luck to all who are going through what I am and may God bles you all.

I called my doctor to change me, it's been 5 days and I'm severly dizzy, my husband had to stay home for 2 days until I could manage myself.  It's an awful drug, I don't recommend it for anyone!!!

Depression	Stina, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	12/16/2007 11:45:27 PM	I take 75mg. I didn't notice a change until about month after I started effexor. Then it had gotten rid of my angry outburts and given me patience, which dramatically changed my relationships with many in a positive way. But lately I've noticed many changes. I sleep alot and am extremely fatigued. I am numb &amp; emotionless. I have lost all  motivation in daily life . Constipation. Lessened sexual desire. And I too feel the &quot;brain jitters&quot; but mostly when something happens that would usually make me upset and cause the angery outbursts. When I have them it makes me feel like a freak who isn't being myself! I would love to get off the medication but am very scared to experience the side effects to the fullest effect. I have missed up to 4days of doses at once and felt horrible. Lots of sharp pained headaches! I do believe that this drug is intended for a lifetime of use.

The hot flashes still come, but not as intense and sickening.My gynecologist prescribed 2 pills a day (not sure of the mg). I tried this and couldn't tolerate that much. The only way I could take it was to cut the dosage down to 1/8 and then to 1/4 of the original prescribed amount.

The nightsweats were so bad I was not sleeping, changing clothes and as well as the bed.  The first 48 hours after starting the med, nightsweats went away.  Side effects are bad when you forget to get your re-fill.  Headaches, nausea, feeling faint (like I was going to pass out).  Was told the &quot;change of life&quot; help with this drug are considered &quot;secondary side effects&quot;.  It has helped a great deal with my mood swings because of the lack of certain hormones. Sex drive is greatly diminished. Has helped me handle everyday and extreme stress very well.  Like all meds it has it's good side as well as it's bad side.  For me it has been a good thing.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/13/2007 10:25:28 AM	I swear by this drug.  I don't know what I would have gone through with out it.  In the begining, it takes a little while to start working, but as soon as it does, you will know it.  Things get better!  The only thing I have noticed that I dislike very much about it, your sex drive diminishes and it is very frustrating, but after speaking to my doctor, he found a solution.

Depression	anonymous, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	12/12/2007 10:54:14 PM	This is the best antidepressant I have been on. Wellbutrin made me irritable, and Lexapro made me feel flat. I have had no side effects because my doctor started me on 35 mg and has gradually increased the dose to 150 mg. It's only been about a month or so, but I can feel a difference and expect it to get even better.

Effexor has made a significant difference in my severe migraines and mood disorder.  Have noticed rapidity of onset of withdrawal sx when missing a few days' doses.  Am thankful for such good results, even though I'll likely need it indefinitely.
Other	CPTech, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	12/12/2007 1:15:38 PM	This medicine has helped with both anxiety and ADD. The only thing that I do not like is the night sweats that I get if I forget to take it for a day.
Depression	amanda, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/12/2007 10:02:05 AM	I honestly can't live without my Effexor.  I have tried several other depression medications and this is the only that actually works for me longterm.  Although I would rather not be on a pill long term to cope with life, if you have to, you have to, right?  and this one works for me.  
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	pixipatrin, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	12/12/2007 4:39:59 AM	I've been on a long journey (6 months) originally going from doctor to doctor in search of answers, and then was finally thrust upon a therapist. It fluctuates from anxiety, to depression, to flu-like/auto-immune symptoms, and so I'm being treated with Celexa. It's made subtle differences, but I'm still hopeless as all get out.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	12/11/2007 11:08:52 PM	Effexor has worked well for me.  I'm on 150 mg/day (I was briefly on 300 mg/day in an effort to treat ADHD symptoms but have since dropped back to 150 mg and added focalin) and it seems to be the best I'll get from antidepressants.  At the higher dose I started feeling emotionally numb (I'd recognize I _should_ be sad, but I wouldn't feel it), I'd sweat a lot (very weird), I had crazy dreams, and generally I just felt...weird.  At 150 mg, though, I have regular emotions, and I still get sad sometimes, but it's &quot;normal&quot; sad, emotions that I should be feeling.  It keeps me much more level and really functional.  It works great for me.
Depression	MaggieMinn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/11/2007 3:15:06 PM	I love Effexor XR and call it my happy pill, even though I'm only on a 75 mg dose a day. I've been on it since 1999 when I was diagnosed with a chemical imbalance, depression, panic attacks, etc....finally, after being unhappy for so many years and being unable to control my runaway emotions and my temper. I recommend Effexor as it really does help you even things out and you are able to become the person you're meant to be, without all the depression, anger, and anxiety that a chemical imbalance can cause. I can't imagine ever going off Effexor as it has helped me change my life.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	12/10/2007 11:02:18 PM	Although this drug helped my depression, the side effects and withdraw symptoms were horrific.  I felt like a drug addict that needed to be in rehab to come off of this drug.  I would not take it again unless my life depended on it.  
Depression		5	5	5			12/10/2007 7:53:51 PM	Effexor is the best thing that happened to me. I have little to know side effects from its use. For me it was a life saver. Maybe its not the right drug for everyone with depression but after my dr. trying a few others first, this one made the difference. My family is so thankful that something helped me. I've been on it for 6 years and life is GREAT!

Missing just one dose would make me feel zaps in my brain. I tried to stop taking it once after the 1st year(under my doc) and couldn't do it. The next year I was finally able to taper down, but had severe brain zaps for months afterwards, developed acne for the first time in my life.  The scars are now starting to heal and I don't have zaps anymore-occasionally though. It's been since February and it's December now...I would recommend anything BUT effexor...
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	19-24	12/10/2007 5:25:37 PM	I have to say this drug is great for depression and anxiety BUT...once you try to go off of it the withdrawl is similar to opiod/heroin/narcotic withdrawl. I tried going off the 75mg of Effexor XR slowly by taking 37.5 for 2 weeks(under my doctors supervision) and I literally thought I was going to end up in the hospital because I was vomiting, sweating, shaking and in excruciating pain for days. Unfortunatly I feel like I am going to be stuck on this medication for the rest of my life because the withdrawl is more than I can bare. I ended up going right back on the 75mg a day because nothing I did made me feel better once the drug was out of my system. I give the drug credit for its effectiveness in treating depression especially if you have tried other drugs and nothing has worked, but this is more of a long term treatment rather than a quick fix.

Does not improve forgetfulness, however, not as anxiety riden. Problems with trying to wean off drug. Vision blurred severe headaches.Expensive drug, have no health insurance.  
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	1	1	Female	35-44	12/10/2007 10:41:55 AM	I tried Effexor this past year due to increased weight gain with my Celexa.  I have to tell you that this was an awful medication for me.  I was extremely nauseated and had awful headaches when first taking this medication.  I continued with the tretment thinking I was being a wimp, well the nausea somewhat subsided and the headaches, but then the uncontrollable sweating started. I was soaking wet all day and with this medication in combination with Dexadrine for ADD I actually felt numbness in my lips and chest pain one morning on the way to work.  Heart attack? Who knows...It scared the bejeebers out of me though, I went back to the Celexa again and remain on it currently with again the same weight gain issues.  It is a bum deal for those of us who are fighting depression, to know that you are going to gain weight which being a female, we all know it is hard enough everyday of our lives to try to maintain a healthy weight.

The only side effects I can see are when I forget to take my pill I get dizzy. Honestly that is not the worst I have experienced with other drugs like paxil...

The worst side effect was what seemed like all night-long dreams of sheer terror where I was literally fighting for my life. Others included extreme nausea, high blood pressure, dizziness, hallucinations, numbness in my right hand,and agitation. It is the worst experience from any medication I have ever been on.  I would seriously warn anyone who is considering taking this medication to see  his or her doctor WEEKLY until the medicine takes its full affect. It may help someone, but it almost killed me.

I was up to 250 mg and I was a different person. I made my anxiety worse and I could'nt sleep. Getting off this medication is hell. The withdraw is the worst feeling I have ever felt. It makes me feel like I am dying. It has been almost 7 months and I am down to 25 mg

It helped me get through things (open spaces, driving, social situations) for the first several years, but I've NEVER had the energy I did prior to taking it. Thinking about increasing dosage, as it does not work so well anymore, but how high does one really want to go? I tried to slowly ween off of this a few years ago, and wanted to DIE (literally)--I was completely debilitated. Only talke this if you plan on being on it FOREVER.

I am able to actually enjoy life. The one thing you need to worry about when taking this med is the withdrawal. If you miss a dose you are extremely sick and lightheaded. It is terrible. You can not miss at all.

I took it for a year or so and I was tired all day and wide awake at night. If I missed a dose, I was really sick. Finally my doctor put me on Cymbalta and I had no withdrawl and I felt better in a day!!! Do not take effexor. Ask your doctor about Cymbalta.  NO WITHDRAWL FROM EFFEXOR.

It was the most awful experience, i lost my career (which i now have back) my husband almost divorced me, and i just felt like dying every day. Prozac has turned out to be the best choice for me.

It has helped tremendously for the depression. And it's just been OK for the anxiety. The only side effects I have had from it is if I forget to take it one day, then I start getting very dizzy and sick to my stomach. It's like my body is going through withdraw after only one day.

It helped eliminate my anxiety and maybe it's the effexor or by coincidence but I haven't had an urge to drink since and it's been 4 years. The generic came out recently and it works just as well, but tastes a little funny if you don't swallow it right away.

I like the difference Effexor has made for me, but I think I need more help.  I was very positive and upbeat and then suddenly went backwards a few steps.  I will talk to doc, but I won't give up my Effexor.  It made all the difference in the world.  It made my heart peaceful again.

I was first put on Lexapro, and it made me feel like I was crawling in my skin, and then they gave me Effexor XR, and it took about 2 1/2 weeks to really notice a change,and of course,because I was feeling so good, I didnt notice, but my husband did, and commented on how upbeat and how I wasnt so, uptight and nervous, and stressed. The only real side effect I have noticed is hot sweats randomly thruout the day, and a small lack of sex drive.

Depression	acc, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	11/26/2007 10:48:27 PM	Ive expereanced weight gain with Effexor, but it works for the depression so I continue to use it. It is annoying that it must be taken on a full stomach or else you will be sick.

I am in sales and my production has increased 200%. I take the effexor 150mg in the morning and the adderal around noon. These two drugs have been life changing and given me so much more patience with clients and family.
Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/26/2007 4:55:35 PM	I've been on different doses of Effexor for over 3 years &amp; it is by far the most effective med I have taken for panic disorder &amp; depression combined.  On the flip side, decreasing doses or weaning off of it is HORRIBLE... no matter how slowly you do it.  I strongly suggest allowing yourself a good 2 weeks to &quot;detox&quot; from the drug.  I've found it very difficult to work, drive, socialize, etc. when weaning off Effexor.  
Other	Professor E, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	11/26/2007 9:37:15 AM	Took for OCD.  It took several weeks and increases in dosages but then kicked in (@ 75mg).  Lessening of Obsession and almost elimination of Compulsion.  First effective things I've taken in my life.  Will happily stay on this forever.
Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/25/2007 9:11:00 PM	Very effective, except for my inevitable January to April depression.  This period of time re4quires supplementation with Wellbutrin.  Downside is withdrawal if you forget to take Effexor for one day.

My Oncologist suggested that I take Efexor for the hot flashes that resulted with the Hormone destroying effects of the Chemo and other drugs.   Now after 18 months on the drug, my hot flashes have improved and my minor mood swings have deminished. I am happy with the drug and would recommend it to anyone suffering with &quot;Change of Life Symptoms&quot;

It's by far the most effective antidepressant I've tried, however after increasing the dosage up to 300 mg. daily I was still having major mood swings. I was then put on Lamictal (a mood stabilizer) and the combination of the 2 drugs has been a very good &quot;cocktail&quot; for me.

I was bipolar; he didn't even get my chart. (it was his lunch time) Latter that day when I was get-ting very ill I called; he said to keep taking them. I quiet - called for three days, he would not take calls! I went to emergency room - they stablized my diabetic; then sent me to another local hospital by ambulance. I stayed 4 days; was put on seroquel 2 1/2 months missing work. The doctor from hospital told me - the clinic had not right to give me that.  The he was liabel of malpractise.  I missed 3 months before I was stable again from a sample.  My health went down hill fast; I had5 Mri's ans have whit masses, 4 Lp with openning high pressures,Cts,and EEGs in 3 years. I had to medically retire from a 23 year carer from IRS May of 2006.  IS the makers of Effexor teaching the new doctor the side effect! It was charted that had No talorence for antidepressents,Pain medication, and only Lithiumfor over  26 years. I had had Migrains over 18 years, and thesimple medication had no effect after onset.  I had to get Stadol shots with fenigrin for the nausea now 3 years.  I took 2 sezzure medications.   &quot;Don't got to a clinic at lunchtime&quot;.

Depression	Lauren, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/20/2007 7:53:31 PM	I have been on Effexor for a five years and was on Prozac for ten years prior to that.  Effexor has done a great job for me although Prozac had less side affects.  If a dose of Effexor is missed, the affects are felt more immediately and are unnerving; however, I am glad that I have had a medicine to keep me out of the dark hole of depression!

I went through severe side affects and was informed by a pharmacist I was in &quot;seritonin syndrome&quot;Was immediately put on 1/2 dosage and taken off all together in one week. I now suffer sever withdrawal symptoms related to that when I was put on it. Please review this drug closely before being on it. I wouldn't wish this on anyone.

I am a new person!  I am sleeping better, so I wake up well rested, ready to exercise, which is helping my joint pain.  The fact that the medication is an antidepressant is why I chose it.  Depression is common in people with fibromyalgia.  I can now say goodbye to the depression, another benefit of the med.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/20/2007 1:31:33 PM	I already wrote a positive review of this drug, but after reading other reviews I thought I should add something about the withdrawal symptoms. With Effexor, it is VERY IMPORTANT to continue taking the medication. The withdrawal is terrible!!! One a few occasions for one reason or another I've found myself without my pills for a few days and it was awful. The withdrawal symptoms start within 48 hours and it's so hard to describe. To borrow from another reviewer...It's like your life is a slow motion movie. I start to get a little paranoid and VERY panicky. I am a little nervous about ever going off this medicine because of that. When I go off my pills, I feel completely out of it. Just remember that when starting treatment - this is not a drug to be taken only every few days.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/20/2007 12:40:46 AM	This drug seriously changed my life. I was dealing with high anxiety and a little fear of social situations, and within a year I was feeling 100% better. I've been on 225 mg a day for the past 5 years. Recently, we also added 20 mg of Buspar because I seem to be overly anxious at night. If it weren't for this medicine, I'd be a complete basketcase. Stick with it! The first year was tough for me as we changed my dose about 6 times. At first I felt super loopy, but now I'm very happy with the results. 
Depression	19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1		19-24	11/19/2007 4:32:32 PM	Effexor was the worst thing I've ever taken in my life.  It did nothing for my depression, caused me to gain over 40lbs (which I had just recently lost), caused extreme diarrhea and vomitting, and made me emotionless.  My fiance and I split up because I felt nothing.  I was literally numb of emotions.  I couldn't laugh or cry.  I wasn't happy or sad.  I was just there.  I absolutely hated this drug.  I switched to this from Wellburtin because of Wellbutrin's side-effects, but the side-effects of Effexor were much worse and not worth the switch.  I'm back on Wellbutrin, and have my life back under control.  No more crazy thoughts, diarrhea, vomitting, or numbness.  Effexor works for some, but is definitely not for all.
Bipolar Depression	Janice, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	11/18/2007 8:30:27 PM	I find it very helpful, however, after taking it for 3 months the side effects are starting to put a strain on me. They are heart palpitations that sometimes continue throughout the day, eye problems such as different exam results that leave me with going back and forth on the right prescriptions and eye strain, excessive sweating, and issues with my ovulation cycle, which made me believe that I was going through an early change of life! I was told by my gynocologist as well as other doctor's that these are side effects caused by this medication. I am very upset, I am taking a small dose and now have to decide what to do, is it all worth it?

MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS HAVING A HEART ATTACK 24 HRS A DAY. INDUCE PARANOIA AND PANIC ATTACKS WHICH LEFT WHEN I QUIT TAKING IT. EXTREME BRAIN SHIVERS AND VERTIGO FOR WEEKS AFTER I QUIT TAKING IT. BE VERY CAREFUL IF YOU DECIDE TO TAKE THIS DRUG.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/16/2007 8:57:37 AM	I was on Paxil before, and did not like it. It took away all my emotion. I wouldn't cry when I was sad, and I wouldn't laugh when I was happy. It was wierd. I do not experience this with Effexor. I like that it helps with my anxiety without affecting my personality. I have experienced weight gain, but that has really been the only side effect. One thing i am worried about, is ever trying to get off this med. I have heard the withdrawal symptoms are insane. I have experienced wierd effects if I skip a dose; i.e. nausea, sensations in my brain (hard to explain), and the anxiety returns. 
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	11/16/2007 1:57:17 AM	I don't know what I would do without Effexor!!  The only downside is if you miss a pill...your body will DEFINITELY remind you with weird shock sensations.

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	11/14/2007 10:07:04 PM	I have been on a regime of various drugs for about 6 years, and Effexor has been the one that finally became a staple in the mix, along with Welbutrin.  The only huge NEGATIVE is the withdrawal effects.  When trying to go off the drug, the effects were unbearable! So, if on a high dose and tapering off, do so very slowly, you will be thankful for it!  Otherwise, I have found it to be a very helpful drug for my depression and anxiety, and it also provides and extra energy boost!

I would continually have horrible nightmares, or even night terrors.  Every morning, I would wake up in a pool of sweat.  One recommendation I would give is if you decide this medication isn't the right one for you, make sure you talk to your doctor and set up a plan to slowly go off of Effexor...the withdrawal symptoms are really intense.

It worked accept I was always in the same mood, never happy or sad, just in between. My friends were the people who noticed it first, I was never really happy or hyper anymore, I was boring and eager all the time. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	11/12/2007 4:04:06 PM	While taking effexor xr, I have been able to attend class, I am a senior in college, and also go into public spaces without freaking out. I am on 150mg in the morning, since when I used to take it at bedtime I would not be able to sleep so now I take it in the morning. I also take xanax &quot;as needed&quot;. I have not experienced any sexual side effects, and my appetite has not increased or decreased, just stayed steady and I have in fact lost weight with this med. I am moving up to 225mg, just to try and make it so I don't have &quot;bad days&quot; as often as I do now, which is about once a week. I used to take lexapro and with that I didn't want to have sex ever and gained weight like crazy. For me, effexor xr is great, the only bad thing is if I miss a dose I also have flu like symptoms, which involve a horrible upset stomach and dizziness, but it goes away after a day. 
Panic Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	11/12/2007 3:57:06 PM	I used to be on lexapro an it didn't work for me. I have agoraphobia, which is a fear of open spaces, basically anywhere that is not my house, and with this it made it a little better, but nothing compared to the effexor xr. I am on 150mg before bed, and when i take it before bed, I can't sleep, so it was switched to the morning. Now that I take it in the morning, I have a regular sleep schedule, not so much a loss of appetite, but a steady one, and I have actually lost weight. My sex life is great, and has not been effected like it was when I was on the lexapro. With the effexor xr, I can leave my house to attend school, I'm a senior in college, and attending class is much easier, also grocery shopping is a breeze too. Overall, I am happy with my results, but it is being increased to 225mg a day to try and fix it more, since I do occasionally have bad mornings where I do not want to go outside. 
Depression	dalem2, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	11/12/2007 3:51:22 PM	Tried Zoloft and Lexapro originally, then switched to Effexor XR.  Worked up to 150 mg, but too many sexual side effects occurred (delayed orgasm) so weaned off with withdrawls and sexual function returned.  Trying 75 mg to see if that's a happy medium.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	11/12/2007 1:16:24 AM	Started effexor about 1 yr ago for depression &amp; panic attacks, I take it in conjuction with Klonopin. Only side effects were constipation &amp; horrible sweating. I increased my water &amp; fiber intake, I no longer have those issues. I have on occasion forgotten to take my meds and if I missed at least 2 days I would experience weird, crazy dreams. Also I start getting aggitated and angry for no reason. I also get a crazy, funky feeling with my eyes. So I do my best to remember to take it and my hubby helps me out to. Overall I'd rather take it than any others I have been on

I was previously on Zoloft which was working, but I felt that I did not need medication for depression anymore, just anxiety.  I have had a few classic symptoms of Effexor. I can't say &quot;loss&quot; of apetite, but definitely a noticeable decrease, blurry vision, drowsiness and dry mouth all the time.  I also have had pain in both shoulders and backs of my arms that I cannot attribute to anything else.

I was on it for 5 years, gained 50 lbs, sweated constantly, no sexual desire, constipated, trouble urinating, and vision was failing. I decided to stop it and had withdrawels of a drug addict. It was horrible, constant dizziness for 2 weeks couldnt function or drive,then the headaches. Do not take it.

I seem to be having many opposite side effects than what others have posted. I have lost weight since beginning the medication and I can't sleep. I have started taking Ambien in order to get to sleep. Effexor has really helped me. I no longer feel &quot;edgy&quot; and I do not snap at my husband and child anymore. I am a much happier person to be around and I actually feel like going out and doing things. This drug has been very helpful to me.

My primary physician recommended EffexorXR about four years ago, and it has been, literally, a life saver!  I still have infrequent bouts of the &quot;blues&quot; but nothing like the crushing despair that I had prior to taking Effexor. And, thankfully, those are usually gone in less than 24 hours.  I cannot say enough good things about what has been for me, a miracle drug!

I tried ssri and buprion but effexor has been lke night and day.  I find that I can be my old self again in my work and I have betterr control over my life at home.  My house is still a mess though.  Maybe not a depression thing but just a House work thing.
Depression	slushyboots, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	11/6/2007 3:00:31 PM	I have been on effexor XR for a month and a half now, and have just adjusted my dosage from 75mg/day to 150mg/day, I have found it very easy to use, NO nausea/tremors, and only experienced slight headaches/trouble sleeping but I had that anyway. I am trying to be patient so that I can have relief from depression, and not worry about what the drug is doing to me. It affects EVERYONE DIFFERENTLY so please don't be scared of what others report about THEIR side effects. If you find it doesn't help keep your mood steady and positive, try something else like adding therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy to your 'arsenal of support'  Do not go off effexor cold turkey, this is stated everywhere and many people ignore this warning, which causes problems. Warnings and directions are there for a reason and following the instructions can help you to have a more positive, healthy experience with anti-depressants. I hope this has been helpful for those of you considering effexor for depression/anxiety or whatever it may be for you, and know that ANY step toward getting help for yourself is a good one!! also, congrats for educating yourself first!  good luck everyone.

Other	Heavenlyscent, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	11/5/2007 4:16:21 PM	I have been on this medicine for about 3 months. The medicine really helped my anxiety and depression, but I have gained 30 pounds in 3 months. I hate this. I have been taking 150 mg. I still have depression because now my boyfriend has started downing me about being fat. I cannot handle that. My mother just passed away and I already have enough to worry about. I took myself off this drug cold turkey. WOW, I would not advise this. I have had nausea, headaches, diarhea, brain buzzes, (which by the way I had never heard that word before, nor knew what it meant, but let me tell you, if you ever have one, you will never forget the feeling, it does not hurt, but it is the weirdest feeling in the world. you blink, move your eyelashes, move your eyeballs, or turn your head and it feels like you are in oputer space) I hope I never have this again and I hope how soon it will stop if ever), dizziness, fatigue worse than I had before. this is my fourth day off the medicine. I hope and pray it doesnt last to much longer because I dont know how much longer I can take it. I have a very (stupid) controlling boyfriend that has no feelings for no one but himself and doesnt care what I am going thru. I may have to go back on this stuff and I dont want to.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	11/5/2007 1:19:06 PM	I switched to Effexor from Paxil a few years ago, and couldn't have been happier with its effectiveness, without the side-effects of Paxil (weight gain, fatigue).  I'm using it in conjunction with Klonopin, and I think that this combination has produced the best results I could hope for.

Effexor worked at first then gradually all my symptoms returned.  It got to where I couldn't function at work; I was tired all the time, couldn't concentrate, would cry at my desk.  I've switched to Zoloft and that seems to be helping.  The Effexor basically did next to nothing for me after a few months.

That was cold-turkey though, slowly, my Doctor said, is how it is done.
Depression	Joe W, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	11/3/2007 7:33:31 PM	I have been diagnosed for depression.  I take 150mg Effexor with breakfast and I also take 20mg Adderall tablets 2X/day, once with breakfast and one with lunch.  The Effexor by itself does an excellent job for me with depression, anxiety and nervousness.  I do, however get extremely sleepy when using it alone.  So the Dr. prescribed the Adderall to offset this by keeping me alert during the day and also to help me focus.  I don't have any side effects whatsoever except I am a little bit numbed or non-emotional, this may just be due to being so anxious for so many years.  I would give anything to be able to go back to my childhood and had these medicines then.

Depression	d00dah, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/1/2007 9:26:32 PM	I have been taking Effexor in combination with Wellbutrin for 12 years. I wish I had taken it years earlier, because I have been dysthymic for most of my life (60). After I had BC, was on Tamoxifen, and other major life changes, I went from &quot;not happy&quot; to not  wanting to &quot;do&quot; tomorrow - not suicidal, but significantly different ... tired.It's gotten me out of the pit. For the past couple of years I have also taken Adderall for ADHD.  This threesome seems to work.  How long will I have to take it?  Who knows? The alternative sucks. I may yet try reducing the dosage, because all these chemicals can't be all that great for my liver. I'm just glad I found a doctor who was willing (and able - a PhD (Biochemistry) along with the MD) to try different combinations until we found one that would work. Once I went through a period of missing dosages here and there that must have mounted up.  I can miss 150mg of my total 375mg/day without ill effects - more than that is too great a drop at once. Coming off the drug is not pleasant, I hear, but it is doable and takes a l-o-n-g time. Have to be patient.

I don't like something having that strong of an effect on me.  I would get headaches, nausea, sensativity to light, irritable, and short tempered. I have taken other anti-depressants and none of them have been like this.

I recently thought maybe I was feeling well enough to go off of the medication and decided to gradually taper off, but have experienced very, very bad withdrawls. I highly recommend not even starting this medication!! The dizziness is horrible. I have been on Prozac and Zoloft in the past and have never experienced withdrawl symptoms as bad as these. I'm not sure what to do now.

Horrible brain fuzziness and withdrawal symptoms if I skip a dose.  Other side effects I experience: night sweats, weight gain, decreased sex drive, loss of memory if you have even 1 alcoholic beverage.

Worked okay but I was never professionally diagnosed  with anxiety/depression before i started taking effexor. I was probably considered average by most professionals regarding levels of anxiety.  My family doctor put me on this med after I told her I get anxious at times and I wish i could go back in time and stopped myself from taking a brain altering med that my family doctor prescribed.  Not only was the weight gain horrible but the loss in sex drive drove me insane.  I finally decided to go off but the withdrawal was so horrible, i considered going back on this drug.  I had the usual side effects, brain zaps, etc.  But the emotional withdrawal symptoms is what is so devasting. I find myself crying and screaming when i'm alone and I have never ever had this problem pre-drug.  Please please, don't take this drug unless a trained counselor or doctor prescribes this and after much evaluation, finds this to be the correct route.  Family doctors aren't trained to see the signs of depression and anxiety.  My life is an absolute mess now and hopefully once all of the drug is out of me, i can lead a normal life.

I had been using the Vivelle Dot .05mg patch since I had surgery. I still had moderate to severe hot flashes throughout the day and night.  Since switching to Effexor XR, within 2 weeks, the hot flashes/night sweats have gone to none during the day, 1-2 mild ones in the evening and during the night.  I almost feel normal again!!

However, like many others, I experience severe withdrawal symptoms if I miss a dose. I've tried to get off it to start another drug and have been unable to do so. I was up to 450 mgs whereas my father only took 75 mgs and did not have trouble getting off the drug when it was time. I experience nausea, &quot;brain shivers&quot;, crying and severe depression when I miss more than one dose. Also cannot have an orgasm (or a very weak one anyway). Think seriously and discuss thoroughly with your doctor before starting this drug. I had tried nineteen different combinations of drugs before I started taking Effexor XR. Exhaust other possibilities first. I'm afraid that I'm going to be on this drug forever, whether I need to be or not. I'm not certain that it's been worth it.

When it seems like it isn't working anymore, increase your dose. After 5 years, I am having a problem with it working for me, so my doctor is now adding to it. Also, try Vitamin B's, which really helps too. I have experienced a change in the meds when I have to take antibiotics, and have seen my molar teeth crumble. Don't know if it is related, but if you experience any of these, write Wyeth, I have.

Every day was a struggle just to get through it. Effexor has given me the ability to deal with the normal stresses of every day life and feel like a normal, functioning human being. I have gained about 20 pounds, which some people say is from the drug, but I don't know for sure.

I was on it and all it did was cause weight gain, but coming off is hell.  Once you're on it, plan on staying on for life.  I've tried to come off this for three months, and went off the lowest dose two weeks ago.   I'm so dizzy I can't drive, can't work, and overall my quality of life is reduced to the point where I don't want to live anymore.   So, before taking any med please google effexor withdrawals, it may save your life.

I was taking Xanax at the same time. I had to stop taking Effexor as it caused central nervous system depression, which if you take this type of combination long enough it can be fatal from my research. I stopped the drug after two days. Symptoms of central nervous system depression include: extreme drowsiness, losing your balance, pains in the back of your head, extreme mobility problems, extreme state of confusion.The only anti-depressants I would recommend based on my own experience to be used with any of the benzodiazepines(xanax,klonopin,ativan,librium,etc .) would be Zoloft or Remeron(mirtazapine).

Both situational and chemical. Effexor has been best for overall effectiveness, but I still have some difficulty with depression. Some help is better than none and my alternative is a disabling depression during which I am unable to even get out of bed through the day. My Effexor treatment is supplemented with low dose Dexadrine. This is closely monitored by my MD. The help of Dexadrine is an often overlooked or underprescribed medication because of the unnecessarily fearful connection of the &quot;speed&quot; phenomenon - this is from a complete lack of education on the part of the MD as regards the usefulness of this medication, at proper times, to supplement the fatigue that can accompany depression.

It works great, the key is to take it every day at the same time so you avoid horrible side effects.  It causes me to sweat a lot, have night sweats, and slight excessive thirst, but i have pretty much learned to live with these.  The drug did start to wear off as did zoloft, which I originally took, so I now take 20mg of lexapro too.

The most bothersome where what is described as &quot;brain shocks&quot; or &quot;brain surges&quot;.  They're not painful, however they happen repeatedly throughout the day and make me dizzy often.  If I would have known about this side-effect that is rarely mentioned, I definitely would have thought again from taking this medication.

It seems to be relatively effective. I have full medical insurance, yet the cost to fill my Effexxor has never been less than $97.00. Personally, I find that overly expensive. Most importantly, I'd caution any and everyone considering taking Effexxor to research its side effects beforehand. Personally, I found the side effects to be nothing short of nightmarish. I 'm very regimented about taking my Effexxor every day at roughly the same time everyday. On the rare occassion that I missed a dose, let's say on a Tuesday morning; by Wednesday morning &amp; CERTAINLY by Wednesday evening, I am completely nauseous, my equilibrium is totally off kilter, my pupils begin to dilate, then decrease down to the size of a &quot;pin dot&quot;, and alternate back &amp; forth until I am able to take my next dose. I become extremely dizzy, and was literally afraid to drive my car. The side effects are so fierce, that I have only missed a dose perhaps 3 times in 5 years. Even then, it was a result of me unexpectedly having to stay overnight out of town on business - or some other extinuating circumstance. I don't mean to be disparaging, I'm simply an advocate of self education re: psychotherapeutic meds because every person reacts differently to any drug &amp; often times, physicians can't quite fathom the toll certain aspects of certain drugs have on our personal health and lifestyle.

I gained 25 pounds, completely lost all desire to have sex, and became depressed. I started sleeping for 12-15 hours a night, and all I wanted to eat were sweets. It did not even help my anxiety all that much. In short, it caused more problems than it solved. I went on a diet, and I didn't even start to lose weight until I went off of the medication.

My PCP put me on this right before I left home for college.  She thought the stress I was going through was related to depression but the fact was I was scared to move 15 hours away to go to school.  I was on this medication for 2 years and if I missed a single dose, I would feel the withdrawal symptoms immediately.  I would have trouble walking, very unsteady (like I was 80 years old), extreme sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, weakness, tired all the time.  When I tried to stop taking the medication, I couldn't go more than 2 days even with 37.5 mg.  Finally, I just had to deal with the withdrawal symptoms and laid on a couch for a whole week until I was completely detoxed.  It was the worst experience of my life...and the medicine did nothing to help my &quot;depression&quot;.  RESEARCH everything before you start taking something that you know nothing about.  Don't trust your doctor just because they went to medical school.

In fact, it heightened it.  When i drank a mixed drink, i became an angry drunk.  I attribute the increased angriness to this drug because i haven't had a problem since i've been off it.  There is a reason why it says not to drink alcohol while taking this med.  If thats a problem for you, then i would do some additional research.  also, the weight gain was awful.  I gained 20lbs in 3 months.  I'm usually very petite and this was such a tramautizing event for me that i became more depressed.  Overrall, just do research before this is prescribed to you.  My midwife, who has no mental health training, gave this to me. I find this absolutely irresponsible.  It ruined my life for two years and since i've been off, i feel like my old self.

I was acting uncharacteristic and had a bad gagging reflex even when i would swallow water. also, i was unable to climax sexually for the entire time I was on the medication. 
Other	babyjay, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	10/7/2007 2:50:15 PM	As soon as my doctor took me from 37.5 mg to 75 mg, I started having severe headaches, sensitivity to light, left ear and jaw hurt.  Very similar to migraine headaches.  My PCP thought it might be TMJ.  So, went to dentist and they made a TMJ splint.  Has not helped at all.  Will call my doctor and tell her of the headache ... problems.

I can tell that the drug is working because I dont get as angry at work about every little thing anymore. I have this, dont care attitude now. I have had to go more than 24 hrs without it because of the cost and it was very uncomfortable. I have tried other antidepressants and never experienced anything like this. I got extreme nausea, upset stomach, brain buzzes and more. I am on the highest does my Dr can give me, 225mg a day. Recently I asked for something cheaper and was rx the generic. I see or feel no difference.
Depression	cpnala, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	10/6/2007 1:01:46 PM	I have been taking Effexor XR for 3 months and I am feeling so much better! Instead of sitting around my house, I am redecorating and getting things done. I am a new person. I was previously on Prozac with minimal effects I reconmend this to anyone who needs it.
Bipolar Depression		1	1	1			10/5/2007 1:16:40 PM	Not a great choice for me. I'm not the type of person that likes to take medication period. The withdrawal from stopping is the worse I've ever experianced. Its like taking LSD. It works in the beginning but subsides the longer you take it. 
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	10/5/2007 2:27:46 AM	The drug worked great at the beginning, but overtime, it seems that it is not the best choice for me.  The one big problem with this drug is if you miss a dose the withdrawl effects are very noticeable.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety		5	5	5			10/4/2007 9:00:20 PM	Just beware that you can't stop taking the meds all at once. If I miss a dose, the withdrawl is pretty severe. I get these &quot;head zaps&quot; and dizziness and im extremely sick to my stomach.If a doctor steps down the dose, I'm told this doesn't happen.It's worth it though because I need to stay on it... it has saved my life, I am a much better person now.FYI I am on 150 mg 1x/day.
Depression	Micki, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/4/2007 12:59:21 PM	I started taking Effexor XR three years ago and it has made a dramatic difference in my quality of life (150 mg once a day).  I also deal with adult ADD, and Effexor has made it easier for me to concentrate and follow through on tasks. I'm very thankful to my doctor for recognizing the signs of both depression and ADD and prescribing this for me.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	10/4/2007 11:12:25 AM	I take 300mg per day (2 pills of 150mg), which is 1 dose away from the most mg allowed to be prescribed by law.  If I do not take this medication EXACTLY 24 hours every day, immediately I start getting withdrawl symtoms. Being a recovered drug addict, I know it is much like a withdrawl from heroin. 1st is the migraines. Then the sweating, bones hurting, vomiting, diareah, it's horrible. But, that's how I never miss a dose. The more extreme symptoms I wrote about do not happen until the 1st full 24 hours without the medicine. But, nonetheless, I've been free from depression for 4 years now, and clean and sober for the same amount of time. i would recommend this product only if you plan to be on it for a LONG period of time, as you can tell what it will be like to try to get off of it.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	10/4/2007 12:23:25 AM	Menopause took my sometimes edgy personality beyond the edge, and kept it hostage.  Any upset became fly off the handle blind anger.  This med stopped the derailment, totally and completely.  And immediately.  I still get angry, but it doesn't overtake me anymore.  I wish I could recapture the first two weeks on 39.5 mg; absolute contentment.  Doubling that did not much of anything; doubling it again (today) has been nice, but I still deal with being me.  I was afraid of meds like this; felt if I couldn't do it myself, I was weak and worthless.  Lemme tell ya, this med has made me ME again, to where I can interact with the world again instead of evading because I fear yet another inappropriate outburst.  I do like yakking with people; I am no longer sullen, which prevented that.  On the job, instead of finding fault with everything and anything, I've recaptured the joy in my ability to do what I do.  One idiot I work with, instead of being a source of bristling irritation, is just an idiot, period.  I still get angry and experience frustration; I'm still me.  But I don't find myself wanting to grab a baseball bat and knock some sense into people's heads anymore.  This med did not work for my biological daughter.  Can't judge meds like this that way.  But she did say it was nasty to get off of.  Weird positive side effect I've noticed:  when first taking, and at each dosage increase, my breathing is easier (I have asthma).  All in all, the positive of this med (no longer itching to jump out of my skin and whack somebody) is well worth it.  I watch the ceiling at night with each dose increase; when I do sleep, dreams are clearly remembered.  I am well pleased with this medication.  Me, who resisted messing with my psyche to the max for years.  If you're sitting on the fence, I'd say go ahead and jump in.  The water's fine.

I cried over everything.  No one said the &quot;right&quot; thing; I was hurt by everyone's words or actions.  I was tired and thought I would die if put in a new situation or attend an event alone.  Panic would consume me.  After a few days on this medication, I felt like &quot;me&quot; again!  A friend asked what I was doing, I looked 10 yrs younger!

I have the numbness and tingling in my hands at night which have woken me up. I have noticed a change in my eyesight which I have corrective lenses for but now I need stronger ones. The last is the intense dreams that seem to have increased. I started on this drug as a preventative measure for depression after losing my precious companion our dog suddenly. I work and could not afford to have the deep sadness interfere with my ability to funtion on a day to day basis. I am concerned with the reviews that indicate there is a withdrawl period since my doctor told me there was none.

My pharmacist told me it puts weight on.  I gained 50 lbs  As soon as I quit i started to lose it. This stuff is really scary and i would take something that is not so difficult to get off of
Other	RMS,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		10/3/2007 12:18:39 AM	This medicine took away my migraine associated vertigo almost 100%. The vertigo used to be so debilitating that I was spinning 24 hours a day, and now it's completely gone except occasionally during my menstrual cycle. My migraine headaches are also less severe and less frequent. I came off of it for two weeks before I delivered my third baby, but I took it throughout pregnancy with her and she was/is fine. The withdrawal was horrible for me and the vertigo came back, so I went back on it and am still on it while nursing. I was never a big fan of the antidepressant idea but this drug has completely given me my life back from migraine vertigo.

The sweating is ridiculous!! He started me on 75 mg which but cut it to 37.5 mg but the sweating did not stop, and that was not strong enough. I just break out in sweat all day! It's not worth that to me.

It landed me in a one year manic before I knew what it was, before I got help. I left my husband, had affairs with woman and men until I finally got to a Pdoc and got on drugs for Bi polar. I am finally stable now, two years later with my life very different and a family ruined. I tried to go off the effexor and crashed and tried to commit suiside. So I love and hate this drug!

If you do drink, only limit to one alcoholic beverage per hour.  For mania and BPD symptoms, this drug works well in combination  with Lamictal (an anti-convulsant). This combo treatment helps immensely. Talk to your doctor about it.

Within four months, I was suicidal and totally withdrawn. Saw a medicine specialist who put me on Wellbutrin, but I am still on the Effexor XR. It has proven nearly impossible to get off of it, unless I am willing to spend three weeks in a locked psychiatric ward. It doesn't seem to do anything until we try to titer me off the drug (300mg daily). Then I am in awful pain, sick, nauseated, and have to get back on it again. I am 61 years old and have a terminal illness. Considering that I should have been dead a year ago, I am just not willing to be shut away from husband and family for three weeks. My personal opinion is that the entire inventory of Effexor XR should be burned!
