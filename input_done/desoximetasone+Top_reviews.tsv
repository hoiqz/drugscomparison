But, this cream doesn't absorb quickly and that's why I don't like using it.

The redness was quite disturbing.  After using this medication the redness is completely gone and my legs are back to normal.  The only side effect is the hair is growing like crazy on my legs.  The wife kids me about this.

I also use it in conjunction with Tecnu poison ivy and oak oil remover soap. Works great!

It has dramatically improved the appearance of the skin on the back of my neck and chest where I suffer from atopic dermatitis. My doctor prescribed the desoximetasone along with another topical drug, but I have only renewed the prescription for desox. because of how effective it was. I would strongly recommend this for anyone coping with a similar skin condition.  
Contact Dermatitis	felinecharms, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/26/2010 4:29:54 PM	So far so good!  I have had trouble with my hands for about 2 years now and this last month has been awful.  Cracking and bleeding they had gotton so tight and swollen I couldn't hardly move them.  I have had 3 shots of steriods and numerous lactic acid lotions that burned like fire.  But this was immeadiate releaf.  I hopw it keeps working or I would have had to quit my job.
Contact Dermatitis	25-34 (Patient) 	5	4	5		25-34	4/15/2010 3:17:51 PM	I contracted poison ivy (I am VERY allergic)&amp; my doctor prescribed this for me. I am extremely cautious with medicine and I hesitated to use it after reading some reviews but I am 100% happy that I used this. Within 24 hours my rash is almost gone. I have had ZERO side effects! Until yesterday, my rash was still weeping and spreading but thanks to this, I am almost healed. 
Atopic Dermatitis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	3/16/2010 10:34:32 PM	This medicine helped my eczema a lot, however, it came with a very unfortunate side effect: stretch marks. I have them behind my left knee and on my thighs. I switched to another doctor and she gave me a new medicine. To this day, the stretch marks have not gone away and I'm not sure they ever will. It's really very unfortunate.

Atopic Dermatitis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	6/30/2009 6:33:16 PM	I was prescribed this medication because after surgery I developed atopic dermatitis on my feet. My dermatologist tried many medications and nothing helped for more then a few days. I saw my foot doctor and he prescribed this immediately. It took a few weeks to start working, but as long as I remember to use it now, I rarely ever have any itching on my feet. It's the only long term medication I've used that's done any good.

Perhaps it takes more two weeks, Time will tell.
Atopic Dermatitis	Meghan, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	5/11/2009 1:54:41 PM	I used this medicine for severe eczema on my legs and stomach. At first I had great results with this medicine. It got rid of some major spots. I kept using it for my normal breakouts for a couple of years. I know have learned that it caused weight gain and stretch marks. I decided to go to a new doctor who said he would never let anyone take this medicine for more than six weeks! I might never get rid of these nasty stretch marks but since I stopped taking the med I have lost 15 pounds, without trying. I do not recommend taking this medicine for extended use. Anyone can have these side effects. 
Contact Dermatitis	mysticpc, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/31/2009 1:07:09 PM	More than once I have had an episode of contact dermatitis. I experience extreme intense itching, rednes, severe swelling, irritation with red raised bumps and welps on my arm. Using desoximetasone 0.25% cream is the only cream that works for me. I experience almost immediately relief and I continue to use it until there is no sign of the rash. I highly recommend this to anyone!!!!!

My doctor prescribed this medicine and I have been using it for a few weeks, hasn't been doing much. I have noticed that is has caused some skin discoloration, that the spots on my legs I have been rubbing it in have turned white, especially noticeable after a hot shower.

Skin Condition	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/18/2009 1:32:52 PM	I had an undetermined skin condition on the back of my thigh.  It started with an itchy bump that got raw, and infected (from scratching).  This cream helped immediately, dried the oozing, and made itching and scales go away in only a couple of days.  I was warned that it can cause thinning of the skin and not to use for a prolonged time though.

Rather expensive without insurance, but worth every penny. The only &quot;side effect&quot; I noticed was RELIEF!
