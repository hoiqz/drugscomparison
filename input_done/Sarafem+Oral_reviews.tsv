Premenstrual Disorder with a State of Unhappiness	sjgirl85, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/25/2012 3:58:15 PM	I have been taking this medication for 7 months now.  It has honestly changed my life.  I wish I would have started taking it a lot sooner.  I have suffered from, what my doctors called,PMDD.  I was depressed, anxious and easily frustrated at some points of the month which seemed to center around my menstrual period.  I would cry for no reason, get upset or mad for no reason, I was super sensative, got frustrated VERY easily and was extremely anxious at times.  It interfered with all of my relationships - my family (especially my parents), my boyfriend, my friends (especially my rooommate and best friend).  I was reluctant to start taking this medication, as I was afraid to feel like a different person or TOO happy or disconnected with reality.  After reading reviews, I decided to start it... it was worth a shot.  I'm going on my 8th month and I feel like myself with a happy outlook on life, a more balanced mood and more control over my emotions.  My frustration level has gone WAY down, which was one of my biggest problems.  My relationships have become better and easier... and everyone notices a huge difference in my mood and personality.  The ONLY negative I have found is that I have gained about 10 pounds since starting it and my doctor says that is is related to the medication.  Totally worth it though!

I only took 10 mg for 14 days.  Yes, it does take the edge off, however I had a very difficult time sleeping.  I would lie awake for two hours some nights which is never usually an issue for me.  Another issue was that I could not achieve orgasm.  I had an option to cut the 10mg in half but I decided against it.  I will try a more natural route or even consider getting back on birth control.

I have to say I'm thrilled with the results so far. I am more stable in mood, my breasts weren't tender with my period, I have less symptoms of PMDD (my hubby noticed a difference!) and I just feel more like myself. I take it at night b/c it tends to make me a little tired if I take it in the morning. I have also lost weight which has been an issue with my past history of anorexia. I am never hungry. The fog I felt the first week went away and I feel like doing normal things (playing with the kids, laundry, grocery shopping) again. My aches and pains I used to feel are also gone. I almost worry this is to good to be true. I feel wonderful. I take 10 mg each day. Start with small dose and work up from that dose if you need to increase. High dose gave me anxiety. I hope this drug helps you as it has helped me, you aren't alone in the way you feel! Keep trying!

It felt like I went through two weeks of moodiness, irritability, anxiety and depression.  It finally got to the point where I was having depressive episodes where I just wanted to sleep.  I went to my doctor and she diagnosed me with PMDD.  She changed my birth control and wrote me an Rx for Sarafem and after one cycle I have noticed a major difference.  I feel like I normally do the rest of the month.  I'm not moody, irritable or depressed.  I'm so glad I went and talked to my doctor about this I can finally be normal again!

She told me about Sarafem.  I told her I didn't want to really take anti-depressants.  She told me about taking it for 14 days, before my cycle.  I've been taking it for over a year now and it has been a blessing.  I haven't experienced any negative side effects, except a lack of sex drive.  That could be due to communication problems in my marriage, but I noticed the lack of intrest in sex increased when I began Sarafem.  I read the reviews for Paxil CR and Zoloft, hoping to find another treatment for PMDD without the lack of interest in sex drive, but Sarafem has the most positive reviews.  I take 10mg of Fluoxetine HCL for 14 days each month and I'm very pleased with how I feel each month.  It has made me feel less anxious and generally content.

I am noticing that I have the &quot;I don't care&quot; attitude to situations where I would normally over-react to.  Be careful taking this with Robatussin (battling a cold).  It caused me to be a bit confused and disorientated, with several weird dreams.

It definitely helps with my mood and uncontrollable anger.  Before taking this, the silliest things would make me want to scream!  When my husband asked me why I take it, I tell him that I take it in order to extend HIS life expectancy :-)  Enough Said?

I have a very bad stage of depression and it hasnt worked the best for me. Some people don't take me seriously when I say that this drug hasn't worked. My doctor said that she would put me on a stronger dosage but never did. If you have extreme depression, ask your doctor for a strong dose. Mild depression will not work with the first dose that they give to you.

However, my pharmacist has told me that they have discontinued it. Does anyone know why or of anything else that works as well as Sarafem?

It has brought me peace of mind and wonderful sanity. My &quot;crazy&quot; time is a lot less stressful on my family. It has brought harmony back into my life.  When I think of how angry and shrill I became around &quot;that time of the month&quot;  I wonder how my family could stand me!

Although situational depression still gets to me, I no longer feel it's unbearable since the extra weight of PMDD-induced depression has been lifted. Most importantly, I've experienced basically no side effects. I dream a bit more vividly, that's all. No sexual side effects, even though my doctor warned me this was common! I'm in a bad place in my life, but Sarafem has made it bearable.

I am not a crazy lunatic every month before my period anymore, it has balanced me.  It is the only medication I am on other than an allergy medication.  I wish I had started sarafem many years ago.  It has really taken away all my symtoms, especially my anxiety and anger before my period.  I am on 10 mg a day.
