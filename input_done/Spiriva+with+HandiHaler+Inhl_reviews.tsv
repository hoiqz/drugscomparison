When this happens I can't seem to really catch my breath.  I feel like this 2 or 3 days a week. I have been admitted to the hospital 3 times in 4 months. I also have insomnia, depression, weight gain.

I tried to stop for one month and noticed the difference.  I question where the plastic from the capsule that is removed to allow the breathing hole goes.  I assume it would be caught in the screen, but I rarely see any there.  Is it in my lungs?  A transparent capsule to see the medication in the capsule would be a BIG improvement.

After two month, the itchy rash was so severe I checked the website and discontinued using Spiriva. Now after 6 weeks of not using Spiriva, the rash is some better, but not completely gone.  What can I do for relief?  Is there a treatment that will completely stop the itchy rash?. Do you have posted experiences from others?

And my breathing has almost returned to normal. iT IS VERY EFFECTIVE. However the side effects have been difficult to deal with. Experienced anxiety,dry mouth, insomnia, night sweats,depression, increased heart rate. The symptoms began almost from the start.When I stopped taking it the breathing problems returned. It will be difficut to figure out what I should do. Stop the medication or live with the side effects.

Shame we can not get the medication and not have to by a new Inhalator.. Anyone know if we can purchase Spiriva without the Inhalator? Just buying the Medication may keep me from falling into the Donut Hole. Maybe someone could make a suggestion for a replacement medication cause either the Spiriva or the Advair I take must go.

Even talking I would get out of breath. I was scared. Have been using Spriva for the past 8 months and the change in my breathing has been amazing. My lungs feel clearer, I can walk longer without losing my breath. I recommend this for anyone dealing with COPD. Its been wonderful for me! Only drawback is my mouth is so dry, my lips actually stick to my teeth. So I have something to drink with me all day. Never go anywhere without something to drink. I never knew Spriva could cause urination problems. I see others have complained of that, and it affects me too. I can go over 8 hours without having to urinate. Other than the dry mouth and problmes urinating, this is my wonder drug!

Emphysema	greatgrandma, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		12/18/2011 9:28:14 AM	Very expensive. Many capsules snapped and exploded when pierced.  All the powder fell out, which wasted the dose.  I do not find it helpful, but my doctor insists I take it along with another prescription.  I am considering not following his orders.

Emphysema	sweeney, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	11/24/2011 5:21:29 AM	Seems to be helpful as I appear to have increased the L/Min on my flow meter from around 500/540 to 560/600 in the month or so that I have been on it. Mouth seems dryer but that may be my Sjrogens Syndrome.One question not addressed in literature though. What happens to the piece of the capsule coating that is removed when capsule is punctured? Is it gelatin and gradually absorbed somewhere safe? would be nice to know I've only found remains of the capsue once in the unit into which the capsules are inserted. Agree with suggestion of clear capsule as I did find at first that not all powder had been inhaled. Now breath in at least twice and then check all has gone

I had major side effects I believe were caused by the Advair. Weight gain, water retention, headaches, shortness of breath, and terrible dry skin! I was put on water pills and that was a disaster! The Advair was stopped and I was given Dulera. Its a fantastic drug, however in the U.S. its $240.00 for (1) inhaler. I'm forced to purchase from Canada because I don't have have insurance. Even in Canada, the Dulera is very expensive until the patent runs out. I still don't know which of the (3) meds is causing the dry skin, (dermatitis). Any ideas??

All others made my heart race.  This one seems to elevate my pulse which wakes me up at about 4am every morning.  If I do sleep longer I can not sleep more than 7 hours at a time.  I have had a skin issue while on Spiriva where I get red marks for a few days if I press against an object for longer than 15 minutes.  The red marks last about 2 days.  Both sleeplessness and skin issues dissappear when I stopped taking Spiriva for 2 days.  Other than that it does help me breath better with less racing heart issues.
Emphysema	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	8/18/2011 2:36:44 PM	I know this may be jumping the gun, but the improvement with this drug, at least for me, was evident after my first dose. I have been diagnosed with severe emphysema (after 35 years of smoking, ya think? :) ), and experienced shortness of breath after something as simple as showering. After the first dose, I noticed that I went thru the entire day sympton free. As for side effects, I don't believe I've been on it long enough for any to really develop, but I thank the posters here for things to be on the lookout for.

It helps me breath easier, even if I am already having some bronchospasm. I can use it and it will help. But it is quite expensive. And I feel it is wasteful to sell the handihaler in every box. I think it would save money for them and for me if they would offer it without the handihaler. I am sure some people would buy it and use it more if it were cheaper. You  don't need a new handihaler in every box!Thank youmamoohaha97@yahoo.com

I've been taking Spiriva for two months. I was essentially asymptomatic before the pneumonia, so it's hard to say whether I breathe more easily. The night time heartburn has been off-putting, but now joint pain has settled into my hands and wrists. I won't be able to continue if this side effect does not resolve.

After 3 weeks I developed a very soar throat with some bleeding through the sinus cavities and lost my vocals for up to 5 weeks. Could not carry on a conversation with anyone. I am dispointed with my doctor for not pointing that out to me even if the side effects may have been listed on the package insert. Too bad too because the medicine was helping me gain breathing momentum as I always had trouble climbing stairs. The medicine gave me the energy to do just that. But I have a business that requires engaging people on a daily basis and my inability to speak was not a good thing so I got off of Spiriva.

January 2009 was told I had a blot clot behind left eye. Condition taken care of by Retina Specialist. Developed Macular edema in last few months.  Received medical attention which cleared up ME.  Recently developed ME again and notice my vision is also getting blurry in left eye.  I find Spiriva excellent for treating COPD but not sure if it is having effect on my eyes. Getting treatment for eye problem. Going to stop taking to see if eye problems stop. Never had eye problems before starting Spiriva.

I cycle 80-100 miles a week.  Hills that were a major effort before Spiriva are nowhere nearly as daunting. My overall energy level is much increased.I have had no side effects other than slight hoarseness.I highly recommend that COPD patients try the drug to see if it works for them.

Bronchospasm Prevention with COPD	Barb, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	55-64	9/13/2009 8:16:36 AM	Diagnosed with Mod. COPD. Been on this med. for 5 days, no improvement. The only thing it has given me are heart palpitations.  I'm on Symbicort as well. I love riding my bike (10+ miles per day), but the COPD restricts that now. Spiriva/Symbicort combo is worthless.  I have more mucous and chest tightness now than before I started these meds. I'm an ex-smoker (2 1/2 packs - 31 years); quit 12 years ago. Doc says I've probably had COPD for many years, the symptoms are just now surfacing.  Chest x-ray clear, lungs clear. Spiro test revealed that I have 62% lung function. I have bad allergies and am wondering if that's not most of the problem.  I'm going for a 2nd opinion.

Since that time even though I am on other medications I have noted the facts that constipation, blurry vision, some headaches accur with using this medication. But if my doctor still wants me to use it I will, but some of the side effects cause me distress, even though this medication really helps me every day, and I was diagnosed at 53 years old.

Bronchospasm Prevention with COPD		3	5	3			2/26/2009 11:49:07 AM	Using Spiriva and Advair 500.  Both are too expensive.  Will meet my gap on medicare in 7 months.  Wonder how much I am paying for the advertising for these 2 drugs.  Should be a law against advertising prescription drugs.  I need to quit one of them.  Believe the Spiriva is causing urine retention in bladder.  Causes bladder infections.  Even with both drugs still have to use albuterol.  Not sure what I should do.  No alternatives.

Bronchospasm Prevention with COPD	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	10/24/2008 10:43:52 AM	My GP switched me to Spiriva from an inhaled steroid, this seems more effective and easier for my breathing difficulty. Initially experienced dry mouth and throat, this has receded. However: &quot;Store this medication at 77 degrees F (25 degrees C). Brief storage between 59 and 86 degrees F (15 and 30 degrees C) is permitted.&quot; News Flash! I live in the northeast, heat with oil, and keep my thermostat at 60 degrees. If I really need to keep this medication at 77, that's a huge hidden cost.

Other	Patricia, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	9/27/2008 1:34:33 PM	I have mild to moderate asthma and reactive airway disease. For years I have had a chronic cough and have used every inhaler and medication for allergies that is available OTC or by prescription.  I frequently used an albuteral inhaler to stop sudden coughing attacks. A year ago I was prescribed Spiriva and it has been a miracle for me! I rarely have sporatic coughing attacks (especially in public) and rarely use an albuteral inhaler--before that I used it almost daily. I am so grateful that my new allergist realized that this is the drug of choice for me. I take no other medications for my condition. 
Other	45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/26/2008 8:51:20 AM	My doc gave me the Spiriva because of my smoking. The first time I used it, I noticed a drastic change in my lung capacity for the GOOD. I'm able to take deeper breaths and hold my breath longer. I play racquet ball every day and I am not huffing and puffing half as much as I normally do. I have been using the drug for one week but I am amazed. Also, in the week I have been using it, I have cut my smoking down by at least 50% for some reason????

The drug appears to work quite well.  Today, though, I went to my eye doctor and he told me I am beginning to experience signs of macular degeneration.  I am only 55.  I have been on Spiriva for one year and nine months and it has been almost exactly two years since my last eye appt.  I had noticed problems with my eyesight and I had read that one could experience changes in vision with this drug.  Has anyone else out there had any such diagnoses?

I was referred to a pulmunologist who immediately changed me to Spiriva.  No problems with the Spiriva except maybe a little dry mouth.  I have not been rinsing after taking Spiriva.  I've been glad to get off the steroid in the Advair.  Agree with the comments that the capsule should be clear to verify that there is content and that all is used.

Probably great for more serious breathing problems than mine but in my case not worth the side effects.

However, it is not possible to just buy the capsules alone.  One presciption includes only 30 caspules which is a one month supply if taken as directed. So you are paying a lot for a new inhaler you probably do not need.  I wish they would just sell the capsules in lots of 60 per prescription.  I do not like having to pay for a new inhaler and then getting only 30 capsules per box.  This is not a cheap drug - roughly $150 per box and you get only a one month supply or 30 capsules.  As directed, you are supposed to take it every day at the same time.  This drug is way too expensive. Ask your doctor for something less expensive if your medical condition allows it.

Side effects are pretty mild (at least for me).  It may be causing slightly elevated resting heart rate, but otherwise haven't noticed side effects as long as I take it in the morning (believe it might keep me awake if I took it in the evening instead).Have suggested they make the capsule fully or partly clear so patients can see the powder in the capsule before they take their med &amp; no powder after they've taken their med.  BI (manufacturer) says they'll consider the suggestion, which has been implemented in some other countries.
