I began taking razadyne after side effects with Arecept.  Side effects were less with Razadyne, but dreams have continued, but less intense.  Little positive effect on memory.  Now I take Namenda with Razadyne and I see an improvement.  However, cognitive skills tests did not improve after six months of both.  But, I feel better.

I just started taking it this morning, so I really don't know what to expect-- or if it's going to be helpful.  I am quite concerned about possible side effects because I am very sensitive to medication and had my gall bladder removed around five years ago.
