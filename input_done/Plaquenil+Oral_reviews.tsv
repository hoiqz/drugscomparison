It was a lifesaver initially.  It really helped but for the last year I developed sensorineural hearing loss and began having trouble with my eyes.  If you take this it is very important to have your eyes checked regularly and have visual field acuity testing.  Once damage is done it is permanent.  It doesn't effect everyone this way but it is important to get checked regularly.

I only took 1 tablet daily for the last 3 or 4 years, in the last2 years that I have started having symtons, first they were only noticable to me, then they have gotten stronger. I don't want to say worse because they don't last more than a couple hours some times less,oh,Iam taking plaquinel because I was diagnosed with lupus in 1985, I did not see any symtoms until abuut 2002 when my temp. went up to 104.4.the lupus affected my lungs,first my dr. put me on pednisone then she weened me me off and put me on plaquenil,this morning I woke up to a swollen jaw and as I write I can feel the swelling going down. GOD gave man wisdome to formilate drugs because this body was not made to last forever. From the day we are born we begin dieing, so I advise you to take care of yourself and advise everybody that you have the oppertunity to talk to.tell them the same.

My Doctor insists I have a break after about 18 months continuous use for six months. Any longer and my R.A. returns, it does take a further six months to get back into the system. I've never had any side effects from it. After this break my symptoms came back with dreadful flareups and I had to have a steroid injection which has stopped all flareups and attacks. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis		1	5	1			4/26/2012 1:58:02 AM	I've been taking this medicine for over 2 months now with no results- my Rheumatologist said it can take up to 6 months to work! But now in the last few weeks I've been suffering from its side effects of nausea, dizziness, feeling lightheaded &amp; even occasionally vomiting. So, take this into consideration before beginning your treatment.

I was having a very bad flare up, with rash from chest on up. I started the medicatins, by the 2-3 week I did start feeling beter, a little more umph in my step. also a little less fatigued. Then i started getting blurry vision, and my loew legs form my knee's done started going numb after standing for maybe an hour. So I quess it's all achance, wether your body will handle it or not. It's a hit or miss. Thats why there are other courses of treatment. Everyone is different, just got to find the right one for you.

Didn't seem to do anymore for my joint pain than regular old ibuprofen, so why should I have to deal with the side effects.  I now treat the symptoms as they come, with OTC pain relief.  If things get any worse I may have to start on it again - but I am hoping for the best.

Other	mememe, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	3/28/2012 11:55:46 PM	After 10 years of being misdiagnosed with Fibromyalgia, I was recently diagnosed with Undisclosed Connective Tissue Disease - basically all symptoms Sjogren's with a normal result on lip biopsy - and my rheumatologist put me on this drug, 200mg twice a day.  It has made a fantastic difference already.  I am 26 and was starting to feel helpless in my life because my health was so out of my control.  I was having stronger and stronger flare ups and was to a point where it hurt to walk, I was having shiver fits, my legs were bruising, my hair was falling out, my skin covered in rashes, my behavior/personality changed, etc.  After a month on this drug, I've seen slow but steady improvement.  I have had several flare ups, but they were minor and less painful.  Overall, this drug is not a cure, and it won't fix everything (especially with an autoimmune disease, where after a while you don't really know what's from the disease and what's from other causes), but it has helped me drastically.  I want to live again.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	3/27/2012 9:22:49 PM	I started taking this for RA about 6 months ago.  Had reduced morning stiffness after about 8 weeks, but no further improvement since then(Probably due to severity of disease activity instead of med. ineffectiveness). I had slight stomach discomfort when I started taking it.  Now I only have problems when I have to take something else with it, like prednisone or antibiotics.  Benefits definitely outweigh the side effects.

Have been on it for 13 years. Have SLE and suffered from joint pain and swelling, hair loss, fatigue, migraines, and other bad neurological symptoms, rash. Debilitating fatigue was the worst! Started feeling the medication working after 6 weeks, and took about 12 weeks for full effect. Took two 200mg tablets a day.  Tried weening back to only one 200mg tablet a day with no luck. Joint pain, swelling, migraines and fatigue came flooding back. Now 400mg on even days alternating with 200 mg on the odd days. No side effects that I know of over the years.  Have routine blood work drawn every 6 months. This medication was a lifesaver for me in the midst of SLE, and I am thankful not to have to use the other medications like steroids that can have worse side effects.

Inflammation of Blood Vessels in the Skin	Maureen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	55-64	10/16/2011 10:39:54 AM	My dermatologist prescribed this medication for treatment of Lichens Planoplaris Frontal Alopecia -- basically hair loss when hair follicles die after enough scarring due to skin inflammation...a harmless health risk, but still something most women want to prevent. Prednisone was also prescribed for the first four weeks of treatment with the dose stair stepping down as the Plaquenil built up in my system. I was three days away from ending the Prednisone when I began to feel sick -- lethargic, fever, sore/constricted throat, swollen tongue and a ripe rash that bloomed first on my lower back. While waiting for my doctor to return my call, this rash had spread around my torso. I was sent to my primary doc to determine if this was an allergic response to medication or a viral/bacterial infection. My primary felt it was drug allergy and gave me a shot of cortisone with advice to also take Bendryl and keep my dermatologist appointment scheduled for the next day. I awoke sicker than before with a 103 degree fever and a virulent, itchy rash that had spread to cover my body like a racer-back swimsuit! Plus, my body seemed to be swelling from the inside with enlarged waist and breasts. My dermatologist said because the steroid shot hadn't knocked the rash back but seemed to enhance it that she felt the reaction might really be viral or bacterial after all and sent me back to my primary for further diagnostics. I was able to get blood tests and a strep test by early afternoon and found out the next morning that I was healthy except for this reaction and prescribed another round of steroids -- oral and topical -- to treat the drug allergy. It has been two days and the rash is finally subsiding, though slowly, and my temperature is normal. I am concerned now about how long full recovery will take -- I have a vacation trip planned in less than two weeks-- plus will I have now an ongoing need for steroids and if I have any permanent damage to organs.

Have had five biopsies, no cancer, no sarcoidosis.  Dr. thinks it is contact dermatitis but I disagree.  Occasional redness and slight itching.  Been to two dermatologists and have seen about 100 others at a grand round.  No one seems to know what it is or care. Have vision checked by opthamologist every six months.  So far that's fine.  Am ready to forget about doctors. Been fighting this for two years.

Trying to ween myself off them now because I forget to take them half the time and feel pretty good so am going to try it without them.Would definitly recommend this drug as long as you keep faithfull to your eye and blood check ups.Worked well in combinatin with advil but advil was hard on stomach if you can go without the advil would recommend it.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	LUCKY, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	35-44	2/4/2011 4:11:45 PM	This med was given to me for joint pain relief.  It started working within a few days as far as noticing a difference in the morning stiffness of hands and other joints. BUT,I also started having other random problems, I thought purely bizarre timing.  LONG STORY short, after weeks of fighting (what I initially though was unrelated) mouth sores, nose sores, eye ulcers, hair loss, urinary pain and a rash that COVERED my legs and feet, 2 ER trips later I was diagnosed with Steven's Johnson Syndrome - which is life threatening allergic reaction to med - skin was breaking down from inside out.  Took myself off med because ea. DR. kept sending me away saying they knew nothing about the med - didn't need to know the med, needed to have know I was allergic to it and COULD HAVE DIED!  Many people die from SJS within a month of being intro to the med.  I'm not saying this med is bad (cause the pain went away) just saying that pay attention to your body and trust your gut!  I knew something was wrong and kept insisting on help.  The Rx label warn of reactions - take them seriously.  I had no idea what was happening to me could have been deadly - even hesitated stopping the med b/c I was getting relief.

Benedryl was making me so sleepy, doctor said to take Loratadine (OTC) and it works great without the fatigue. I have have ringing in the ears for a couple of years, it came on very suddenly. I have noticed that this has now been added as a side effect. Don't know if it would go away if I quit taking it. Right now I'm trying to wean myself off prednisone----it's been rough!

My dermatologist prescribed plaquenil and I have been on it ever since. My birthday is this month, I will be 24 and just last month I was diagnosed by my rheumatologist with Systemic lupus. Plaquenil has worked well for me over the past 10 years, but if a flare is strong enough, it's like I'm not taking any medication. It works well for my skin, but my joints and my back hurt so bad, sometimes I can't get out of bed. I would recommend this medication and also give advise to just give it time and you will see the benefits.

I've taken 200mg twice a day and have noticed definite improvements in mobility / joint stiffness and the rash on my nose / cheeks.  The most bothersome side effects I've had were diarrhea and feeling tired at times, though the fatigue wasn't as bad as it used to be.  I've been on the medication for 7 weeks and will definitely continue it.  I hope it keeps my symptoms in remission so I can be active again.

I was on 200mg twice a day. I had no stomach probs,etc but I did notice my vision decrease slightly. I am 37 yo &amp; wear bi-focals. I had to stop the med after 3 wks because I began having severe burning &amp; tingling in my feet/ankles. It was very painful to walk or sleep. My rheum dr said that can be a reaction but she usually sees it in pt's that have been on the med for 10-20 yrs. took me 3 wks. Unfortunately it was working. I felt better &amp; my blood tests were down. Now I'm not on anything &amp; have more frequent flares of body aches, photosensitivity, burning red hands, etc.  Next step might be methotrexate. we will see.  Has anyone else experienced the red burning hands? Makes me want to soak them in a big cooler of ice! And they get very stiff.

Started taking Plaquinil has been Ok so far but time will tell.  will repost, but after 4 horrible years of pain and feeling like my body was falling apart hopefully this will help.  And if anyone has Sjogrens ask the eye dr. about plugs in the tear ducts they are wierd at first but they do help. Good luck to all and hope this helps.

After 3 weeks I felt it was helping but then I broke out in a terrible rash on my face, torso and arms and we agreed it was a reaction to the drug.  I have stopped taking it and with a treatment of Prednisol, the rash is getting better.  Too bad because it was helping with the other symptoms.

My energy went way up and no rashes..good sense of well-being.  Up until the present time it worked so well for me.  I have discoid lupus and this medication helped me tremendously since I do live in Florida part of the year.  I do use sunblock and stay out of the sun.  At the present, the medication does not seem to help with the rashes and my energy level is low, so next step is to see my rheumatologist to see what if anything has changed.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	daienu, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	6/27/2010 9:58:44 AM	I am a 30 year old female with a 10 year history of SLE and Sjogren Syndrome. My lupus was properly diagnosed in 2008, until then all kinds of theories were tested of what my illnesses were. Since 2004 my condition began to worsen, since 2007 quite dramatically, until the diagnosis. Steroids were used at first. The pain subsided only temporarily, weight gain followed. At the beginning of this year Plaquenil was prescribed to keep my lupus from flaring up. I haven't noticed a very significant difference with the flares. With the pain and general feeling well, I find it is connected more to the monthly cycle. After the beginning dose, I now take one 200 mg dose at night, one in the morning. If I don't eat with it, it causes nausea, dizziness. My hairloss has not stopped, my joint pain has (lupus comes hand in hand with RA and nerve pain like in fibromyalgia). I do find flares can be controlled by the type of diet we follow: meat and milk products in moderation, same with anything acidic; but plenty of fruits and vegetables, with the exception of mushrooms and alfalfa. The first is hard to digest, the second triggers flares. My vision has worsened significantly: I cannot wear my contact lenses. The optometrist said one of my eyes cannot produce enough moisture and after one day of wear it gets inflamed. It doesn't help that I have Sjogren's ( chronic dry eyes and mouth) and astigmatism in that eye.  Even the special eye drops don't help, and this sort of dryness  affects vision adversely. They are considering a surgery to plug the tearducts to help my eyes produce enough 'tears' for my eyes to see better.Lastly, at about the same time I began taking Plaquenil I began having a runny nose and sneezing a lot. At first we thought it was a cold, but it stayed for weeks...and despite medication. Then the spring passed by. My doctor suggested allergies, which I never had. Still puzzled. Have any of you had similar symptoms to this last one?

The main side effect I get after taking the medication is that I break out in hives then I have to take Benadryl which in turn makes me sleepy. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	45-54	6/23/2010 5:09:49 PM	I was prescribed this with Minocycline and had stomach issues.

Other	cwatty, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	55-64	6/23/2010 11:05:50 AM	I have sarcoidosis. First diagnosed with it in the lung. After a year of treatment of prednisone I came off of that and a few  months later was getting sick every day, wake up feeling nauseous and it started lasting all day. Thought it was gastro and went through all sorts of test and scans. End result was it was the sarcoid and it was now in  my liver and skin. Dr. put  me back on the prednisone and now has added the Plaquenil. After a month I am nauseous more now and dizzy where I have started to vomit bile, also have ringing in my ear that is out of control, I have to stop. This has not been a good experience for me as I was hoping this would get me off of the prednisone. Waiting to see where we will go from here but

I was put on Methotrexate, Celebrex (stopped due to headaches) and am now on Orencia once a month.  They aches and pains and Fatigue are worse.  Plaquenil was added and I feel worse.  I feel like I have restless leg syndrome but all over my body.  My lower back (possibly kidneys) are throbbing and depression is setting in.  With the combination of variouos medication, like the rest of you I'm not sure which medication is causing what side effects.  I hate taking so much medication but I need to in order to get through the day at work.  I would love to lose weight from the medications but instead due to a steriod shot I've ballooned making things worse.  RA is terrible.

Other	everanon, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	55-64	6/6/2010 3:30:05 PM	Drug was prescribed for Sjogrens syndrome (chronic extreme dryness of eyes, mouth and nose), an autoimmune disease related to Lupus.Drug seems to be working very well in combination with oral pilocarpine.  However I have been experiencing some very disturbing problems since I started taking this medication.  These include general fatigue, general muscle weakness and problems with control of arm and leg muscles, obsessive thinking, labored breathing, nausea and stomach pain.Plaquenil is among the possible causes I am researching.  Other possibilities are hyperthyroidism, Guillain-Barre' syndrome and other changes in my medications.I will have to discuss my findings with my doctors before any conclusions can be drawn.  In the meantime I may reduce the dosage myself to see if there are any improvements in the possible side effects

A reheumalogist declared my lupus to be 'wildly out of control'and prescribed Plaquenil. He said that if my face should happen to turn 'red like a lobster', to call him immediately. After two doses, I knew that something was very wrong and went to see him that same morning. He took one look at me, handed me a prescription for a massive amount of Demerol and told me to go home, that I would be very ill. (He was a real compassionate guy!) That was at 10am. At that point, I looked like I had a bad case of acne. By 10pm, I did look like a lobster and could not drink enough water. I was in pain all over; it felt like my skin was being pulled off my body. By 3am, my skin WAS starting to slough off like a third-degree burn over at least half of my body. The pain was excruciating. The local emergency room admitted me as an inpatient and got three IV's running-two for fluid rehydration and one for a drip Demerol. Solumedrol was added later in the day. Very few practitioners know what Stevens=Johnson Syndrome is, much less have seen it at any stage. Sadly, it is not as rare as it used to be. Many of the new pharmaceuticals are causing a variation of SJS that involves damage to the linings of internal organs. If you or your family medical history runs toward allergies or auto-immune diseases, do your homework before popping that new pill. It could save you or someone you love a very painful traumatic experience, maybe even save a life.

Flare-ups were getting worse and more frequent.I finally started taking it after my blood work showed my c-reactive protein at 156(shows the amount of inflammation in the body) it should be 0. my platelets were over 600,000 and the norm is 140,000-350,000. I took this medication for a few months and my flares decreased amazingly , CPR was normal and platelets went to 250,000. However down side my eyes got worse, but my Opthamologist said he would rather take 2 Plaquenil a day than 2 Acetaminophen that is how safe it is. It is not a miracle drug but it does help. it take about a few months , nothing is ever overnight. It does help.But is not a miracle drug.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	sjrf, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	55-64	3/9/2010 11:48:56 AM	I was diagnosed with RA in 1998.  I started on plaquenil 1 BID, then methtreate was added 6 mos later and then Arava was added.  After 3 years the doctor retired and the new doc. wanted me on biologics.  I didn't want to do that so I changed to another doctor and he was so surprised I was on so much medicine.  He took me off Arava, then methotrexate, and then my numbers were so good I took myself off plaquenil.My side effects with all these meds (because they were started so closed together I didn't know which side effect went with with drug.) were serious hair loss all over my body ( I still have no hair on my legs and armpits), thinning of my skin (I would bleed with the slightest bump, my nails on my fingers got seriously deformed (thankfully that ended with meds stopped), some weight loss, no rashes, lots of diarrhea.  I had to take an ImodiumAD daily. My eyes were affected, but I can't buy new lenses every 6 mons.  And so now after 4 years off meds except Celebrex I need to take something again.  I dread it tremendously and would tolerate the pain as to not loose my hair on my head again. I fear depression.

I do get a bit nauseated sometimes from the medication - but it's easily taken care of with a little food in the stomach or a carbonated drink.

I have felt much better and my face rash totally cleared up. I see the eye doc every 6 months so I'm not too worried. I still have a itchy scalp with hair loss and see a dermo for special shampoos and solution which I believe are helping and some hair is coming back in. I really think that the plaquenil has helped me with the aches and pains, fatigue, and face rash. I haven't experienced any stomach problems but I do get a little dizzy from time to time. All and all I'm sure that I will be on this for life as my Rheumatologist says.

I have symptoms of lupus, sjogrens, and been diagnosed with raynauds. My PCP diagnosed lupus, but my Rheum has not diagnosed anything yet. He put me on Plaquenil 200mg 2x per day. I have had the most severe constipation ever, and I have never been constipated in my life. I also showed an increase in BP, heart rate, and became more short of breath. But in about 2 months I noticed my left eye going blurry...that's when I decided I had enough.

The gas lasts for hours, and gas relief pills do not help.  I wondered if anyone else had this problem.

I was diagnosed in 1989. I take 200mg per day with no side affects. In times of severe stress however I do encounter flare-ups so I increase the dosage for 2 days or so or I take Voltaren until the pain diminishes.  I manage my condition very well.

The swelling hasn't diminished but the pain was really bad everyday now I have some days that are bad but more days that are good.  It hasn't given me any side affects thank God but I also take Gabapanten for my polyarthritis condition.  Hopefully it will get better. The pain sometimes is so bad but before it was worse and more often.  I take 600 mg a day.

Basically an auto immune disease.  Have not had normal liver enzyme levels in 15 years. Did the prednisone thing for about a year, helped but as soon as I stopped taking it, my illness got bad.This medicine is a life saver for me.  Been on it for about 9 months, and my blood test are all normal.  Few side effects, stomach pain and gas, but other then that nothing.  I love my rheumatologist for giving me this drug, he also says this medicine can reduce the possibility of getting diabetes, and also helps lower cholesterol. Statistics for eye damage is around 4%, in all his years practicing medicine, he has never seen the nerve damage in the eyes actually happen.  I will stay on this drug as long as necessary.

Last week I started itching a lot on arms, hands, neck, and back.  Benedryl worked to keep the itch down until today.  I ended up going to emergency because the itching was so bad I couldn't even drive...my sister took me.  They told me to quit the Plaquenil, take the max dose of Benedryl, take an oatmeal bath, and have my Doc give me something else.  Very disapointing.

I have never had a problem until now.  Severe headache, burning eyes, fatique is continous.  My doctor just took me off of it now. Everytime I change a medication I start hurting worse.  So, I hope it takes the horrible pain away and not start the arthritic pain.  Ugh!  All in all this medication has served me well over the years.
Other	peacelovepink, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	11/23/2009 11:44:50 AM	I have fibromyalgia and have recently been diagnosed with Sjogrens Syndrome. I am 56. Rheumatologist feels like I have had Sjogrens for a very long time. I started taking the generic to Plaquenil about 2 months ago. So far I feel like my joint pain is much better. I am allergic to all non-steroidal drugs and asparin. And all NSAIDS. So the plaquenil is a life saver for me. The worst thing about taking it is that if I dont eat something a while before,I have a horrible bout with diarrhea for several hours. Just toast or drinking milk isn't enough. I have to eat a meal. Then its fine. I have no problems with my evening dose at all. I feel like over-all it has helped with the Sjogrens but not with the Fibro. My Mom has polymyalgia rheumatica and was just put on Plaquenil about a month ago. I see some degree of better movement in her also. Good health to all!

After the first day, I had no problem waking up in the morning.  I told the Doctor that I felt like I was on speed.  She told me it was the placebo effect.  After reading other reviews, I think she may be wrong.  Racing heartbeat, vivid dreams and one episode of flashing aura in left eye for about ten minutes.  No other side effects with 200mg.  When the dosage went up, gastrointestinal dysfunction.  Sticking with 200mg.  Haven't needed caffeine since taking.

I thought @ first it was the flu cause alot of people were getting the swine &amp; H1N1 flus around here. So i did not go immediately to the doc, thinking its just the flu. I have never had an allergic reaction to a medication before; so i did not know what to expect. I do not recommed this drug as a first choice to treating lupus! Seek a second opinion before considering this med.

Still have dry eyes and mouth.  Biotene toothpaste and mouth wash have been life savers.  The mouth wash helps me get thru the night plus sipping on a glass of water.  Systane eyedrops and Restasis help.  Not sure about longtime affects but hope it causes nothing else.

I was placed on Plaquenil for one year as my doctor told me this was the shortes amout of time I could be on it to get accurate results. My overall fatigue improved some as did the joint pain. I did, howeve, develop severe stomach and gallbladder issues to the point where I didn't want to eat because the pain and nausia were so bad. After a year on the drug my ANA came down to &quot;borderline&quot;, but I started to develope problems with my eyes and chose to discontinue use of the drug.The small rash on my face has remained the same and the sun reaction welts happen mostly in the spring and fall. It has been four weeks since I quit taking it and the fatigue and &quot;deep aches&quot; in my arms hands legs and feet have returned. I am currently starting a supplement and vitamin therapy which I hope will help and working hard to get enough rest.I also take a prescription strenght anitinflamitory which helps with discomfort.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	9/3/2009 4:12:49 PM	I started taking Plaquenil six months ago when I was diagnosed with lupus. The diagnosis changed to RA a few months later but my new doc kept me on the Plaquenil. It has definitley taken the edge off -  I can roll over in my sleep now without severe pain waking me up and I don't lie down on the floor to cry half way through getting ready for work in the mornings now. I'm a long way from pain free, but the side effects are minimal --  stomache aches once in a while --  and its better than many of the other drugs out there. I also have Sjogren's disease and fibro, so I take oxycodone as needed.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	cafequeen808, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	8/18/2009 3:44:30 PM	My rheumatologist prescribed Plaquenil to treat my RA symptoms telling me that it is relatively mild in comparison to other meds &amp; has fewer side effects, usually rash or other dermatological reactions or GI upset.  I was concerned but her nonchalantness seemed to quiet my reservations &amp; I decided to give it a go.  The possibility of living pain-free was so exciting that I was not willing to accept the fact that I was indeed having an extreme adverse reaction to the medicine.  To the surprise of myself &amp; my doctor I began to experience really bad side effects by the third day of treatment.  It all started with a throbbing, pulsating migraine that left me pretty much unable to function.  Before long the nausea set in &amp; then the dizziness, lightheadedness, &amp; other feelings of disorientation.  I began to feel an overall sense of just not being &quot;right&quot; for lack of a better word.  I experienced extreme mood changes, anxiety, depression, &amp; paranoia.  I had very little energy &amp; felt very tired, weak, lethargic, &amp; listless.  In fact, I remained in bed all day both the second &amp; third days of treatment.  I wish I could somehow better explain just how awful I have been feeling these past few days because I would really like others to know that these types of side effects may not be common but definitely are possible.  By the fourth day I began vommiting &amp; was in intense pain both inside &amp; out.  I was sore &amp; achey from head to toe &amp; really ready to pack it in.  I hope that others have much better luck with the medicine than I have had because these have been some of the worst days of my life.

For about 2 weeks these symptoms have developed and progressively worsened. I do not have rheumatoid arthritis. I have early onset severe inflammatory osteoarthritis.

It HAS lessened the lesions quite a bit, but I have noticed some changes in my vision, although per my eye doc, there are no substantial changes. But I am wondering if anyone has experienced an unusually weak, tired feeling in their legs, especially the thighs. I've noticed this for a few weeks, but it has gotten a lot worse recently. My legs feel heavy and weak when I walk. I just hope this feeling is a symptom of Plaquenil, not something worse. Has anyone had this happen to them? Thanks!

Plauqenil is good if used in conjunction with the prednisone. I don't truly believe it can be used alone. For awhile I thought it was working on its own but when I weaned down off the prednisone I found out otherwise. I am on 20 mgs a day of prednisone, unfortunately it is something we'll have to deal with until a better drug is found to combat all our issues. God Bless

I've had very few problems with it; some intestinal problems &amp; seem to be having head rash-don't know if this is Plaquenil caused, though. I've been relatively pain free since the first initial flare.  I'm able to control most pain with Ibuprofen.  I'm glad it has worked so well for me.
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	45-54 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	3		45-54	6/13/2009 10:49:39 AM	I was doing very well on plaquenil for 9yrs.I now have damage in my retina and can no longer drive. I have what is called a bulls eye macula. This means there is a blind circle around the central vision. It also seems that there been a gradual decline in peripheril vision. I do reccommend the medicine, but PLEASE make sure your eye doctor gives you FIELD FISION tests all the time. Especially if you have taken it for over 7-8yrs as the plaquenil remains in your body for a long time.  It is very hard to tell on visual inspection of the retina that the plaquenil has left deposits. Since it is rare, many eye drs are lax about it. When caught early, no more damage may appear. But if not caught early you can continue to lose vision like me.

Started with Methotexate and Prednisone and decided to opt to not take these meds due to fear of side effects. Dr. put me on Methotrexate about 4 months ago. The first 3 months I was still in considerable pain in my hands, wrists and fingers. My doctor said to give it another 3 months and we will reevaluate. Just in the last couple of weeks my fingers have been almost pain free, wrists alot less sore and feet much better in the morning hours. I had 2 days of absolutely no pain in my hands what so ever. I know this is a build up med and I am praying that the decrease in pain is due to the Plaquenil. I take the med morning and nite.

At first I noticed a difference in the way i felt, but at the time I was on 40mg of prednisone as well, so I think that helped with my pain and swelling. I was weaned off the prednisone a few years back and tried relying on just the Plaquenil, but to no avail I have been on at least 10mg of prednisone for 5 years. The plaquenil has not been that effective for me. I read all these posts and I am jealous of all of you because it is working for you. I have not given up hope though. I am going to give the plaquenil another shot and try to stop taking the prednisone. I think its mental for me, I am scared to death to stop taking prednisone because so far it is the only thing that relieves my pain, other than narcotic pain medicine. I do not want to take narcotics for the rest of my life I am 28 years old, and I have already built up a tollerance to percocet and vicodin. I will update and let you know how my next journey with the plaquenil is going.

I have had SLE lupus for 32yrs. and I love this medicine. I took prednisone for many many yrs. until I developed avascular necrosis,in which I have had both knees grafted which is a very painful process. I do not and will not ever take prednisone again. Plaquenil takes away most of my pain,and so far is less damaging than the steroids. I myself can't imagine my health without plaquenil.

I take 200mg once a day.  After approximately three weeks on it, I realized that I was not in so much pain.  I did stop for about two weeks due to extreme nausea and weight loss, which I attributed to either the Plaquenil or another new med I was taking.  I quit the other drug, and went back on Plaquenil, and have had few problems.  I do find taking the Plaquenil at night eases any tendency to nausea, along with making sure I eat something or drink milk when taking it.  It has been a Godsend, and I just hope that I don't develop any of the possible serious side effects.  I can't imagine being without the Plaquenil, which has allowed me to return to a very active role in caring for my livestock.

This medication has really helped my condition. I do see my eye doctor on a regular basis. I wear glass but they are not necessary. I did have a flare up around November of last year. But it didn't last long. I no longer have aches and pains like I did when I first got sick. Overall this medication has really helped me.

Diff. Dr prescribed about 3 mths after diagnoses, and I had few, if any side affects.  Am waiting to see how I do without.  I do know that my hand pain is a bit worse and swelling is bad.  I have FMS too, along with a lot of other conditions. Current dr (VA) thinks RA blood diagnoses is suspect since it doesn't show up on xrays. Would go back on if need it, which I probably will.

I see wavy lines and blurry/blind spots in both eyes.  I've taken this drug since 2000.  It really helped with the pain I was having and kept all my labs in check.  But, my eye doc recently found the drug in my eyes after I failed a couple of eye tests.  There is nothing that can be done to correct this damage and new glasses won't help.  Vision loss is a rare side-effect but you should think carefully about taking the chance.  My eye doc says in the hundreds of people he has seen for Plaquenil he has had only had one other person get the drug in their eyes.  He is now blind.

I had the pills since late December 2006 - afraid to take, due to the side affects. I took 400mgs of plaquenil and popped lots of Ibuprofen/daily and together it relieved the aches and pain.I also notice I had a patch of hair that stayed shorter than other parts. I kept my hair short and it alway grew back in the same pattern. I believe it was the plaquenil- Dr's advice Bioten, it didn't help much. Anyhow, in 2008 I continued the use 400 mgs plaqenil and no Ibuprofen was need-felt awesome. Late 2008, I have noticed itchy skin even in my vaginal area -Derms say dry skin.  Dr's permission reduce to 200mgs and so far so good and still no Ibuprofen needed. Derm said take zyrtec durning day benadryl at night -works! My skin appears to be sensative, every now and then I get red patches on my face and ear area and I can tell they are there because I feel warm, but then they fade away -strange.  ecbanks60@comcast.net

The plaquanil helps with the constant feeling of fever, aches, etc.  However, is hard on my eyes and require check-ups from an Eye specialist every 6 months.  Yet, It helps me to be able to function as normally as possible with the severe RA and the stenosis in my lower spine.  Am blessed to be able to have this drug.  Yet, as with all meds, it does have some bad side effects.

After being on this drug for approx. two and a half weeks, my skin broke out in a horrible rash.  I also had incredible &quot;brain-fog&quot; and COULD NOT THINK.  It is amazing how things can sneak up on you and take over and you don't notice it.  It was a gift that I was allergic. After being off the drug for a short period of time I was back to normal.  I will pay more attention to my body while taking the next drug... A very good lesson.

Other	christine204, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	1/12/2009 2:51:50 PM	I have been on Plaquenil Oral for approx. 9 weeks. My main reason for taking this Rx was because of the excruciating pain in my left arm that has now spread over to my right arm. I have been through 2 PCP's, 1 Oncologist/Hemotologist, 3 Rheumatologist and ALL I still know is that I have positive ANA's. That's all they can tell me; that is all they know. I was EXTREMELY hesitant to take this Rx because I have NO idea what I am taking it for. I have a high Rheumatoid Factor, Positive ANA's and for the most part I know I have either Lupus, Sjogren's or possibly RA. I took this because the Rhematologist told me that if I did not I was putting myself at a life or death situation?? I had a little girl about 3 years ago and something after that birth triggered my body into a downward spiral. What has happened I really do not know. But, the meds, I feel the same pain in my arms (it literally makes me cry and I have had 3 children with no tears) that I felt prior to taking Plaquenil.

More energy and a general feeling of well-being.  This is a great medication if you have any auto-immune disease as it controls (in some cases) the inflammation that runs rampant through the body.  If you suffer from auto-immune disease, please check with your doc and give this one a chance.

Started plaquenil (200mg's) in 2003 and have been on it ever since.  It has helped me tremendously and I have never had one single side effect.  They were going to give me Methotrexate and I blu my stack since Methotrexate is a chemo drug.  So I just stuck w/the Plaquenil by itself. I guess I'm a lucky one.  If you keep on it - it will eventually help.  You just have to give it time - cuz it does work.

I've taken 100 mg for 4 weeks now and haven't seen any benefit to the medication. I have no appetite and have lost 7 pounds due to pain in my stomach and nausia. The only way I can counter the anxious feeling this med brings on is Xanax, and I don't want to use the drug, but it's the only thing that calms me down.  I've accepted the diagnosis, but the doctor insists that it's not the Plaquenil causing anxiouness or insomnia and rapid heartbeat, it's getting used to the diagnosis.  I've handled brain surgery, and I think I can handle this just fine. If you have similar problems with the drug, get a second opinion, which I'm searching for now.

I am hoping the stomach rumbling and loose bowels subside soon (same problem for a while on methotrexate). My normal hot flashes are somewhat increased, joint pain same.  The worst is the mid afternoon fatigue.  I'm wiped out for the rest of the day.  I know this drug takes some time (2-3 mos.) to really take effect, but I will probably have to go off of this if the symptoms do no subside soon.  History, FYI: I was diagnosed with RA 2 years ago.  I tried methotrexate without much relief for 8-9 months.  A dr. put me on Arava, with the metho &amp; my liver enzymes went sky high.  They are still not back to normal after nearly a year with no meds at all. I am trying milk thistle and staying away from all alcohol for the time being.  Also have Sjoerens &amp; Reynauds.

Recently was put back on it, I at first refused but was told it works better when combined with other drugs so I agreed to try it again.  So now I do a injection of Humira and injection of methotrexate every week and plaquenil every day. I still feel it doesn't do a thing and I feel the same about methotrexate which I've been on since 2001. I've done prednisone and about every NSAID out there at one time or another. I still have too much joint damage and pain to even get started on that subject.  I try to stay positive and take life a day at a time but sometimes get so frustrated because nothing has done much to stop the joint destruction and pain.  Recently started Kadian for pain over Darvocet and that does make a difference in the pain level. Still searching for my wonder drug.

It took about five weeks before I could get out of bed without crying in pain when my feet touched the floor. I have no adverse side effects, and have more energy than I've had in years. I wouldn't dream of missing a dose, because I remember what my feet used to feel like every morning! Other meds are 800mg ibuprofen 3x/day and diclofenac topical gel.

I had neglected to have my eyes checked (needs to be done every 6 months as Plaquenil can affect the cornea) and the Doc would not renew until after testing. Went without for 5 or 6 days and could feel the difference within 3 days.I am also taking Clebrex. The combination seems to be working quite well, though I am considering dropping the Celebrex. No side effects form either drug.

I found that Plaquenil causes nausea no matter when I take it (day or night) and predinisone works but my rheumatologist doesn't want me to stay on it past a flare up.  Plaquenil keeps the flare ups to a minimum but the nausea is bad and my fatigue is still present.

Plaquenil was the first DMARD we tried, and I took it for 8 weeks. Unfortunately, it was ineffective, neither relieving the arthritis nor the fatigue. On the other hand, Plaquenil had the fewest side effects of any DMARD I have tried, with bloating as the only noticible issue.

It helped to relieve pain in my fingers and feet but the side effects that evolved were intolerable.  Extreme nausea and vomiting were the worst but it seems that I expereienced every side effect but the rash. Earlier review mentioned calf pain. Riding in a car and even sitting was excrutiating.  Doctors would not listen.  It is improving daily since discontinuing the med.    
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	5/29/2008 2:31:05 AM	I was diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome about 7 years ago (23), believe that I had had it years before.  I was to the point that I could not get out of bed unless absolutly necessary.  I found great improvement with a combonations of plaquenil and NSAIDs, but not 100%.  If I forgot to take the plaqenil I reverted to a flareup.  NSAIDs didn't seem to matter, still had pain.  I have been able to come of the NSAIDs with use of diets, but haven't been able to come off the plaquenil yet. It's saved my life. I feel better at 30 than I did at 22.  My recommendation to anyone with pain: experiment with your diet.  Wheat triggers swelling and joint pain for me, but I have tested negative for Celiac disease twice.  Tomatoes, gin, beer, and white zinfendel cause flareups as well. I feel much better when I eat a clean diet.  Chicken, veggies, fruit, and rice. It's hard so I allow for cheats but remember that I will feel awful.Also, preservatives make me feel like death.

The generic drug that I originally had was oval, white and was inscribed with &quot;93&quot; and &quot;9774&quot;.  I felt this was very effective. My insurance company changed the brand and the pill is round, white and i inscribed with &quot;373&quot; and has an &quot;M&quot; on the reverse. I felt the first pill was better for me and am wondering if you can tell me the manufacturer.  My insurance company will fill the prescription if I can tell them which company to order it from.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	25-34	3/20/2008 2:20:00 AM	I began taking Plaquenil 2 years ago for Lupus and RA and have been very pleased, I have not had any side effects and as long as I remember to take it, I am able to keep my flares to a minimum. I have a horrible memory when it comes to taking medication of any kind and this does cause a problem with the effectiveness of the drug. IF YOU ARE ON THIS MEDICATION AND YOU MAY POSSIBLY BECOME PREGNANT PLEASE PLAN IT AND DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG WHILE PREGNANT NOR FOR AT LEAST 6 MONTHS PRIOR TO BECOMING PREGNANT. I found out that I was pregnant with my third child in August 2007 and immediately stopped taking Plaquenil. During my 21st week of pregnancy it was discovered that my baby had SEVERAL severe and fatal defects. Now I cannot seem to get any answers. My doctor has now told me that it is POSSIBLE that Plaquenil may have caused this, but unfortunately there have not been any studies on the dangers of plaquenil during pregnancy and there is no way to prove it if it was the Plaquenil. BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY.

I still have general fatigue most of the time.  I have a rash on my hands that is treated with a cream that basically keeps the rash at bay but resurfaces if I stop it even for a few days.  All my tests have finally returned to normal, after 3 years.  At my last doctor appt it was recommended I take DHEA and that may help with my weight gain.  It took a year for me to get off the prednisone, started at 40 mg.  The rash is the most annoying thing for me to deal with, I have to use the cream two times a day.

Looking back at the symptoms I think I had sjogrens for at least 3 years before diagnosed. My ra specialist says takes about 6 months to get full affect of medicine. I can now take walks again, not as tired, climbing stairs is still a chore,eyes are still dry but not as bad and still sensitive to sun and wind. I have experienced very little Side effects and I am very happy about that. My main concern right now is my memory. If its not in front of me I don't remember to take care of it. I forget things that people tell me until its brought up again by someone else. All though my memory is better since started the medicine. My hair is not falling out in clumps now and is looking healthier. MY eyes still make me look tired but not exhausted.    My body overall has been functioning more like it is suppose to. I never realized my body was not functioning like it should of been until I started this medicine. What a difference.

Other		4	4	4			2/22/2008 3:54:52 AM	I just started this medication today so my rating is irrelavent, but I wanted to post to some of the other people. I have Sjorgen's, RA, Lupus, fibromyalgia, and chronic complex migraines. My doctor did warn me about the possibility of developing a rash and if so stop it. I use Restasis for my dry eyes - it's wonderful. I no longer need artifical tears. I use BreathRx to help with the dry mouth along with sugar free mints - works well. If I have bad flares, I do use the steroids. With all the side effects that come along with that, I try to stay away from them like the plague. My doctor has suggested looking into using IV gammaglobulin to help dilute my immune system. I use it for a different reason at this point, but have noticed that the times I get a larger dose I do do better. I send my wishes for better health to everyone, one day at a time.
Other	Kristi, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	2/17/2008 7:07:30 PM	I was being treated with a two week trial dose of Prednisone to see if my Sjogren's symptoms would improve.  I have very little saliva and very dry eyes.  Both the dry mouth and dry eyes seemed to improve with the prednisone trial. Then since my MD saw improvement with the steroid use, he wantedto try giving me Plaquenil.  I was taking it for 11 doses and I developed the most horrible rash that covered my entire body.  It  itches so bad that I thought I was going to lose my mind.  It fells like itching and then the next second it feels  like my body is on fire.  It's been 9 days since my last dose and  I am still  on huge doses of Prednisone and Benadryl to get over this allergic reaction.  Has anyone else experienced this horrible situation?

I have an elevated TSH which could be responsible for the fatigue, aches and pain from my neck to feet. I just don't know if it's helping.

The rheumatologist has called me a plaquenil failure, because it really didn't make any difference in how I feel.  However, she chose to keep me on the plaquenil and add Humira, which works much, much better.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	11/4/2007 8:33:27 PM	I've been on this drug for almost 2 years and I haven't experienced the symptoms I had previously. . . fatique, joint pain, general achy-ness. . . all have subsided since taking the drug.  I still get swelling and the occasional flare, but overall I feel much better while on the medicine.

A few months in I felt incredibly better, I didn't realize how many joints were affected until the pain and stiffness went away. It did bother my stomach a lot and I still can't take it in the morning because of the nausea is causes.

It has helped with my chronic pain, so much so, that I have been able to cut back on my pain meds. It has not impacted the number of flares though, but still has been extremely beneficial to me! I would highly recommend.

I was surprised on how strong and energetic I feel now as compared to last year. I still have swollen ankles and very poor circulation in my legs but at least the flares does not occur elsewhere. With the help of Physical Therapy &amp; this drug I believe my health with continue to improve.
