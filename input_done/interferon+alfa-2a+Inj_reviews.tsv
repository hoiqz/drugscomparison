IT DID CURE ME OF HEPATITIS C . IT DID HOWEVER BRING TO MY ATTENTION THAT I HAD DEPRESSION / MOOD ISSUES AND IT WORSTENED THEM TO THE POINT THAT I SHOULD OF BEEN PLACED ON DISABILITY . I WAS NOT , AND IT MADE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR MYSELF , MY CO WORKERS , AND MOST IMPORTANT MY CHILDREN A NON SAFE, ANGRY , EMOTIONAL , AND CONFUSING DAILY EXPERIENCE ( FOR THE WHOLE YEAR AND TWO YEARS AFTERWARDS ) . I AM GREATFUL THAT I AM CURED , HOWEVER, I REGRET THAT MY CHILDREN HAD TO EXPERIENCE EMOTIONAL ABUSE DURING THAT PROCESS OF TREATMENT.

I haven't been back to the Dr since starting 3 weeks ago.  I know it is MUCH more merciful than it was in 1998 my first time around,  it has been much more tolerable this time so far.

He took the medication for 7 months and has been cancer free for 13 years!  He is now 67 years old and living a normal life and back to work as a police officer.  This medication was truly a miracle drug for him and he sees his doctors every six months for his check ups and the doctors cannot find any cancer.  Thank you for this wonderful medication.

This injection has not cured my conditions at all.
Other	45-54 Male  (Patient) 	4	2	3	Male	45-54	10/8/2007 6:04:57 PM	it is hard to tell if the medication is actually injecting or not, the window still shows fluid in the pen after use. We are not being able to tell if the medicine is going out of the pen except by pulling it out to see if it is dripping, and re-injecting it if it is!
