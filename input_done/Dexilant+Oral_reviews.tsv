This year my insurance company decided I needed to change to dexilant to be less expensive.  After 4 months, I developed chronic diarrhea...daily since May 30!  Six weeks, five doctors, weight loss to 98 pounds, trip to the hospital, and a doctor finally told me to stop the dexilant!  Day 6 being off this horrid drug and my digestion is finally getting back to normal. The medicine was great for controlling acid reflux, but the daily bouts with diarrhea almost did me in!

It is the only drug that helps my reflux. BUT... I recently went to a new physician and she did blood work that showed multiple vitamin deficiencies - B12, Zinc, magnesium.  I am taking supplements for these vitamins because with PPIs I can not absorb these vitamins from food.  I am currently weaning off the Dexilant. I am a little nervous because this has been the only medicine to help with my reflux.

My face and ears were burning and I had to go to the ER.  I was on steroids for three months.  I still have numbness in my face.  The doctor said all of my nerves became inflammed from this drug.  I was also on the verge of vomiting constantly while using this drug.  I had hot and cold flashes and difficulty sleeping.  This is a terrible drug.  Beware.

Dr. switched me to Dexilant, and symptoms have been relieved. However, I have experienced muscle pain in my legs, kind of like restless leg syndrome. Began after about a week-and-a-half on the meds. Feel slight cramping in feet.  I also feel heaviness and muscle weakness in arms. Saw a few posts like this, but am wondering if it is more common. Love the lack of acid, but am slowly going crazy thinking my arms and legs will twitch forever. Am thinking of getting off and see if it gets better.
Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	BeachAngel7, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	6/7/2012 8:51:02 PM	Well after reading the previous posts regarding Dexilant 60 mg, it has saved me a trip to ER.  I've taken it for 7 days and first 2 days worked great (previous Prevacid apparently stopped working). Dr gave me samples. At first I was relieved of heartburn and esophogeal burning/pain. Then I developed chest tightness, heart palpitations, extreme nervousness, terrible headaches, neck pain, feeling like I was coming down with the flu, lump in my throat, sore throat, mid chest pain and muscle twitching, the worst was scalp itching and burning! My daughter was RX'd the same and we were about a day apart in taking them and she started to tell me about the same sclap itching, dizziness, bad headache and the &quot;brain fog/confusion&quot; that she was experiencing.  We both stopped the pill immediately and now 2-3 days later we both are starting to feel better.  I have been on Tagament, Aciphex, Prevacid and OTC meds. I thought for sure we had a great product, NOT SO MUCH. The side affects were horrible. I have Baretts and GERD, hiatal hernia etc, so I need PPI forever.  I don't know if I'm allergic or what, but no more of this for me! Heartburn/Reflux is easier(at least I know how to deal with that) compared to these wicked side affects.  I hope I am better enough to go on vacation in 3 days. Newbie users beware! Pay attention to your body's response. I was so glad I read everyone's comments, it saved me a trip to ER, thanks everone! 
Excessive Production of Stomach Acid	Kelseyant-PPI2, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	6/3/2012 11:32:45 PM	I'm 22 years old, Female. I took Nexium since Highschool. I then switched to Dexilant 2 years ago. I found that If I missed a dose , I would get more stomach acid, then take more Dexilant. Vicious , never ending cycle. Anyways, If I would miss doses for more than 3 days at a time . I would start to get severe cramping, muscle spasm pains right where my ribs join/where the esophagus goes into the stomach. Which ends up leading to me having to vomit to relieve the pain (not just from having acid but the muscle spasms too) Then.. every time the acid fills up, Its even more painful and causes me to vomit again. Needless to say, I end up being hospitalized for this. Its excruciatingly painful. This happens every time I missed a dose for more then 3+ days. It is not just from an increase of acid , its much more than that. Hard pain to explain.Anyways, I decided enough is enough. and I stopped taking Dexilant and started drinking Pure Aloe Vera juice from the Healthfood store (not gel juice from grocery) and used tums and store bought ant-acids to help. 3 weeks later, It got better .. and better. and not , I am acid reflux free but occasional heartburn, less than what I would have gotten using Dexilant.Most ant-acids PPIs are really the cause of the acid if you have been tested and no cause is known, thats your issue. I HIGHLY recommend getting off PPIs , stick through the pain for a month and you'll be free.

It worked on my Hiatal Hernia wonderfully. Then after 4 weeks of taking the drug, I developed RLS-Restless leg syndrome. I stopped taking the drug after 6 weeks. Told my doctor. Its been 6 months now and I still have symptons of RLS (side affect is sleep deprivation)
Other	apalachp40av5, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	55-64	5/6/2012 8:52:01 AM	At first there was relief from the constant burning in my stomach.  After a month I experienced occasional nausea and loss of appetite. I should have stopped the medication at that point. Near the end of my second month on Dexilant DR I began to feel weak, constant nausea, sporadic, excessive sweating even when cool, sleep interruption from bone pain and sweating. The last 2 side effects the day I stopped taking the medication were tremors and the common cold.  I am still experiencing all these side effects but have only been off the med for 2 days.  I hope it does not take long for these symptoms to disappear.  The relief I initially felt is not worth what I've been suffering--and for how much longer? I should have checked the side effects before I began the medication and certainly would have stopped taking the it as soon as the first side effect began. If I could do it over, I would not take the medication. The short relief from burning stomach pain is not worth these side effects and the suffering they are causing.  BTW, I rarely take prescription drugs.
Other	anonymous, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	55-64	4/29/2012 8:47:26 AM	Proton Pump Inhibitors suppress gastric acid which is necessary for metabolism and absorption of nutrients. Promotional literature describes impaired absorption and deficiency of B-12, magnesium, calcium and the serious consequences. Why would the drug not block absorption of other necessary nutrients as well? Perhaps this is why the small print urges stopping the medication as soon as the precipitating condition has resolved. Apart from critical, life changing long term consequences, watch out for dizziness, trouble breathing. Bottom line: cease use a/s/a/p.

I do have to open capsule and swallow the tiny pills as I am not supposed to swallow pills whole. I have tried just about every medication on the market and have had 2 surgeries for GERD/Hiatal Hernia.Unfortunately my insurance company (Blue Shield) will not pay for the second dose each day. I am now trying Omeprazole as a second dose but, it is not working.  I will keep trying to get Blue Shield to pay for Dexilant as it has worked the best for me without any side effects.
Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	65-74 (Patient) 	3	4	1		65-74	4/11/2012 4:10:06 PM	Doctor gave me samples of Dexilant to try, since Nexium gives me headaches. After a few days treatment, although my reflux symptoms were relieved, I developed excessive abdominal gas, cramping and urgent diarrhea. Stopped the Dexilant and the symptoms went away after a few days. Thinking I may have just had an intestinal bug, I restarted the Dexilant and the abdominal symptoms reoccurred, full force, after the 2nd dose. I will not take this drug again!

The biggest however, is that I am CONSTANTLY hungry. I'm talking 30 minutes after a full meal, I'm searching for something to eat. Try to have an apple or banana, but then it's back to the fridge for something else. I have never been a snacker, so I'm sure it's the dexilant. I've taken it for 2 weeks, and I've gained 6.5 pounds. Bummer...it works really well on my reflux.

I developed a rash in my vaginal area, rectal area, throat and mouth. I can tolerate the itching of the lower two areas but the throat and mouth are killer. Both are red raw, cant taste anything, difficulty swallowing, feels like my mouth is on fire and my tongue is raw and swollen. Was told I had strep throat, 10 days of antibiotics and no relief. All this is listed as rare side effects to the Dexilant and No one will listen to me. I have stopped taking this medicine and my relief has not yet been felt!

I've been on Protonix for years.  Now I know never mess with something that works!! This drug worked fine for a month, but I started noticing uncomfortalbe side effects after 4 weeks including EXTREME facial and eye swelling...to the point that I couldn't open my eyes.  Also have noticed about a 5# weight gain.  Also...reflux has gotten worse again after 4 weeks.  I took myself off of this medication this am.  So far still feel bad...but hoping to feel back to normal soon!

Stopped taking it and only then did I realize my pain was caused by this PPI.  After 4 days of being off of it, my pain disappeared.  I tried again a year later to take it and the pain started after taking it 3 days.  This is my 4 day off of it and the pain is now beginning to subside.  It's swapping one problem for another!

I was first put on Prevacid 30mgs but it didn't really help. We then tried Nexium, no help there either. The day I was leaving for Disney she gave me Dexolent. I did experience the gas and diareah for about the first week then they went away. This medication worked for me! I could actually eat and enjoy my vacation. I have now been on it for about 2 weeks and I am feeling 100% better! I still have to be causious about what I eat but it takes time to heal completely. I recommend this to everyone and I suggest you try to power through the side effects. To me they were worth it to feel better.

Been on dexilant for 3 months, tremors are less, but the bloating and gas are terrible. Wondering if it can cause leg muscle cramps too. I'll be asking my Dr. for something else.

I was able to eat normally again, but after 8 weeks I started have what they call as a rare side effect - depression. The depression was severe enough to accompany suicidal thoughts. I quit the dexilant and returned to my normal self, except for the heartburn. Now I am looking for something that won't try to kill me mentally.

Very reduced belching and gas vs. the little purple pill.  But after several months, I was getting chest pains and heart flutters.  My condition has much improved since stopping this medication.  Trying natural alternatives at this point.  Side effects are NOT worth it.

Stomach Ulcer	Dre.Dre, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	11/22/2011 10:55:13 PM	It works well. Although I had ran out before my prescription was approved for use by my insurance company. During the two days without it I used the Prilosec. the pain that I felt in the center of my chest were excrusiating. I'm glad to be back on it. However, I am concerned about the long term effects.  This is a relatively new drug. I came to this site in search of some information about the long term affects. The other PPI's caused fractures of the hip and other extremities.  I don't think thats a fair trade.

Severe muscle spasms around the sphincter and under and around the ribs. Extremely painful, throwing up releaves some pressure but as soon as the acid fills back up I had throwin up again in previous cases where i ended up in the hospital with excruciating pain. This has happened the last 4 times I didnt take this medication for more then 3+ days at a time. Be careful

Excessive Production of Stomach Acid	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	55-64	9/28/2011 9:13:03 AM	Started with Kapedex(Dexilent) over a year ago. Has horrible gas so switched to omeprazole -rash on my back. Went back to Dexilent. I would say in the past 6-9 months I have had hip/knee/pelvic pain, lightheadedness, heart pounding, shortness of breath just walking up one flight of stairs, unable to sit crossed legged/yoga, just an overall  crappy feeling. About 3 months ago I went to refill, asked pharmacist about medication and it was recommended I stop taking it. I am feeling so much better overall. Stomach acid came back but I am now taking 14 days of Prevacid/24 hrs (OTC) and with 3 pills left I feel so much better. Side effects are not worth it.

I did not take the dose today and will not be taking it again. I will try over the counter medications to relieve any heartburn. The medication stops the heatburn but the side effects from long-term use may be life- threatening. Kidney function comes and goes as does pain in the kidney regions. Stomach swelling, gas, and incomplete bowel movements are a part of the disadvantages of long-term use. I am scheduled for a colonoscopy in October. Praying the damages are reversable.

I wish it would help me lose a few pounds, but it hasn't (grin).

Relief of my  Gastritis/Esophogitis but after 6 days on it I developed the most severe headache of my life (I have a 25yr history of migrains) I ended up in the ER.

I have Barrett's Disease in 2 places in my Esophagus, and I had been on Prevacid for 7+yrs, then 7+mo's on Prilosec, then my Dr. gave me some samples of Dexilant, and WOW! I am terminal due to severe Osteoarthritis, and have shrunk over 2 1/2feet, causing my entire torso to crush the inside organs w/in the area from my neck to my pelvic bone, &amp; lower. My Esophagus is now curving, the same way my shattered back has been leaning now for approx. 2-3yrs. Liquids I drink, according to a recent Barium Swallowing Test, go into my esophagus, curve sharply to the left (patient side) then, as it started to go down further still curving sharply, it goes INTO my left lung, leaving some fluid in the lung. I 'may' have 20% lung capacity right now, but that will continue to decrease as my spine continues to curve downward until the largest organs in my torso completely cover, then, finally crushing both of my lungs. Mortality is strange. I will be 50yrs old this October, and would LOVE to see it, and with God's help, and my UN-ENDING FAITH IN HIM, I will live to see 60 &amp; may be 70! As much pain as I'm in, I really don't want to push any further into the mid 60's! ha ha. If you know what I'm talking about, you'll understand EXACTALLY what I mean. TRY THIS MED!!! My Med Part 'D' Insurance denied paying for this at first! I know, I'm like WHAT?!?!? But, my doc's Nurses, LOVE THEM, got it approved ASAP! I've got it now, paid for, so no worries. Whatever it takes, DO IT! This pill truly is a Miracle! Most Sincerely, JKDion

Ive had two scopes and show everything is normal. Ive been on Nexium for the last 4 years. My specialist suggested Dex. Ive been taking it for 4 months now and its slowly not working as effectively as it used to work great. Ive been having extream esophagus spasms and extreme pain and swelling , with no acid. Feels like i swallowed a bunch of whole, sharp things and its stuck in my throat. I threw up, no relief. I then used Maalox and sat up for an hour . seemed to calm it down now. I really want to get off this medication instead of upping the dose. Maybe try a herbal way.

Stomach Ulcer from Aspirin or Ibuprofen-Like Drugs	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/17/2011 11:22:41 AM	I have had ongoing stomach issues since taking too much ibuprofen several years ago. I get stomach pain and nausea if I eat acidic foods or drink coffee or alcohol. I did one course of Dexilant and my symptoms were basically down to nothing. I had some slight nausea some days, but it went away if I ate something. I took the pill at night, usually about 1 hour before bed, in the hopes that it would minimize the nausea I had experienced from other PPI's. I'm doing another course now because I took Aleve once or twice and it brought my issues right back. I like that this drug can be taken anytime, without regard to food.  It's expensive, but I have good insurance so I only paid $20 for each month.
Excessive Production of Stomach Acid	flgardener, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	7/16/2011 1:32:51 PM	Works great but am now concerned wih recent reports of increased risk of bone fractures that PPI drugs like this may cause.  Started taking this about May '10 after taking Nexum for years.  Had to switch due to insurance requiring me to change.  I had an incident of eye swelling that started with sense of pressure in the chest and severe nasal congestion about the time I started taking this.   Ended up in CCU of hospital and with tests for heart problems.  None showed up but they weren't concerned with eye swelling that lasted a week.  Have had a couple smaller reactions since but not as severe.  No one questioned this medicine and this as a side effect.  Still on this medicine though and wondering if I should change or stop for above reasons.  Appears that most PPI's are listed as perhaps causing increased bone fractures, not just this one.

After taking only one, I had such low back pain that I could barely stand it. Initially, I had a burning sensation in the back of my throat.. It was more unpleasant than disabling. Nexium was the best but it put on the pounds. I'm uncertain what's the best course of action for Barretts.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	7/10/2011 2:26:18 PM	I was given Dexilant for AR due to gastroparesis and my body not adjusting to having my gall bladder removed.  It takes care of the stomach pain I was having but I ended up with severe muscle pain every where, chest pains and dizziness. I'm going to go off of it while on vacation and see what happens.

But have had horrible chest pain to the point of even ending up in the emergency room one night. I will stop taking for a few days to see if this is the reason behind my chest pain.

Plus, I have a headache &amp; being a migraineur, I would rather stop taking this drug and wait for my colonoscopy on Friday.
Inflammation of the Esophagus with Erosion	Plainer, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	6/20/2011 11:42:47 AM	Had been taking 10mg of metoclopramid 4-times daily and 20mg of omeprazole twice daily off-and on for 7 months but had little affect in curing GERD symptoms. After reading these reviews about Dexilant (pro and con) decided to take it 4 days ago. Dr. prescribed 30mg once daily for four days and twice daily thereafter. I decided to take the med only when needed rather than daily. Took my first and only dose 4 days ago and it worked immediately. The GERD symptoms disappeared and have not returned.  Keeping my fingers crossed but am very pleased with the results. 
Inflammation of the Esophagus with Erosion	Plainer, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	6/18/2011 9:31:15 PM	Previously, I was taking metoclopramid 10mg 4 times/day and omezoprazole 20mg twice a day together with Pepcid and Alka Seltzer to control my GURD whenever it started to act up again. The constant belching affected my throat as though I had a lump or tumor in my eusophagus partially blocking my food intake. It would subside when I slept but it would return as soon as I got up in the morning when my belching resumed where it left off the night before. My Dr. finally prescribed Dexilant even though I knew it would be expensive but figured if it could cure my GURD it would be worth it. I was prescribed 60 30mg capsuls with instructions to take one capsul for the first 4 days and two thereafter. Two days ago I took my first capsul and within minutes it seemed to have reduced my GURD.  Yesterday, I decided not to take my second capsul to see if Dexilant really cured my GURD as the symptoms seemed to have disappeared.  On my 3rd day, I have not taken another capsuls yet.  This Dexilant really works beyond my expectations. I experienced no ill side-effects in spite of the fact I only took one dose of this medicine. I will continue to monitor the after effects in the weeks ahead to determine how effect this remedy is should my GURD symptoms return.  I know one dose does not tell the whole story, but it is encouraging.

My doctor recently switched me to Dexilant, and it really works great for my symptoms. However, now it is causing diarrhea, and I'm losing weight. I didn't think the medicine was the culprit, but when I read the side effects diarrhea was the first one listed. It bums me out, because the medicine works great, but I'm unwilling to deal with this awful side effect.

The first time I took it, I had chest heaviness and pain that evening.  I was better the next morning.  Not knowing I was allergic to it, I tool it again the next day and had chest heaviness and pain again that evening and also my throat and neck felt a bit swollen.  I felt like I had pneumonia symptoms from the Dexilant.  Haven't taken it since and feel a lot better.  Had doctor switch medicines.

I had terrible stomach cramps, a very bloated and gassy stomach, and terrible itching. I went off this drug, took Zantac instead and am starting to feel some relief. I recommend reading the side effects if you are taking this. It wasn't until I read them that I realized that this drug was making me worse instead of better.

About two weeks ago, I started being dizzy all day with nausea and then stomach felt like it was in spasm, like in a knot.  I finally realized the dizziness started about an hour after taking the Dexilant pill.  I didn't take it so far today, and so far no dizziness.  I'm worried though without it, I will have the terrible indigestion and heartburn again which is unbearable.  The Dexilant worked very well to eliminate that, but I can't stand the unpleasant side effects.

Other	doldale, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	5/4/2011 11:15:19 AM	Today is first day off this med. Daily pain shooting into eye off and on along with itchy eyes which often feel swollen. Most distressing is pain in so many parts of my body, e.g. arms, feet, stabbing in center of back, flanks and especially across the knuckles of my hands which appear very swollen and feel hot.  Also swelling and pain in my knees. Dr. sent me for blood tests for possible Lupus or rheumatoid arthritis and both negative.  On a whim, thought maybe it was the Dexilant so I am self-medicating by stopping it as of today, May 4th.  The pain has been excruciating and it started about 3 weeks ago.  I started this med in January, 2011 after a severe bout of colitis which had me in hospital for 7 days.  From reading other comments it has given me hope that the cause of my problems is this medicine.  I will see my gasatro dr. in 2 weeks and by then I should notice if there are any changes in my condition as a result of stopping Dexilant.  I do not have GERD but do have diverticulosis, esophagitis, IBS and a sliding hiatal hernia.  There seems to be no specific meds for relief for my problem.  One other thing, sometimes it feels like needles are being stuck in my fingers, legs and upper arms.  Hope this wasn't too boring but maybe someone else is suffering these symptoms.

He gave me dexilant, and the first three days were absolutely miserable, no relief at all.  The fourth day was a little better, and the fifth day has been the best by far.  Today would be the fifth day for me.  I had a raging headache and a feeling of lightheaded and dizziness on the first two days.  Those symptoms have gone away.  I do feel full, and I'm not really hungry most of the time.  I feel like it's starting to help but we shall see. My doc thinks I may have a hiatal hurnia, but I won't know until I get the scope in a few weeks.  Hope this helps someone, it's a miserable condition.

The prescription says to take for 8 weeks. The only negitive I have is if you miss a dose in 6-8 hours the  acid is back with a vengince and takes a couple days to get it back under control. As long as I don't mis a dose I can eat/drink what ever I please.

Side effects include headache, feeling full or having the hungry horrors, gassy, bloated, palpitations, stomach pain and tightness in the throat and the joy of either constipation or diarrhea along with worsened heartburn.  I stopped for 2 days and feel better.  Calling my doctor tomorrow.  What a crock.

Gradually over last couple of months I developed hard, jagged, painful stools. Very odd as this side effect is not listed. However, when I stopped taking the drug my stools became softer but my AR returned. Now that I've studied the list of side effects it's alarming. Pancreatis? This drug is too new and unproven for me to use. 
Stomach Ulcer	Anita, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/14/2011 6:22:48 PM	Took Dexilant for about 10 days, ended up in the ER three times within a weeks time.Had severe nausea 24/7. The only time I had any relief from the nausea was when I took a anti-nausea pill that put me to sleep for awhile. Last time in the ER they switched me to Nexium 40mg. Dexilant for me was a horrible drug, something I never want to go thru ever again!

Unfortunately the claim that it works all day has proven false.  I feel great for a few hours after I take it in the morning, but by 3pm the pain and nausea return.  Doc is reluctant to increase the dose due to the recommended max of 60mg/day.  No side effects to report

My doctor put me on Dexilant because the Prilosec OTC wasn't working.  It worked well for the first three weeks.  The other night, I woke up with abdominal pain, profuse sweating, and dizziness, followed by severe diarrhea.  I called the doctor, who said I probably have a stomach virus.  My gut feeling is it is the medicine.  I stopped taking it, and now I feel fine.  I just don't know what I am going to take for the heartburn.

It's the only medication that has put a stop to my vomiting acid. I know it's not technically healing any of the erosion or stopping the growth of polyps but my day-to-day level of discomfort has drastically decreased. If I don't take it pretty much right on schedule I immediately start to 'feel the burn.' No noticeable side effects.

It has now been five days off the medication and I must go to a doctor to STOP the diarrhea, loud gastric noises, and heavy gas. It might have triggered a whole 'nother problem. And on top of that, I received a letter on it from the national hdqrts of the drug store I use, telling of these 'possible' complications! I will never recommend it, or take it again.

Have tried all but Prevacid was the only thing that seemed to help. My health insurance will no longer pay for PPIs and OTC Prevacid can be expensive if you are on 30-60mg /day.  My Dr. recently suggested Dexilant since it would be one pill a day with greater coverage for symptoms. Plus, it has a discount program that you can potentially qualify for.  If so, the script is 25.00/month. I have not had any side effects at all!

My nutrionist says its not good for you to take antacids on a continual basis because it keeps you from absorbing other nutrients, so I am trying other methods to relieve my heartburn.

I am a healthy 33 year old female that does not take any other medication, but have noticed that since taking Dexilant, I have moderate stomach and lower esophagus discomfort and a tightness in my chest throughout the day. I also tend to feel nauseous morning and late afternoon.

Effective, quick and no side affects. Costly, but I use it only sympomatically, which is less and less.
Other	Sherry, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	2/26/2011 9:49:11 PM	I take dexilant for ibs. I have prersistent gut ache, very low, and constipation, and dexilant works great. I am symptom free unless I eat super spicy food. Been on it a year.

After colonoscopy confirmed GERD and hiatal hernia, I told the doctor Nexium seemed not to be effective anymore. He prescribed Dexilant; seemed to work a little better but costs me more. Also, I have experience weight gain and frequent throat clearing/cough. Also had eye problem thought to be a sty but it left a small boil inside left eyelid. Don't think I'll stay with it........
Inflammation of the Esophagus with Erosion	Anxious, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	2/13/2011 9:20:57 AM	After after a few days of taking 60mg Dexilant, I developed internal tremors.  Within a few days after that, you could notice my hands and arms shaking.  This continues nearly 24/7.  Prior to the drug, I did have anxiety, but I did not feel like this.  I just stopped taking it yesterday, and I'm waiting a few days to see if the tremors disappear before starting Prilosec OTC or Zantac.  This tremor feeling has been unnerving.  Also, I have very quick periods of time where I'm lightheaded.
Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	Marcia, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	2/10/2011 8:36:48 AM	Have Reflux for over 10 years and was on Zantac until it stopped working.  Dr. put me on Dexilant 4 mo ago and had total relief after 3 days.  However, started experiencing extreme daily headaches and heart palpitations.  Brain MRI showed normal, so I'm going off Dexilant to see if headaches go away. Might try natural remedies to  help with reflux.

I am 59 and have been on PPI's for 13 years and despite this now have a few small esophageal dyplasias.  All other PPI's I have used.  Some did not provide relief at all - Prilosec, Nexium, Zegrid.  Aciphex, Protonix and Prevacid have all given me a queasy stomach for about 2 hours after taking them.  Dexilant has no side effects for me and I wish I had known about it sooner !!

I've taken it for almost 6 mos. and feel like I'm dying everyday. My stomach hurts more than it did, have bloating, gas, trouble breathing, nightmares, pain all over my body and chest congestion. I stopped taking it last week after looking up the side effects. I will never take this med again!!

My stomach does feel better, but I can't stand the side effects.....

I feel &quot;weird&quot; on this.  Am on 2nd day of taking, none of the symptoms are on the &quot;get off immediately&quot; list, but I will call Dr after weekend, I can't keep this up long term.  Upside, it DOES WORK, and hopefully for those w/o side effects, you are in luck!

Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	patrol, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male		1/9/2011 10:34:20 AM	Because of suspected problems taking Nexium and lots of Motrin the Dr prescribed Dexilant. Within 12 hours of taking the first 60 mg pill I started with diarrhea, it continued through three days and three pills. I actually lost about ten pounds at this time. Stopped taking the pill and took an anti-diarrheal med. Will seek other meds for the GERD and indigestion.
Excessive Production of Stomach Acid	Rickypy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	1/6/2011 6:55:04 PM	I was only on Dexilant for about a week.  Within the first couple of days, I woke up with a numb left arm, but thought that I had slept wrong on it.  My left arm remained tingly all that day and the same thing repeated the next day.  The day after that, in addition to my tingly left arm, my left foot was also tingly and numb.  Then, the next day, my left jaw did the same thing along with my left foot and arm.  I went to the hospital and they checked my heart and gall bladder and all the tests came back good.  I have been off of Dexilant for three days now, and the tingling sensations have left my foot and my jaw.  My left hand continues to feel a little numb, but seems to be getting better. Anyone else have side effects like these?  Do they completely go away? This drug is HORRIBLE and I will NEVER take it again! It took care of my reflux, but the side effects aren't worth it.

It was misdiagnosed for about 2 months.  I started taking Nexium at 40 X1day and Zantac 150 X2day and it did not help a lot.  I was then switched to Nexium at 40 x2day w/the Zantac 150 x2day and it still left me w/acid poblems. After a few months I was switched to Dexilant X1day and Zantac 150 x2day and I have had very few symptoms and almost no acid problems and very little supplementing w/Rolaids, etc. (which I was taking several times a day before)  I don't have the constant acid feeling in my throat and that is great!!  After 2 weeks of this, I'm hoping my insurance company will help pay for this!  Also, chewing gum after eating really does help.

I don't seem to have any of the side effects mentioned by other reviewers. Took Nexium for yrs but still had symptoms of acid reflux occasionally. With Dexilant, I don't. Just hope and pray that it continues to work so well for me.
Stomach Ulcer	Coogieman, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	35-44	12/27/2010 1:51:13 PM	I have been on on Protonix for almost 3 years for GERD.  During that time I experimented with prilosec and prevacid as well as just using H2 blockers (mostly because I don't have insurance and protonix is expensive), but recently my doctor put me on a 10 day Dexilant regimen because I developed a small ulcer as a reaction to an anti-inflammatory.  I'm not sure why he didn't just let me stay on the Protonix (I'm honestly guessing he forgot I was on Protonix), but even though my Ucler is gone, my GERD has come back while on this.  I can't wait to get back on Protononix. 
Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	Sylvia, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	55-64	12/24/2010 12:34:19 AM	Now, after 6 weeks on Dexilant 60 mg, I experience relief from GERD. However, I developed a severe migrane, which has now lasted five days. Today, I saw my physician and she ordered an MRI of my brain due to the excruciating, ongoing pain. The MRI is negative, which is a relief, but the headaches continue unabatedly. The ENT who prescribed the medication does not think the headache is a side effect of Dexilant. I do, because I rarely have headaches, and this one is ongoing. Dexilant is the only cause I can think of. I will discontinue Dexilant and see if the headache disappears. The pain is intolerable. Has anyone had this side effect on Dexilant? Please comment.

Still burp, maybe not as much - no nasty taste though, kinda like aftertaste from Alka Seltzers.  Stomach bloated so much, it's hard to get breath - excessive gas - afraidto go out in public!  Taken 5 days - just now woke up with acid reflux - can't lay down.  I'm stopping this - the side effects are worse than the problem!

Since going to WebMD web site and seeing the side effects of this drug, it will not be a drug of choice for myself.  There are too many choices on the market that do not have such severe side effects that can be taken under a doctors care.  I wish the manufacturers of these drugs would look at them as if they themselves were going to have to take it and then maybe there would be so many bad side effects.  I'm a believer in this medication, it's just not right for me.
Excessive Production of Stomach Acid	Me, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	11/29/2010 12:47:41 AM	I was prescribed Dexelant for heartburn, (or my doctor said I have heartburn).  But it's not working.  I have severe stomach pain, been to the ER twice, doctor 3 times, but denied the GI camera procedure last month. This medication is not working. I have also had bouts of throwing up, with the severe pain, before and after taking dexelant. I have told my doctor after 3 wks on this med, it's not working, and my symptoms are getting worse, he told me to keep taking it. My pharmacist said it should have kicked in by the 4th day of the 1st wk of taking it.  Not sure I have heartburn. But I believe since the dexelant is not working, I need something else, or I have other issues, which are not being looked into by my doctor, probably due to insurance.  I have none of the side effects anyone else is speaking of, it's just not working for me at all.

I was able to eat anything.. and most important swallowing without any difficulties. I don't think I had any major side effects.. maybe some aches, getting sleepy more than usual.Anyway, it has been 8 months for this medicine with great feelings... but now i'm starting to feel it is not working... i started to feel my throat is getting tight and wheezing sounds are coming back :(Please add your comments.. Thank you.

I have noticed loose stools, lots of gas in the upper GI region and I experience nausea about 2 hours after I take it and again in the early evening. These side effects are really uncomfortable. I am going to ask my doctor to switch me to the 30mg capsule and see if that works without all the side effects, if not then it's back to the Nexium and the breakthrough heartburn for me, what a shame!

Started Nexium about 10 years ago &amp; it worked great, but insurance forced me to OTC Prilosec, etc.  Not good alternative for me.  Started Kapidex/Dexilant 1 yr ago and much better than OTC, but not as good as Nexium.  Had occasional reflux problems at night requiring Tums.  Also had bad constipation.  New insurance covered Nexium and restarted 3 weeks ago.  Constipation and night reflux problems gone.  Have not heard of others with constipation tied to Dexilant and there may have been some other cause in my case, but the problem was gone within a few days of discontinuing it.

PS- be careful takin clyndamicyn(antibiotic) or pain killers. or could this reflux be from the fact i have a buldging disk on lower spine at the same height of my stomach? idk... every dr has been vague so i dont know what my problem really is plus i never had an acid reflux test, i feel like something is stuck in throat, had burning in chest only 3 times, had constipation problems till a month ago prilosec changed it 2 softer stool, now theres blood in my poop from 1 dexilant, i wonder whats next... im afraid of the hospital &amp; dr's. why am i having all these weird problems im only 29, sum1 tell me

I have been on Protonix for tens years.  Recently, my doctor switched me to Dexlilant.  I have been on it for 2 months now.  Over the last 3 weeks, I have dizzy spells, light headed spells, mental confusion, and boughts of severe heatburn. I also have a severe sensitivity to loud noises.  My regular doctor thought all this might be stess, so I took a week off.  The symptoms have only gotten worse.  I also feel pressure in my eyes, especially in my right eye.  This is costing me a lot of money with time off from work, and now they are looking at my heart, another EGD (throat probe), and looking for signs of stroke.  But just last night, it struck me that this all has started since I switched meds to Dexilant.  Anyone else have some or all of these symtoms?

I was previously on AciPhex for 10+ years, but my doctor said it appears the AciPhex is no longer working or I had other issues that needed to be diagnosed and dealt with. I don't know if I should keep taking this or call the doctor to go ahead and start the tests. Any suggestions?

It works great at first, but there are things they don't tell you about.  I've been taking this for 8 months and was just as happy as all of you, until the heart issues started.  I'm only 28 and live a moderately healthy lifestyle and everything with my heart comes out normal(ie, blood pressure, blood count, pulse, cholesterol levels) , but my heat beat has been messed up for the last few months.  My doctor told me it was my stomach and not my heart that's the issue and that I needed to take more of the medication.  When I did that, the symptoms got even worse.  Well, I'm now seeing a cardiologist because of how bad my heart got BUT as soon as I stopped taking the Dexilant my heart symptoms disappeared.  This was a week ago that I stopped and I went from having several dozen skipped beats an hour to none at all in a matter of 2 days after being off the Dexilant.  I've changed nothing else in my lifestyle and am positive that the medication was the issue.  As well though, don't sleep on your right side as you can still wake up in the middle of the night choking on stomach acid.  I'm now just going to deal with the pain and try to find something natural to help with the GERD instead of listening to my doctors who've only steered me more and more in the wrong direction.   You won't find these side effects listed on their website OR on this one but if you do a search you can find that a lot of other people are having the same symptoms.

The drug worked well as far as getting rid of the stomach acid but I developed severe diarrea.  Had to stop the taking it but the Nexium has the same side effect after only taking it for about 1 week.

I was on Acidphex but this works better.  I am so pleased with the results -- no more supplementing with TUMS.  As far as weight gain goes -- maybe its because we can actually enjoy eating again!

I haven't had any side effects at all. I'll find out how expensive it is soon since the samples the doctor gave me will run out next week.

I have been using this for a year at 60 MG dose. Perhaps a bit of weight gain but I am more concerned by joint aches and stiffness which I think may be caused by this drug, although I have not seen anyone else with this complaint.

Now Aetna wont pay for it and I was forced to go on OTC or Dexilant.  I have developed a chronic cough.  Gas, achy muscles. Has anyone else had a severe cough with this.  I have been sent to specialists, gastro and allergy.  Now battery of other tests.  I think it is the Dexilant. The insurance companies want to save money and place us on cheap imitations......so I guess until my MD finds out why I am having so many problems.....it will cost the insurance company even more for all these tests.  I am going to stop it for a week and try basic acid reducers over counter.  Help......

He has gotten better relief with less side effects than other meds he has taken for his GERD. In response to reviews about weight gain: if your digestive system is feeling better, possibly you are eating more food. Just a thought. Recently my husband developed profuse sweating followed by chills. He has never had this before. I noticed one other reviewer who mentioned hot flashes. This could be related to the medication.

Protonix worked, and some other proton pump inhibitor medications but they cost a great deal of money. My doctor recently suggested Dexilant to me and gave me some samples. I was shocked that it immediately began working and I only have to take 1 pill a day. Usually, I was taking 6 150mg Zantacs a day to see any results, which is very risky. Dexilant works. Its great.

It's not listed as a side effect, but it's very upsetting not knowing if or when the weight gain will stop.

My doctor has prescribed 60mg 2x a day. I still have reflux but it has been explained to me that there are two types of reflux, acid and non-acid. Apparently,I am now only having non-acid reflux. My voice is very hoarse in the mornings.  Sometimes when I talk I loose by voice all together for 10 minutes.  When I bend over at the waist, I can feel the reflux.
