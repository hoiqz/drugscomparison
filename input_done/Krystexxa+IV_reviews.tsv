The infusions are far from home and consume half a day every two weeks, but the result has been life altering -- definitely worth the effort.  Thank you Savient, for providing this relief from decades of suffering.

After suffering for almost 3 yrs, thanks for my daughters constant pressure and her connections, I am on Krystexxa now. My doctor can not belive how drastically it reduced my uric acid level within 6 weeks.
