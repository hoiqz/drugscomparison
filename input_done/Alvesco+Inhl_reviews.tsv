Asthma	nicatl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/3/2012 11:45:09 AM	i recently was taken off Asmanex and put on Alvesco. I am very happy with this drug. I was having bad thrush with Asmanex but haven't had this problem so far with Alvesco. I had been on Asmanex for over 5yrs but i switched asthma drs. and he said evidently it wasn't working as good cause my PFT's weren't where he would like them to be. I hope everyone that is using Alvesco is having good results and if you are trying to make a decision to switch to this drug,,give it a chance. Also if you have any comments or feedback i would love to hear them.

Took Advair for 5 years and have been on Alvesco for one plus years. It is like a miracle for me.  I used to cough up phlem many times a day and now I no longer cough.  I do haved sinus drainage and need to clear my throat often but my breathing has improved miraculously. Iowa winters do not seem to bother my breathing like it did before.
Asthma	pudgy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	7/10/2011 9:40:32 PM	i have experienced weight gain and fluid retention which my allergist swears this drug doesn't cause this. I have been on Alvesco for 1 year. Tried to go off and switch to Singulair, but didn't work out. However, I can't continue to gain weight and can't get my doctor to believe this is the cause.  I am becoming very depressed b/c of weight gain. Has anyone else experienced this from taking Alvesco?

He switched doctors and the new doctor put him on alvesco and xopenex. His lung function has improved dramatically since taking the Alvesco.

Asthma Prevention	Howdy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	5/28/2010 7:23:56 PM	I was feeling good. Went to see my allergy doctor. I was diagnosed with mild asthma mainly excercised induced and started on Alvesco 2 puffs twice a day. A week later I had pneumonia!So needless to say I have quit taking it.
Asthma	morris, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	4/6/2010 10:45:55 PM	I had a bad reaction to advair and other meds in that group.  I have some relief with alveso and am very grateful for their program to pay my copay for the first 12 months.  I have noticed a decrease in my pain from fibromialgia since taking this.  I suspect it is related
Asthma	janet, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	55-64	9/5/2009 1:26:36 PM	I had bone pain in my legs and hips starting about 3 months into treatment. I am not sure if it was caused by Alvesco, but was a possible side effect in the literature. Notified the manufacturer. They said it could cause extremity pain. I went back on Asmanex.

Asthma	Gertie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	4/27/2009 6:38:57 PM	Unfortunately, despite being very thorough about rinsing after use, I developed Oral Thrush.  Even after not using it for sometime and trying again.  I have had the same problem with other inhalers.  Perhaps after years of use I am intolerant.  I am looking to my Respirologist shortly for an alternative treatment.  When the asthma is seriously affecting me, such as recently, I am put on a high dose of Prednisone for a short period.  I do not like this drug and do not want to have to keep taking it.
Asthma	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/6/2009 8:26:37 PM	I switched from Advair to this medication because I was having horrible thrush issues from the Advair.  Alvesco has so far been just as effective w/o the side effects of thrush.
