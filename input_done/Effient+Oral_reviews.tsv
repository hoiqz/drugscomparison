Blood Clot Prevention Following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention	Joyce, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	9/1/2012 4:53:10 AM	Have had 3 blood clots since 2003. One after heart bypass, one in optic nerve in eye a year ago, and in stent placed in June 2012. So far I have had only one side effect which is that any cuts take a longer time to stop bleeding and healing. Used to take Plavix, but was not working, evidently,  so switched to Effient and hoping to never have another blood clot again.

My stomach burns like it is on fire within 40 minutes after taking it each day.  I am also fatigued and very nauseated.  Some intermittent chest pain has returned. I see my doctor in 2 days to see if I can take something other than the effient.  Also my bp increases within 1 hour of taking the effient and my pulse increases also.  Praying for relief.

I'm doing exercises for my lungs. Since I've had the stent put in and am using the Effient, I can not complete the lenght of time I was doing before using Effient. I'm so tired I can hardly make it in a day. I bruise so bad and still feel the pressure I was having before stent was in. I told the lung doctor about how decreased length of time since I'm on Effient. The cardioloigst seem to just ignore what I am saying. He's not tried to put me on any other medician to even see if it would improve my tirdness and help me in anyway. I'm seriously thinking of changing cardio doctors. When I had a treadmill done he dsaid all was ok. within just under 6 months I was having a stent put in LAD. Someone explain to me why this didn't show up at that time that I had a 90% blockage. I want a different medician that doesn't make me so tired!

My vision is blurred and I feel terrible.  This medication is expensive, but I doubt my doctor will take me off it. Does anyone else have stomach pain.  I also take Celebrex, but am afraid to take it for fear I will have another ulcer.

Have been on Effient 10mg and also take 81mg aspirin. Bruising is only side effect. Also have nightmares but don't know if there is any connection to Effient.  I feel much better since having the stents. My cardio used the radial (wrist) method which is much quicker and painless in comparison to through the groin.  About 8 years ago in Canada, I had an angiogram through the groin and the recovery and discomfort was worse.  Effient costs me $1080 Mexican Pesos ($78 Canadian dollars) so it sounds cheaper here than in the U.S.

I was on 10 mg for 14 months.  After the first 2 months I developed back &amp; joint pain and had a lot of trouble walking, very tired and I was almost not functioning due to the discomfort.  Finally off of this stuff.  Back and joint pain almost gone after 2 months. Still have some trouble with left hip area, but at least I can function somewhat.  This drug was only tested on 25% women and I think this is disgraceful.  Why did FDA okay this?

Everything was fine first few days then started to itch like crazy all over and developed a broad rash on chest and on neck and behind ears...internal med doc said i was having an allergic reaction to my latest med.  So cardiologist prescribed yet another horrible--long an short back to Plavix (which is still a problem with side effects!).  Like lot of people posting about these drugs would like to take just aspirin but docs don't think as effective (although aspirin is usually &quot;on board&quot; also).  Bottom line is if your chemistry doesn't tolerate the drug industry's &quot;wonders&quot;, you are out of luck.

In a 6 month period was hospitalized  twice with severe gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding did not stop until off Effient 3 days or more each time.  Transfusions required both times and after every test imaginable could not find the bleed source. Choice was either colostomy or stay off the Effient. Now on Plavix for a month, so far so good.
