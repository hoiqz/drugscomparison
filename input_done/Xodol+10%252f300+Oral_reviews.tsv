If your in as much pain as myself and the others writing you feel or made to feel like a a#@ when your script. needs to be refilled a day or 2 early. I like what someone else wrote these meds. are made for pain relief and should be avaiable, all it takes is a few people to abuse it and it labels the rest of us who need it as some drug adict, hope everyone gets better soon or relief. god bless.

The Dr. suggested putting me on xodol, and he told me it was similar to a vicodin HP(1000 mg), but it had less tylenol in it. It has been amazing. I have been usiong Xodol for over 6 months and I can wake up take 1 pill and I am pain free for 6-8 hours. No more taking 2-3 of the regular vicodin. Xodol as well has given me energy to do my everyday tasks. I suffer from severe RA in my hips and knees, so if you have hip n knee pain you know that just doing everyday tasks can be painful.
Pain	Doug, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	7/9/2010 10:03:04 PM	I have been taking Xodol 10/300 for about three weeks now and I am pleased with the relief of my back an neck pain.  I was taking Vicodin beforefor about 2 years but my doctor was concerned about the amount of Tylenol intake.  There really is no difference between these and Vicodin other than the amount of Tylenol.   I wonder why there has been no generics made for this one yet??  With this and any opioids, you have to be careful of dependence.  If you take this for more than a week or so you will certainly experience withdraw when ceasing the med.  The withdraw symptoms are a nightmare, so you should only consider this med if you have tried all non-opiate treatments and they have failed to relieve your pain.  If you have to take this regularly I advise to plan to get any refills before your supply runs out.  To reduce dependence you may also consider taking &quot;pill holidays&quot;, or skipping a day here and there.  This will also help keep tolerance in check.  I hope this helps someone. :)
Pain	Enigmatoid, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	45-54	1/30/2010 12:54:23 AM	I switched from Vicodin XS because of the ratio of hydorcodone/tylenol. Elevated liver enzymes indicated minimizing anything that would be taxing to the liver. The 10/300 ratio as opposed to the 7.5/750 ratio of Vicodin XS met with approval from my physician. I have arthritis that acts up intermittently. Most of the time, I simply deal with the pains. But when the pain really flares, I take one Xodol 10/300 and all is well. Once, I went out to dinner after having taken one about 2 hours earlier and had a glass of wine with dinner. I was unusually drowsy after dinner so I wouldn't recommend any alcohol until the Xodol has completely worn off. Obviously, I take it as needed and not consistently. So, my evaluation probably wouldn't apply to someone with chronic pain.

Although it is very helpful in alleviating pain, if anyone is on it for a long period of time, they will without a doubt become addicted and will pay a big price for what the body will go through during withdrawals once you stop taking it.  Also, your body does become tolerant of this med, and after a long period of taking it, it can cease to work as well as it once did.  You may find yourself needing more.  The long term affects of this med are NOT good, but it does help with pain.  Its heaven and hell all in one pill.  Be careful...and dont just stop taking it out of no where.  You may get very sick and stay sick for quite some time.  If you can make it through the withdrawals after stopping this med, try not to start up again.  You will only repeat history.  Just please be careful, anyone and everyone reading this post.

These do have less tylenol in them, but if you take them frequently in excessive amounts you will KILL your liver.  You will get the same high, if not better, from taking oxycontin or roxycontin.  Just remember the amount of synthetic opiate in all narcotic pain killers is stated on the pill bottle.  For example, four 10/300 Norcos or Xodols have the same amount of narcotic as one Oxycontin 40mg.  The difference is Lortabs, Vicodin, Norcos, etc. have 300-700mg of tylenol (which will kill your liver within two years of hardcore use-exponentially faster if you are a drinker).  There is too much tylenol in these pills to use them intravenously so don't bother trying to work them up into your rig.  It will only clog it and piss you off.  They will stave off sickness from opiate withdrawal.  If you want to kick the needle you can wean yourself off with these pills as long as you don't eat like ten a day.  Try eating one in the morning and one in the afternoon.  Then cut back to one a day for a few days.  When you're down to about five pills, just eat one when you start to sweat or when you have to go to school, work, or take care of any responsibilities.  It's way better than going to the methadone clinic, and saves you from shopping for a doctor that will prescribe you Saboxin.  Doctor visits are expensive (and so is Saboxin) if you don't have insurance.  Street value for any 10mg Norco, Lortab, Vicodin, or Xodol is between $4 and $6.  Sure beats $20 for a bag of heroin, or $40 for an Oxy 80mg.

MY ADVICE? NEVER EVER PUT A PAIN PILL IN YOUR MOUTH IT WILL SAY YOU A WORLD OF HURT AND PAIN, ANGER AND SICKNESS.  IF YOU GET CUT OFF YOU WOULD KILL YOUR OWN MOTHER FOR A BOTTLE OF THEM THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO LIVE, GET OFF OF IT YOU CAN DO I KNOW I WISH I COULDLEE

I had a 3 level fusion on the lower 3 discs (starting with the SI disc - if that makes sense).  It's been OK but in the last year my back has gone south and my pain meds are not working well/cutting it.  I wil continue w/drug but not much pain relief

Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	10/3/2007 4:40:03 AM	I WAS PERSCRIBED OPANNA WHICH WHEN I STOPPED USING I WENT THRU WITHDRAWLS.  THIS IS SOMETHING I HAD NEVER EVER HAD BEFORE.  IT IS THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER GONE THRU.  WORES THAN BEING DAYS AWAY FROM DEATH FROM AN INFECTIOUS DESIESE.  I WAS PRESCRIBED XODOL FOR THE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS WHICH WERE COLD SWEATS, VOMMITING,DIARRHEA, HOT FLASHES, CHILLS, WELL YOU GET THE PICTURE. WITHIN THE HOUR IT TAKES TO START TO WORK I COULD TELL IT WAS WORKING.  THE SYMPTOMS WERE GOING AWAY.  I JUST WONDER IF THIS IS JUST THE START OF ANOTHER PROBLEM WHEN I FINISH THE XODOL.  I AM TAKING TWO EVERY EIGHT HOURS FOR THE FIRST DAY AND THEN ONE EACH DAY AFTER THAT.  ONLY TIME WILL TELL IF IT REALLY WORKS.
