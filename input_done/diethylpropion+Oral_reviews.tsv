The great side effect for me is the weight loss. I started this brand on Thursday Here it is Saturday morning lost 5.4 lbs. and I can breath fine in this humid weather. I don't have all the bad side effect because I'm use to caffeine (Cola soda/coffee black). That the problem for most people They're not use to the feeling(like drinking Red Bull). If you eat a good diet and walk around ,you should get The result you want. Then again if this is your last resort for dieting maybe it's you. Just maybe.

Overweight	overweight, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	10/13/2011 1:49:34 PM	I began taking tenuate several years ago under a doctors supervison. I lost 75 lbs the first year.  Once I stopped taking the pills I gained even more weight , developed colitis, high blood pressure, vision problems ,and excessive weight gain .  I stayed off the med for aprox 2 yrs. Frustrated with the 100 lbs I had gained back I began taking tenuate once again.  However this timeI broke out in hives all over my body , my throat was swollen and itchy .  I went to an emergency clinic I was having severe allergic reaction to the tenuate. Currently I am still 100lbs over weight and have several medical conditions all from this diet pill .   I have tried countless efforts to loose the weight but have been unsucessful.  I do not recommend this diet pill to anyone .

Overweight	kamyo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	35-44	9/4/2011 5:07:01 PM	I have been taking this in conjuction with prescription phentermine. So far, not impressed. I have lost only 2 lbs in 4 weeks since starting this (I was taking only then phentermine for 2 weeks before that) Im pretty disappointed. My doc suggested I try it. But so far.... she says to give it some time. I am looking to lose about 20 more lbs. I see that so many people posting on here are so excited about losing unhealthy amounts of weight quickly. It didnt take 2 weeks to get heavy, so if you lose it fast, you will gain it back even faster. I do exercise, but not as much as I would prefer due to my schedule. I will give it another couple of weeks.

I have headaches everyday, feel slightly depressed (which I have never felt in my life) and have not seen any positive results for the past two weeks I have been taking it.  If anything my hunger has increased and my desire for exercise as almost totally went away.  I have heard so many positive things about this medication, but for me it has been a terrible experience!!!     
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	7/7/2011 8:55:35 AM	I am not quite sure how to rate this pill. I have literally taken only one 25mg pill today, and 30-40 min later I became exremely nauseaus for about 45 min. I see so many great reviews, and really do want to try it. I am not sure if the nausea was just a coinsidence, or if it's a side effect. Anyone have any similar reactions?
Overweight	qwerty68, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	6/27/2011 2:52:28 PM	I took this drug for four days, once a day midmorning to late lunch time.  The dizziness and nausea were nonstop and began within a few hours of my taking the pill.  The headaches I experienced were not lessened by any OTC headache pill.  I did not experience any other symptoms beyond nausea, dizziness and headaches -- which were plenty!  I tried taking half a pill on the fifth day....although the syptoms were less severe than the other four days, they were still strong enough to prevent me from going about my day as normal.  I stopped taking the pill after the fifth day.

While this drug stopped my interest in eating, I spent a whole day with heart flutters, out of breath, dizziness when standing up and walking, and other odd sensations. The dull headache throughout did not improve my experience. Off and on my throat would feel tight and if I was wearing a scarf that was tied too tight.

I was started on a low dose(1/2 a 25 mg pill 2 times a day). I can honestly say that I feel great. I can focus on my daily tasks, I am not hungry or anxious. I feel energized. I workout for an hour and feel great!I am having a little trouble falling asleep so I take my last dose at 3pm. I have lost 6 lbs in 4 days.

Perhaps I should eat a small breakfast also. This is the meal I skip usually. It does reduce appetite, making it easier to make wise choices.

I stopped taking it and lost 5 pounds on my own since it shrunk my stomach. I have maintained my weight since but would like to get the last 10 off. I have start the pill again while working out between 30 and 40 minutes a day. After only 2 days back on my stomach is FLAT as a board. Love this pill. No heart trouble. Minor insomnia but that goes away. The first day is the work with the killer migraine, but the end result is worth it. Plus it shrinks your stomach so it is not a lifetime pill. make sure you learn how to eat right and not use it as a free-for-free. work with the pill and this will be the end of your weigh loss woes :)

Overweight	Mom Of 4, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	4/6/2010 12:25:44 AM	I am just starting this medication and have read many of the reviews. I did take phentermine for quite some time and the results were amazing but the heart palpations were terrible. No matter how early I took it, I was still wide awake at night. My doctor said that diethylpropion is more cardio friendly than phentermine. I am starting on the 25 mg tablets 3 times a day so I can judge if they will keep me awake...and also if I experience the heart palpations. I plan on easing myself into this. The phentermine just made me stop eating. I only ate once a day - no exercise. Of course, as soon as I stopped taking them the weight slowly crept back on. I would like to be more careful with these diet pills and make a habit of eating better so when I do stop, I can keep it off. Good luck everyone!!!

When I saw all the posts I was very excited, but so far have not seen much of a change in about 6 weeks.  Dont get your hopes up, cuz it is hard to bounce back if it doesnt work.  I have been working out at least three times a week and monitoring what I eat.  I go back to the Dr in a week I will have to wait and see what she says.  I wish it would have been as easy for me as other people made it out to be.

I've been taking it for a week and still find myself hungry most days.  I have taken phentermine in the past and found it much more effective.  My doctor gave me this drug because I have borderline blood pressure.  
Overweight	WT, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/21/2009 10:49:57 AM	I have been on this medication for almost 3 months and, during my dr visit this morning, I just found out that I've lost 31 pounds!  The first few days were an adjustment period.  I felt a little light-headed and hyper for 3 or 4 days.  After that, I felt fine.  Cravings were curbed as were the late afternoon, early evening munchies.  I took 75 mg once a day.  I had to experiment with the time a little.  If I took it too early in the morning, it didn't work as well for me.  I take it at about 10:30 every morning now.  I&quot;ve very happy that my doctor suggested this medication.

I previously had gastric bypass in 2003 but slowly gained back some of the weight due to over eating and pregnancy.  I find that just in the first week of using this drug that my hunger has curbed signifigantly and my enery has also increased.  I take 25MG 1/2 before each meal 3 times a day.  I have also noticed that I am more thirsty so my water consumption has increased.  No other side effects thus far.  Haven't been on the scale yet to see if there has been weight loss, but am looking forward to it at my next doctor's visit.

I do plan to walk on my treadmill going forward, but what a boost after only 2 weeks!  My doc also has be taking a diuretic and b12 shots since is a a drug that works on the CNS.  I highly suggest the diuretic which reduces the increased blood pressure this pill causes.

No side effects I can complain about, except keeping me up until 2am almost daily. What this drug does is get rid of your munchies. I normally eat less then 1000 calories a day now and I feel great! I have more energy too! It feels like this is how you should have always felt about food but couldn't do by your self. If anything its a motivation tool for me. I can honestly say I would never go back to eating the way I did.

It REALLY does stop a lot of food cravings and, as one other reviewer stated, it makes you forget about food. You can eat what you want, but I noticed that, even when it was something I thought I wanted, I ate very little and pushed it away. With faithful dieting and exercising, this drug would be very effective. I have been off the drug for about 4 months now. The cravings are back, and so is the weight (and then some).

What's crazy, is that I have been giving in to the bad foods when it comes time to eat (which is hardly ever) But I ate Pizza, BBQ ribs, and some Ramen noodles one day -Now that I see what it has done with me not changing my eating habits, only makes me WANT to change my eating habits to reach my goal quicker.

I don't have any bad side effects - I do notice that I talk an awful lot though, i have way more energy this week than last too.  I feel a little dry mouth now and then but nothing a little gum won't fix. I eat oatmeal and toast with peanut butter for breakfast and a lite salad for lunch. I haven't eaten dinner lately because I'm not hungry.  I am very confindent that this is going to work wonders!

In addition, I did easy workouts when I could (which honestly was hardly ever) and added a liquid Vitamin B supplement to my diet twice a day.  Within a matter about 6 months, I had lost about 50 pounds.  I had dropped several pant sizes, down to a 7 or 8 from an eleven or higher.  Shirts went from extra large to large, and then to a medium.  I have kept all of that weight off for over 2 years, as it is now February of 2008.If you are having problems losing a large aount of weight, I strongly advise you to talk with your doctor about this medication.  What I was using was Diethylpropion 75mg extended release.  The only side effects I noticed was light headedness, especially when I was smoking.

Overweight	Michelle, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/17/2009 9:37:36 PM	I've been on it for a three weeks and have gone from 225-217 in about 2-3 weeks which is healthy weight loss. I wasn't looking for it to make the weight go rapidly but to curb the snacking. Remember the quicker the weight goes off the quicker it will come back on when you get off of the pill. While taking the pill, I keep a food journal and keep my calories to 1,000 a day and sometimes under. I also walk everyday. It's about lifestyle changes and not losing weight quickly. Because what goes up must come down. I'm learning how to eat better and to make better choices with food and to get into the habit of exercising everyday. i even give myself cheat days so I'm not depriving myself and then go on a binge and gain the weight right back. Be Smart! I have gotten headaches too but I thought that it was from not eating. So I get a snack and take a tylenol. And I also drink plenty of water. I noticed that the days I didn't drink water that the weight loss came to a standstill.

I don't exercise and I still whatever I want - pizza and donuts.  You only get hungry when your body needs calories and you don't feel the need to gorge.  On a side note - I used to have severe depression and anxiety. I have felt completely normal and calm since I have been taking the medication.  I have not had one panic attack and I don't have crazy mood-swings anymore.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	8/14/2008 12:19:38 AM	I started taking this medication about 6 months ago to lose weight. I have been very successful, losing about 30 pounds so far, without having to do very much excercise (although when you excercise it speeds up the weight loss). After 4 or 5 months I started to plateau and needed to step up my work outs to continue to see results.However, I would caution anyone with an anxiety/mood disorder when considering this medication, such as I have. For the first few weeks I had trouble falling asleep and needed to take a sedative. Once I got used to the medication, I started sleeping well, but at times have become increasingly irritable and moody (particularly when &quot;coming down&quot; from my mid-day dose before taking my early evening dose). I would not say it is necessarily addictive, but I am reluctant to stop taking the pills because they have been so helpful in helping to suppress my appetite. I would urge caution to anyone with mood disorders when beginning this drug and to consult with a doctor first.
Overweight	dyme-p, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/5/2008 8:56:06 PM	this has worked wonders for me. my doctor chose to go with the 25 mg 3 times a day. i started taking the pills 07/11/2008 at 193 lbs and wearing a size 16, i was still carrying weight from my beautiful daughter who is now age 4. and today 08/04/2008, i have lost a lot of weight, i am now back into my size 10 calvin klein jeans that i wore when i was age 25 and i am now age 41. the 3 pills a day before eating work great for me. they reduce the hunger that turns into binging for me. i have lost so much weight and without a lot of exercise, although i do plan to incoroporate exercise into the plan to lose additional weight. my doctor simply told me to eat a very large breakfast, of cereal, eggs, english muffin, orange juice and fruit. then make sure when i do eat later on, the meal always consists of lots and lots of salad and water. so simple, but it works. YEA ME :)

It helped take the nagging hunger pain away and allowed me to eat less.  It did not make me tired, I did notice the slight jitters, but nothing too bad.  I have lost 50 pounds on this plan, but with lots and lots of exercise...I did not lose weight if I didn't exercise.  My doctor put me on a 25mg dose after I lost 30 pounds and I only take 1 pill a day to help me through the mid-day hunger time.  I love it and have only good experiences to report.

I have been using it off and on for months. Lately, I have had trouble sleeping at night (I take it at 9am). I have dry mouth, and have lost my sex drive. But, at least I'm thin! Overall, I would not suggest using it for very long. I did not have these symptoms when I first started the drug.
Overweight	Marian, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/2/2008 1:00:45 PM	I've only been taking this for 1 month (tomorrow) but have had such a good experience I thought I'd share here. My doctor has me taking 1/2 pill in morning and then 1/2 later in day. I did this the first week but cut it down to just 1/2 pill daily. Appetite suppresant has given me hope and allowed me to completely change the foods eaten to healthy now. I've lost about 16 lbs. Obesity runs in my family and I now have hope for the first time in years. The doctor gave me a list of foods to avoid and I've been able to do that. I don't count calories, just eat VERY healthy. No cakes, pies, cookies, soda, ice cream, mashed potatoes, corn, pasta, pizza (you get the idea). I never thought I could go without some of these daily. I now  eat veggies, organic brown rice, omelettes, salad, yogurt, apple juice, bananas, cereal, etc. Back to the doctor tomorrow and feeling good about it.

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/13/2007 5:44:32 PM	I have lost 5 pounds in two weeks and notice an over-all (needed) calmness, not jittery or excitability which has been an added bonus.  This may need to be looked at for other methods of treatment, not just weight loss.
