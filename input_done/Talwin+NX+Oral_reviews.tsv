Pain	Elizabeth, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	4/25/2012 9:53:07 PM	This medication has never worked. I couldn't tell I had taken anything for pain.  I have been on it for a week and a half and I can barely move.  It does nothing for my pain.  I will be calling my doctor tomorrow to change.  I just don't understand why it doesn't work on me.

Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	45-54	10/4/2011 6:11:35 AM	I take the generic form (PENTAZOCINE-NALOXONE TABLET)I have Fibromyalgia that painful little disease that many doctors do not recognize.  I moved to GA around 3 yrs ago. I saw many of those types of doctors.  Luckily my last Pain Management Physician was able to refer me to a Doctor in a nearby town.  I travel 132 miles round trip to him monthly. At the point of seeing him I was in real bad pain.  I discussed with him, of being ready for a narcotic or something stronger .  But I don't want the possibility of becoming addict.  I grew up with an alcoholic parent. At the end of our consultation he prescribed Talwin NX generic.  He said that my history was one that I could be prone to addiction. He also said that I would build up an addiction to this medication because it will be taken for a long period.  A body addition not a mental craving. This medication has helped me I take a steady 1 to 2 every 4 hours.  It is more rare now to take 2.  I know it is masking the pain and it does not mess with my head.  I can get into major pain at times. It passes, I think easier because I have a steady level in my system. Super happy that I am not taking a Hydrocodone type drugs after a couple days I would feel very sick. The worse thing about taken PENTAZOCINE-NALOXONE TABLET is that the taste is horrible. I start gagging if it touches my tongue. I have a certain drinking bottle. I put the pill on my lips then push the bottle water to send the pill straight back to my throat. Bad Bad Bad tasting pill.      
Pain	Nita Justice, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	55-64	9/29/2011 10:13:23 AM	I was on this for 2 weeks.  At first did not associate what was happening.  Was having heavy, heavy sweats that started abt 5-6 days after first taking it.  I thought it was just hot flashes again (age 64).  Then a rash started and has gotten worse and worse.  Also a pain in lower left abdomen (not sure if this is related).  Tongue is swollen. Stopped medication immediately upon making connection.  Evidently it is good for some, but be aware what is going on in your body; if anything different starts happening, be aware it could be this medication.
Pain	sideswiped EDS-er, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	9/14/2011 3:56:10 AM	I had a severe reaction to generic Talwin NX with each of my first two doses and was taken to ER. It probably interacted severely with my other meds, including Prozac, Ambien, and Xanax. Speech became difficult with immobility, numbness, tingling of whole body lasting several hours at a time, then muscle spasms, light sensitivity,agitation, confusion,crying and runny nose, and constipation.  My husband should have called 911 during my initial reaction, but failed to recognize how serious it was.  I could barely move or speak and felt paralyzed. It was very scary. I was conscious, with racing thoughts, but felt like I was under anesthesia and high on something. If you are on several medications, including Xanax, Tramadol, or blood pressure, I don't recommend Talwin NX. The ER doctor gave me a scrip for Tylenol 3 (with codeine).  I still have questions with no answers.  I don't take aspirin because of stomach issues.  I have a rare collagen (connective tissue) disorder, Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, with pain and osteoarthritis.  Caregivers, please call the doctor or 911 right away if you find your loved one unable to move or speak, or any other unusual side effects. By the time I was taken by ambulance, I was probably in withdrawal!

Pain	buff3ttphan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	7/9/2011 1:46:13 AM	only problem was nasuea, but dr prescribed phenegren and that occasional problem went away.Some trouble taking it during day if i had to be active, but i rarely am, and have taken vicodin, percocet,etc if i have to be driving or operating machinery. none of these make me sleepy but the codeine in them seem to make me itch a bit, so i take one half of one of my xanax with those to releive the itching. I do very well on this combo...i also have fibrobyalgia pain in addition to the pain from the auto accident so i am in quite a lot of pain, including migraines and insomnia. I have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, very low vitamin d level, a very small liver elevation which i'm working on by staying away from acetemenophen other than what is in Vicodin. I need something or a combo of things to alternate because the pain comes back if i take the same thing every day, and the insomnia does the same. Is it safe to alternate meds to not only help the way they seem to help me, or take the same thing every day and chance of ending up addicted.
Pain	sunmoo69, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	5/23/2011 1:06:29 PM	I am a 42 yr old female who has been taking pain meds (was on Darvocet :))for about 5yrs.I have tried about 6 different pain meds since Darvocet was pulled from the market.My most recent one is Talwin NX.I also take flexeril and I am on mental health meds like Ativan.All of these have a sedative affect.I took 1 Talwin and 2 Flexerils and had to go lay down.In the past I have taken my pain med with 1 Flexiril and 1 Ativan and have had a very mild sedative affect, but I am very nervous about doing that with this med. Is anyone on any of these meds and are familiar with the effects they have?I stopped taking it because it made me nervous that it might be too strong.My previous med was Ascomp COD 30mg and I could take that safely with the flexiril and ativan with no side effects.I am just wondering also,will the side effects pass the longer I am on the medication? If anyone can help I would really appreciate it.
Pain	2Risky, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	45-54	3/13/2011 5:39:26 AM	This medication is the most effective I've been given for severe &amp; chronic back pain. However, within a short period of time (less than 1 month) taking it as prescribed, it became ineffective and the dose was slightly increased. You don't HAVE to have an addiction history but severe pain that makes you think 1/2 an extra dose will make it work to relieve the pain and you will develop a dependence. I rated ease of use and overall satisfaction the lowest because of the rapid rate of speed this pain medication builds up in the body/becomes ineffective. Other pain medications either don't do that or can be switched back and forth with no danger to prevent dependence. This one can't.I had to stop taking it within 2 &amp; 1/2 months with no substitute, until it was completely out of my system. It's an awful medication to stop when you have severe pain because it DOES work then stops so when you stop the medication (slowly) the pain it was treating feels worse than before using it.I think this drug is terrible for chronic pain patients and should be banned from treatment for chronic pain and only prescribed for very short periods of time, in patients with long term pain until they can remove that the drug builds up in the body and so fast. Use with serious caution if your pain is daily and ongoing even if you have no history of drug addiction. NAIDSwork better on chronic pain.

Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/7/2010 4:13:20 PM	I have chronic pain in my lower back due to arthritis, sciatica and two ruptured discs. Also have knee pain due to deterioration and arthritis. Have tried many other pain relievers but had terrible side effects or they simply didn't work well. My doctor prescribed Talwin NX and it has been a miracle worker. I am able to function normally and work a full time, physically active job. Most of the time I take it every 6 hours and occasionally need it every 4 hours. But I am so pleased with the results. I have many med allergies, especially to codeine based meds. I have no side effects from Talwin.
Pain	mamamarcie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	7/11/2010 9:08:30 AM	Please let me preface that I was prescribed the generic form of this medication. I am in severe pain and have a possible back fracture. I told the orthopedic NP I saw that I am allergic to hydrcodone, but he thought I could take this. Not only did I have itching reaction I get from hydrocdone, but it also incapacitated me to the point that I was doing was sleeping. And after just three doses, I felt hot &amp; cold simultaneously, became really restless and developed severe nausea and vomiting. I'm definitely adding this drug to my list of allergies! 
Pain	JaxChick, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	3/22/2010 12:53:57 AM	I have chronic hip pain from a birth defect. Surgery is not an option at this time. One doctor took me off hydrocodone and put me on Talwin NX. Help was negligible. I had seriously weird dreams and felt sharp pains and aches all over if I went without a dose. I had to take it dead on schedule or I was in trouble. I wish it helped. I ended up going back on the hydrocodone after some time had passed (agonist vs antagonist issues) and it helped me more than the Talwin NX did.  I also had a very hard time finding a pharmacy that stocked this without having to order it and wait a week everytime I needed a refill. This is an older drug, from what my doc told me. He doesn't recommend using it but has tried it from time to time with patients who weren't responding well to traditional meds.
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/10/2010 3:56:12 PM	I don't know if it eased the pain because of the severe hallucinations I had after taking the first dose.  I received the prescription mid-morning and had to be rushed to the hospital emergency room shortly after the first dose..

Pain	anna, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/3/2010 12:03:15 AM	Although this medication has not eliminated all of my back pain, it has taken enough of the edge off to enable me to continue daily activities such as work, mothering my small children and exercising.  I have many severe allergies including codine and sister drugs (ex:hydrocodone), making it difficult to find pain medication for me that works with my autoimmune difficiency as well as my allegies to meds.  I am happy to say that this medication works well for what I am striving to accomplish, as well as it has the benefit of not being so strong that I feel altered.  The only bad part, the awful taste of the meds.. my suggestion, take with a small amt of milk and place the pills on the back of your tongue.  You know you need this med if you are able to swallow these pills every 4-5 hrs in a day..yuck!

Pain	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/26/2009 7:53:43 AM	I've been dependent on opiates (oxycodone, hydrocodone, methadone) for pain management for 9 years (bulging disks/severe muscle spasms/pinched nerve).  During the past year my daily dosage increased 8 to 10 pills a day (10mg percocet or lortab)--these medicines alleviated my pain and allowed me to continue working a seven-day a week schedule...but my thinking was always cloudy and I was crabby and just always felt like I was poisoned...slowly dying.  Even worse that I was always running out and no matter how much pain I was experiencing, some doctor or nurse made me feel worse with snide comments which made me feel like a junkie...hell, even though I WAS in chronic pain and required these meds, I STILL felt like a junkie.  Anyway, I voiced my concerns to my doctor and he prescribed me Talwin NX.  AMAZING!  It totally wipes out my pain...to a point that I fear I will hurt myself in the gym as I can't feel any pain when doing ab exercises (with oxy- and hydro- I could still pinpoint the origin of the pain)...I went from a slight limp to speed walking and jumping in and out of my lifted ford truck.  Side effects are minimal...in fact, I can't really notice anything different except MAYBE a tad bit of increased alertness, a slight 'speed' effect...but my body does not CRAVE the medicine...I do not feel like crap when the effects of the medicine dimimish (in fact, I only feel dulled pain in the usual spots)...I've only been taking Talwin for one week, but I'm so excited about it that I'm sitting here at 530am writing about it...Ironically, before I started typing this (about 15 min ago), I was hurting pretty bad and unable to walk without stabbing debilitating pain in my hip and lower back (my usual morning routine), and my neck, back and hip throbbed as I sat...and now I'm barely feeling any pain...it only takes 15 minutes for one pill to start working and the effects seem to last 3 to 8 hours...I'm 36 yr old and male...and I'm very grateful for this medicine.

I have no side effects but I have only taken 1/2 pill when needed and it helps. I have severe back pain from hip to hip and a split rotor cuff.  My only problem is that many pain management doctors will want to put some dvice in you body for a morphine but refuse to listen to a  patient when they explain that this product talwin nx works better.  I am 71 I still work 8 hr days 5 dys week for a c/s company...doctors need to listen and not just tell you and act like they know you better than you know yourself...did they evedr have severe reactions to codene, darvon, darvaset and the worst of all percodan which really is a horrible horrilbe pain reliver...do doctors ever stop to think that this talwin nx if not abused can help a person work live a normal life...I personaly double it.  thank you for listening...pain management doctors do not listen...

Pain	DeeG, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	45-54	7/21/2009 12:41:52 AM	Talwin has helped some with my pain. Much better than Tramadol. I have fibromyalgia, osteoarithitis, Bursitis in my hip, sciatic nerve damage, and a recent fall causing some nasty bruising from my hip down my thigh to my knee, from my elbow to my wrist, one on my cheek, a knot on my head. Very lucky nothing was not broken, but now I have to use a cane to walk. The Talwin has taken the edge off the pain, but not taken the pain totally away. It is really hard to swallow because it is very bitter, overall it is not so bad. At first it did make me nauseous, but that is getting better now. Maybe the pain will better also! Maybe life will get better! Wouldn't that be wonderful! 
Pain	Andrea, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/12/2009 11:43:00 AM	I have three herniated discs from an accident 4 years ago.  From the ER they gave me a scrip for 60 Hydrocodone, which I quickly went through.  When I saw my family Dr. he refilled the prescription for 60 Hydrocodone with 2 refills.  The next thing I knew I was physically dependent on Hydrocodone.  I told him I felt that I was physically dependent on the Hydrocodone and he switched me to Talwin NX.  Now I see my chiropractor once a week and take Celebrex and Talwin NX.  This works very well to manage the pain.  In the beginning I felt a little &quot;woozy&quot; when taking Talwin, but the side effects were gone after the first two weeks.  I have never felt sleepy on Talwin NX unless I have taken the doses too closely together. I am glad this medication exists.

Pain	lolinarose44, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	35-44	6/6/2009 1:05:35 PM	This was given to me as a prescription at the ER, and they didn't carry there so I had no idea how I would react to it, but initially after taking it, it just didn't do much to help the pain I was in, but I went to sleep only to awaken at o'clock in the morning with my head in enormous pain and my body still hurting from before.  I ended up about an hour later not able to hardly even see if front of me the pain was so excruciating and I starting throwing up, I had to the ambulance to come and get me, it was the worst pain I'd ever experienced like that.  That medicine made me so very sick.  Would definitely not recommend taking it without under a doctor's watch to see your reaction to it, it nothing else.  And as far as pain, I can't say it did that much to help me at all.

Went from 1/day to 2/day pretty quick and 2 seems to do the trick.  Recently decided to stop and am no longer sleepy all the time...can actually stay awake all day. Since being sleepy all the time was effecting my life more than the pain, I'll go back to managing the pain w/ OTC meds

It was controlling my life.My Dr. tried many different meds before discovering Talwin to be the best to help manage my pain.The 1st week I felt a bit nervous and a little shakey but soon the side effects subsided.I'm glad I stayed with Talwin because I believe I found the best relief for myself under some of the most horrible conditions possible and wouldn't change it for anything.God Bless you all and thank you for reading my post.

I found this to be a very effective medication to relieve residual pain and discomfort. I experienced dry mouth and a mild feeling of ichiness in my face. Otherwise I had no other side effects. I felt overall it was a very effective pain medication.
