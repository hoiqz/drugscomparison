I experienced absolutely no adverse side-effects either during or after its' use. It is a shame it was not studied in further detail before being yanked off of the market. If there was a legal way to get this pill again I would not think twice about it. I want it back!!

I lost approx 20 lbs before they took this off the market. I had all the tests and am fine. Taken alone it was a great medication. The FDA should re-evaluate when taken by itself.

I lost the weight I was trying to lose that would not come off with exercising in just one month. Stopped taking redux and was very happy with my weight loss results!

I was on Redux only and was able to lose and maintain weight loss. It was the combination with Fen-Phen that caused the troubles.  This drug should be re-evaluated alone to judge effeciveness and likely of deadly side-effects.

Overweight	 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		3/26/2008 2:23:34 AM	Not only did it curb my appetite but it totally eliminated my alcohol consumption. I kept my weight down about 5 years. I'd like to find it even if I have to go out of the country. To me it's worth the risk.
