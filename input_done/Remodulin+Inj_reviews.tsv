They left that pick line in to long instead of doing it the right way and he ended up getting an infection called sepsis and it killed him. As you can probably tell I am very bitter about this procedure and I think they need to do something about how doctors handle this drug and that everyone needs to be made aware of how dangerous this drug can be.  My dad just turned 70 years old and 1 year before he died he was still climbing tree's for deer hunting so he was a very active man.

Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension	ricashea, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	45-54	6/19/2010 5:33:57 AM	My main complaint about this drug is that I have lots of pain in my feet, legs, and hands. It seems to be getting worse as I increase the dosage. At times it's almost intolerable. I am on gabbypentin an a stong pain med. At times that doesn't even help that much.

It literally has lengthened her life.  When her PAH was diagnosed, we were told that she would likely die within 6-10 months.  She has used it with a central line and infusion pump.  We have used two different pumps with very little trouble at all in the mixing or administration of the drug.

I began in 2007 and have had few side effects--(just a little diarrhea and leg pain.) Once you get used to the process, it is simple to use and even easier once you are stable and can use the smaller pump.  It is wonderful to be able to braathe again!

I am a widow so I have to mix my own medication.  Luckly I have a son who lives 25 miles away who can help me with my dressing change.  The thing I have a problem with is keeping my dressing dry when showering.  I miss swimming too.  I am grateful ths medication is keeping me alive so I should not complain about anything.!  Thank you to all reseachers who invented this wonder drug. !!
