She entered the facility fully ambulatory, continent, and able to eat well.  Two weeks later, in diapers, unable to walk or feed herself, and  9 pounds lighter. Also shakes constantly. Staff just said she had a bad reaction. Truth: given a drug not approved for elderly dementia, and they overdosed her.  Waiting to see if she will recover. So sad this is STILL being done, even in well-respected,  church-run facilities.
Other		1	5	1			5/15/2012 3:04:25 PM	was given haldol/benadryl in ER for serious side effect from another med. I was shaking uncontrollaby and they couldn't get an EKG reading so they gave me this med to control my shakes. Absolutely HATED the way it made me feel-anxious, seeing things, couldn't think straight. Then for 2 days afterwards I was a zombie because it apparently takes a couple days to get out of your system. I'm sure Haldol works well for some people but I never want it again!!

I noticed immediately that it totally wiped out my personality, I felt numb and emotionless. I couldn't eat anything and if I did I would get intense nausea or end up vomiting. I was dizzy and sluggish all the time and felt like I could barely move and the simplest tasks were difficult, all I could think about was lying down. I don't know why doctors prescribe this drug, it seems to do more damage than good. I took it for a little less than a month and have since discontinued it. I feel much better now.

Listen to the patients. There are much better alternatives.Horrible experience for me, I lost muscle control on one side, couldn't walk, couldn't pee, felt agitated but could hardly move or function, also caused drooling and uninteligable slurred speech.Haldol (haloperidol) for Dementia: Haloperidol is not for use in psychotic conditions related to dementia. Haloperidol may cause heart failure, sudden death, or pneumonia in older adults with dementia-related conditions.Haldol for end stage cancer: My father did not look at all peaceful on this drug and his mouth was sandpaper dry.

He was put on Benedryl and told that he had the most extreme side effects possible. Very scary to him and us.

Brief Episode of Schizophrenia with Rapid Onset	ACT, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	3	1	Female		2/22/2011 4:59:27 PM	This drug nearly killed my grandmother.  She had a brief psychotic episode after being hospitalized, and the ER psychiatric nurse prescribed Haldol (and instructed the assisted living facility to where my grandmother was discharged to continue the dose).  My grandmother completely lost touch with reality, experienced extreme audio and visual hallucinations, and had bruises all over her body from constantly falling.  She was completely disoriented to time and place and stopped eating. After six weeks of alarming physical and mental deterioration, I took her to a private psychiatrist for a second opinion, and he quickly began weaning her off of Haldol and onto Seroquel.  Over time, she returned to her normal self (except she still grinds her jaw, which she never did before being prescribed Haldol), was able to walk without falling, and resumed sleeping and eating normally.This drug should NOT be prescribed to the elderly!!!!!  This was a terrible experience, and she describes it as a  &quot;twilight zone&quot; nightmare. I'm just glad to have her back.
Other	bwarnerjr, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	2/14/2011 8:51:36 AM	The only things that concern me are weight gain and increased glucose levels. I ate some junk food last night and my glucose level was much higher than normal, I wasn't told that this was a possible side affect. Plus I don't know if it causes weight gain or not, I told my psychatrist that I won't take anything for my BiPolar Disorder if it cause weight gain. So I'm hoping that this doesn't increase my weight, I do exercise daily 6 days a week for about 45 minutes..Has anyone noticed anything with their weight while on this along with anyone noticing glucose readings being higher?

Recently she has started having extreme 'hyper' episodes that will sometimes go all day and all night.  She gets very agitated and it is impossible to calm her down.  The Hospice nurse recommended Haldol (we've tried many other things) and it seems to be working well at just making her more peaceful and now she isn't keeping the whole house up at night. She has only been on it for a week and I am watching for side effects.  So far, so good.

I was just informed today that she has been extremely lethargic and was picking at her clothes and was extremely disoriented. I have done some research on this drug and other psychotropic drugs, and I have mixed reviews about Haldol. I would suggest anyone that is prescribed this to do some research before you accept that your physician is giving you a medication that will be effective.
Other	1, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	7/7/2010 12:26:39 PM	this drug made me go insane, literally, for a week. i was 17 when given it and never informed of the serious side effects. i had uncontrollable drooling, i was unable to speak because i couldnt get my jaw and tongue to work, for 3 days i did not sleep because i thought someone was coming out of my mirror trying to kill me and my mother, i could not control my body movements, i kept jerking and shaking violently, i sweated heavily all the time, i could not even shower by myself because i just couldn't make my body function and control my movements. i now tell doctors i am allergic to this drug just to ensure i will never be given it again. finally 7 days after i had been injected with this drug the side effects started to subside and eventually went away, i had to teach myself to speak all over again and i still stutter to this day because of that medication, it has been 5 years since i was given it.
Other	momofboys, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	7/4/2010 10:26:49 PM	My mother had open heart surgery and was on a vent for 10 days they could not wean her off because she was anxious and her heart rate was going through the roof when it was time to take the vent out.  They gave her Haldol to calm her, and it worked wonders! She was more relaxed and cooperative to be able for them to take her off the vent.  If she was on it one more day they would have had to to a trech and she would have to worry about infection (not good for open heart patients!).  So for severe anxiety it seems that this is a good option.  I belive it saved moms life.

I felt so weird and restless that night couldnt sleep, walked around school feeling drunk and disorderly, later that next day, i went out to eat with my mother, and ended up stealing her car to drive to the hospital, she called the cops on me, but then they realized i was having an alergic reaction to it, it made my neck bend down to where it stayed stuck to my shoulder, i couldnt breathe, and if i didnt make it to the hospital i probably would have died. they gave me benadryl to stop the allergic reaction. this was the worst medicine EVER that i have taken...

I have had a headache for 4 days, shortness of breath, massive anxiety, severe vertigo and dizziness, being irritable, and memory trouble.

He was put in prison for giving a bank teller a note asking for 20.00.  He spent the last year and a half in solitary confinment for throwing a fork.  They killed him on Haldol....it was probably injected.

They gave it to my 90 year old stepfather. He was very frail to begin with. They do this to keep the patients &quot;Quiet&quot; so they dont have to tend to them. I am telling you the Gospel truth. Do NOT let them give this drug to your elderly friends and relatives. it is a killer to the elderly, especially ones who suffer from any dementia.  They stop eating, get tremors, cant walk anymore, and withing months or sooner end up dieing from it. it weakens them horribly. It should be banned from being given to the elderly. The nursing homes and hospitals call it&quot;Vitamen-H&quot;. It solves the problem of under staffing. It keeps patients quiet, undemanding, drooling and  zombie like. It is a scandal. I hope this drug, and the nursing homes and doctors get exposed for this horrible injustice to our elderly citizens. It makes me sick. We suffered a terrible family loss unnecessarily because of Haldol.  I hope to God that a law suit is brought against this company.  It absolutely should be contra indicated for the frail and elderly. .Stay far away from Haldol. It is a killer.

Delirium	Good4Nothing, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		11/28/2009 1:11:27 PM	My previously fully independant elderly mother with no previous signs of dementia was given this medication by IV after surgery because she didn't know the date but was otherwise not confused. The notes by the physician actually say - &quot;she was oriented to time and place but did not know the date, I recommend Haldol.&quot; The whole night she screamed in pain from the tremors this medication caused her. By the next morning she did not know anyone and was staring at the ceiling fidgeting with her hands touching imaginary objects. She has not been able to learn to walk again and cannot have a normal conversation or focus on the moment. She doesn't remember the past either. This is not normal dementia. Her diagnosis is still delirium caused by medication toxicity. The CT of her brain before this treatment and after shows extreme brain atrophy (more dramatic than her neurologist has ever seen occurring in that short of a time period). This person was driving and living fully independently prior to this. After surgery that morning she was also doing fine and was able to walk quite a ways down the hall and do other exercises. She fell asleep in the afternoon and upon awakening was slightly confused and that's when this Haldol nightmare began, which turned her and her family's lives upside down. If I can do nothing else - please do not allow anyone to give someone you care about this medication, especially by IV, under any circumstances. In trying to find care for her I have seen others similarly affected. The situation is heartbreaking.

He is confused, argumentative and makes up stories. He will recognize you one time but introduce you to others as some one else. He was not like this before surgery. The Dr.s say it is a reaction to him not drinking his usual amount of wine. They strapped him down and even put him in the hallway to watch over him. I don't know if the surgery caused the dementia or the Haldol.

So while waiting for his never to come phone call I read the comment refering to Dystonia and researched it. That seemed to be a match. so i took her to our PCP. who called back immed. and he looked at my wife and said she is dystonic.no doubt. the increase was the problem. So he called the Psych. and when he called my Primary Care Physician he said stop the haldol. He must have been pissed because i over herd my PCP say &quot;I'm not truying to step on your feet&quot; so thank you for posting your comments you made the difference in my acting immed. oh by the way her Psych. still has not called back and we are seeing him in four days so.... any one post your experience and let someone know they are NOT unique nor is their concerns. sincerely..

Schizophrenia		2	3	1			7/30/2009 1:48:14 PM	I was recently prescribed this drug to help me connect with reality. If this is what reality is I want no part in it. While I am more in touch with my surroundings, it's usually people freaking out because my muscles are twisting or I can't move my arms. As far the person who gives it to patients: Just because they aren't telling you they don't like it, doesn't mean they feel better. Sometimes I can't even respond to a simple greeting. I wouldn't give this medicine to my worst enemy.

I was supposed to take only 1mg a day, and I took 4mg. My legs began to tighten up and my head would turn to the side on its own. This lasted for about 3 hours, than finally I was diagnosed right in the ER and they gave me 2 shots - one of Cogenten and one of Benadryl. It took it away after I woke up. DO NOT ABUSE THIS PILL!

It's the best thing Iv'e ever used for those who need it. They can rest very peacefully and let go of their life in peace.
Tourette's	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	4/8/2009 3:21:34 AM	Just started it for Tourette's and Chronic Insomnia. I'm not happy about it. But have had Tourette's of course all my life and Insomnia the past 8 years. Have only tried it for a few days. But wow the ticks have been very few and that's fast for only a few days. The sleep isn't the best. I still have energy. But am tired at the same time. Then again, I have only just begun. I will try to leave another reveiw after I have been on a while. But I don't want to use this drug for more than a year for fear of the long term side effects. Oh yes and I have also had no apetite at all since I started this drug.
Tourette's	Beloeil, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/2/2009 4:57:03 PM	I was finally diagnosed with Tourette's about 5 years ago (after 40 years of wondering what was wrong with me).  I take 1 mg haldol in the am and same in the pm.  It has changed my life.  Although I do battle fatigue, the tics are very much under control (not gone, but under control).  I have no other side effects other than fatigue.  The damage being done to my shoulder by a persistent tic (7 shoulder surgeries and no one figured out why) has been completely stopped and I have no shoulder pain any more.  I can't imagine going back to life without this drug.

Mental Disorder with Loss of Normal Personality &amp;amp; Reality	bipolarsucks, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	2/5/2009 11:53:46 AM	 Here's the worst and best of this drug as I have had both.I have to agree with the 1st reviewer. This can cause facial disconesia. Sorry if my spelling isn't right on that one. The gist of it is your face starts to lock up and twist. GO ASAP to hospital have someone go or write out that its an allergic reaction to haldol. You will be unable to speak no doubt within 45 minutes. Scary yes! Benadril liquid or caps may be taken ASAP if you have them at home. This does help.As for the good part. I was on a manic high for over several months before I hit the wall and realized in the hospital I was Bipolar. Hey cause lets admit it mania can be very very fun but .. dangerous! Here is where haldol kicks in. If you are having a manic episode or you feel one on the way. Your Dr. may have you take this drug to knock you out long enough for your brain to bounce back to normal. Before you get a chance to hurt yourself or someone else being manic. Also used in hospitals as an injection to quickly calm a manic person.So is it a good drug? Yes, and I'm sure it's saved my life more than a dozen times. However, the last time I took haldol I had the facial thing, not cool at all. If I need this kind of fast muscle and brain calming due to mania I now take benadril with it.

When I get manic I know it is time to take this med and I return to even mood within 24hrs.  I recommend it for certain patients with certain types of bipolar disorder.

Chronic Type of Schizophrenia	Anymouse, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	35-44	1/7/2008 1:29:52 AM	I do not consider turning a schizosffective but functional patient into a drooling quivering mass sitting in a corner of a Navy psych ward to be &quot;treatment.&quot;  My doc took me off it, and when I asked him what I should do with the extra he said - &quot;Give it to my wife&quot; - as she had been harassing the Naval Hospital as to the condition it left me in.  It was also instrumental in destroying my military career.  This stuff is &quot;not candy&quot; - beware.
