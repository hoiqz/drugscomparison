This is an update as to the commenhts I made about Amlodipine on 4/19/12 under the name &quot;The Truth&quot;. I had, on 4/19/12, complained that the amlodipine, which I'd taken for at least 2 yrs, wasn't working. I complained that my BP hadn't marginally improved, and that the medication caused bloating. Well, my Dr, at my request, put me back on Metoprolol (50mgs)beginning on 6/7/12. To date, I've lost 17 lbs, the bloating has disappeared, and, most important of all, my BP has has lowered significantly. I feel SO MUCH BETTER! Best of luck to all of you for continued good health!  
High Blood Pressure	jean, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	55-64	8/30/2012 3:47:30 PM	At a lower dosage it seemed to help lower my blood pressure some, but not enough. So my dr. increased dosage to 10mg-after 5 days, my ankles swelled a lot and my knee (I had surgery on it 3 months ago) started hurting again! I went back to lower dosage &amp; am without issues, but will have to try something else for the hypertension
High Blood Pressure	looking for a natural cure, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	8/28/2012 10:12:45 PM	I am taking 10mg of Almodopine daily. Started taking regularly for past 3 weeks.  Experienced severe swelling of ankles, feet and recently hands.  I noticed joint pain in finger, feet and ankles.  Also suffered neck and upper arm pain daily.  The last straw is a an itchy rash all over my arms, feet, hands, torso and upper thighs.  Perceived the rash to be an allergic reaction. Didnt seem to think it is meds since I told her that I had been taking acai berry concentrate in my water daily.  After reading this post, I know it is the meds--because I was taking acai berry before medication with no problems.  Anyway, I will refrain from both.  I have tried two other medications--experienced uncomfortable side effects.  Oh yeah, also have weight gain and stomach bloating.  I hope to find a natural alternative.  I do walk daily and used to run also.  High blood pressure diagnosed shortly after my father's death.  seem to have increased when I am stressed.

I stopped taking this and my feet and ankles are getting back to normal! Will discuss with the Dr. Monday when I see him!

On this, lisinopril and a diuretic. Have still been trying to get the dosages correct, but this medication in particular I get really dizzy when we try to increase the dosage. No swelling has occured, but that may be because of the help from the diuretic.

I've been taking it for approx 2 yrs now. I'm subject to daily bloating (my stomach makes me, a male, seem very pregnant), my thighs and ankles swell.  Plus, my BP hasn't improved even marginally. I'm going to ask my Dr to put me back on metoprolol.  When I took metoprolol, the side effects were minimal at best. It's not fun walking around all the time looking like a bloated idiot

Noticed my left leg swelling too. I dropped myself down to 2.5mg and wasn't as weak but, still had panic attacks, swelling in my leg and headaches. My doctor does not believe me about the symptoms and told me to keep on it. I have chosen to take myself off it and try something natural (Green Coffee Bean Extract).

I take it with 100 mg of Metoprolol(been on Metoprolol for 2 years). Amlodipine helps my bottom BP, but on day 3 I noticed my fingers, neck, face and ankles were swollen. Fingers are so bad that I could barely get my rings off. Keeping rings off until the meds get out of my system. The swelling in my face and neck is slight--but odd and uncomfortable. I haven't tried any other new meds--figure this can only be associated with the Amlodipine.

High Blood Pressure	OasisArtist, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	1/11/2012 2:26:06 PM	Started 1 month ago on 10mg Amlodipine, 10 mg Lisinopril, and 25mg hydrochlorothiazide daily for scary high BP. My pressure came down quickly BUT the side effects have been troublesome. Fatigue (especially in the afternoon), weakness, dizziness, hair loss (about 3 times the normal amount of hair in my shower-yikes!), loss of appetite, weirdly cold fingers at times, slight ankle swelling, and low blood pressure. I almost blacked out while driving when I took a deep breath and held it to get rid of a bout of hiccups! I have recently scaled back on my dosages to 5mg of each BP medication daily and my blood pressure so far has been fine with the lower doses. My side effects are much less with the lower doses and I am feeling almost normal. I am taking 1200mg garlic daily since I have read it can help lower blood pressure. I am wearing compression stockings during the day to help keep ankle swelling down. I have lost almost 10 lbs since beginning treatment for my BP, I suspect because the meds have killed my appetite. My goal is through weight and diet management to be able to get off the medications completely. I'm still about 20 lbs too heavy so I'm working to lose the extra lbs. Hopefully that will normalize my BP and allow me to be medication free. Wish me luck!

At first they were not too bad, but lately have been quite debilitating.  I finally decided maybe it was the amlodipine,  remembering back to the timing of when I began taking it and when the headaches started. So, I was anxious to look at this site and read others experiences with this drug. I want to thank everyone for sharing.  It is so helpful to know I am not the only one having these awful headaches. I am also having some bladder problems  which I had not associated with this medicine before reading the reviews.  I will stop this medicine tomorrow, maybe I can get my life back.

Itching and redness of the skin, frequent urination and some swelling of the ankles. It was helping my blood pressure but the side effects are so bad until I will have to go off of it. This should be listed as one of the major side effects for this drug.
High Blood Pressure	Anthony, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Male	45-54	8/16/2011 7:26:23 AM	Been on this med for 4 months; constant urinating through am hours. (Prostate checked, good) abdominal swelling and intestinal pain developed after 3.5 months. Doctor claims this med doesn't have abdominal pain and swelling side effects? I'm taken myself off this med (I also take lisinopril,which 20mg per day for 3 years no major side affects) to see if my body swells go down. Also to see if my intestinal cramps (which at times were servere) subside and or go away? The most important aspect of meds in general is that#1 only you know your body and how you feel. I'll be monotoring my blood pressure and will go back to 40 mg lisinopril per day. Has anyone had these side affects from this med?

Then, a couple of weeks ago, having developed an upper respiratore infection, the blood pressure was up, and the dr. prescribed another does per day of this which made it 5 mgs. in the morning and 5 mgs. at night.  My legs got much worse, ankles were swollen, behind knee was swollen, eyes were puffy, and bad headaches.  Went to my doctor and we have decided not to take this medicine and will check back with him in one month.  I feel this is a very dangerous drug for some people, we cannot all take the same drugs.

She took me off lisinipril because of cough, back pain and added tekturna. No symptoms but blood pressure didn't go down enough. Seemed to get nose bleeding once tekturna added, but dr. doesn't think bleeding is associated with medicine. Then she added Losartan and I am still experiencing nose bleeding.  Anyone else experience this?

I got severe headaches which I thought was a sinus infection and I was very weak.  I took antibotic's and when that didn't help.  I went to an ENT. Had a CAT scan done sinus were fine, but I still had headaches and extreme fatigue.  I looked up this medication on google and there were all the side effects.  I stopped taking it immediately.  Back to my old peppy self and no more headaches.  I will never take this drug again.  If it work's for you take it, but if you have one side effect, call your doctor and asking your doctor to change medications.  It doesn't get better it gets worst.

The only side effects are slight swelling and flushing to feet.  I take a diuretic to counteract the swelling.  Now I notice my gums are swelling.  I believe the circular that came with the medication stated a side effect is gum overgrowth that should be reported to a dentist.  I am planning to see my dentist soon, and will ask my doctor if it is time to change this medication to another one.

Dosages were at the lowest level.   After Amlodipine was added, the side effects included a boiling soup sound and sensation in my stomach, alternating constipation and diarrhea, tarry stools, stinging, burning and pain going to the bathroom, weird sensation in mouth in morning, hot flashes and sweats, flushing, irregular heartbeat, etc. After enduring the side effects for too long,  a cardiologist eliminated the Amlodipine. The side effects were gone within days, except for the stinging and burning going to the bathroom.  Six months after the Amlodipine was stopped,  an endoscopy showed a healing ulcer in my stomach.  The periodontist  may need to surgically fix the receding gums.   A  colonoscopy was clean.  As of this date, the burning sensation, abdominal pain and the tarry stools, have not occurred since the colonoscopy.

The first thing that happened was swelling of my ankles. My doctor told me not to worry, its a side effect. After being in this drug for 6 mos. I never felt good and sometimes had palpitations after taking it. I weaned myself off of it and refuse to take it. Wish doctors understood how hard it is dealing with side effects. Oh, and I developed a horrible rash just on my lower legs and even though I no longer take this drug, the rash never went away.

Even with the other two rx I am on, Diovan and Lasix, my BP is still high; but within two days I was itching. Now after two months I can hardly function because I am too busy clawing at my skin until it bleeds. Even benedril doesn't work. I am done with this stuff.

I appear to have experienced a lot of the same side effects as reported by other users. Sexual dysfuntion, leg/ankle swelling, urinating multiple times during the night, dry mouth, reduced energy levels. Not really satisfied, been taking this medicine for a long time, and am going to speak with MD about the alternatives.

I would have to stop and rest 2-3 times to go to the road to get my paper and mail. I am extremely dizzy and can't bend over to put the clothes in the dryer. When I cough I get dizzy and almost fall over. I've also gained at least 25 pounds since I started taking this pill and I bruise extremely easily. My arms hurt so badly I asked my husband to massage them and now I look like I've been beaten! The FDA must re-evaluate this medication because of the excessive amount of side effects. I'd rather have the high blood pressure than the terrible side-effects of this pill.

High Blood Pressure	bikerdude505, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	55-64	8/3/2010 9:10:50 AM	Started taking this for high BP. Was switched from Lisonapril/hydrochlorizide due to side affects. This one was worse I have been on it for 5 days, 3 MINI- migranes tired, weak, flushed face, No libido, Erictile dysfunction and general lousy feeling, hip pain. A freind is also on this and he is just tired all the time. Be aware of side affects that you do not dismiss them as old age or the flu.
High Blood Pressure	65-74 Female  (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	65-74	7/31/2010 10:46:07 PM	I was taking 5 mg. daily and this dosage was not controlling my blood pressure and the dose was increased to 10 mg daily. After 2 months suddenly my ankles and feet began to swell to the point that I was in pain. The medication was discontinued and immediately the swelling disappeared.

In the beginning it did a good job of controlling my blood pressure with no other side effects. Now I am experiencing a few. Considerable swelling of ankles and feet are the biggest concern now. Sometimes I feel bloated, like I'm retaining fluid. I urinate almost every hour all night long. Tough to get a good nights rest. My sex drive is almost zero. (yes there is sex after sixty :) Oh, and my ears itch. Strange, but true. My blood pressure is still good (115-120 over 75) But I know I have gained at least 10-15 lbs of water weight. Is there a diuretic pill that can be taken with this drug to counteract the fluid retention? I feel like a water balloon!

Biggest problem is that I'm having severe heart palpitations/fluttering - usuall when I'm lying down at night.  It was so scary last night that I slept with my clothes on...just in case.  No swelling, but have had really bad cramping in my right calf muscle for two days now.

In addition I am experiancing extreme leg and muscle pain. While easy to use, it's one of those meds you can't just stop taking when you don't like it, you have to be weened off, I'm not comfortable with that. I have found several natural remedies that I will be switching to as soon as my doctor gets me off this crap.

Blood pressure stays around 110/78. Also taking HCTZ, so no swelling noticed in legs &amp; feet, although I am gaining weight. I got very ill after drinking a daily ounce of pomegranate juice with my medication: severely low BP (at lowest point, 79/58), dizziness and shortness of breath.  I drank pom juice with meds for 3 days and the effect has been like an overdose. DO NOT DRINK POMEGRANATE JUICE WITH AMLODIPINE!  It is like grapefruit juice and can be toxic!   It has been 6 days since I have been off my meds and my BP is staying low (109/77) and still dizzy.  I can't walk for long periods of time and have to stop for a few minutes to catch my breath and control the dizziness.  Hoping that the effects will dissipate soon and I can get back to normal.  I am drinking cranberry juice to help detox my liver and kidneys.  It seems to be helping, but I had like 15 days worth of meds in my body.  
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	6/10/2010 1:51:28 PM	Started on 5mg but was not effective.  Dr. Increased to 10mg &amp; it brought it down to normal to boarderline range but I am not convinced my BP is as low as it should be.  As for side affects - some swelling though not too bad.  No real pain/itching/rashes to mention, I do have dry mouth &amp; urinate a couple times a night (but this was occurring before the med), no erection or sexual performance problems either.

I was on lisinopril for 3 days and made me VERY sick. Stopped taking it and was fine the very next day. The doctor put me on this today and after reading reviews decided not to take it. The thing is that I went to the doctor for a rash on my leg and they never even adressed that now they have me taking all kinds of tests and taking meds for high blood pressure. How do they know I have high blood pressure if it was the first time they have taken my pressure. You cant make that judgement by one time. Time to find a new doctor. By the sounds of things I think the doctors are getting a kickback for prescribing this med. Well they are not getting my $$$.
High Blood Pressure	Silver Foxy Oma, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	65-74	5/18/2010 3:07:14 PM	I have been on this medication for some time in addition to taking Diovan HCT 320/12.5 which is a combination blood pressure and water pill. I would take the Amlodipine 10mg in the evening and the other in the AM hours. I too had attributed my aches and pains etc. to getting older, however after reading all 274 Reviews I believe this medication is responsible for most of my problems.. No sex drive, weight gain, crazy dreams that make no sense at all, swollen feet/ankles and legs, feeling that my throat was narrowing, making it noticable to swallow, dry itchy skin, pain in my left shoulder and neck, getting up 2-3 times during the night to tinkle,inability to get to sleep or sleeping for 4-6 hrs a night,thinning hair, dry eyes and mouth, heart palpations which caused my cardiologist to feel that I needed a pacemaker, which I have had now for one year.(Wonder if I really needed that). Since I didn't have any of these problems before,.. like I said I attributed it to aging. What brought this medication to my attention?.. I ran out and needed a new prescription, using a military mail order firm, new scripts take 10-14 days to fill... after about 5 days without it I noticed that I had dropped 1 1/2 lbs and now a week later I have lost 7 lbs.. I had gained about 40 lbs over the past 5 years and was miserable, tried exercising, diet etc.with no results or non lasting weight loss.I received my refill yesterday and I think that I am not going to take it and see just what happens. The pain in my shoulder is easing up, no more hip and back pain, (I have had both hip joint replaced, but the muscles around them hurt),the night sweats in the neck/upper chest area have diminished, my dreams have some sequence,no pain in my legs, still waiting for the libido to come back(yes there is sex after 70:-), Still get up during the night to tinkle.. hopefully that will ease up too. I'll keep you guys posted.I hope everything gets better for everyone. I'm starting to feel Gr-r-r-eat!!

The Dr. increased to 10mg. My legs and ankles swelled and became blotchy.  Dr. prescribed water pill. Swelling continued to increase and a fevered redness spread over ankles. The Dr. than prescribe an antibiotic to help infection and stop the HP prescription. The infection got worst in three days and I had to go to ER. I was in hospital for 6 days. I do not have diabetes or poor circulation. For me this was not the drug. I can't recommend.

Cough stayed(no surprise) but now I have swollen ankles, feet, dry month, excessive thrist, and am up every 2 hours during the night going to the bathroom along with the cough. Dr. hasn't taken my blood pressure since he switched my meds.  Maybe time for a new DR.

Went to my Dr. but had to be seen by a Nurse Practicioner who stated it was not a side effect of the medicine. Was all of this just a coincidence? I thinking of stopping the Amlodipine myself to see if it all clears up. (or change Drs)

I stopped taking it after a month because of the following symptoms: severe flu-like pains with aches in my limbs,nausea with dry heaving, feeling like I got run over by a bus, trembling, endless hot flashing. My doctor said that these sysmptoms are not from Amlodipine but after reading all the comments I beg to differ.   Two days after I stopped using it I still feel bad but not as bad. The nausea is finally subsiding.This stuff is not for me. I would rather have high BP and then live in misery. Way to go Pfizer.

I developed serious side effect on the drug - hives, hot rashes in between filings.  But after talking to the pharmacist and switched between a couple other manufacturers, I was able to settle on one of them.  If you are experiencing the same problem, you should have your pharmacy switch the manufacturer to see if it helps.  It takes me a couple month to find the right one.

She had it in the past and was taken off due to bad side effects, then was on it again in Azor, and  now is on it alone again. She just went through a spell where she almost completely lost control of her mind. She could not do simple tasks. Her memory was all over the place and she'd get her mind on one thing and not be able to let it go and her worrying was through the roof. Now that she's on norvasc alone, she's sliding again. She is having to urinate frequently, especially at night, so she loses sleep, plus insomnia is a side effect, so the combination is taking her health down. Her doc tried to convince me it was old age. Sheesh! She has many other side effects listed for it as well.

After reading all of your comments about weight gain.. and leg pain I am considering stopping the meds myself. I am experiencing leg pains and a dizziness that is crazy. I feel high as a kite for hours. I have not seen any swelling but I feel so tired. I didnt take these pills for one whole day and I feel much better without them. I have not been testing my blood pressure at home but I can feel when it goes up and down. I too have had crazy psychotic dreams off and on. It was scary. Taking the pills at bedtime helps u sleep through the  side effects if u take it earlier enough. Oh yeah and I too have night sweats. I dont trust medications AT ALL.. and this one I am not sure I am sticking with either..

Lisinopril is the culprit for your coughing as told to me by a pharmacist. Please, for your own good, get a second opinion. After coughing my head off due to Lisinopril I changed to Amlopidine 5mg. two years ago. Fortunately, no side effects and bp in normal range most of the time. I research all drugs that my new doctor prescribes and so far most of them have too many side effects to even consider taking them. It's still my body and ultimately, I'm the only one responsible for its condition. Why do drug salesmen give free samples to doctors? Think about it.

Amlodipine decreases my chronic angina &amp; helps me live a better life.  No side effects noted on 5mg 1xday dosage.  Last 2 months increased dosage to 5 mg 2xday which immediately decreased my chronic angina without decreasing my BP.  My BP runs low normally and never had high BP.   With increased dosage have noticed  numbness in lips/gum tenderness and these discomforts are increasing.  May return to 1xday to verify reactions caused by increase in amlodipine and then decide if the benefit of less chronic angina is  worth the lip numbness/tender gums.  Will consult with cardiologist/PA.  Also taking metoprolol and ranexa for angina along with aspirin, plavix, pravastatin, zoloft, stool softner, alprazolam, temazepam, multivitamin and iron supplement.

Within 45 minutes, my heart started beating extremely hard and my whole body was shaking.  Two hours later, when I went to Urgent Care, my blodd pressure was 189/80.  Originally, I given this prescription for my blood pressure whick would vary from 130-179/70-80. I was concerned that my heart was working so hard that it was going to stop.  You could see the veins in my neck popping out with my heartbeat.  I will never take something like this, again.

Other	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	55-64	8/13/2009 10:02:53 AM	The medication's side effects were not described to me at all when they were prescribed; when I reported problems with edema in my fingers, lower legs/ankles/feet, and genitals, no indication was given that this medication might be the cause.  I also reported tingling/numbness of the feet (neuropathy) and again, no mention to me that this medication was causing the problems.  The same with severe lower-back pain when walking or moderate exercise.  I was sent to a vascular surgeon, an orthopedic surgeon, and more--but not one of the doctors indicated all my problems might be related to amlodipine.I cut my pills in half, and began to see a marked, though not total, lessening of the problems.  However I'm sure the doctors would object.

I take half of a 5 mg. tablet morning and night.  I still feel a sense of anxiety for a while after taking the dose, which disapates gradually.

I took it last night and had very bad dreams.  I'm wondering if this is a side effect of the med.  I know that stress and what we eat has a lot to do with our BP levels.  Fatty and salty foods tend to cause my BP to jump.  Stress is my worst enemy.  Wish I knew how to get the stress down.  Tried everything.  I keep Amlodipine with me at all times.  I've tried several other meds that had bad side effects.  This site allows us to share info like this.  Thank you WebMD.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	7/4/2009 3:07:41 AM	About the second week of taking this drug I started experiencing dreams that were unusual or not ordinary.  Shortly after that I experienced hullucinations right after taking this medication.  I had been on Amlodipine for a brief 2 weeks.  After hallucinating, I'm done with it.  I feel that I had an adverse reaction to it and have discontinued use.
High Blood Pressure	Thomas, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	55-64	7/2/2009 12:49:31 AM	Started with 5mg, moved up to 10mg after a month or so, total treatment duration aprox. 3 month. Taken with a mild diuretic for the lenght of the treatment. Presently changed to a new medication within the group of ACE inhibitors called Benazepril at 20mgs plus the same diuretic. OK, back to Amlodipine: It does lower your bp but in my case with several side efects such as Lightheadedness, swollen ankles low libido and very poor tolerance for alcohol, those still persist, however some of the initial side efects such as insomnia, constipation and skin rashes were gone after the first week of use. Overall and effective med. to lower your blood pressure. Bottom line: I'm happier with Benazepril 20mgs with less side effects and a remarkable drop in blood pressure not even close to what I was able to achieve with Amlodipine.

High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	35-44	4/18/2009 1:03:43 AM	I switched to Amlodipine 10mg about a month ago from Sular 8.5 because the serveve side effects from Sular (frequent and serveve hives).  Before that I was on Sular 10mg for about 2 years but did not have any issue.  So far, my blood pressure has not drop a bit, still at 140/90 even with the medication, same as when I started.  Sometime even higher, especially during the day when the stress level (from work) is at its highest.  I will stay on it for a little bit longer to see if it actually works for me or I need a higher strength.  One thing I did see improvement is the side effects of hives.  I do not get the hives as frequent or as serveve, but it still exist.  (I have a full panel of blood tests for allegies, but ruled out all of them).   Other side effects are the same as Sular, such as dizziness, headache, lack of concentration at work, tired, having hard time falling to sleep, sudden fast heart beats, etc.  Overall, I did not find it to be very effective.

However,it causes me to urinate constantly. I am urinating all day. I went to the doctor, to check out my prostate, so I know that it is the medicine. I don't want to take the medicine, because it makes me urinate to much. Please give me some insight on what I might be able to due, with regards to the urinating problem I am experiencing.

Seems to be working, just started it 1 week ago, no unusual side effects so far. I read on here where some of you taking HCTZ have itchy skin, my doctor told me to take it every other day and use some Vitamin E lotion on my itchy legs. Works for me.
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	45-54	3/22/2009 8:29:56 AM	I started using 5mg of Amlodipine once at night for the last month. The cardiologist decided to add this drug to the current Benicar Hct 40/25mg that I was taking once daily for a year to lower my BP some more. The first thing I noticed were the side effects listed for this drug: fatigue, lack of motivation, dizzyness and mental fog, and constipation. It does lower my BP, but I feel way too laid back to be productive at all. Last week an unusual tenderness and fluid buildup appeared on my left forearm. The next day it moved to my elbow and has caused my elbow to be tender and swollen.I will be calling the cardiologist to get off of the Amlodipine.I wish there was a drug out there that was good for you and actually made you feel good too!If you are sexually active or want to be, do not take this drug!
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	3/19/2009 7:47:30 PM	I have been on 10 mg of Amlodipine for 8 days and my face is flushed, my ears are hot and I feel very anxious. I have a call in to my doctor,I'm going to ask to be taken off this med and given something else.

High Blood Pressure	Gene, 65-74 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	3/19/2009 1:59:30 PM	I have only been on this drug for two weeks but my BP dropped from 180-94 to 104-60 in  just two days.  Also on two other drugs that didn't work. Still taking those with this. No side effects yet... we'll see as time goes by.

High Blood Pressure	PAT, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	55-64	3/10/2009 1:50:15 AM	I take Hydrochlolrothiazide 25mg with Amlodipine Besylate 5mg for BP for a couple of months. I now notice that my ankles are swelling and my skin itches, feels like its streching and my inner wrist itches also.  I thougt maybe it was the weather or something I ate or an allergy. Well after reading all the comments I think its the AMLODIPINE. Ive already tried 2 other BP medicine and don't want to change again but I'm uncomfortable specially with the swelling.  I will call my doctor tomorrow.

I ached all over, was dizzy, nauseous, wanted to stay in bed all day, legs swelled and itched so badly that I scratched oozing sores in them.  Even my scalp itched terribly and oozed when I HAD to scratch.  I was so tired and depressed, at 74, thought I was just old.  My boys came to visit and asked what was wrong.  I said I'm just getting old and they said &quot;NO! get to the doctor!&quot;  I quit taking it that day and began to feel better by the next day!  BP went up but so did my morale!!! Now on new drug.  Hope it works - couldn't be any worse!!  Life is good again!!!

My ankles started hurting but a foot doc told me it was nothing. So I just lived with it until about 1-2 months ago I started getting some big swelling in my feet especially my left. Finally got into my doc today and he told me he was 95% sure it was because of this drug, so he took me off of it. I guess we will see in a few days.

High Blood Pressure	Pat, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	2/25/2009 8:52:55 PM	I've taken AMLODIPINE 5mg for two months and I also take HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE 25mg. This is the 3rd time my medication was changed and it seems to work for me.  AMLODIPINE I take it late at night when I go to bed and snack on crackers before taking it so it won't bother my stomach. HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE I do not take it at night because it wakes me up 2 or 3 times to urinate, so I take it in the morning. My blood pressure was 179/92 for the last two months its been pretty steady at 135/80. Hopefully it will go down more. The only side effects I experience is drowsiness with AMLODIPINE.

Dr. added Amlodipine.  BP is down, the last couple of weeks, I've had swelling in legs/ankles/feet.  Dr. told me this would happen but didn't say how long it would last.  Does anyone have any idea how long it will last?

Daily, usually take at around midnight before sleep. My BP is lowered, and I have far fewer side effects than with previous meds but do have irregular sleep, mild nausea, some weakness in legs, and mild constipation on an irregular basis. This round of medication is the first in my life (age 71) and I don't know enough about side effects to worry over these symptoms.  Went 4 days and nights during travel without the meds (forgot to pack 'em) and felt great the whole trip.  Got back, resumed once daily intake, now have leg weakness, stomach upset, irregular sleep, and heavy eye mattering again.  None of those is fatal I guess, but there is discomfort when using amlodipine. I'm hoping to be off all meds altogether after a year's use of BP med, and first time ever watching dietary content.  It's disturbing and not in my lifestyle pattern to take anything.
High Blood Pressure	graymatter, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	2/22/2009 10:46:15 PM	I haven't taken for one full month yet. It has lowered my B/P; I take 5MG, generic Amlodipine. Woke up with what looks like &quot;heat rash&quot;. First on inner wrists, arms, then on to chest, abdomin, back, neck and spots over eye, behind ears. This rash is slightly raised, hot &amp; itchy. Bendryl helped temporarily yet rash came back full force. Oatmeal bath did not help. I am irritated that Amlodipine seemed to help initially, now is rashy and I had to stop Lisinopril after BAD dizziness.  There has got to be a better way!! I'm gonna try the Hawthorne berries/Cayenne combo that a previous person mentioned.

Despite the doctors telling me it can't be, I never had a problem until I started on this,and now that I stopped, it has gone away thankfully.  Also, lots of dizzy spells and unusual head pressure.  BP was down for a few weeks, but then spiked up.  Too many side effects to deal with.

Bad reaction to the drug, there are alternatives. Check out Dr. Jay Cohen MD's. book The Magnesium Solution for High Blood Pressure.
High Blood Pressure	JayJay, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female		12/17/2008 4:42:25 PM	I have been on this drug approximately one month and in the past week experienced swelling in the ankles and hot red blotchy areas on the face after the first hour of taking the pill (usually first thing in the AM).  The redness disappears later in the day.  Dr. does NOT think ankle swelling is from the drug and I beg to differ because never have I had swelling in the enkles - just seems likely that when a person starts taking a different drug and experience symptoms not evident previously - then DAH! This is not rocket science to equate new drug with never before afflictions!  I prefer NOT to take any drugs.  I am going to half the 10 mg. dosage and see if that helps or go off altogether.

I have watched my husbands health deteriorate and I blame it on this drug, and the dr who prescribed it and told him he would have to take it for the rest of his life.  3 visits to the drs office his bp was elevated, and he told him that he needed to go back on meds.  He didn't ask what was going on in his life or how he was feeling he just wrote the script and walked out.  My husband's demeanor changed for the worse, his libido is nil.  He sweats profusely and has gained 40 lbs in these 2 years and has added stomach problems to his laundry list of symptoms.  Istead of taking the meds away they add more.  His BP has been normal since he started taking the pills, it just goes up when he stresses out about having to go to the dr.  His legs are going bad and he has sciatica.  I believe that if they would take him off that Amlodipine he could get his health back.
High Blood Pressure	chiwee, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	10/24/2008 1:04:42 AM	I was prescribed Atenolol by my ex-doctor when my hypertension was discovered. For almost two months, nothing positive to actually lower it happened. My new doctor advised me to switch to this drug after assessing my condition (43, F, semi-vegetarian, smoker, occasional drinker, exercise present in job). First 2 weeks into it were terrible - chest pains, racing heartbeat, neck stiffness and body pains. After that, everything went okay. From an average BP reading of 150-160/105-115 a day, it's now down to 125-130/85-90. My dose is only 5mg/day which I take every 8am. Quite effective, I think so.

High Blood Pressure	Sheri, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	8/21/2008 6:12:30 PM	My husband just recently (2 months ago)began taking amlodipine 5mg.  I am seeing a significant change (not good) in his normally calm and patient demeanor, and his sex drive is completely gone.  His anger and frustration is being directed at me.  I'll be calling his Dr. tomorrow, and hopefully, he'll prescribe something different before it's too late.
High Blood Pressure	Hilda Z., 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	8/8/2008 10:56:22 AM	This medication was prescribed to me by my cardiologist on 08/01/08.  At the time my BP was 156/102.  My cardiologist also recommended that I purchase a blood pressure monitor.  I used the blood pressure monitor today for the first time and my reading was 122/87.  This medication has drastically reduced my high blood pressure in a very short period of time.  Also, I haven't had any side effects. Thank You...Hilda Zorrilla!

Though it helped lowered my BP, it also caused swelling in my ankles, fatigue, and a severely decreased libido. Stopped taking it and replaced it with hawthorne berries and cayenne supplements. BP has been normal ever since and the side effects are gone.

Have been seeing an allergist since December for the Hives and can not find the cause of the recurring itchy rash. Just did research on this drug and these are all side effects.

High Blood Pressure	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	2	5	1	Female	65-74	11/11/2007 7:15:00 PM	I gave my husband, who is a stroke victim, this medication for about 2 months.  His face, neck, shoulders and upper chest turned red.  He seemed really dizzy and he was very constipated.  Laxatives did not help the constipation.  I stopped this medication, no more constipation and he seems to be feeling much better but the redness has not gone away.  I got a new medication for him, just started today, which has lots of side effects also.  Why can't we get medication without so many bad side effects?
