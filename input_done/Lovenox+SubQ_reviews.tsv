Blood Clots in Deep Veins and in Blood Vessel of the Lung	cindy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	8/22/2012 3:12:01 PM	Horrible, horrible shots.  Just a thought, why can't this be put ion a patch style delivery method? The side effects are horrific, huge bruises and hematomas.
Blood Clots in Deep Veins and in Blood Vessel of the Lung	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	55-64	7/15/2012 2:42:38 PM	I had a pulmonary embolism in Dec '11 and when I had a leg ultrasound, I had DVTs in both legs. This was 4 weeks after I had a large polyp (fortunately benign) removed in my colon with a colonoscopy. I had one previous DVT approx 20 yrs ago under a cast when I broke my ankle. Because this is a second incident in my life, my doctor told me that I have a 7 times greater chance to develop a heart attack, stroke, and another blood clot in my lungs. I felt horrible on warfarin (Coumadin) and am told the Lovenox is my only other choice and I need to give myself inj 2 times daily for the rest of my life. Not fun! I don't even know where to give myself inj anymore since I have to get 60 inj a month. I am grateful for my insurance with the cost being approx $80 per inj and am afraid if I could no longer work, what would be my options? Please, drug companies, I beg of you to try something different. I have huge hematomas all over my abd and don't know where to poke anymore. I know what I am doing because I am an RN. My doctor put me on Pradaxa but the hematologist told me that that drug is only FDA approved for atrial fib. Anyone else in my shoes? (I have not had a diagnosis and the clotting disorders are ruled out so why am I developing clots?)

Deep Vein Thrombosis Prevention	Romeo, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	65-74	5/5/2012 11:26:57 PM	Started taking Lovenox twice a day after knee surgery to prevent clots. Only the first injection was difficult. (I just couldn't stab myself but now I've got my method down pat) Some hurt, some don't. Most result in long lasting deep purple brusies. About 30% give me a lump. I am OK with this medication and glad my use is short term.
Treatment to Prevent a Blood Clot in the Lung		5	5	1			3/26/2012 9:12:58 PM	background- 26 preg for 1st time, 4 weeks with bad back pain went to er. confirmed bad blood clot in lung. lovenox only thing safe for pregnancy. was on 2 injections twice a day. 2 injections at once because the amount needed was more than supplied in one needle. was on it for remainder of pregnancy, 4 shots total a day. (took 18 days to dissolve clot)WARNING WARNING WARNINGi wish i had a heads up before taking this drug to maybe mentally prepare myself. the needle itself is nothing, it super tiny and doesnt hurt at all going in. so thats not the problem. as soon as the med goes in its the worst burning sensation ever, like a 100 wasps stinging you and if you can imagine your skin tearing. thats what it feels like. an Indian burn that is ripping your skin open. the burning stays in a space about the size of a quarter for the first 20 minutes,then progressively spreads (the burning) to about the size of a small plate. then the whole area burns and is VERY sensitive to the touch or if you move that area for the next 2 or so hours. the next day or two an area about the size of your fist turns into a bruise that hurts if you move it or touch it. i had to inject my stomach and thighs so when i would walk or bend over or even having a shirt touch my skin was painful. after about a month i was running out of spaces to inject and had to inject on the bruising to be expected it was the same feelings of pain just 3489273827 times worse.there were times where i skipped a dose KNOWING this med was saving my life. it was so painful and made me so depressed. i would count down and dread the time i was to get it and then would lay immobile for the following 2 hours to reduce pain. between worrying and laying down it literally took up my entire day.i have no history of health problems but the drs said if i get pregnant again i have to go on it bc its the only one safe for pregnancy. bc of this i am choosing not to have anymore kids. this is the only reason. it was THAT bad. 
Blood Clot in a Deep Vein	Hazel, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	55-64	2/25/2012 6:49:55 PM	After a bilateral stroke in 2010, dr's found a clot in my right Iliac artery. I have been on Coudmadin and now on Lovenox for the second time in 3 months. I'm taking Lovenox before I have a stent procedure done. For me, the bruising is bad and today I've been bleeding from his morning's injection site. I am thankful for drugs to prevent clots, but find myself tired of giving myself these injections. I have other health issues and have to manage my medications for oo.those things too.  Thanks for listening. Hope I've helped someone else.

Then last year a pulmonary embolism.  The Warfarin had failed so I was put on Lovenox.  The stomach bruising and hematomas are difficult but a small price to pay for a medication that is keeping me alive.  I am looking forward to enoxaparin sodium in a pill form in the future.  That would make life so much easier and a little less painful.

I have found that injecting slower than I was shown by the doctors takes some of the sting intensity out. I also seem to be bruising around the injection site less than my first two injections did.

Was given this drug in the ER and for 5 days while in the hospital.  The nurse said it was to prevent blood clots that might form while lying in bed.  (I hadn't been lying in bed before.)  I suffered from mental confusion which was severe at night and now after release my feet and legs are very swollen.  I hope I don't have to return to the ER because of the side effects.  I will never take Lovenox again.  I don't understand why the doctor ordered it, or why he didn't stop it when I showed side effects.

Heart Attack	Mbeard, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	1	Male	55-64	6/14/2011 9:02:44 AM	I have a heart valve and on Coumadin. Prior to any surgery, I am taken off Coumadin and normally placed on Heparin. This time I was put on Lovenox instead. After surgery, I am normally put back on Coumadin. This time I was put on Lovenox and Coumadin. My prep for surgery was longer and l almost bleed to death because my blood would not clot during surgery,and my hospital stay was longer and still trying to get my INR right. Never had that problem with Heparin to get my INR right. My stomach is as blue as it can get and the shots are painful. If I ever get my blood right and completey back on coumadin, Lovenox will be out of the question. I will never use it again. There were no instructions on where or how ro give the shots. I had to do research on the internet to figure it out. The Doctors were not even familiar with Lovenox. They said it was better than Heparin and I would be in the Hospital less. They were wrong and I will never use lovenox again.

Coumadin was used until the last couple months, while in therapeutic range, I still clot.  Have been changed to Lovenox 2x daily, easy to use, the needle is barely felt, the drug stings minimally, just happy to have an alternate as Coumadin was not working effectively.

I had a recent DVT and now have to go in for a Hysterectomy.  They put in a IVC filter and am off coumadin prior to surgery, but they have me doing shots.  I find it almost impossible to do them.  I have tried my legs as alternative location and have had bleeding from one of the sites.  The first nurse that instructed gave me incorrect info and told me to hold the needle down into my skin until the shaft went over the needle OUCH...then I was told to do it in my legs but they did not say where and that is when I hit a vein and it bled for days.I just sit and cry when I have to do the shots as they hurt and I just can't seem to do them without inflicting brusing and pain.  I can't wait to stop.

Deep Vein Thrombosis Prevention	AmberLee, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	3/24/2011 1:22:28 PM	The needle is not what hurts when it's time for injections. The needle is thin and sometimes I dont even feel it going in. It's the medicine going in that hurts, I can feel it spread out. I had a blood clot in my leg after giving birth to my son. I am pregnant again and they decided to do more tests resulting in them finding out that I have a factor v and prothrombin mutation in my genes resulting in a higher risk for blood clots. During pregnancy the only option I have for treatment is the shots, so I am forced to inject lovenox twice a day for the remander of my preganancy and at least two months afterwards. (About 7 to 8 months) At first there was a lot of bruising, but its been alittle more than a month and there is much less visible bruising. I see a doctor next week who will tell me if I have to be on blood thinners even while im not pregnant... but I think i will be able to take the warfarin pills then. It's really not as bad as I am seeing expressed in the other reviews.. it's either the shots or take the chance that I will get a clot and not be around to see my kids graduate. The hardest part about my diagnosis is knowing that there is a 50/50 chance that I passed the mutations to my kids.

Because the delivery method is sadistic and barbaric!  I am able to give myself daily injections of Forteo (for osteoporosis)because it uses ultra-fine 31 guage needles, so I DO know how to do subcutaneous injections. But the (only available) needle on the Lovenox product is large, incredibly painful, and leaves HUGE painful bruises, whether it is a nurse or myself doing the injection! It is like trying to do an injection with a crudely sharpened metal pipe!  Horrible! Painful!  My hematologist is telling me that it is truly a matter of staying alive, but I simply can't do the injections. ARE ALL LOVENOX MANUFACTURERS REALLY THAT COMPLETELY UNCONCERNED ABOUT HOW PAINFUL THE DELIVERY METHOD IS?  I am appalled by the total disinterest in finding a better delivery method, using smaller needles or some other reasonable approach. ALL of my other DVT meds are in pill form.....why can't these geniuses figure out a way to put it in oral form?  I'll tell you why: patient's pain levels mean ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to them! They could care less. After all, THEY are not the ones who have to inject it into themselves!  We are just supposed to shut up and take whatever torturous method they invent!  Well, at the risk of my life, I CANNOT use the ridiculous syringes, and WON'T, until they come up with something reasonably humane!

I can now walk on it in the morning without a cane or support.  I thank God for my doctor a classmate who not only diagnosed the problem yet allowed my to actually practice the initial injection on myself.  I am having bruising and pain at time yet it does not match the pain and possibilities encountered prior to treatments.

It was discovered i have a clot in my lung. I have been on birthcontrol for almost 13yrs and this was the reason for the clot. I am on coumidine and lovenox injections. The injection burns and leaves nasty brusing and hard nodules on my stomach. But overall the drug is effective. I just wish it didnt burn and itch so bad even hours later sometimes.

Missed the fat and got the muscles instead.  Why the doctor's office can't handle this is beyond us.  Let alone bear the cost. A recent prescription for 8 doses of Lovenox cost $797.

I received my first shot in the ER and my first dose of Coumadin. By 9am the next day the pain in my back was gone. I give myself two shots a day and I am very happy with the improvement I am seeing. The swelling and discoloration of my leg is getting better everyday. I have no problems with the shots as long as I don't go to far over the side of my stomach. The price of the shots are rather steep but my health if worth it as long as the work. I do experience a slight head ache after the shots but nothing two Tylenol can't handle.

I was immediately given Lovenox injections 2x's a day, so far for 2 months. I'm still on them, and have not had any problems at all with this medication or any recurring clots to date. The only reason I'm still taking the medication is a precautionary measure prior to my upcoming surgery. At that time I will have to stop the Lovenox so that my blood will start to naturally clot for surgery.  I expect to be placed on the Lovenox again after surgery, and I'm fine with that.

Yet I have to use this drug while I am trying to get pregnant, when I am pregnant and 6 weeks after delivery to avoid a miscariage. I have Anticardiolipin Antibody and this causes my blood to clot easily, which will cause a miscarraige. My husband has to give me the shot, because I just can't do it myself. I will say though, it is relatively painless. I also remember this more than my coumadin, which before I had to switch, I would forget. All in all, as long as this truly works to prevent any miscarriage, I am ok with this treatment.
Deep Vein Thrombosis Prevention	Al, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	35-44	4/20/2010 11:08:51 PM	Not only was I born without a Inferior Vena Cava, but I have Lupus Antibodies that are causing DVT's in both legs.  Got blood clots on Coumidin, and now taking Lovenox injections.  Would like to speak to someone born without an IVC.  I am 44 years old and would like to know what to expect in the future.  I've been hospitalized 2 times in the last 8 months due to DVTs.  The Lovenox seems to be working, but have experienced some internal bleeding.  The needle seems to be too thick and could be much thinner and shorter.  The manufacturer should consider the discomfort of the thick needle, which is unnecessary.  I do have bruising and develop knots in the injection site as well.  This is a small discomfort considering the consequences of not having the medication.  I'm very thankful that my insurance is helping with the cost of this medication; $4,000 per month is extremely expensive. If you were born without an Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) please  respond.

I found the prefilled syringes very easy to use.  One little trick that I learned from experience is to leave a small bit of air, less than 0.5cc, in the syringe and flick the barrel of the syringe while holding it with the needle pointing towards the ground.  this brings the small bit of air up to the plunger.  then when the medication is injected, the air acts as a plug or cork in the injection site and prevents bleeding onto my clothing.

Have been on twice daily Lovenox injections and Coumadin for almost 2 weeks and my ProTime is still only 1.6.  Abdomen hurts, have nodules in many injection sites, and worst of all, have a massive bruise that I think may be pooled blood under the skin.  Am seeing the doc today.  So far am not impressed with Lovenox.

My PT is still only 1.6 &amp; I have a horrible spreading bruise on my stomach that gets bigger every time I look at it.  Lots of little bruises and nodules too.  Am going to speak to my doc today about injecting into the back of my upper arm for awhile.  Don't much care for this therapy but have to stay on it until PT is at least 2.

What a scare!  When they told me I had blood clots in both of my lungs I didn't know what to think.  I was only 30 years old and in very good health!  The dr told me I would have to give myself injections twice a day for the remainder of my pregnancy plus at least six weeks after.  I have always been bad with needles, but when they taught me how to use the convenient prefilled syringes I felt a lot better.  Although I don't enjoy the injections and the medicine does burn for a few minutes, it has literally saved my life and that of my unborn daughter.  I would certainly recommend it.

I just had to have a double ligament replacement in my ankle and the lovenox is working great. so far so good, no clot and the injections arent that bad. they could make the needlle a little smaller but with how much you have to inject it would be hard. The trick to making the needle not hurt so bad is just to pinch the fat a little harder so you feel the pressure more and not so much of the needle.

The real problem is the large round balls of fibroids that occured at most of the injection sites. They cause pain and discomfort wich becomes worse when I have to use commpression panty hose, to my waste. I'm a jeweler and this makes it hard for me to sit at a bench all day. This was the second treatment, during the first treatment this did not occur.

I have found none of this to be true.  I have bruising but that's it.  There is no pain getting the shot or burning injecting the medicine.  You just have to set your mind to a place that tells you that this is the stuff that you need to survive and deal with it.  I was perfectly fine one minute (working full time, running a household, and going to college full time, with a 4.0 GPA, and told that I had a terminal illness within the next 1/2 hour.)  I'm very thankful for anything that will help fight this dreaded disease and live to see my youngest son grow up and my 2 grandchildren.  Little bit of pain to go thru with a shot is worth every but of it.

Deep Vein Thrombosis Prevention	13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	5	Male	13-18	1/5/2009 7:43:58 PM	Okay, where to start.... It's january 5th, 2009, and I was rushed to the hospital on the 20th of December because the days previous to the twentieth, i literally had a purple left leg, severe hip and back pain(could not move or walk) and the night my mom called 911, i had a severe panic attack in which my vision went pitch black and my hearing went to like zero(i felt deaf)(i don't know if this was due to the DVT but that happened), and that lasted about 5 minutes.....christmas eve, i get out the hospital around 6:30PM and my family and I went to the pharmacy, the lovenox was $4000 dollars, i was like, are you kidding?!?!?! but blue cross blue shield is paying for a ton of it.............so anyways, the reason all those things happened to me was because I was born without a vena cava inferior(which it turns out is supposedly a 20/305,000,000 chance of that happening to someone) and the clot in my leg was more than 3 feet long..................now, onto the drug review........LOVENOX IS 5 STARS FOR EFFECTIVENESS, BECAUSE ALTHOUGH I DO NOT KNOW IF MY CLOT HAS SHORTENED IN LENGTH, I CAN WALK AGAIN, RUN, JUMP, AND WALK UP STAIRS. THE EASE OF USE IS LIKE A NEGATIVE BILLION BECAUSE THE PAIN FROM THE SHORT&amp;STUBBY, THICK, DULL NEEDLE IS HORRIBLE, BUT I HAVE ONLY BEEN RECEIVING INJECTIONS TWICE A DAY FOR THE PAST 15 DAYS, AND I HAVE YET TO EXPERIENCE THESE SO CALLED NODULES ON THE STOMACH =/. I HAVE BEEN INJECTING IN THE BACK OF MY UPPER ARMS ON THE FATTY PARTS AND THAT AREA IS MUCH LESS PAINFUL THAN THE STOMACH. FOR SATISFACTION, I HAVE BEEN VERY SATISFIED DESPITE THE EXTREME TERRIBLE RIDICULOUS BURNING AND STINGING AND STABBING PAINS FROM THE INJECTIONS BECAUSE I CAN NOW WALK AND BE MOBILE, AND THIS MEDICINE HAS SAVED MY LIFE. IF ALL OF US WERE HAVING THESE PROBLEMS WITH OUR BODIES 60+ YEARS AGO, WE WOULD DIE. to conclude my story/review, i'll say that one thing i would like for the manufacturer of the prefilled syringes to do is to make the needles thinner and sharper

MD now says that I can't take it again and will have to have in-patient heparin if the need arises.  Oh joy!

He couldn't breath, walk,stand up,eat.He ended up on oxygen and when we brought him to the hospital they are all saying there is no way whats happening to him is from the coumadin. But thats the only new thing hes on. He has diabetes which gets insulin injects, has cancer which he is in remission, neuropathy. We asked them to put him on Lovenox and they said they can't because it interferes with another med hes on but won't tell us which one so maybe that could be changed to get him on Lovenox. Is there any other blood thinner he could go on? My mom and I are so confused and frustrated and need help. We would appreciate it.

One was for a DVT in 2003 and this time around during my pregnancy. It's been okay BUT since the first shot in 2003, I've developed severe itching!! This time around I've developed the wonderful nosebleeds. I love that it's prefilled and I don't have to pay full price. The downside is the itching &amp; now minor nosebleeds. I'll be glad when I don't have to take this medication anymore!! I wake up from a sound sleep just to scratch my injection sites. 
Blood Clot in a Deep Vein	mainer, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	55-64	4/24/2008 2:25:33 PM	This is the second use of Lovenox for me,Coumadin was discontinued due to unbearable side effects. I find Lovenox easy to use but after several weeks of daily injections I'm experiencing severe flushing episodes ,they are becoming so frequent that I've considered stopping daily injections to see if there is any relief. I had not known this was a side effect until I read about it in this column. Is there any way to relieve this sympton short of discontinuing  the Lovenox?
Deep Vein Thrombosis Prevention	MrsAlex, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	4/23/2008 4:13:09 PM	I am taking Lovenox during my pregnancy to prevent a 2nd or 3rd trimester miscarriage/still birth.  I miscarried a previous pregnancy in the 2nd trimester about 7 years ago.  After the miscarriage I was diagnosed with Anti Phospholipid Antibody syndrome.  I am seeing a high-risk OB in my area and this pregnancy seems to be progressing well, although I am only 9 weeks at this time.  The injections aren't fun, but they aren't horrible.  I have definitely gotten better giving myself the daily injections because I am no longer bruising.  My big complaint with this drug, is the cost.  My insurance has left me responsible for 30% of the cost which is over $400 per month.  I am just happy that I only have to take this medication for 7 more months, and the baby and I are healthy and happy.
Deep Vein Thrombosis Prevention	mainer, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	4/19/2008 8:56:22 PM	I asked to be put on Lovenox after bad side effects from Coumadin.I have no trouble injecting myself as I'm a diabetic used to daily insulin injections. After using Lovenox for several months I now find myself in a state of almost constant flushing which is worse than hot flashes of menopause. Any suggestions for some relief from this side effect ? I still have several more months of Lovenox use to go.
Deep Vein Thrombosis Prevention	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/18/2008 6:27:26 PM	I am on Lovenox for the third time to prevent a DVT during pregnancy. While I don't think I will ever be comfortable with daily injections, it is much better than taking coumadin and getting lab work every other day. In order to minimize the bruising and hard spots, I take my time inserting and removing the needle from my skin. There is some burning during and after the injection but it is bearable. After having a DVT after delivering my first child and dealing with the pain and stress, I think it is much easier in the long run to use the Lovenox.

At first they could not find a cause but after a recent clot, I was diagnosed with APS, antiphosholipid syndrome. I am still learning about my ailment but was told that this medication increases bone density and with my legs hurting alot, I am thinking about switching back to coumadin.  Does anyone have any advise?
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	3/11/2008 10:00:22 PM	I was put on Lovenox twice daily for 6 months after the birth of my son whenI suffered from an amniotic embellism.  I stopped taking it 10 days ago and have experienced dizziness, swelling, and what I believe to be Carpal Tunnel in my left wrist.  I'm not sure if these are related to just stopping Lovenox or not.

My lower abdomen, where I injected my self 2 times a day, turned a dark purple, with swelling and after a few days, I was bleeding from the site of the injections. I did not inject myself with Lovenox in the same location.After finally seeing my specialist, he eventually switched me to Arixtra, which causes no problems for me, except anytime I bump myself, I do bruise easily.  Better than Lovenox!!!!  I clotted the 5th time in my life while on Coumadin, and my PT/INR were within the normal range at the time of the DVT.

I found that icing my stomach before and after injection caused less pain and bruising. I do however notice more headaches than with coumadin. Anyone else having side effects that you haven't had with coumadin or other medication?

Tip- I seem to have less bruising and hard knots if I rub the injection site for a few minutes firmly afterward.. it burns more, but seems to help with side effects.  Any other tips would be helpful.

It has been very effective for the last three years. I controll my bruising with Arnica cream. As long as I apply it daily, there is very little bruising visable.I prefer the cream over the gel. You can find this at a health food store. Life is good!

Blood Clot in a Deep Vein		5	2	5			12/11/2007 8:54:56 PM	This drug in very effective...I was prescribed Lovenox after being diagnosed with a Deep Vein Thrombosis, and it prevented further damage. I'm just not fond of giving myself injections, hence the lower 'ease of use' rating. However, I'd rather deal with needles than a heart attack, so it IS the lesser of the evils.

I had a high fever and chills and severe nausea.  I had to stop taking it after three days and had to take a high dose of aspirin instead.  This was the most horrible reaction to a drug that I ever had.

It was one of the hardest things I have ever had to go through.  My stomach was bruised beyond belief and the injection sites were hard as rocks.  Just thinking about this medication makes me want to cry.  Although painful it did do it's job and prevented another clot so what a little pain compared to your life:)

So I was on Coumadin and Lovenox injections (twice a day). The injections left big bruises and made my sides tender. They were also a little painful until I got used to the nurses injecting me in the stomach. When my INR got above 2.5 they switched me to coumadin only and it has maintained it. however, I feel like Lovenox helped save my leg because I had very little blood flow one clot ran from my knee, through my thigh, and in my pelvic area. it's not the most comfortable medication but well worth it =)
Blood Clots in Deep Veins and in Blood Vessel of the Lung	indianwolfspirit, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	11/22/2007 11:14:24 AM	I have a blood clot on my lung so of course they wanted to put me on Coumadin and these shots. Originally, they told me 2-3 days only on the shots. It's been over 3 weeks now. My stomach is bruised badly and tender and I'm developing hard spots too so that limits areas to shoot into. My level is still only 1.8 and I am very discouraged.  The high copay for this is about to kill me financially and now I have to get another refill. I wish there were a generic alternative available. It would be great if they could make this in pill form too. I had a minor melt down yesterday after finding out I had to remain on the shots through the long holiday weekend... there has to be a better way! Once I'm off of this medication, I'm not sure I would ever agree to go back on it. My doctor is sending me to a specialist to check more into why my blood is still so thick but that appointment isn't until April of 2008 unless there is a cancelation.  I better be off of these shots by then!!!  :-)

I take it during pregnancy to prevent DVT.  I have a history of DVT @ age 24.  While I don't like the needles, the drug does work well.  There is some burning when the drug is injected, but it doesn't happen all the time.

I am taking these while trying to conceive (I am FVL homozygous with a history of DVT and PE at age 25) and while I am not excited at the prospect of taking these injections for the next year, I am grateful there is something that I can take to help protect myself and my unborn child. Aside from the occassional bruise, this really hasn't been that difficult.

I don't like needles, but the simplicity of a pre-filled syringe helps me.

However, the medication itself burns as it goes in &amp; usually leaves a bad bruise.  I've even had the nurse watch me as I inject myslef to make sure I'm doing it properly.  I feel the drug co could modify this product a little so it wouldn't burn so bad.

I thought I would be done with blood thinners by now. It's been a year since my initial diagnosis. I might find out that coumadin doesn't work for me. The clots are still there.

It is extremely expensive and can only be administered by daily injection which leave hard nodules under the skin that last for weeks.
