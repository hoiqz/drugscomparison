We prefer it in cream, and not in the vasaline like ointment. I was finally prescribed this for my son's eczema. He had a red dry spot on his chin for months on end. He  then started to get a few spots behind his knees.After several doctor appointments and other time wasting remedies the doctor prescribed this cream. It worked wonders. I was told not to use it on his face but I gave in and that spot on his face immediately disappeared! I was relieved. Who wants thier kid with a mysterious sore on his face! I know it has a steroid, but we were desperate. Use sparingly and it does the job. I now seem to get a few spots of itchy eczema and it works like a charm. Takes the itch away immediately and rash away within a short time.

One disadvantage is that I developed body acne...like on my arms and my back....I mean don't get me wrong anybody can get this kind of acne but from research and what I was told it's a higher chance on a bigger person. I started using this stuff on my arms and back twice a day and within a week I seen a major difference. I will continue to use this and I recommend it to anyone else who have this problem. The rx is a little pricing but it's well worth it in the end with they results you get. I mean from the time I rubbed the cream on me it's like I felt it to begin working...

Tried gutting through the outbreaks with over-the-counter drugs (hydrocortisone, calamine lotion, benadryl, etc.). Finally went to a walk-in clinic, got a shot of steroids, and this Triamcinolone Acetonide cream. The cream was a godsend--no itching, no burning, gradual reduction in swelling, no permanent scarring. Read lots of eczema treatments, which are chronic to my limited knowledge. For acute outbreaks of contact dermatitis or allergic reactions, I would strongly recommend going to a doctor and asking about this treatment.

I couldn't see or reach it, so I went to the DR, who prescribed this. After application 2 times daily for about a week, it is nearly gone, stopped itching completely, and no adverse side effects. It is kinda greasy, but if you just rub it in, it absorbs quickly, with no stains on my clothes.Also, it only cost $4. at WalMart, so if you are paying more elsewhere, try them. It is not expensive for what it does.

I developed a rash on the back of my neck as a result of a bad barber and it was horrible. I was a turret gunner so driving around for hours under 135 degrees sun with a rash was very unconfertable. I was on several lotions and nothing worked until a doctor gave me this lotion. It cleared up it a matter of 1-2 weeks, relieved the itch and made my missions go a lot smoother!

Atopic Dermatitis	prettyinpink23, 0-2 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	0-2	12/18/2009 12:41:16 AM	I've been putting this on my infant child since he was 2 months old. I use it on his body. He has a moderate case of eczema on his body. His face, however, is a different story. Nonetheless, we are still working on trying to figure out the triggers and a way to get it under control. This helps the rash for a short time on his body. I can only use it for a few days. Then it flares right back up again. It's good for short term use with eczema but not for long term use. I worry about the side effects though with him. It can stunt a child's growth, thin out their skin, create stretch marks and discolor their skin. We are using it on his body (not face) but I still worry about the long term effects of this product. I just wish it stopped him from itching and crying for longer. He is now 5 months old.

I have had this since birth and nothing has ever seemed to make it stop itching or make it clear up. Always, even as a kid, you could notice my eczema. As I have matured into my high school years, my eczema has gotten worse, due to my active athletic schedule. Especially during basketball my eczema would inflame and being very irritated. I knew I had to get off whatever I was using and go to a dermotologist to help get rid of this eczema. I got prescribed to triamcinolone acetonide cream about a month ago, and it works wonders. I have never had a cream clear up my whole arms as this one. You can't even notice that I have eczema anymore. And, unlike many others, it keeps it away. I put it on a couple times a week and it seems to work wonderfully. I really like this cream and would recommend it to anyone like myself who has had to live with eczema for their lives. This stuff is GREAT.

Growing up, I had eczema in the joint areas (inner elbows, back of legs, back of neck).  Not understanding my skin's sensitivity, my parents had me washing dishes and doing laundry during my teens which worsened the problem.  After college, I upgraded my skin care to Eucerin cream and Cetaphil &quot;soap&quot; which are great OTC products.  Sun &amp; Earth make great skin-safe laundry and cleaning products.Now my issue is the scarring and seasonal flare ups, but this medicine gets right in there and calms and actually smooths my skin.  Only my hands are affected now, so I use gloves etc.I know that my skin will never be normal, but using this medicine helps it look normal.  I must say that I had been going to a doctor who was prescribing the normal stuff year after year (Lidex, Atarax, Topicort, etc).  Don't get stuck in that rut cycle.  See another doctor -- someone who wants to heal you/make you feel pretty and not just contain the discomfort.

They pop up randomly and when I scratch they seem to multiply. Well I was prescribed this med and tried it this morning and by lunch time it did not itch anymore and looked ten times better. I'm sure this med won't make the bumps go away forever, but it works when they show up.

Since I have been using it not only has it removed the bumps from my skin but it also evened out the discoloration of my skin, and flakyness. Now I am more comfortable with wearing low hanging clothes on my back. Only downfall-can't discontinue use otherwise rash comes back.

This is the only medication that immediately and effectively provides any relief for canker sores.  However, as you can imagine, it has an unpleasant taste and is a strange sandy consistency and does not work well on the back of my throat.

It works quickly every time and it doesn't smell, which is a huge consideration for me since it is used twice daily. The consistency is also good; no need to cover up the problem areas because they look pasty under the cream - it dries fast and clear and provides relief!

I was unsure of the cause and tried many, many anti-itching creams and lotions. Nothing semed to help and it continued to get worse. My Doctor gave me this in a 0.1% cream and that still did not work.  After more than six months of the problem getting increasingly worse, I was tired of trying new creams. Once I tried ointment however, it immediately calmed down and began healing. I did not get the scaly result that all the others had done as this &quot;ointment&quot; was the vehicle I needed to keep the area in a film to protect and heal while slowly drying up.

I was put on triamcinolone steroid cream when I was a child which worked, what I thought was, wonders.  The itching red spots disappeared within days, and my mother and I were very excited.  My mother specifically asked if there were any side effects to be worried about from a steroid especially thinning of the skin - and we were told not to worry. I have always been fit and never over weight, but my sophomore year of high school I began showing stretch marks on my inner thighs...the only explanation I have is the steroid cream did indeed thin my skin so much over the years that when I grew my skin didn't have enough elasticity left to stretch without stretch marks.  The problem with steroid cream is that it works, and it works very well, but there are consequences.  I would not recommend using it in children unless it is only for a short period of time, or on a small area of skin. (I was applying cream over basically all of my body)  I hope this helps, and good luck to everyone!

The Effudex caused severe inflammation and discomfort which was significantly worsened by the Triamcinolone (1 in 100,000 said my doctor). I discontinued it after four days and am now trying Locoid Lipocream.  I have only applied it once so far, to severely inflamed skin, and so far it has been quite comfortable.

After no cause could be found, ti was determined that it was possibly a minor staph infection. This medication worked very, very well for me. Not only did it relieve the itching, but within days began to clear the condition. However, it did not work immediately, as I had hoped, so patience was needed. Further, I was told that this medicine has a tendency to 'thin' ther skin and cause spider veins, so the cream should ONLY be placed on the area that is bothersome, even if it means applying to each little bump. I was very happy with the effectiveness of this medicine.

I am somewhat concerned about using it as often as told, since my 2 inch rash (in the beginning) now covers 90% of my body!

This medicine is our wonder drug if he accidentally has it.  Clears it up quickly.  We have seen none of the side effects.  Also, it is not a preferred drug for insurance, so the cost is reasonable.  For a child, I do not use for the long term.  3 days, and it usually clears up the rash/inflammation.

You have no idea how uncomfortable the itching is.  In the begginning i was taking predisone and  that did a  job on my skin,  It  did not stop the itch.  It made my skin thin, so when i scratched i  bled.  I take  coumadin also.  I have been  to many dermotalogists  seven to be exact all over the state of  Conn.  No help there.
