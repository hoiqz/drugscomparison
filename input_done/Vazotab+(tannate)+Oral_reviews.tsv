Only problem is that I had the chewable kind and just the taste of medication makes me gag also it made me sooo drowsy that I could barely function at school.

It worked and relieved sinus pressure and confusion related to sinus pressure! It works better than anything I've ever used. 1 whole chewable made me a little drowsy, but 1/2 was perfect. My only complaint would be cost. $45.00 with insurance for 30 pills.

Cold Symptoms	Shmily, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/3/2009 10:24:08 AM	I had fluid/infection in both ears and was on my 2nd round of antibiotics - nothing was working. Dr. prescribed this med and within 24 hours of first dose the pressure in my ears began to diminish.  By day 5 my ears were completely normal.  The only side effect I experienced was increased thirst. Great product.!

Cold Symptoms	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	12/15/2008 10:34:56 PM	This drug does a great job at immediately relieving congestion, but that relief seems to only last an hour.  and in the meantime, I feel that it has only made the pressure in my head worse, leaving behind a headache, which then is frustrating, seeing as there is no information as to whether or not it is safe to take basic pain relievers with this medication.  For the most part, this has been very ineffective for me.  I am appreciative however for the attempts made to create a medication that can relieve cold symptoms.
