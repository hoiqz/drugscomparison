Other	Siobhan, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	2/16/2012 11:59:53 AM	I took this drug on recommendation of my doctor on a routine visit. The nurse told me my arm may hurt for a few days but I was not told that this drug is also for Pertussis and Diphtheria. It has been over a week now and I have chills and severe vertigo and dizzy spells. I have never been this sick in 60 years. The doctor does not seem to know what to do and tells me she never saw a reaction like this. I have been to see her now 3 times with no real relief from these symptoms which do not go away. I will never ever take this drug again. Beware!

I have been very ill for almost 4 days. My arm is in excruciating pain. USERS BEWARE.. ITS HORRIBLE I am middle aged and have never been this sick from a shot..I was not told what type of tetnus I was receiving. When I called the drs. office they said no one has ever complained about a reaction. Well I am I have had to go back twice and missed a week of work.
