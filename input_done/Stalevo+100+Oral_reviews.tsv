Parkinson's Disease	Tom, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	2/9/2010 9:51:38 AM	I was diagnosed with PD in 1997.  Began taking Stalevo 100 in January 2005.  Had DBS Surgery December 2006.  Stalevo is very effective and is easy to use.  I now take 6 Stalevo 100 per day, but with adjustments to my DBS stimulator (happening tomorrow 02-10-2010, I should be able to reduce the frequency and quantity of Stalevo and Sinemet.  (I also take 1/2 Sinemet 25/150 with each Stalevo, Mirapex 0.5 MG four times a day and Azilect 1.0 MG once a day).

It was immediately effective for my symptoms and I reversed about 4 years with my symptoms, virtually no symptoms.  I also take .5 mg of Mirapex with each dose.  I am now experiencing wearing off and feel under medicated, so will talk to my neuro about adjusting my medications.  This drug has given me a new lease on life.  I exercise 4 times per week, which helps with my symptoms and seems to help the drug work.

First symptons 1991.  Officially diagnosed 1997.  Stalevo has helped me get into an &quot;on&quot; situation almost every time I dose.  I have reached my saturation point with a max of 7 x 100mg a day.  If I stay active, I have found that I can stay &quot;on&quot; much longer.  I still work with the aide of an electric wheelchair.  I also take a 2mg Requip with each dose. and 75mg of Amytriptaline before bedtime.
