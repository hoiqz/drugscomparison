Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	25-34	1/6/2012 1:27:31 AM	I started taking this medicine at the mid range dose about a month ago and I noticed better sleep patterns and less obsessive behavoir. I even lost weight as I tend to be a comfort eater when stresed. That being said. the first week I had terrible dizziness and my sensitivty to alcohol was exponentially increased(a half glass of wine made me faint). The only persistent side effect has been severe constipation; the worst of my life. I'm going to give it another month and then switch if this doesn't go away.

Panic Disorder	Tony Michael, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	1	3	Male	45-54	7/26/2011 10:09:32 PM	Two months of many side effects like bad constipation to name one and stomach pain.  After that it worked, but it left me very very tired.  Also thirsty all the time.  Must watch diet or you will gain weight.  I drank lots of water.  I quit mainly because of the tiredness.  This one was a very hard one to start, so be careful and go up slowly or it might trigger a panic attack.

I was on several medications including zoloft and prozac.  They would work for a while but they usually made me sick.  Anafranil was absolutely wonderful after the few weeks it takes to build up in your system.  Even if you feel better never stop this medicine on your own. I made that mistake as a teenager and the OCD usually comes back full throttle.

I've been on it at 200mg daily for just over five years. It was very effective in treating my panic disorder and OCD symptoms, but I experienced all the side effects described above. The dry mouth is so bad I couldn't use my CPAP anymore. Over all I gained about 35 lbs that I could not lose not matter how hard I tried. I had constant thirst and excessive urination. My affect became flat and dull. I was rendered completely impotent. And over five years I was prescribed four other medications to treat the side effects. But I endured it all. Finally, after achieving some stability in my life, I am trying to get off it. It is a nightmare! I've been weaned off for five weeks, but the withdrawal effects are nasty: headaches; horrible depression (my worst ever); vivid, disturbing dreams; nausea. I've been essentially useless since I stopped. If I knew then what I know now, I never would have started taking it. It's side effects were horrible, and it's withdrawal effects are worse.

It is a wonder drug as far as OCD drugs go. There is no other BETTER DRUG OUT THERE FOR OCD!!! It is a miracle drug. I took it starting at age 9 and quit taking it at age 20 when I got pregnant with my 1st daughter . I didnt need the medication anymore after that, not sure why but I have been free from ocd for years and I no longer take any meds, however this is the one and only best drug for OCD!!!  : )

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	ocdgirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	8/19/2010 4:19:23 AM	When I first began taking Anafranil, I got really sick.  I stuck with it, and it is the only drug that helps me with my severe OCD.  The only side effect has been immense weight gain.  I never had a weight problem until I started taking this drug.
Anxious	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	7/31/2010 12:11:44 PM	The medicine gave me the worst side affects at first. I was sweaty, shakey, I had a terrible dry mouth, and no appetite.( I lost 12 pounds on it.) I was on it for a month and even though the side effects were bad, my anxiety was tolerable, and the OCD was nearly gone. HOWEVER, by the third week, I was so depressed that I scared myself and took myself off of it, which made me so sick for a few days. I wouldn't take this ever again.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	StaceyAmber, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/8/2010 4:45:33 PM	I have a terrible time with counting and checking things and I have found this works great. I had to give it time to work. I have been on it for two months now and I am very happy. I have had some side effects i.e. sweating, weight gain about 15 lbs, and twitching, But I would rather sweat, twitch and be a little heavier than COUNT and CHECK everything in my house before I left. Give it time it works!!! You will feel better. Watch your eating habits and get exercise. Happy Journey!!

I landed up in the ER needing to be catheterized. I don't think it is a common effect but it happened to me. I really loved this product too. It was really helping me sleep.

Not a good thing for me. I would like to know how other patients deal with it.

Anxiety, panic attacks are under control. Before I was extremely hyper to the point I had a bells palsy/stroke. My doctor started me on this. He monitors my condition very close. For me this medicine works.

Depression	Sweetcindylouwho, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	7/1/2009 6:50:23 PM	I have taken many other antidepressants over many years and have side effects with all I have tried, so I was excited about trying a different drug in a different drug category.  Initially I felt the Anafranil was beneficial and I tolerated it at the lowest dose ok but wasn't fully effective so my doc increased the dose (which was about a medium range dose).  When I hit about 3-4 days into my dose of 150mg daily I started noticing that the way I was feeling was likely due to this med.  I experienced SEVERE dry mouth with furrowing in my tongue making it uncomfortable to eat, cracks in the corners of my mouth - neither of these responded to hard candies, gum, mouth rinsing or drinking copious amts of water or other fluids.  Then I noticed I was way more jittery and anxious than usual and the worst was these random, nonpurposeful muscle twitches of varying levels on an increasing interval.  When I decided to taper myself off the med I might have twitched 20 times in 5 minutes - everything from a contraction of my little finger, followed by my hip twitching then my opposite shoulder ---- all over!  It was awful making my insomnia even worse.  I was tremulous, agitated, uncoordinated, confused thinking...I could go on.  I have been completely off it for 3 days (after a slow taper down) and still feel a bit irritable with rare twitching.  when I told my psych doc today about this = he says, &quot;yeah, some people get that jerking pretty bad&quot;.....no one told me it might happen  UGH!  But remember, just because it happened to me doesn't mean it will happen to you.  Every patient is different.
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	5	Female	45-54	5/16/2009 10:34:49 PM	I haven't seen much reduction in my OCD problems, but every time I sneeze, I have an orgasm!  And it's allergy season!  My doc says 5% of patients experience this side effect- but no one ever talks about it.  I LOVE it!  I will NEVER give up this drug!
Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	3/14/2009 1:58:09 PM	Excellent result for premature eyaculation, however take it around 11:00 Am Because the later you take it it might affect your erection.
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	35-44	3/3/2009 6:12:25 PM	To manage side effects I had to start at low dosis until my body got used. I have to sleep my hours to avoid sleepiness in day; I have to watch my weight, and exercise. I started to feel the real effects after taking the medicine for more than three months; I think that it made the full effect after six months. You must be patient to feel the liberating effects of Anafranil
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	45-54	2/4/2009 10:41:41 PM	Did not notice improvement in symptoms.  Had quite severe dry mouth and strong urine which I could not drink enough to dilute.  Nice that CVS pharmacy has blood pressure machines.  This medicine raised both numbers by about 15 points which put me at 1st stage hypertension and pulse rate as well.  Phychiatrist stopped this medication and tested me for ADHD.  I scored high on that test and medicine for that seems to be working.   I had been seeking treatment for insomnia for 2 yrs and had been on different depression medications.Keep working with your doctor!  Everybody has slightly different metabolism and mental illness symptoms often overlap.  When I drew this for my Dr he just smiled and showed me he used the same interlocking circles to describe to his patients.
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	ProjektRaCat, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	1/5/2009 6:55:33 PM	Took this medicine for 3 weeks when I was 16. I quit because the side effects were too much to handle. Just started taking it again a week ago. I haven't had any panic attacks or any OCD issues, however, my hands have been very shakey, my pupils have been dilated, I'm very fatigued, and keep getting headaches. I also spent one morning dry heaving. I'm going to give it a bit more time, but stay on the lowest dose to see if the side effects go away. It works... you just have to be able to tolerate the side effects.

Early on, the side effects of this medication were difficult to deal with - dry mouth, unbelievable appetite, sweating and sexual dysfunction. Over time, side effects diminished along with the symptoms. Currently, I am 18 years symptom-free and have been off the drug for the last 12!
Depression	suziehistory412p, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	1/6/2008 6:25:12 PM	I have trouble sleeping as I have major clinical depression, panic/anxiety disorder, and OCD. I took Benadryl but it only sedated me and I had night terrors. Anafranil at bedtime works like a charm. I think my other meds keep the side effects at bay.
Panic Disorder	BlueHedgehog, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	1/4/2008 11:48:59 PM	I took Anafranil to treat anxiety and phobias, and the side effects were too much for me to handle. I became very agitated and aggressive while on it. My friends nick-named it &quot;The Devil Drug&quot; because I acted so unlike myself while on it. I nearly attacked a kid at school with a math text book for making a bad pun, and almost went after the drama teacher with my scissors for messing up a costume I made. Considering that I have never even gotten near getting in a fight my whole life, I think it is safe to say it was the medication. Apparently this is a common side effect for pediatric patients--it sure drove me nuts.
