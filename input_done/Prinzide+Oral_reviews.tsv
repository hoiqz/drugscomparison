High Blood Pressure	Wasatch Front, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	1/14/2012 1:25:21 PM	Had to increase my first dose, but had started at smallest to see if it would work. Doubled my dose and it is working fantastic now!! BP at normal. Do get dizziness occasionally, fatigue a lot, and dry mouth with a super mild cough. I take my pills at night so I can just sleep through the worst of the dizziness. Now, as long as I am careful when standing or bending over, I am pretty much fine. Losing some weight and my doctor says we may be able to lower my dose soon. Not had any allergic type reactions, which is good because it is super easy for me to react to things.

Mine was down to normal with one week. The side effects are something you need to adjust to. I am very tired by afternoon, and I do experience some light-headiness. But overall, this medication has been very effective in lowering my blood pressure.

High Blood Pressure	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	4/25/2009 1:17:18 AM	This drug has given me no side effects.  I take the smallest dosage available and then take 1/2 tablet in morning and the other 1/2 at night.  That seems to keep my blood pressure level.

High Blood Pressure	jerry, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	4	Male	55-64	3/30/2009 2:26:55 PM	This medication has lowered my blood pressurewith only a slight increase in urination as a result. But it has only lowered it from a type to hypertension to a type 1. I am hopingthat an increase in exercise will lower itfurther.

High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/10/2008 4:24:17 PM	I've been on Prinzide 20-25MG for 6 months and it has been fabulous. When I started my blood pressure was 180/110.  Within the first month's checkup, it was down to normal limits.  A common side effect is a cough, which I did not have immediately but did experience a cough around 2-3 months of starting it, but it only lasted about a month and never really that disruptive.  
High Blood Pressure	VA girl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/7/2008 11:55:50 AM	I have been taking Diltaizem XT for about a year, but it was barely controllin my HBP.  I started taking Prinzine (10-12.5) about 6 months ago and my BP is great!  I had it checked the other day and it was 108/63!  I coughed some at first, but that disappeared. No other problems.
