Bipolar Depression	ckeise, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	45-54	5/16/2012 8:01:16 PM	I was doing great on the original GEODON but when I had to switch to the generic GEODON (insurance coverage)I began developing the same side effects as when I took ZOLOFT.  These effects are lower back pain, swollen breasts, and dehydration.  I got off the Zoloft and all side effects disapeared.  Now with generic GEODEN all the above came back.  Why?

However , over the past 3 years I&quot;ve gained 50#. I HAD to have sweets. I also have asthma , so this made the weight gain even worse for me. I tried Ziprasidone &amp; after about 2 weeks everything just went into place. I've been losing weight, I've got my energy back, and feel better all over. I do take meds for depression too , but this review is only for the ziprasidone. Give it a decent try...at least 2 weeks. If I had given up , I would still be fat &amp; even more depressed.

This medication really helps with the psychotic symptoms of my disorder like the delusions and the hallucinations. It also helps me sleep at night since I take it in the evening. I get blood draws every 6 months to keep an eye on my blood sugar levels. Am taking Geodon with Depakote ER, and Zoloft. Works great together. Actually feel productive and &quot;normal&quot; most days.

Although the results from the drug were working, I didn't like the weight gain.  My Dr. switched me to Geodon and it's worked well for me.  I've lost weight and my bi-polarism has been under control.  Although I still cycle, the cycles are shorter and not as severe.  The cost is expensive and taking with food are the only down side of this drug.
Schizophrenia	knife, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	2/3/2011 3:15:18 AM	I had years of ineffective meds. When prescribed geodon at a hospital it solved all of my diagnosis problems. I was raised to a place where negative thoughts didn't exist, I looked for fear and the resulting loss of control of thoughts and feelings and was glad to realize fear didn't come even when I was looking for it. Finally I felt pleasure which is hard to come by. It was my miracle drug until the Grand Mal seizure as a result of an allergy to the drug. I have suffered several years since and now take 6 meds. I wish there was a drug to take with the geodon to avoid the allergic reactions. Alternately I want to try Invegra.

It caused osteonecrosis in my hip(left one)and I had to have a hip replacement-which was botched!!! It also cause mydusplactic syndrome(I had to have 9 blood transfusions and almost died!!!). My hemotolgist confirmed it was caused from Geodon. Name of Dr. on request. Thank god I don't have mydusplactic syndrome!!! Geodon caused me to become severelt anemic and caused osteonecrosis...my hip my dying!
Other	nootropics, 35-44 Male  (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	35-44	11/1/2010 8:33:10 AM	Schizoaffective disorder.  Hospitalised against will 6 times due to psychosis and mania.  Medications used since 1997: mood stabilizers- lithium, valproate, lamotrigine; antipsychotics- risperidone, olanzapine, amisulpride, quetiapine, aripiprazole; antidepressants- venlafaxine, fluoxetine, reboxetine, paroxetine, mianserin all under close supervision of treating psychiatrist.  Results of ziprasidone monotherapy: only drug that works particularly for refractory bipolar depression and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  Concerns over lack of efficacy due to underdosing in clinical practice.  Small side-effect footprint so can be used for maintenance therapy.  Without this drug I would be facing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).  Currently taking 40mg morning and 120mg night (to better regulate sleep rhythms).  Ziprasidone has unique pharmacodynamic action in that it is like an antidepressant/mood stabilizer/antipsychotic rolled into one (dopamine/serotonin modulator plus serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor).  Can adjust dose to achieve required mood stabilization but can over-activate at lower doses (cause mania/hypomania).  Action on alpha 1 adrenoreceptors probably causes the cardiovascular side effects (vasodilation= reduced cardiac output=hypotension=dizziness) but this is minor compared with results.  QT interval overhyped.  Vastly improved energy, activation, mood and thinking.  Previously I had to abort medical studies due to illness.  After 7 years out of work, I have been able to return to study a Masters degree.  Remember people to SLOWLY do anything to do with dosing! (titrate over weeks/months).  Take REGULARLY (same time each day with food, don't miss).  Has no weight gain, good for blood lipids/sugars.  My turnaround in first month was remarkable; like an awakening.  Averaged 5 hours sleep but not manic.  Best I've been for 20 years.  If can't tolerate ziprasidone, next best is aripiprazole.  Try everything else, then try the best: ZIPRASIDONE!

Still no sleep. The Geodon has kept me from loosing weight. It makes me crave sweets when I get up so I keep gaining weight. I am thinking about getting off of it. I miss my ups. I'm tired of feeling so blah all the time. no fun without the highs. I don't miss the lows though at all. It has kept those away so I might just cut back on my mg. Have to talk to my Dr. about it. All in all it's a decent med for bi-polar manic depression. It deffinately helps stop hallucinations.

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	3/17/2010 11:28:40 PM	I am taking Pristiq 50mg for depression.  The psych decided to give me Geodon to boost Pristiq to help my depression as I am not getting complete relief with Pristiq.I took Geodon for a total of 4 days.  I was off from work all week because of Geodon.  The first 2 days I took 20mg and felt as if my equilibrium was off &amp; I was off-balance.  Also, for someone who goes to bed by 9:00pm every night, I was up until 1:00am all 4 nights, and even with 6 hrs of sleep, I felt fine the next day.  Everything about what I did and felt was out of character for me.  By the time I hit day 4, I was in the emergency room.  My blood pressure increased to 188/110, I had chest pain, and experienced a day-long panic attack.  It's been 2 weeks since I stopped taking Geodon and I still am experiencing chest pain.  My psych had me stop Geodon and now wants me to take Abilify.  He says that after Geodon, the chest pain I feel is a symptom of a manic episode.  Funny... I NEVER experienced a manic episode in my entire LIFE and it wasn't until I took Geodon that I did. I need to go see a regular MD to make sure there isn't any permanent cardiovascular damage, as I still feel awful.  This drug is dangerous in my opinion.  If your doctor prescribes this for you, be sure you are monitored VERY carefully.  This is not a drug you mess with at all.

Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	1	Female	13-18	3/5/2010 5:44:26 PM	So, I just started taking this last week for Bipolar. I was previously on a low dose of Abilify. And let me tell you, Geodon has made my moods so stable and I actually let things go with my mom when we fight. I used to fight with her every day, and they got really bad. But now I just let things go real easy. Thing is, the side effects are RIDICULOUS on me. It started with me not hearing my alarm in the morning and waking up late... only to still be in sleep mode for the next 4 hours. Ever woken up and you can't keep your eyes open because you're so tired? Multiply that by twelve and add puffy, bloodshot eyes. I still haven't woken up to a day where I'm not tired. And I'm usually really good with that kind of stuff. And the dizziness... oh my gosh. It's really bad. I've been on tons of medications for ADHD and Bipolar, never have I had side effects like this. Maybe I'm just that one case in a million...

Other	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	12/30/2009 12:20:57 PM	I was diagnosed with an unspecified mood disorder and prescribed Geodon in order to control my mood swings.  If it helped at all, it was because I slept throughout the entire day and was not mentally present in the hours that I was awake.  I struggled with debilitating exhaustion, inability to concentrate, involuntary head movements, and muscles seizing among many other adverse effects for several months. Finally, after having a small seizure during an exam, I decided enough was enough and gradually lessened the dosage over the period of a week until I wasn't taking any at all.  It took several weeks for the effects to wear off, and thankfully none of them have reoccurred.  But I would suggest extreme caution when deciding to take this drug.  In addition to being expensive and incredibly difficult to handle, it didn't seem to solve or treat the mood swings-- only knock me out to the point where I didn't have the wherewithal to feel much of anything.

I have had to overcome serious problems trying to get enough sleep(or even getting to sleep)with this medication. However I can say I have had real good success getting to sleep with the dietary supplement Melatonin. I cannot stress enough how much good this supplement has made for me-(better sleep, lots of energy, and especially a good mental outlook- feel great since I started taking Melatonin 5-10mg.( My naturalpath recommended this dosage and my doctor approved it too.

(I never hallucinated that much that intensely before I took it.) Then I started to get dizzy and my face would go numb as it wore off. I also would twitch and tense my leg muscles as I tried to relax. Over 4 months of taking it I became emotionally numb, very quiet, and distant from my family. I also required 9-10 hours of sleep at night. When I tried something else I was dizzy for three days like I was withdrawing from it. I don't know witch was worse the illness or the drug both hurt my house hold. Now I am taking seroquel 200mg to sleep and abilify 5mg in the morning. As of now (1 month)I have no noticeable side effects and I don't feel it &quot;wearing off&quot; like the geodon did.

Bipolar Depression	Glenl, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	7/6/2009 2:29:23 PM	One thing about this medication that I've researched is that it can produce low levels of magnesium and potassium (they work together). When this happens it can lead to shortness of breath, diareah,changes in mental status and irregular heartbeat. However you can have your doctor first check to see if you are low in magnesium, then , if you are low in magnesium, your doctor can prescribe the right kind of magnesium( pill supplement and food high in magnesium, such as spinach, almonds, cashews, soybeans, etc.) Then this approach, I think,  will work very well( as I have tried and seems to be working) . Another HUGE BONUS is that you do not gain weight on this medication! As a matter of fact , I was on Zyprexa , but on Zyprexa I gained 50 LBS.But on Zeldox , (ZIPRASIDONE-ORAL-only 20mg.) since I have been on it( 10 weeks), I have lost 20 lbs.

It has taken the doctor 3 months to put me on something for Bipolar. I nor the ones who know me and around me all the time think Im bipolar. Instead everyone including myself feel Im ADHD, I work with children with mental disorders,behavioral problems, and most are ADD/ADHD, so I think I know what Im talking about... The med is to expensive, going to the doc and counselor is exspensive I really think its all about the money and not my health. Geodon sucked the life out of me no one likes to be around me Im not fun I have no personality anymore. I take it at night but I can't function in the morning VERY SLEEPY. Im very zombie like. In bipolar(which I don't think I am) I experience hypomania the most so could it be more me being hyperactive as one would be with ADHD, yeah think so.  Im quit taking it and I will be back to my old self soon. Doctors are a big waste of time. Screw the labels I just want to get better and enjoy my life and have others around me enjoy me again... Its a joke considering my doc has spent a total of 5mins with me in 3 visits, but they are confident that Im bipolar. explain that... Very fed up...

Other	 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male		4/15/2009 4:53:44 PM	I know this may sound stupid. But a friend of mine well actally a crazy ex girlfriend of mine gave me the drug to sleep. Two days straight I had to go to the emergency room. I took one tablet and it made my facial muscles freeze to the side, my eyes roled to the back of my head. My jaw was stuck so far to the side that my gums started bleeding from my teeth pushing into them so hard. I started spitting blood. It was all so uncontrollable im just scared for my life right now. I thought I had serious brain damage. Luckily for me the symtoms wore off. But I dont know if they might come back or not. Im not bipolar and I dont have a mental illness. Taking this drug was the worst mistake of my life. And I was told it was a harmless medication for sleeping like seroquell. It ended up being a bleepin nightmare. This all happened to me yesterday and today. I went into the ER. My doctor is now telling me I need an MRI of my brain. I might have serious brain damage. All I can do is warn people out there. Before you take this consider the side effects. They are as serious as anything. Id rather be dead than experience that torment that this drug inflicted on me. 
Additional Medications to Treat Depression	Alexandra, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	4/9/2009 11:22:03 PM	Suffering from depression (which started from postpartum) for over 17 years, with many, many meds that did not work, one summer about 5 years ago, my therapist (not psychiatrist) suggested adding Geodon to my antidepressant. The therapist was thinking I had shades of being bipolar and this drug was starting to be used as a mood stabilizer. I thought it was a miracle. I felt like my real self again, happy, laughing and was even able to take my young daughter on a week-end trip. (The only time I've been well enough to take her anywhere.) I had no side effects, it was easy to take, but it stopped working after 3 months. I was crushed and back in the abyss again. In the last two years I have finally been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder. While it didn't work very long for me, I had one happy summer and I believe it could be very effective for others.

Like many, medication is just a part of my 'pie-chart', along with meditaion, eating good, exercise...but, what an important part.  Just remember to get regular check ups:blood test,cholesterol, etc. AND, I just read that Geodon is 1/2 effective if taken on an empty stomach.

It was hard to deal with at first because it makes you really sleepy if you do not eat with it.  I still get tired and take naps since I take it twice a day (and most people take it after supper).  But overall it has stopped my panic attacks.  I havent had one since I started it after my daughter was born.  I think it is a great med for bi-polar patients mainly if you have panic disorder.  I dont know what else it works for, but I take other things for depression and anxiety.  I was on 160 mg and have tapered down to 80 mg a day.  I tried going to 40 mg and my body couldnt deal with it.  I started having shortness of breath and I couldnt sleep so I am back to the 80 mg.  Hope this helps!

First off it made me feel really restless and feverish then on the third day I was taking it a had tardive dyskinesia which is a big word meaning I lost all control of my facial muscles as well as my tongue. I though I was going to swallow my tongue. I ended up hhaving to go to the ER to get a shot to counteract the reaction. I stopped taking the geodon immediately.

Schizophrenia	Victor, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Male	25-34	9/14/2008 5:11:05 PM	Yes, this medicine has been very effective when nothing else worked, but after 5 years I got excruciating headaches starting early in the year.... NONSTOP~!  After exhausting the ER with a trip a month and my Doctor's comprehensive tests, which showed nothing, we came to the conclusion that Geodon may be the culprit.  Have reduced meds slowly from 180 a day (topped at 200/day for a short period) down to 80, headaches are still there!  No one told me the consequences of getting off this stuff.  On top of the headaches, dry heaves, body aches, muscle jerking, it's been hell so far.  My Doctor (primary physician) has been researching this drug non stop and we hope to find an end to the pain.  My Psych doctor can't understand what I'm talking about, she's not heard of weaning off this drug being so difficult.  I know it's not just me.  So far tho I'm adjusting to the upper doses of Seroquil to compensate for the Geodon and it's taking care of the mental issues for which I'm grateful.However, everyone MUST be warned about the incredible difficulty PHYSICALLY getting off this drug.  Had I know it would be this painful and difficult I might have preferred the mental issues to dealing with this severe chronic pain every day.Good luck and think twice about using this drug.

I just have to time my dose right and I get a good night's sleep. It's really helped slow down the racing thoughts and reduces the anxiety/lack of focus/insomnia that those thoughts cause. My doctor hasn't officially diagnosed me yet, but I'm just glad to find something that works after years of trying antidepressants.

Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	25-34	8/16/2008 2:04:29 PM	First off, I'd like to start by saying that in many instances, mental illness is very hard to diagnose hence the &quot;other&quot;.  To get to the point, I have mood &amp; thinking issues maybe part bipolar or part schizoid or some combination.  Geodon / Ziprasidone is a good medicine.  I have had better results, though, with a newer drug called Invega / Paliperidone.  They work very similarly and are in the same class of drugs.  The biggest difference, I think, is that Invega uses technology that lets the drug be released over a 24 hr period which helps manage symptoms better.  Due to the difficulty in diagnosint mental illness, I think in many cases people need to try combinations of drugs untill they find what works best.  I am on Invega 6 mg (switched from Geodon), Depakote ER 1500 mg, &amp; Cymbalta 60 mg.  I think of it as attacking coexisting problems from multiple directions to be free or close to free of symptoms.  Good luck with your treatment..  Remember, Geodon is good but ask about Invega.

I have been taking Geodon 80mg twice daily for years.  It is pretty effective at controlling my psychotic symptoms, anger, fear, etc. The only side effect I have noticed is that is makes me fall asleep. I've tried lower doses but symptoms came back. The sleepiness is intense and unpredictable. I often have to pull over the car if I'm driving because of it. After a short nap I'll be okay. The episodes of passing out made me lose my last job. Overall the side effect (sleep) controls my daily activities. Pretty rotten, but better than being controlled by a Demon.
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	35-44	5/23/2008 1:09:05 PM	My Dr. started me off with 80 mgs at night &amp; 80 mgs in the a.m.  It has controlled my manic episodes but I don't know if I can stay on the drug due to side effects (My Dr. even reduced my dosage to 60 mgs at night &amp; 60 mgs in the a.m.).  I am extremely tired all the time, my muscles seem to move by themselves (like restless leg syndrome), &amp; it makes me feel like a zombie.  I miss my happy/funny personality.  With this drug, there are no ups or downs, I just feel &quot;nothing&quot;.

I've been depressed, but that's not what Geodon is trying to prevent.  I don't have any side effects.  I hope it works well in the long-run.

I don't have any side effects that I'm aware of. My doc sometimes has to adjust the anti-depressants that I take.  But the Geodone really helps me a lot with paranoia and the manic, angry side of this condition.

I have been taking it for two years now for my bi polar disorder, I'm hypo manic and it manifests itself in shopping of all things. And the Geodon really works for me because it controls my spending thousands of dollars on things I absolutely do NOT need. It helps me sleep too.
