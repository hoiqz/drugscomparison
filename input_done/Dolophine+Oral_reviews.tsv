Pain	gomeril, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	4/3/2011 4:20:07 PM	Despite 5 surgeries and countless &quot;injection treatments,&quot; I continue to experience severe neck pain. For the first 10 years, I resisted the use of any opiods until I was totally exhausted and no longer tough enough to &quot;grin and bear it.&quot; Of course, my pain treatment did not begin with Methadone and it wasn't until Oxycontin was no longer effective that Methadone was even suggested. Although I continue to seek and pray for non-drug alternatives to managing my pain, aside from the frustrating weight-gain, Methadone seems to have fewer side effects than other opioid. For example, at the prescribed dose I've never found it to be significantly mind-altering, which is a tremendous blessing for those of us who still need/want to have our wits about us. In fact, if it is mind-altering, it's most commonly the result of over-usage. I have also found that on those &quot;mysterious&quot; days when I have little or no pain, I can freely skip it without adverse reactions. I have recently enjoyed long-term, measurable decreases in my pain level from Radio-Frequency Nerve Ablations. During the 12-16 months it takes for the nerves to regenerate, I find I can reduce my methadone use by about 30% and I never have any difficulty with abruptly reducing my dosage. Additionally, I have never required an increased dosage, something I cannot claim with any other opioid. Since Methadone was originally developed for the treatment of pain, it's unfortunate it's become stigmatized by it's use in treating heroin addicts. That stigma is often projected onto pain patients, which just adds insult to our injuries. However, the superior effectiveness of Methadone, combined with it's more tolerable side-effects makes it a valuable component in the management of long-term pain. For the sake of everyone with chronic pain who can benefit from Methadone, I'll continue to pray it's reputation as a safe &amp; effective pain management medication is eventually restored.
Pain	Back Hertz, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	6/2/2010 11:01:41 AM	I was prescribed the drug 2 years after a major spine surgery involving a disc removal. It changed my life, I was relatively pain free for the first time in 2+ years. The pain clinic was later closed. My new pain doc doesn't beleive in prescribing methadone(damn the stigma). I'm now using vicodin at a ridiculous dose and am high all the time(which I hate). My new meds don't lessen the pain but make it a bit easier to live with. I miss methadone for all the right reasons. For me hands down the best/longest lasting pain med on the market and I have tried them all.    
Pain	willum, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	5/16/2010 10:56:07 AM	I have had severe pain after neuro surgery 14 years ago. I was given Oromorph ( morphine liquid )which increased over the years to over 300mg a day! I had to get off it as it runs your life and you become dependant rapidly. It is a horrible drug to get off. I went to Methadone and take a relatively small liquid dose once a day. It is just remarkeable! No feeling of being drugged, it stops the pain and I feel so much better. I thank God for this as by now I am sure I would have ended my life. My thoughts are that the people that have problems with it tend to abuse it. If this is the point then you should see a pain specialist and re-evaluate you.

All I can say is both will turn you into a addict. Run out of either and you will want to die. I have been searching site for the how to get off. Noewhere to be found. I know getting off will mean pain. Both will ruin your teeth and I have found that it will kill your sex drive by lowering testosterone levels.These drugs would be wonderful if you could stop them. Unlike cigerettes instead of feeling anxious you will feel like the worst flu of your life. its like being tortured.If anyone has gone through getting off let me know
Pain	Jim, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/12/2009 3:59:57 PM	I just wanted to state that I am tired of people bashing methadone. I have had arthritis (AS) since the age of 17. When I was introduced to methadone 4 years ago by an orthopedic surgeon it is the first time in my life I had true relief from the continuous pain being inflicted on me.  If people are dying it is because they are not following their doctors directions or they are abusing the drug. I am so tire of seeing the DEA take liberties by suppressing the use of the 40 mg tablets due to peoples stupid, half-witted, actions. Please don't get me wrong I don't like seeing people die from overdosing, but they are doing it to themselves. Every person knows AND I MEAN KNOWS that they should not take something that wasn't prescribed to them, yet people continue on this trend.  I don't know the solution to the problem, but preventing people who treat the drug with the utmost respect that it deserves from taking it to receive relief from severe and deafing pain is not the solution either.  It is unfortunate that people haven't learned how extremely dangerous it is to try and take a drug like methadone to get high when you can't get high on the drug to begin with. It only relieves pain for people that have pain. All it will do for someone that doesn't have pain is kill them or put them in a coma.  To any one who plans on trying this drug to get high on please don't. Smoke some grass if you want to get high. Don't kill yourself and cause people like myself and others that suffer from diseases and accidents from getting the relief we need.Thank You Jim
Pain	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	55-64	11/14/2009 6:18:49 PM	After 5 years of intense pain due to chronic pancreatitus my dr prescribed methadone which has given me a new lease on life.  Although before high doses of morphine or oxycontin had little effect when I started taking the methadone I was a close to painfree as I have been since this all started.  I realize that it is very addicting and the withdrawel horrendous but the chance to live a semi normal life now is worth anything I might have to face later.  It is not always easy to fill the rx and they treat you badly when they see what it is for but it is a shame more drs. and the medical care in general do not understand pain and what it can do to your life.
Pain	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	11/12/2009 6:14:12 PM	having a high tolerance, the medication was perfect. I had tried vicoden even in it's 10mg form and i'd have swallow 3 to 4 at a time every 4-6 hours. That's a lot of pills. With dolophine i did'nt recieve a narcotic type lull. I was able to preform all of my duties and sleep exceptionaly well.

I just want to rest. caught myself on the edge of sleep in church, No appetite,occasionally feel a bit disoriented. Best not to drive  the first week of taking as did  not been entirely cognizant at every moment.  However, the pain is 100 percent better then the morphine 30mg

I experienced a fractured vertabrae leading to a multitude of back and hip problems and after years on oxycontin my Dr. put me on methadone for both maintainence and pain. The withradrawal was absolutely horrid. There is no easy way to get off this drug without swapping it for an equally addictive alternative. Do not start this therapy unless absolutelty necassary. You become way to dependant.
Pain	equilibrium, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	5/13/2009 2:37:25 AM	This medication is much better than the Dilaudid and Fentanyl I was taking as it brings me back down to earth, where the other medications were less effective with more psychological side effects. Thi medicine really works well for pain all around, without the narcotic shock instances of other opiods for pain
Pain	ROK, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/21/2009 12:52:21 PM	I gave this med 5 stars, but I want off of it. I've been on 100mgs for over 6 years working up to that dose from 10mgs. I started to reduce my dosage and got down to 20 mgs. I hit the bottom rung and my pain level went sky high. Well I really had a hard time with my neck pain at 40mgs, but wanted off of this drug. I contribute my Gallbladder problems and my bad teeth on this drug. My PCD wants me to stay on this drug and to up my dose to where it &quot;Masks&quot; the pain again. I asked for something else to control my pain, but he said this is about the best there is. I tried all the other stuff, I even became &quot;addicted&quot; to Oxycontin and other narcotic pain relievers. I also used Morphine for breakthrough pain, but weaned myself off of it without my Dr knowing it. I just want to live narcotic free, but don't think that's possible. Sometimes I wish I could close my eyes and never wake up, but I know that's not possible at this time. That's my experience with this drug, oh that and trying to get it refilled is a PITA!!!!!!!!
Pain	cjv, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	35-44	1/30/2009 11:35:48 PM	I have take Methadone for chronic back pain. I was on oxy-contin, but really became too fond of the way it made me feel. My dosage has increased regularly over the years, which my doctor says is common w/ opiates. I am on 220mgs daily, divided into 3 doses. It can be difficult fulfill Rx's, not every pharmacy carries much of it. I have had to be without it for a day or two, and by the 2nd day the withdrawl starts &amp; you feel quite bad. But this is the best solution, considering the pain I was in &amp; the depression that comes w/ it, left me unable to function. I don't feel like I took anything at all as far as euphoria goes so I feel safer on it. I do become more tired than usual. I recommend this drug highly.   
Pain	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	10/28/2008 7:25:43 PM	i have been rear-ended while driving too many times to count. my spine is damaged &amp; degen from top to bottom. i was given everything from naprosyn to a combo of 200mg ultram &amp; 3200mg vioxx daily for about 2-3 years. with methadone i can function again, after 5 years of use i am addicted to the same 10mg as when i started. on days when the pain intensifies i will take up to 30mg (but, will avoid driving). i never have stomach problems due to usage, i have not become a &quot;junkie&quot; and can in fact function at a high level of competency. if i have to take up to 30mg for a couple of days, i will decrease the dosage over a 3 day period. common sense?  this medication is for me, a blessing.

Pain	Jamie, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	9/28/2008 5:14:12 PM	I have incredible pain from degen. disk, worsening arthritis in both hips, extreme arthritis in rt. shoulder, entire arm, wrist &amp; hand (all had severe injuries in the past) I went up the ladder of pain meds to Morphine, and the pain was still enough to keep me exhausted, really lacking motivation, &amp; flat in bed several days a month at least. Recent change to Methadone/Dolophine has given me a new lease on life!  MUCH more effective pain management, and gone is the relentless exhaustion. I am sleeping better at night, more active and motivated in the day, and enjoying substantial reduction in pain.  No (bad) side-effects at all. Bottom line, I guess, is that I have renewed interest in Life!!

If not for Dolophine perhaps I would not be here it saved my life!
Pain	fatcat, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	9/30/2007 9:41:11 PM	This is the only long -lasting pain medication that has worked for my severe chronic pain and small nerve neuropathy. In my opinion it out lasts any other pain medication that is on the market even newly approved medication by the FDA.
