Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	9/23/2012 7:24:16 PM	Took this for what turned out not to be inner-ear related dizziness.  Accordingly, it did not help anything, which was the doctor's fault, not the drug's. However, when removing the patch after only 1.5 doses, I went through awful, awful withdrawal. I was terribly sick and having what I can only describe as &quot;bad trips&quot; like you'd see in movies like &quot;Less than Zero.&quot;  I've never been so sick or so scared. I filed a complaint with the FDA. Stay away from this.

Motion Sickness	Waiting, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	5/16/2012 9:53:56 AM	Like everyone else, I am having  the same side effects from removing the patch I'm very sick.  It has been four days since I removed the patch, and I still feel sick, shaky, tired, etc.  A friend of mine who had used this after an ear surgery to correct vertigo had terrible reactions after removing the patch, so she came up with her own solution:  she cut the patch into smaller pieces to ween herself off it slowly.  It worked.  I will never use this drug again.

I get nauseous and usually get a migraine when traveling. It lasts for days and ruins the whole trip. Now I put a patch on 3 hours before I go, and take it off when I arrive. I do the same for the return trip. I do feel a bit thirstier for that day, but have had no other side effects. I love this. I couldn't travel comfortably without it!
Prevention of Motion Sickness	Caribbean Cruiser, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	35-44	4/10/2012 12:06:58 PM	Took this drug to prevent sea sickness on a 7 day cruise.  Used as directed and had no serious serious side effects on the cruise.  I did experience blurred vision, dilated pupils and dry mouth as warned.  The real problems did not start until 24 hours after the patch was removed.  Terrible nausea and headache began and lasted for over 2 days.  Still not back to normal yet.  Although it helped with the prevention of seasickness, I don't think I will use the patch again.
Motion Sickness	jenny, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	4/1/2012 6:48:25 PM	These patches worked very well for me on a recent trip that included small airplane rides, a choppy small boat ride, a long diesel bus ride and a rocky ferry ride, all of which have been known to give me notion sickness. I felt great through it all and will use them again! I didn't notice any side effects worth mentioning. The only problems with regard to the patches were that my health insurance refused to pay for them and they seem to be in short supply so I had to shop around to find a drugstore with 4 patches, the amount that I needed for the rip.
Prevention of Motion Sickness	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	3/25/2012 9:16:46 AM	I have been using this patch for years to prevent motion sickness. It has always been very effective in preventing the sickness. I do experience the blurred vision (pretty severely actually) and have extremely enlarged pupils.  It's frustrating because I can't read anything but to me I'd rather not be seasick so I've dealt with the blurred vision. However, when I got back from my last cruise, I took off the patch and hours later started vomiting for several hours and felt extremely dizzy and sick to my stomach.  I almost felt sea-sick only worse. It lasted for about 24 hours. I've never experienced this before but I'm not sure I'm going to be using this patch again. 
Motion Sickness	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	1/5/2012 1:58:50 PM	I get extreme motion sickness to the point of where Bonine doesn't even touch it. I went on a road trip to the mountains with a friend for a four day weekend. I was a passenger in a car and we went to the mountain. This drug worked great while up on the mountain but within 24 hours of returning home, I have been completely bed bound with severe dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, headache, upset stomach, and am on the verge of vomiting. This drug is horrible; I will never take it again. People should be warned of the side effects of this medication. I hope this wears off before I have to return to normal activities.

I removed it after 2 days.  I have been nauseous, and dizzy with blurred vision for 8 days and counting. I cannot perform daily activities. Have to sit or lay still to keep from throwing up.

Motion Sickness	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	11/26/2011 8:25:46 AM	I used this patch for extreme dizziness and vertigo related to migraines.  There were no warnings on the package.  I still felt dizzy while wearing it, and began to feel a bit anxious.  I wore for 36 hours.  24-48 hours after removal, all heck broke loose.  I thought I was dying with a 3 day panic attack, vertigo, dizzy, horrible headache, tingling all over and extremely fatigued.  I had to miss Thanksgiving with my family.  The worst part was I thought it was me until I researched it on the web.  DO NOT WEAR THIS PATCH.  I would rather spin and puke for days.   It has been 5 days since removal and I am still feeling bad.

Prevention of Motion Sickness	HappyTraveller, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	9/5/2011 9:11:55 PM	I used this to prevent motion sickness on a cruise but ended up taking the patch off after 24 hours as I felt terrible.  It made me incredibly thirsty and gave me an unbelievably sore throat to the point that I almost lost my voice.  I've had strep throat that was less painful and 5 days after taking the patch off, my throat is still a little sore.  I don't know if it stopped the motion sickness as the seas were relatively calm, but it would have to be incredibly rough seas for me to try this again. 
Motion Sickness	35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1		35-44	8/21/2011 4:31:18 PM	I took this for motion sickness on a deep sea fishing trip. I put the patch on the night before the trip and within 4 hours of putting it on I started getting side effects. Dry mouth, dizziness, could not sleep, and difficulty breathing. I took the patch off and within a few hours felt normal 4 days later I was in the ER with sever simptoms of heart attack and stroke. After 6 hours in the ER and a clean bill of health still could not figure out what was wrong. My doctor finally figured out that it was the side effects from this patch. 2 weeks later I now get weird heart beats, my heart rate has slowed down, I feel nauscous, my mind gets cloudy, my legs go numb, and my moods will change. I would never recommend this to anyone EVER. This is the weirdest scariest feeling ever and it has cost me nearly 10k in hospital bills to find out I'm not dying and it is side effects from this product that could last who knows how long. Did not take this product, it is not worth it!!!
Motion Sickness	jaq, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	7/29/2011 2:51:27 PM	I was prescribed this patch by my physician before leaving on a 5 day cruise in the Galapagos.  I put it on the first day on the boat.  On the 2nd or 3rd day, I experienced psychosis.  I could not recongize if I was dreaming or awake.  It took great will power not to completely freak out.  Since discontinuing use, 5 days now, my vision is blurred, I feel sea sick and am extremely tired.  Does anyone know how long this will last??  I also had my period when using this patch...  just called my doctor...

This was a 16 hour trip. I still got sea sick. Got very dizzy on the boat whenever I stood up or laid down. Took off patch immediately after coming ashore. Still dizzy with stomach ache 3 days later. This is an awful drug. DO NOT USE!

The side effects are worse than the condition it is supposed to treat.  Where is the FDA?  I have suffered for several days now with a disconnected, dizzy, drowsy, stumbling around, frightened and altered consciousness. My stomach is upset stomach, there is a nasty metal taste in my mouth and I can't stop shaking.  I wish I had just dealt with post surgical nausea and never been subjected to this horrid drug.  Please, do not accept this patch on anyone's advice.  Anesthesiologists get real!  You should be required to test this patch yourselves before you recommend one to your surgical patients!  BAD CHOICE!
Prevention of Motion Sickness	Lynn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	7/16/2011 2:08:09 PM	I used this medication to go on a fishing trip in the Gulf of Mexico.  I had been previously very ill and got a scrip from my dr. so that I could enjoy a day out with my family.  I put the patch on only 2 hours prior to the trip.  It was very choppy and I had no problems with getting sick.  I thought this was the miracle drug I was looking for.  We were planning on going out the next day so I left the patch on.  During the night I woke up with extreme dry mouth.  I was very disoriented and my teenage son could not get me to respond in a coherent way.  I was wandering around not knowing why.  I finally went back to bed, the next morning I was still very dizzy and feeling out of it so I took the patch off. It took me a couple of days to completely feel normal again.  I still feel that my concentration is not 100%.  This is a very scary drug.  I have very little recollection of waking up that night and am very upset about my children seeing me in this condition.  Please be careful if you use this drug.  I am 48 years old and have not had a period in 2 years.  I don't think with me it is hormone related.  
Prevention of Motion Sickness	Sue in Georgia, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	7/9/2011 11:35:31 PM	I have used this patch for over 10 years for traveling and also during multiple surgeries, which it works terrific for. I probably use the patch 4 to 5 times a year. This is my problem and I don't know if it is patch related. For the past two years I have experianced a pain in my left ear, behind my ear and left jaw....at times severe. This is the ear I always put the patch behind because I am left handed... Doctors can find nothing wrong with my ear or my teeth, mouth etc.....I am questioning now if the medication in this patch and how often I use them is not causing some problem causing this pain. Just a thought as the pain is getting worse....
Prevent Nausea and Vomiting After Surgery	Kathy, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		7/7/2011 4:48:46 PM	My mother was given this medicine for nausea after hip surgery. It caused a severe reaction after only 2 days use. She was hallucinating, speaking to people who weren't there, slurring her words and could not remember where she was for more than a few minutes at a time. I would not recommend this medicine for anyone who has high blood pressure or severe allergic reactions to metal or other medications. It's not worth the risk.

The dizziness never stopped and on top of it my vision blurred, my pupils dilated, my body was very itchy, couldnt sleep and felt very &quot;fuzzy&quot;.

Motion Sickness	alwayscarsick, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/30/2011 9:05:20 AM	I have used this product for over 20 yrs.  Minus the time it was off the market (which was awful for me). I have used this product with great success.  To all of those who have had the awful side effects upon removal I am truly sorry for your experience.  However, as with any prescription medication there are risks.  If you are considering this medication I would recommend trying it before you NEED it.  I have found over the yrs that cutting the patch in 1/2 has decreased if not eliminated all of the side effects including the ones upon removal. Also, I would highly recommend starting off slowly.  Using it for a day, removing and then again later for a couple of days.  If you are needing relief immediately and don't have time to ease yourself into a (prescription medication) like this then try 1/2 the patch but follow the directions and place on the skin 4 or more hours before you travel.  Use a moisture eye drop for dry eyes and a throat lozenge for the dry mouth &amp; throat. ie: Halls fruit breezers or something.  I find gum also helps.  This is a highly effective product but as with all prescription medications care should be taken. My own motion sickness is very severe.  I do not enjoy travel of any kind.  Even a trip across town in the passenger seat is awful.  With this product I can enjoy traveling even time on our boat!  I DO NOT over use this product though and do not enjoy taking medication of any kind.  But with that said this is the only product that has ever worked and believe me I have tried EVERYTHING! I wish you luck and relief from motion sickness.  
Prevention of Motion Sickness	SpartanDiva, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/25/2011 12:05:54 PM	I used the patch on my first cruise. After I took it off I experienced intense dizziness and was in bed for 2 days, I am still rocking and swaying.  After reading all the reviews I will never use the patch again, although on the ship it was great.  I would encourage other sufferers to look at Mal de Debarquement Syndrome, this decribes exactly what I am experiencing.  www.mddsfoundation.org, I am currently seeking treatment with an ENT Dr. and an acpuncture dr. I have worked for the last 3 days at about 50% capacity.  Wish I had read about the patch before I left.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	2/18/2011 11:23:13 PM	My MD prescribed this medication after I got a sudden case of Vertigo they think was caused by an inner ear drum disturbance. I should have read the warnings before taking this. Extreme dry mouth, blurry vision, and both pupils fully dilated. I also noticed that my lips were red and my legs also turned red as if I had been sunburned. I am so mad that my MD would prescribe this medication considering it's side effects are the exact thing I was trying to get rid of. I took the patch off as soon as I realized the symptoms I was experiencing were caused by it. I believe my dizziness wore off on it's own, no thanks at all to the patch. 
Prevention of Motion Sickness	sea shell, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/7/2011 8:33:03 AM	I have used this patch on numerous cruises and I also wore it for 3 days at Universal Studios in Florida so I could unjoy all the rides. The only side affect I ever have is a little dry mouth. This is easily resolved by dinking plenty of water, or eating fruit, something I do anyway. I had a glass of water by my bed at night, in case I woke up thirsty. Once I got home, I removed the patch and I never had anything adverse effects happen. I felt perfectly fine each time. I have been on cruises up to 10 days with it and am going on a 14 day one soon. I highly recommend this and hope it's always available for use. LOVE IT!!
Motion Sickness	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	65-74	1/9/2011 2:39:50 PM	I am suffering with dizziness and motion sickness. Doctor prescribed patch to help eliminate the dizziness. I have been using these for three weeks. They seem to work well. Dizziness reduced and sometimes barely noticeable. Side effects: dry mouth but that's all. Patch has helped reduce the dizziness, but not entirely. I would rate this as somewhat effective, and the cost is reasonable: about $10 per patch.

Other	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	65-74	12/4/2010 2:24:29 PM	I was prescribed the patch from my doctor for my ear infection.  It was a little strange he did not prescribe any antibiotics for the ear infection.  My doctor only told me not to touch my eye after placing the patch behind my ear.   My eyes dilated right away.  Then starting the second day, my mouth got very dry, my eyes got dilated enough I could not see very much.   It messed up my thinking, didnt care what I was doing.  Changed my mood to make me feel like a zombie, moving around not knowing what I was doing.  I always know what day to put my trash out and this patch had me so messed up I did not even know what day it was and put my trash out on the wrong day.  I got weak especially my knees, and I did not have any strength.  I could not breathe very well.  My stomach was bloated, had gas, lower part of my stomach hurt below my belly button.  It affected me in almost every way I could think of.  I called my son because I felt like I was going out of my mind and told him I need to talk to someone about what is happening to me.  Talking to him helped me get my mind back enough to decide to go to the doctor.  I wore the patch about eight days.  I went to see the doctor and he pulled the patch off right away.  My doctor did not warn me about any symptoms.  Two days after removing the patch the symptoms started slowly going away.  Now I am on my 3rd day without the patch and I am starting to feel about back to normal.  This time he prescribed me some antibiotics.

I've used a patch routinely for about the last 9 years on an annual cruise and thought nothing of it. This time, I vomited the first morning even though the seas didn't appear to be especially rough. Was sick about 4 hours. Then, I experienced headaches for the first two days. For the first time ever, when the cruise ended and I removed the patch, I felt seasick. About 18 hours after removing it, I felt depressed, headachey, nauseous and wanted to sleep. Took a few days to get out of my system. After all these years, I'm done with the patch and not sure what I'll do for my next cruise or if there will be one. Could aging have something to do with the after effects of this patch since I never had this in the past? Now I'm afraid to use it and afraid not to.

The patch has always helped enormously and the only side effect have been a very dry mouth.  Only once have I had the misery after returning from a cruise described elsewhere - awful.  Therefore, I am wondering whether to abandon the use of the patch on the next cruise.

Apply one patch every three days,and switch sides. read directions and wash hands after applying the patch each time. Had a great time n not an ounce of sickness. When vaction was over I had NO problems after removing the patch, no dizziness vommitting nothing, not even swaying like i was still on the ship. Great product won't go crusing without it. This was my 3rd cruise out of NY. My pupils were dialated and I had dry mouth a bit.  Vision looking down was a little blurry but no big deal. REMEBER:::: one patch at a time. Hope this helps.

First time for a 5 day cruise and then 7 day cruise the following year.  It prevented me from being seasick but I had terrible dry mouth and vertigo during the cruises and for the week after I returned.  However,  I've also had terrible vertigo after a day of fishing  on a 15' boat so I don't know if the vertigo is from the patch or the rocking of the boat.  I don't think I'll be taking another cruise.

Although I am using pain meds to help control pain,lately it has not been well managed to the point that I am constantly sick to my stomach and vomiting. I started this medication to help cope with the nausea, but an hour after applying the patch I started getting stabbing pain radiating on the side of my neck where the patch was applied. Along with that I have also had wretched headaches, but no more stomach upset.  I am just hoping the pain in my neck and head begins to dissipate.

Was given overdose of Scop. patch ( used approx. 4 weeks). In other forms I discovered the meds in patch were used for truth serum in WW I or II, and is used in the date rape drug. I have significant memory loss issues today (2 years later) which have been confirmed by the doctor. They will not link the patch to the medical problems but I am certain it caused my problems. I was hospitalized from my Vertigo and could not count past 3 with the meds I was given. I did not drive for almost 3 months. i will never use this medicine again and believe it causes memory loss or brain functionaly issues.

I couldn't focus at all. I removed the patch and in about 12 hrs my vision returned to normal. I had used the patch on 2 prior cruises with no issues so I feared something else was wrong with my eyes. Fortunately it was just a side effect of the patch which I would not use again.

I have been using this for 1 years.  It is easy to apply, lasts for 3 days and the only side effect I have had is a dry mouth (countered by chewing some gum and keeping hydrated).  If I am on a trip where I fly back within the three day, I keep the patch on for the entire trip.  If not, I remove it as soon as I land and then put a new patch on 3 hours (or the night before) my return flight.

I didn't have any problems while wearing it. I noticed the next day however, that I was feeling very weak and a bit nauseated. After I drank a bunch of water, I felt much better within a few hours. I'm heading to Hawaii now next week and am questioning if I should use the patch again based on the reviews here. Especially since I will need the patch for a much longer time period.
Motion Sickness	nickydizzy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	6/4/2010 12:31:13 PM	I had been suffering from dizziness and lightheaded issues for about a month...my doctor decided to try the patch along with Meclizine.  I put the patch on first and had a severe reaction 3-hours later...my left eye start to itch and my lip became swollen...I took the patch off immediately.  I was given a steroid shot atarax and zantac 150...I am so glad I had the immediate reaction based on the reviews...I leave soon to go on 7-day cruise I hoping to be well for my cruise and do not want any issues afterwards...I think I'll stick to dramamine...it has work while cruising.
Motion Sickness	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	35-44	5/29/2010 7:27:06 AM	I have to travel on a ship for my work, usually in 4 day stints. The first time i ever went out I got terribly sea sick. The second time I went out my dr. prescribed this patch for me. It works great - no nausea/vomiting, and only slight drowsiness. The problem i have had with it is with blurred vision. After the second day, i can no longer focus my eyes. I can see things, but just not up close. It usually takes 2-3 days after removing the patch for the blurred vision to go away. I still use the patch when i go out to sea (since my dr. says just about everything else will cause the same side effect, or just not work) but i just can't read while i'm out there.

This drug has been around in various forms for a very long time and works well for most people, me included. But like any medication, side effects often vary from person to person and depending on the circumstances.  I have used this product for many years -- mainly for motion sickness but also it has been prescribed to me pre-operatively for every surgery I've ever had.  I have had the &quot;dry mouth&quot; side effect and sometimes a little bit of blurry vision (especially if I don't wash my hands well after I apply it) but for me the benefits outweigh the side effects.Talk to your doctor if you have side effects and talk to your doctor (not your travel agent) about its appropriateness for you and your situation.

The patch didn't seem to help but I used it faithfully as the doctor did recommend it's use. I stopped when the package ran out and now all my symptoms have come back severely. What's up with that? The world is spinning and long hall ways appear to mountains, my balance is worse, and of course this makes me nauseated. Help...is it the patch or my first illness? See another specialist Monday.

I used the patch when I was working on fishing boats. The only side effect was that it gave me &quot;the munchies&quot; the first day after putting it on. It wasn't sufficient to prevent seasickness for the motion of the small boats so I used meclizine daily while leaving the same patch on for 5 or 6 days before taking it off. I didn't put a new on one because the meclizine was effective. After stopping the meclizine I experienced insomnia for 24 hours. 
Prevention of Motion Sickness	Carrie, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	55-64	2/22/2010 11:27:57 PM	I took this drug to prevent motion sickness while traveling that included several plane trips and a short cruise, total trip 12 days.  I had used it about ten years ago for a cruise and don't remember this side effect.  When the trip was over and I removed the last patch, I became dizzy and nauseous within 48 hours.  I have now experienced decreasing dizziness over the last 3 days and hope to be normal by tomorrow.  I will not use this drug again and would caution others about this unmentioned side-effect that happens after you stop using the drug.

Prevention of Motion Sickness	emmalou, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	1/29/2010 4:27:27 PM	I have terrible motion sickness and I had not flown for 10 years due to this condition. I decided to take a trip to Italy with a friend and used the patch on a recommendation from friends. I did NOT obtain a prescription but got the patches from a relative. But i am sure my doctor would have prescribed it for me, because he was totally surprised when I told him about my reaction.The flight was effortless I felt great. I spent the next 10 days traveling on busses and in the back of a car on windy roads. I NEVER would have survived without the patch which I replaced every 3 days. A few days into the trip I did notice my vision became very blurry. I was unable to read anything without reading glasses.But I did not consider this debilitating enough to stop using the patch. At the end of the trip we planned 2 days in Rome where I removed the patch because I did not plan on any other transportation but walking. About halfway through the first day i began to feel dizzy. I thought it was the heat. But by that evening I was flat on my back in the hotel unable to move. IMy traveling companion was a pharmacist- but she never made the connection until we read the list of side effects. I put another patch on and was ok by the morning. I flew home that day and was absolutely fine. I kept the patch on until it fell off, hoping a slow withdrawal would keep me from experiencing any more side effects. No such luck. Almost exactly 24 hours after the patch fell off I experienced sudden extreme dizziness and intense nausea. I was in bed for 3 full days. When I was able to sleep I had intense and disturbing dreams. My doctor was completely shocked he had never heard of anyone experiencing anything like this!

It's been more than 48 hours since I removed the patch and I'm not feeling any better; in fact, I'm feeling worse.  I've used this patch before and don't recall having these issues.  I will be calling my doctor tomorrow to see what I can do to feel better.  I'll never use this patch again for motion sickness...

Where is FDA on all the complaints that are posted in this site? I used it for a 7-day cruise until 1/2/2010. After I removed for 24 hours, I threw up and then had dizziness for two days very serious. I could not go to work for those two days and had to lie in bed all the time. Now it has been more than 2 weeks, my blood pressure went to 94-146. I feel heavy on the head. It is awful experience. Then I found there have been so many complaints about this drug by many other people. Why FDA has continued to allow this to happen. I think it is time to take legal actions against the drug companies.

It worked great. I woke up from surgery with no nausea and also had no issues with nausea from the pain meds during the 3 days I had the patch on. I had no withdrawl symptoms when the patch was removed. This was a very positive experience and I would use the patch again.

I have been off of the boat (and the patch) for three days and am experiencing blurred vision, inner ear pain, nausea, balance problems (including bed spins when I try to sleep).

Prevention of Motion Sickness	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	12/9/2009 12:59:41 PM	I was prescribed this medication by my Primary Care Physician for a honeymoon cruise. I applied patches every 3 days for 2 weeks. Upon our return, I removed the last patch and within 12 hours was flat on my back. I was so dizzy, disoriented that I had to stay motionless on the bed. I continured to vomit for 24 hours straight which sent me to the ER. I spent 12 hours in the ER with an IV, (3) nauseau shots, (2) potassium bags and (1) magnesium bag. I also had a CAT scan thinking my bladder was the cause. The doctor said I had a virus from the cruise, but after reading all the side effects of patch removal after prolonged use, my husband and I believe all of this was due to prolonged patch use and removal. It has now been 8 days and I am no longer vomiting, but I have extreme head/neck aches and am still slightly dizzy/disoriented during the day. I am going back to my doctor and asking why no one warned me of these side effects, if they had I would have sought other options. I have never been so sick in my life. I lost 8 lbs in 3 days due to loss of fluids. I would recommend extremem caution with this drug. Note: the only side effects I had while taking the drug was blurry vision the 1st day of a patch (where I could not read) and extreme cotton-mouth. These I can live with since they were noted on the instructions...the removal side effects were not listed. I am now thinking of reporting this to the FDA.

By midnight when I got up to use the bathroom I realized I was feeling numb throughought my whole body! I went to the ER the next morning,the DR told me I was just having a &quot;reaction&quot; to the patch(my husband ripped off the patch at midnight)but that it should be out of my system after a few days...Today is day 5 and I am STILL feeling like I have a full body epidural. If you need something for motion sickness or for vertigo, try dramamine instead...this product is horrible and I wouldn't give it to my worst enemy.

Motion Sickness	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	7/16/2009 10:33:09 PM	I recently got a prescription for the patch to use on a trip to Disney World.  I used it about 3 years ago on a cruise without any problems or side effects, so it was a &quot;no brainer&quot;.  OMG, what a disaster.  I put the patch on about 3 hours prior to my early morning flight.  I just felt &quot;off&quot; for most of the day and didn't ride any rides at Disney.  That night, after about 15 hrs. of wearing the patch, I looked in the mirror and was mortified.  My left eye's pupil was huge (I had placed the patch behind my left ear).  My right pupil was completely normal.  No wonder I felt &quot;off&quot;!!  My equilibrium was completely shot.  It took me at least a day for my pupil to go back to normal and couple days to recover completely.  Also, I had just finished up my period and I started experiencing sharp pains in my left breast.  I didn't necessarily connect the two symptoms but after reading some previous reviews, I see that the hormone connection might also have caused the breast pain.  It took a few days to pass, but it seems that also was connected to the patch.  It's really weird that I had used the exact same patch a few years ago and had none of these same side effects.  I know I will never use it again.  It's not worth it.

I thought I had finally found the wonder drug for my motion sickness. It worked great until I took it off. I was in the hospital for 3 days with vertigo and nausea. I have been out of work for a week and am still experiencing muscle weekness and vertigo. My sister, an RN, suggested slowly reducing the size of the patch to lessen the withdrawal symptoms. WILL NEVER USE THIS DRUG AGAIN! Why didn't the doctor or any literature warn of this??
Prevention of Motion Sickness	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	4/2/2009 9:00:25 AM	I had a bad experience after leaving our cruise ship, and taking the patch OFF! The weird thing is that I have used this patch 3 years ago, with no side effects. This time, I placed this patch behind my ear as directed, to prevent motion sickness for a 3 day cruise. The seas were rough, but I did not have any motion sickness. After the 2nd night, I noticed the blurred vision. Each morning I woke up very dry, and my eyes were bloodshot &amp; red. By the 3rd day I felt generally pretty bad, and was in no mood to enjoy myself. Overall during the cruise, I think the drug worked in preventing motion sicknes.  However, my sickness began upon disembarking the ship. I removed the patch, and had sharp pains in my ear within 30 minutes. My blurred vision became worse, and my heart was racing. I took ibuprofen and laid down in bed. I have been back from the cruise for 3 days now, and I still feel terrible. My boss thinks I'm a hypochondriac because I have to keep leaving the office to go lay down in my car. I have been dizzy, nauseaus and on the verge of vommiting several times. I thought I had an inner ear infection, and scheduled a doctor's appointment for later today. But now after reading all of these horror stories of withdrawal symptoms, this is probably what I'm experiencing. I still feel like I'm on the ship right now, everything around me is rocking and swaying. At least my vision is almost back to normal.  Oh, and like many other women, I was on the 2nd day of my period when I put the patch on. Since I have taken this before with no side effects, I think that being on my period has contributed to my side effects and/or withdrawal symptoms. I do NOT recommend this drug if you are a woman. Stay far, far away from this drug!!

Motion Sickness	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	12/31/2008 3:46:20 PM	I recently used this for about 10days when I flew to Singapore. I usually use dramamine so I wanted something easy to use and got it from Doc. Well when I tried to take it off after 3 days I became very dizzy and threw up, until I put another patch on. I kept it on my entire trip and took it off a day after my plane ride and yet again extremely dizzy, nauseated, could not get out of bed to even eat. I called doc from bed and they perscribed something for vertigo, which is what they said I had which turns out was only horrible withdraw symptoms from this patch. The dizziness stopped after a day on meds and then I have had continuous problems with nerves in neck and head area. It seems like my head on the side I put the patch on is heavier than the other side and I can not hear well. I went to an ENT who said it is nerves in my neck and head and hearing is fine. It has been almost 2 full weeks now and I still have neck issues, and now I am taking muscle relaxers. I think next time I am going to try this thing that goes on your wrist instead. I hate taking meds...and now I have taken so many it is ridiculous although I will say these work......but at what cost?? My health?? No thanks!

Previously used pills for motion sickness. My mouth felt like cotton, chewed gum. When I took the patch off, the next day I woke up dizzy, felt like I was going to throw up and short of breath.  It lasted until the next day.  I am still a little nauseated, but my vision and breathing is fine. Next cruise, I won't use the patch!

I had no idea about any of the side effects.  While on the patch I did notice blurred vision, but recalled reading about that.  When I returned home and took the patch off, I have been experiencing balance problems, focusing problems, visions problems (although this has corrected itself thankgoodness) I have muscle weakness.  I have been off the patch now for six days and I am wondering if it is ever going to get any better.  Something that I thought is worth mentioning, I started my period three days ago --- I just finished my cycle two and a half weeks ago.    The patch did allow me to enjoy the cruise, it was easy to apply, but the side effects are hell and are NOT worth it.

I got it from my doctor.   I used it for 16 days but the day after I removed it I experienced extream motion sickness that lasted for 3 days b/4 I finally was so bad I had to make and emergency appointment with my Dr who diagonsed me with Vertigo.  From the ship not the medication, and put me back on the patch to even me out.   After two weeks I took my patches off b/c I thought it was gone, but the next day felt the symptoms return and quickly put on another patch.  Now I'm convinced my issue is with withdrawal from the patch and not the cruise.  I like another write also got my period 3 days into using this product.  I've felt hormonally out of wack the entire months I've been on this medication.  I'm depressed then happy, blurry vision is constant, sometimes affecting my ability to read, do my job or drive.  BUT I can't function with out it right now.  I've called my Dr. and expressed my concerns.  I even read on one site that the carcinagenic properties of the patch are unproven.  IKES!  I am awaiting their reply....Any ideas to help...I do not recommend this product to anyone.

It has changed my life.  I can put it on and go all weekend on a road trip with my husband driving.  I can turn around and watch my young kids while riding over the Grapevine!  I even got to go on Soaring Over California for the first time!  I did have a little blurred vision when I changed my patch, but I thought maybe I should have waited during transition or something.  I am very pleased, but worried about all the other reviews.
Prevention of Motion Sickness	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	9/30/2008 3:17:01 PM	My husband &amp; I used this patch for a 4day/3night cruise. The ocean was rough and glad we were wearing this patch.  I get motion sickness easily and this was great. I was able to enjoy my trip without being ill.  The drawbacks: If you sweat, the patch falls off. My husband placed only the sticky part of a bandaid over it to keep it from falling off (which worked). I experienced the blurred vision after 36 to 48 hours of wearing it. I washed my hands thoroughly, even when changing it. I still experienced the blurred vision. My vision was just like when the optometrist dialates my eyes.  I also had dry mouth and just chewed on sugarless gum.  My husband and I also experienced red, dry eyes in the mornings.  We used over-the-counter eye drops and it went away.  However, we had to use it every morning as the red eyes were only in the morning. Once we got home and removed the patch, the blurred vision took about 24 hours to return to normal. I had some dizziness (loopy feeling).  My head felt heavy and a slight headache. I was very tired which may or may not be related to the patch. I absolutely HATE to throw-up. So for me, not having to throw up was well worth the side effects.

I put the first patch on Fri. evening and by Mon. morning, my pupils were HUGE (and yes, I thoroughly washed my hands before and after I put the patch on).  I took it off immediately - it took 2 days for them to return to normal.  I also had extreme dry mouth.  I took BONINE for the rest of the cruise and was fine.  Also, about 36 hours after I put the patch on I started my period.  I am in menopause and hadn't had a period for 15 months.  Although this wasnt't listed as a side effect, I don't think it was a coincidence, especially now that I see that it works by balancing hormones.  I will never recommend this patch to anyone.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	25-34	3/14/2008 8:34:03 PM	I started using the patch for vertigo. It did help to keep the nausea and dizziness at bay. Every time I tried to leave it off my symptoms seemed worse. Also, I had a reaction to the adhesive and had to use cortizone cream to deal with the raised redness and open skin from that. The pharmasist said there wasn't anywhere else to put them, so I had to just deal with that. I used these for a little over 2 months. I stopped using them 4 days ago after having phyiscal therapy treatment for my vertgio. I have had nausea, dizziness and just plain sickness since then. The good news is the physical therapy works. I recommend getting it as soon as possible if you have vertigo. The bad news is that I still feel like sick from the patch. After reading the other reviews, I'm not eager to face the next couple of weeks like this. I hope that it resolves quickly.

This is a very danagerous drug and I can't get anyone to answer my questions about the side effects.  BEWARE.
