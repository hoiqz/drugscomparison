Other	Galbladdergone, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	19-24	9/2/2012 4:58:26 AM	My doctor put me on 25 mg for my extra secretion of acid where my gal bladder used to be. Although all my pain and other symptoms had gone completely, I found that i turned into a zombie. My response time was about 6 minutes and had to be homebound from school. After 6 monthes of a living in a haze I stopped taking it. Luckily it set my bodies secretion level of acid in my stomach back to normal and I was better. Several years later i'm having problems again and hoping I won't have to live as a zombie again to get rid of the pain.

The only thing it did was make me feel like a zombie every day with continued migraines every 2-3 weeks. Since that last migraine in May I've had none. What a relief. However I've gained 20# in this 8 months. At gym 4 times a week for past 2 months and feel as if I'm fighting a losing battle. I, like others mention, crave sweets I have never wanted in my life! I sleep like a baby, but will talk with the Dr on next visit about decreasing dose so I'm not so groggy the next day and maybe get some weight off.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	8/10/2012 9:49:16 AM	I have been taking this med for about ten years, 20 mg. There are a few times when I have to supplement with Tylenol for the fibromyalgia. It doesn't help much with anxiety though, nor with sleeping through the night. 
Migraine Prevention	LJ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/7/2012 5:37:17 PM	I have been on amitriptyline 35mg for the past 2 years and it has worked wonders. Haven't had a migraine since. I take it at bedtime, as it makes me sleepy if I take it during the day. My only other side effect is drymouth. I will take that over a migraine any day.
Migraine Prevention	PJ, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	65-74	8/7/2012 1:53:04 PM	Opthomologist prescribed 25mg. @ nite, but made me loopy next day and very dry mouth.  So, I cut pill in half and take 1/2 at nite and then 1/4 during the next day.  Has really helped prevent my ocular migraines w/ auras that I was having almost daily.  Also - 10 lb weight gain within 1 month!!  No matter what I do- can't loose the weight because I'm thirsty allll the time! Benefits far outweigh the side effects.  I'm resting better at night.  Anxiety is much better - not taking anu Xanax!

It works wonderfully.....however I have gained about 60 lbs and my breasts have grown 4 sizes! The weight is causing other health problems in my joints and feet. I excercise 30 minutes a day and only eat 1200 calories and I CAN'T LOSE THE WEIGHT!The doctor said it's either the weight or the severe pain. I'm 5'3'' and weigh 195 lbs. now. I don't think I would recommend this drug.

I am now weening myself off this drug. it does nothing I am tired all the time,very forgetfull, have gained 30lbs in the past 6 months the weight gain is all from this pill, because I do watch what I eat.I do not recommend this drug to anyone for anything.and to the woman out there the weight gain is all in your stomach and you do get alot of bloating. good luck to everyone who is taking this med.

I did stop taking it for a while because I felt so much better,but suffered terrible withdrawal symptoms and a return of my fybromyalgia symptoms too. I am now back on it and feel so much better,this works for me.If you,re just starting to take this stick with it,it really helps.

Depression	JJPet, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	3/4/2012 11:17:57 AM	I initially went off of this because of rapid weight gain. I am a person that has only fluctuates 5 pounds and only gained 15 pounds during pregnancy. Knowing this could cause weight, I was careful with what I ate, yet still gained 10 pounds in 6 weeks (all around my abdomen). Besides the weight gain, I did feel a little more &quot;snappy&quot; than typical - like more easily fly off the handle. As long as I took this around dinner and got 8 hours of sleep, I did not feel too &quot;zombied&quot; the next day. I went off and continued to try other classes of drugs, but found my body could not tolerate them. I am going to go back on temporarily (10 mg/day) while I get through a this difficult time in my life. I will deal with the weight gain later when I come off. It does help with sleeping, calming my racing mind, and lessen my body aches I experience from the depression/stress/anxiety, and generally give me a little more energy.

I have suffered with Fibromyalgia as well as other chronic pain conditions like RSD/CRPS.  I noticed a dramatic difference increasing this medicine from 75-100mg.  The only downfall is the weight gain.  This medicine has had the least amount of side effects which are weight gain and difficulty emptying my bladder.  I am extremely foggy in the morning also, so I just set a timer at night and take the Amitriptyline at around 9pm and that made a huge difference as apposed to taking it at 12am.  I have literally tried every medicine for fibromyalgia and this is the best by far.  I would recommend slowly increasing the dosage of this medicine.  When I was first diagnosed I couldn't even walk up stairs my joint's hurt so badly.  I hope this review helps

In the sense of the amounts of migraines, it has worked. When I do get one, it's usually pretty bad. Just glad the migraine doesn't last 5 and 6 days like it used to. Haven't had any big side effects since the dosage was upped to 35mg at bedtime. Still have trouble sleeping but feel better about not being in constant pain.
Migraine Prevention	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	12/12/2011 10:58:54 PM	When first taking this medication (10 mg for a week increased to 20 mg), I felt tired all over and I was questioning why I was taking it but the next few days were great! I sleep great every night and I haven't had a migraine yet and its been over 2 months. I still occasionally get daily headaches but none are as bad. I would recommend this medication but luckily I haven't had any of the horrendous side effects others have had. I am fearing the day where I have to stop taking this drug

Migraine Prevention	AshleyHi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	11/27/2011 3:24:29 PM	I was started on 25mg per day to prevent migraines. Before taking this medication I was getting migraines daily, now I only get them about 3 times a month. Although, this medication has tremendously improved the frequency of my migraines i still have my reservations. I have gained about 10 lbs in 6 weeks and also have sudden mood changes. The mood swings are very apparent and have been pointed out by my husband and children. I also have VERY dry mouth which has lead me to drink tons of water which may have also contributed to my weight gain. The medication also helps me sleep which is an extra bonus, i dont feel overly tired or groggy in the morning. Im considering switching to another preventative due to the side effects. I hope this review helps others that are seeking control over their migraines.

New(er) GI doc wanted me to try this drug to help control these symptoms, mostly the pain. The first month I really couldn't see any improvement... just felt drowsy and had a dry mouth. Almost 2 months now, and I have semi-normal bowel movements, and can tolerate some foods that would before near put me in the hospital. I think it has been helping with my depression too... so, I've been happy with it thus far.

His side effects did not begin until he skipped a dose on accident. He was on a steady increase weekly of 10mg to 20mg to 30mg a night. After the 30mg increase he started to have problems with his stomach and the migraine peaking on him constantly. Usually it is present but not spiking. His blood also became VERY thin when using Ibuprofen to try to treat the spike. He is now being weaned off of it, but his doctor said down to 20mg for 2 days and then 10mg for 2 days then to stop taking them. His mood was horrible from the skipped dose, so I was not pleased to hear this and pushed for a week for each step. After reading a review that said 6 weeks I am happy I stated my concern. I am not pleased to have the weaning effecting him more than then the actual increases.  The side effects he has felt include blurry vision,dizziness upon standing, stomach discomfort/ache,mood swings, restlessness, sleeplessness, and worse migraine pain.

I also take Ambien CR 12.5 at bedtime, but I take 30 mg amitriptyline about an hour before bed. I didn't think it was helping that much until tapered off for awhile and realized that I'm sleeping better when I take it. Nothing at all like my old &quot;normal&quot; sleep, but definitely better.

But now I'm thinking of taking my own life, I never had such thoughts before and I'm scared out of my mind.  I don't know what to do, but to go off this Amitriptyline.  I weighted 135 now I'm up to 160 lbs.  The nightmares finally went away but these thoughts of taking my own life are scary.

I felt tired and not like myself.. i also felt non-social, which that is the opposite of me. but i stayed on it in the hopes that it would change and it did. All of a sudden one day i felt like me again. Before my mouth was REALLY dry and i felt dizzy, short of breath. Now i sometimes have dry mouth but not where it bothers me.

She is currently at CHOC hospital.A week ago she all of a sudden got really bad pressure on the front right side of her head. Within in seconds she got really pail and passed out. Her heart rate went up and her blood pressure went extremely down. She never gets head aches or migraines. The team of doctor's have been running lots of tests. They decided to take the conservative route and treat her for Basal migraniame variant. They started her 3 days ago on 10mg of Amitriptyline.She is sleeping all the time. She is getting head aches all of a sudden and is very moody.I'm not liking the side effects at all.How long do I let them keep giving this drug to her? I am so confused and frustrated. Please feel free to give me any advice!

I love that I dont have anymore headaches, so far.  Funny, other symptoms I have that I didnt really mention to my doc like history of bulimia, OCD issues, and ADD seem to be better.  Except for the fog I get after I take it...no more staying up all night watching tv. (must be working).  But this dry mouth is A PAIN IN THE... Hopefully that goes away.  I am worried about reports others wrote about trying to come off the drug and my fingers feel a little numb. not too bad, I could live with that over no more migraines, I had them once or twice a week and they were really pretty bad.  But, I should mention I liked my ADD symptoms so if I keep being so rational and slow, I may come off the drug. LOL! I need to get stuff done!!! and I am cool as a cucumber! Of coarse I will have to ask my husband and kids what they think, but I swear I am easier to get along with. :)

He takes 10mg at night to help prevent his migraines. Since he started taking it his headaches are not as severe (no more vomiting) and they are less frequent, however he does still get them &amp; he still misses school. His doctor bumped him up to 20mg 2 weeks ago, I've noticed my son is now too mellow, seems zombie like so I'm switching him back to 10mg. He did say he sleeps a lot better when he takes 20mg but it's not worth having a 12 yr old with no personality or drive, so I'm lowering the med back to 10mg.

I began experiencing extremely painful and swollen breasts a few weeks ago, but didn't know until today that this medication can cause this as well. All in all, I'm glad I chose to stop it - though the withdrawls are REALLY tough. Was thankful for the ability to sleep, but had NO LIFE while taking it!

Neuropathic Pain	Skyrena, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	6/28/2011 12:29:52 PM	I have degenerative disc disease, Stenosis, osteoarthritis and shoulder inpingement syndrome and am also depressed. I was given this drug for its dual effect on pain and depression. The very first night about 30 minutes after taking my heart rate was fast and I was wide awake for about 2 hours. I had to supplement it with a muscle relaxer in order to get to sleep. This medicine did nothing for the pain, I actually awoke because of the pain in my lower back. I was already on this drug but at a lower dose it did not interfere with my sleep or heart rate. At 75 mg it certainly is. Sometimes trying to change ones medicine in an attempt to lower their narcotic pain medicine just doesn't work.

Migraine Prevention	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	6/21/2011 10:16:13 AM	I was on 75mg/day at bedtime for about 2 months for migraines and has absolutely no change in my headache patterns. I started out on a low dose but as soon as I got up to 75mg all the side effects piled on. I started having tremors all throughout my body, looking like some sort of drug addict going through withdrawals. I work as a nurse and my hospital was forced to send me home because it was so uncontrollable. Around the same time, I started having difficulties urinating. It began as just a difficulty in starting but turned into a complete lack of ability to urinate. I ended up in the emergency room to have my bladder drained and hurry the medication out of my system. I'm told my reaction was not common, but I just want anyone who may begin taking it to know what possibilities may lie ahead. This was a complete nightmare!!

I was instantly severely depressed and hopeless. To the point of suicidal thoughts. As soon as the doctor weened me off and I wasn't taking it anymore I was ok day by day. I was not on this medication for depression or any other mental disorder and I had real knowledge of what some people go through while on this medication.

I wish I had been told that.  Now that it is working, I am finding it although extremely helpful with pain (now just uncomfortably numb), it makes me cry all the time.  I feel depressed and anxious at 75 mg.  I have also lost a lot of weight, which I can't afford to lose.

On the 6th day woke up with diarrhea had it all day. On 7th,8th, and 9th day woke up vomiting, diarrhea, and severe abdominal pain. I thought I had a stomach virus then maybe a ulcer. I took this med at night and was supposed to help me sleep and it kept me up. The pain and vomiting only lasted til about mid-day while diarrhea lasted all day. I didnt take it on the 9th night and felt a lot better 10th day and even better the next days. My neurologist said these aren't normal side effects but to stop taking it. Now I am going to try verpamil for prevention of migraines.

Not only did it stop my itching, it stopped my migraines, helped me sleep and helps me urinate alot less. I would not stop this drug for anything. It has changed my life so much for the better. My 20 year old daughter started getting migraines,the doc put her on amitriptyline and she too can sleep and has no more headaches. The side effects are minimal. Once in a while when I awake from a deep sleep I will hallucinate and see huge spiders. I will gladly see the spiders for the benefits it gives me.

Other	boston2capecod, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	2/25/2011 10:20:31 PM	This was prescribed for severe abdominal pain, caused by a partial bowel obstruction, as an alternative to a potentially dangerous surgery.  I have been taking this drug for about 6-8 weeks and over the last couple of weeks, I have gone so far as to fantasizing about killing myself, to almost acting upon it (went so far as to write the note).  I was so depressed after a difficult day at work, that I contemplated running my car off the road.  I have been treated for depression and thought I was having an repeat episode of the depression, but after thinking it through, I thought it may be something I was taking for pain management that was causing these unusual symptoms.  That is when I logged onto WEbMd and found the symptoms I am having are a well known side effect of this drug. I should have read the material provided by the pharmacy or researched this drug on WebMd before taking it.  Unfortunately, I could have been dead or seriously injured before anyone figured it was a known side effect of this drug.  I have yet to fully confirm this, but my symptoms line up too perfectly to really be organic.

So I now have to decide if I want to be fat and sleep well, or thiner and tired all the time!  I will be discussing the weight gain issues at the next visit. It truly has helped my sleep issues amazingly well(I have suffered most of my life with insomnia), and I have taken just about every sleeping pill known to man.

I've gained no weight but am craving sweets. Having dreams at night, but not too bad to deal with. Still have pain but might bedeminished somewhat. More time is needed to really determine effectiveness. I'm not having to take as much vicodan, and soma.
Other	Pam, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	1/7/2011 11:31:03 AM	My back doctor prescribed amitriptyline with Neurontin to help with nerve pain for my dergenerative disc disease. It did not help with the pain and the side effects were unbearable. headaches, very moody,angrey,Irritable,forgetful,and for some reason craved sweets that caused me to gain weight. The smallest inconvenience sets me off. I have a two year old and he and the family didn't understand why I was always in such a bad mood. I took this medicine for 7 months and feel so bad for my family to of had to put up with this. I will check on web md from now before taking any medication that I am prescribed. No pain is worth putting your family thru this.

It has helped with the frequency from a migraine everyday to maybe one every 2 weeks or so. I do still get them but will give this a chance for another 30 days. I do sleep better. The only side effect so far is the dry mouth which I keep hard candy and gum at hand.
Other	Txlady615, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	12/18/2010 1:29:43 PM	It was just prescribed yesterday. I am researching and deciding whether I want to risk it or not. 2 years ago I took Mirapex for 6 months. Had dry mouth, night mares, leg cramps, frequent urination at night, angry, and almost had 2 head on collisions from falling asleep with no notice. I leaned later that the med I was taking for chelestrol had restless leg syrdrome that mirapex was prescribed for. That dosage was greatly reduced, I quit Mirapex and the symptoms went away.  Then, i had cervical fusion with spinal cord damage that I am recovering from now. Dr. prescribe this med for pain. The experience with Mirapex was horrible and I'm not sure I want to risk this one! I am currently taking vicodan, and just started Soma. I think I should stick with them for a while and see if the Soma helps with sleep as the bones fuse and heal before I risk this drug.

I began taking it when I was about 14 for mainly migranes, but it also helped with my depression following my parent's divorce. I was always a fairly docile child, but things changed after that nasty divorce. My mood would swing violently to one side or another with little or no provocation.I remember as for one example watching Tom and Jerry at around 2AM (insomnia as well) and I was absolutely outraged, literally red in the face at Tom never letting Jerry catch a break. Then, not more than a minute later, I was laughing myself to tears when he got nailed in the face with a frying pan.School was difficult too. Needless to say my grades were crap. I ultimately decided that the medicine was to blame since none of this ever happened before I started taking amitriptyline, so I immediately discontinued use. The following week was hell, almost literally. I went for days without sleep, put on and lost weight on a daily basis, and had an absolutely blank slate for emotion. Now here we are, about 6 years later, with heavy insomnia problems and migranes at least once a week. I'm told by countless people that it was the medication that I quit cold-turkey like that, how it kind of &quot;burnt bridges&quot; on the way out of my system. I've now, believe it or not, become completely nocturnal.

Other	dakotah, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	65-74	11/26/2010 3:52:15 PM	I was unable to fall a sleep &amp; had restless leg syndrome.  I also had joint pain which was finally attributed to gout, and I was given Alllopurinol.   I was prescribed 50mg of Amitriptyline at bedtime to help relax and fall to sleep.  After taking this drug for about 2-3 months, I was able to sleep soundly but it took me approximately an hour to do so.  I started to develop severe dry-mouth starting about mid-morning and lasting in to late afternoon.  I noticed that it became more severe if I became anxious, flustered, or angry.  It didn't take much for me to get cotton-mouth.  Now I'm constipated, which will last up to about 3-5 days.  I'm also very irritable, and the smallest inconvenience sets me off.  In the past I suffered a stroke, few days later a heart attack, and eventually bypass (5) surgery.  Presently I take 13 prescribed medications including one for diabetes, and others for high blood pressure and heart.  I have gained a considerable amount of weight, which I feel is due to several medications that I now take, and my inability to exercise for any length of time.  I stopped taking Amitriptyline yesterday and now I'm curious what the side effects I will have.

So, I will return to this med to prevent migraines that are occurring almost daily.  Constipation and dry mouth are worth it.

I started low 25mg and gradually went up to 150mg.  I then decided that was too much, so I gradually went back down to 50mg and there I stay.  I like it the most for the fact that it helps me sleep and I don't have any hangover effect.  It takes a couple weeks to get balanced on it, but it's worth it.
Migraine Prevention	Angela, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	11/13/2010 11:05:12 AM	I was just prescribed this drug, and have not yet started taking it. After reading the posts on here, I am seriously re-considering it.  I have a constant low grade migraine, that hardly ever goes away, and treat it with pain killers when I absolutely have to - when it has worn me down especially after a long day at work.  My neurologist has prescribed Topomax (terrible side effects - heart racing, trouble concentrating and focusing, etc) and then Propanol (horrible nightmares and trouble getting back to sleep after them), and it has been several months since I stopped it, so my doc decided to try something else.  I am not convinced after reading others experiences with this drug that this is the best course of action. Will keep searching...

I was originally gived Depakote &amp; Topomax, which seemed to work.  I lost 40lbs due to the Topomax and my headaches were down to 1-2 a week, taking Vicoden as needed for pain.  About 10mos into it, I started losing my hair.  I told my Dr I was freaking out about it &amp; stopped taking both.  Headaches aren't too bad, manageable.  Checkup he prescribed Amitriptyline for headaches &amp; to help me sleep with Maxalt as needed for pain.  I just got it filled &amp; am very nervous to start taking it.  I take Ambien now to sleep, so I don't have a problem w/that.  The reviews are negative.   Honestly, I'm scared to start. I had 2 horrific nightmares the other nite and that was w/o any meds.  Should I even start?  Or say heck with it &amp; stick with the occasional Vicoden to help with the pain?

I have been on it for about 3 months now and it has NOT helped me at all with my depression! I am SO disappointed.I am going to stop taking it but you CANNOT just stop all at once! You MUST do it gradually by one-half each week or so as not to cause a &quot;serotonin storm&quot; I believe they call it. Very dangerous.Maybe after I stop, I should just continue going to the psychiatrist and talk and start WALKING outdoors in the fresh air everyday and listening to soothing music. Also, taking deep breathes help to calm people as long as you do not take too many. Breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth!I wish everyone here the best of luck and....by the way......this medication DOES make your STOMACH LARGER!!!! How about gaining around 17 pounds in 3 months!!! I was 163 and now I am 180!God Bless you and try to hang in there. I know....it is SO very tough sometimes but believe me....there are SO many of us out here that have problems in general and I always try to think to myself about all the people who are MUCH worse off in life than myself. I do thank GOD every single day for being there always for me.Take good care and have nice Holidays coming up!

Other	bhoneycake, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/9/2010 8:21:50 PM	prescribed for IBS,headach,sleep. Taken for over 20 years and would not be without it. Anything that controls my IBS is great with me. I learned though that I must take it at bedtime because it does make me tired. It took about 2 weeks before I felt &quot;normal&quot;. I felt like I was drunk but it passed quickly. Still get headaches but with less intensity. One side effect I don't like is the weight gain and some edema in legs but my job requires me to sit for long hours so that may be the cause and the sun sensitivity causes me to get sun poison if I don't use a good sunscreen and limit my exposure. My doctor monitors my blood and it does elevate my liver functions but nothing abnormal just a little on the &quot;high&quot; normal rating. I can't imagine my life without it. I would probably be a house bound person if not for this. Just make sure you get a yearly checkup and if your doctor is like mine he will make sure it is working for you or not.

Some chick on here gained 10 lbs the 1st month! I really think I'm going back to the Dr., becuase as someone pointed out, this medication is not for people with active life styles. I have two jobs, I can't afford to be tired and sleepy all day, no matter how well I sleep at night. Also saw several people mention low sex drive, and contstipation, as well as memory issues...

Although I have the overall pain, fatigue and sleep disturbances were my biggest complaint with fibro.  Started on 25 mg Elavil at bedtime, and have found deep, restful sleep which helps reduce my pain levels.  I have had to increase dosages over the yrs due to drug tolerance, but am finding a good balance with sleep/pain at 75 mg.  Yes, it does have potential side effect of weight gain, but even at 75 mg, I was still able to lose 50+ lbs via Weight Watchers from Jan-Dec 2009, and kept it off.  I hope I never have to stop taking it.  Without it, I cannot fall alseep for many hrs or will wake several times during the night and never reach deep sleep.

This works great for my headaches. The dose was increased to 25mg about 4 months ago for increased anxiety. Works great and helps me sleep very well. Down sides is that it makes me crave sweets a lot and has really decreased my sex drive.

Not sure if it helped or not. I have interstitial cystitis or so we think. Suddenly about two weeks ago I started getting a burning pain in my calf, always the right one (maybe because I use it more such as driving). Also my feet and hands have been tingling on and off. I had gastric bypass two years ago so I informed my bariatric doc. We did all my blood work and it's all fine. So, I called the uro and the nurse said it is possible to develop a reaction even after taking a med a few months. She says I will probably have to come off it and they will let me know tomorrow after speaking with doc. Anyone have anything happen like this?

Was reluctant to take because I was told it was an antidepressant; however, once I started taking it every night I noticed that it did help with sleeping throughout the night.  No longer awakened by the discomfort of tingling in my foot.  I have been gaining weight and think this pill may be the culprit.

From day one forward I began feeling more and more agitated and that continued into restless hands/wringing then into full blown panic attacks. I have had  similar experiences before and luckily knew how to wait it out.  VERY long nights as a result of taking a full dose of this med.  No sleep at all. Panic/pain constant racing thoughts.I stopped after three weeks per the doctor and I still cannot sleep at night, but then again, anything over two hours a night is a good night sleep for me.I suffer chronic pain in my muscles and joints that keeps me up at night.  My chest/back muscles were so tight last year that a sneeze broke a rib! I have a naturally fused L-5 disk that my back muscles constantly protect. It feels like someone is sticking a fork in my back and twisting the muscles like spaghetti, or conversely it feels like a railroad spike is lodged in my back/neck/chest/shoulder/hips.  Only relief from vicodin but the NEED to take the next dose 20 minutes sooner than the last one was just too much.

This med was prescribed by her dr after she complained of knee pain. During the first week of taking, she was ok.On the 8th day, she was extremely agitated and wakeful during the nite and went without sleep for more than 24 hours. She was also hallucinating, speaking to people who were not there. When she was finally able to sleep, she seemed unable to stay awake. She slept continuously and had the masked face look. Also, her skin seems pale and she seems uninterseted in her surroundings.We have decided to take her off the medication.

My ENT doctor prescribed this for me to eleviate the ringing. I can say that this medication has not helped at all.  There is not an effective medication for tinnitus.  He gave it to me for the side effects of the tinnitus.  No help.  What I am finding out about this medication is that I do not need to use Ambien for sleep.  It helps me better than Ambien. I can say that if it does not work for one reason it works for another.

Was treated for overactive bladder with other meds that did not aleviate my urge to urinate.  Once I started treatment with this med that awful feeling went away.  I was getting up up to 5 time a night and was unable to urinate.  This was the magic pill for me.  One pill before bed time.

I went to a rheumatologist, he prescribed amiltriptyline 10mg to take at bedtime along with ambien.  I feel like a different person.  I sleep well at night , my fibro pains are less, and it has helped my depression.

Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	4/1/2010 5:47:38 PM	I started this medication after a few rounds on other antidepressants that didn't have an effect. Now after a few months I often almost forget to take it because I feel alright again. Treatment resistant depression and PTSD can be tough, and this was one of the last stops before trying an MAOI or SNRI. I never experienced many side effects except for an increase in appitite, which can definately be controled.

Although, this pill is mainly for depression, it can cause worsening. So far, my headaches have not gotten better, but I just started taking this. Even though I am overweight, I see all the comments on here about it might make you gain weight or even make you feel weak, I don't think should be recommended to people with bulimia or depression since you never know what could happen. But like I said, just started this, so all your comment are going to thought of in my head, hopefully I don't get memory loss like the one person did, I can't remember things as it is, and I really am afraid of what it could do to me.

I was lucky to review this just after 2wks after suffering some side affects.  After reviewing them it explained alot and the way I felt, feeling that had enough of life, stomach cramps and upset stomachs, dry mouth, restless nights
Other	moxie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	3/25/2010 10:26:04 AM	Initially I welcomed the additional anti-depressant, although it was primarily prescribed for my insomnia and lack of deep restorative sleep.  During the first several months, maybe even up to one year, there seemed to be improvement.  The schedule that seemed to work best for me was to take it (100mg) about 2-3hrs before my bedtime, so I would try to remember to take it around 8p.m.  After a while, however, I began to notice that there was little if any impact on my sleep.  It didn't matter when I took it, I still could not fall asleep when I wanted to, nor could I remain asleep.  Moreover, I was experiencing increased anxiety and irritability, a drop in bp upon rising, not just from bed, but anytime during the day (even from the sofa, recliner, chair, etc.), and often I was feeling faint.  The most troublesome side effect has been the cognitive impairment!  The daily, moment-by-moment, forgetfulness, inconveniencing not just myself, but others as well.  I forget normal, automatic actions, like not turning on the slow cooker, or losing my train of thought. Many of us experience those behaviors, but I'm talking about being handicapped in family, work, and social arenas.  Presently, my doctor is weaning me from Amitriptyline over the next 6wks.  And I welcome the change with the hope I regain my memory, become able to follow more than 1 instruction, and decrease the drop in bp and feeling faint. 
Migraine Prevention	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	3/22/2010 6:56:29 AM	I have to say that this medication caused severe side effects for me to include, hallucination, constipation, sever stomach pain, limited sex drive, dryness of mouth, groggy in the mornings, staring throughout the day, and unsual dreams.  If you are generally a healthy individual and just need something for the onset of migraines, this medication is not for you.  I was only on the medication for 4 nights, 10 mg per night.
Migraine Prevention	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/21/2010 12:07:49 AM	I was put on this med for severe migraines. Not only did my head keep hurting, I wanted to blow it off my shoulders! I became angry at the world, and impossible to be around. I began to think about hurting myself or someone else. Luckily my family noticed the changes immediately and I was able to get off the meds before it was too late. I am so thankful that I didn' do anything stupid in the short time I was taking this drug.

I like most of the folks on the review have had serious weight gain. I approched my Urioliogist today about the weight gain and he told me this drug did'nt cause weight gain... Umm.. i think it does! I'am on several other drugs for my bladder problem also, getting ready for a possilbe bladder strech in a couple of weeks. I hope to be off all medications after the sugery. Thanks to everyone who posted the reviews, it has helped alot !!

I do have ringing in my ears but I have had that most of my life well before I took this medication. I have fibromyalgia and this is the main reason for taking it. I also have IBS pre-elavil, and it did not get worse. I could not sleep well before and now I sleep much better with dreaming almost every night, mostly good dreams. I never had dreams before. I started on 25mg and after a few years needed to increase to 50mg. This works well for me and I have been on this med now for about 5 yrs.

Depression	unwell22, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	3/5/2010 6:31:26 AM	IDK really how I should rate this med.  I am a 5yr sufferer of chronic pain, and as of late my situation has gotten worse doe to a failed ACDF, and therefore pain is unbearable all of the time, but is somewhat controlled by a cocktail of medications, 2 being strong narcotics. My injury and failed surgery has altered my life completely. I am deemed disabled at this time, due to all work Ive done in the past has been physical laboring jobs, so needless to say can't do that anymore.  So became severely depressed, self-harming, wanting to just give up so I often have suicide ideations.  So I asked my doc to put me on an anti-depressant for depression, plus it helps when added to other medications to better help with chronic pain. I have taken it 2 nights, the first time I got the 24hr flu so I puked all night(don't believe the med had anything to do with it), 2nd night I fell asleep maybe 2hrs after taking it and I stayed asleep for the first time in many yrs, however, I could not wake up, stayed asleep till noon the next day slept 11hrs straight. Oh no cant do that.  Most of the post are scaring me, I even specified not to prescribe one with side effect of weight gain, due to the fact I am limited to what I can do physically due to injuries and chronic pain but I got it anyways and Im not going to stop it yet but I don't know if I can take 4wks of sleeping all the time, what a waste of precious time, however it was nice to acturally sleep through the night and not wake in pain,or by the nerve pain which always woke me on avg. 4x a night. So idk if this is for me, I will for sure stop if I see weight gain, oh hecks no.  I am in good shape, in body image meaning, not physically pursay, and I dont want to lose it. What to do what to do, plus I read the majority of the reviews and not many if any are on this for depression, docs dont listen or care they just keep throwing drugs at you to shut you up, I seriously feel like I get played every visit.wish to 4c the outcome...

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	2/28/2010 4:50:21 AM	Ive had trouble sleeping for the past ten years and pretty much just ignored it and worked at night.Finally my life changed and i couldnt just wait until I was exhausted to sleep, so i was prescribed elavil. For the first couple weeks I felt drowsy almost drunk all day then that went away. For the first couple months I had silly nightmares but those stopped as well. The funny aftertaste it caused lasted for a few months but it has gone away too.I dont get cotton mouth in the mornings anymore either. So I'd say try to tough out the weird side effects if the benefits outweigh them. I sleep well every night and dont get the hallucinations and blackout periods that other sleeping meds have caused.

Popping percoset didn't help. Finally Dr. put me on amitriptyline. The very next day the pain was gone. Still had tenderness and weakness in right buttox area from limping so much. Been on this med now for one week, sleep great. Taking 10mg before bedtime. Looking forward to getting back to normal and off all the meds. Before taking I read about all the side effects and was willing to go for it anyway. I understand now after reading all the blogs how it does'nt help some, makes some worse and others have trememdous success as I did.

I increased to 20mg amatriptyline after 1 week.  The entire time, I had shortness of breath.  I thought this was from the prednisone, but once I got off the prednisone and incrreased to 20mg of the amatryptline, the shortness of breath got worse.  not only was I exhausted from not sleeping, but now I could not breath well - very heavy chest feeling.   I was exhausted, but could not sleep - I dreamed all night, waking up about every 2 hours.  Completely exhausted the rest of the day, trouble breathing continued.  I stopped taking after 2 weeks and of course the headaches came back. I have had 2 migraines since then as well. I am looking into physicaly therapy and massage therapy now.  No side effects!

Migraine Prevention	headachenomore, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/8/2010 9:17:31 PM	I've been on this medication for over 14 years and haven't had a single side effect. Didn't have another migraine for 10 years, and have had only 1 per year in the last 4.  May need to increase the dose from 50 mg one of these years.  I don't care if I have to take it for the rest of my life.  It works.  And if you get yourself in a pattern of taking it right before bedtime every night (like going to the bathroom or brushing your teeth), you won't forget.  I haven't missed a dose in 14 years.  Maybe that's why it has worked so well for me.

Migraine Prevention	tater, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	35-44	2/4/2010 7:01:23 PM	I have had totally different feelings on this then most of the people posting. I got really emotional, to the point of feeling like crying and thinking I was losing my mind. Did nothing for my headaches,did not help me sleep at all and greatly demenished my sex drive. Took forever to get ready if you know what I mean. Does not help if you have a new girlfriend. Had a panic attack that she was leaving me, knew her a month and was all mushy saying I love her and crazy stuff. I hate this med. and my dr. has taken me off of it. All this is the opposite of how I was before I started taking the med. I would not recommend taking it at all. It made me depressed, could not concentrate, and was hard to recall things. Also I would have periods where I could not remember what I did or what was said. Like I was in a fog. I still have my headaches but it is better then the side effects of this drug. Girl friend wont even talk to me now. So there you go. bad drug for me.

This med has also helped be sleep better at night.  One draw back is that my mental processing is affected and I often forget what I was about to do or have difficulty pulling up information from my brain.

Migraine Prevention	Kojak, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	25-34	1/26/2010 12:17:48 PM	Prescribed for migraines and related headaches that I get 5 to 6 times a week.  Been taking it over a month and I can't say if it has had any effect.  It may have knocked out about 10% of my headaches which doesn't amount to much but my sex drive is gone, and I've gained 5 pounds in the last month.  Also I have started having trouble with depression which is something I almost never have a problem with.  I'm a pretty even dis-positioned person but for the last two weeks I've been really down.  I am having trouble concentrating and staying focused.  I also am very tired and groggy throughout the day.  Going to stick with it just to see if the headaches get better but in the long run I think I'll ask to be taken off of it.

Have taken myself off of this.  Helps very little with my pain, but it makes me so tired all day I just want to sleep and sit. It has made me very moody, and don't want to do anything. Doctor wants me to take Nortriptyline 20 mgs once at bedtime, after reading the reviews, am very hesitant about taking it. I think I will pass and stick with my pain meds.

Its made my compulsive behavior slightly worse (eating,cig smoking)however I now get the best sleep! I still toss and turn but I actually don't wake up a trillion and one times anymore hehe. I don't see much improvement with my anxiety just yet but I'm hoping and have been told once at 50mg or higher it would effect my mood,make me less ansy. So hopefully I should start feeling better soon.Good luck to everyone else and hope this helped a tad. :)

I also have Migraines and Stabbing Headaches.  I was on Topomax for a while but stopped because it terribly effected my memory and my brain function.  I am on Indomethacin for the stabbing headaches but that did not alleviate the constant migraines.  My doctor finally proscripted this drug to treat my migraines and help me sleep through the pain of fibromyalgia.  This drug works great for me.  There have been no side effects and I have been taking this drug for 3 months now.  The only thing is that this past weekend I had to bump up to taking 15mg from 10mg.  I stopped being able to sleep all the way through the night.  I hope that in another 3 months I won't have to up the dosage again.  All in all, so far a wonderful drug for me.

I refused to take it at first because I had taken it years ago with very bad side effects and results.  Reluctantly, I tried it again.  After 3 days of taking this I flushed the entire prescription down the toilet.

Other	Carol, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	12/20/2009 6:42:05 AM	My mother has been on this drug because of shingles and the pain of them.  The small dose of this drug of 25mg at night did not affect her.  She still continued to hae pain for the shingles so the doctor increased her dose to 50mg 3x a day, and then 100mg at night. Before she started the increased dose she had a pace maker put in. She was in the hospital for 24 hours.  After being dismissed from 1 hospital she was showing signs of confusion. I am her daughter and I stayed with her duing the rest of that day and the night.  She continued the rest of the evening to be confused.  I then had to take her to the local hospital.  They did several test including a cat scan of her brain.  It showed that she had not had a bleeding on the brain.  She had a UTI and was admitted to the hospital.  Then all of her meds were taken to the hospital which included the amitriptyline in the high doses.  She has several of the symotoms including involuntary movement of muscles including hand, arm and leg twitching while sleeping. A masked look on her face, extreme confusion, not knowing people. She had none of this until being given the amitriptline in the high doses.  I contacted the doctor and let them know that I was extremely concerned about my mother and her condition.  She was taken off the drug after being on it for 36 hours or so.  I hope that she will recover from these symptoms.  I just wanted to let you know that you should watch out for you older parents and keep a watchful eye on there medication and new symptoms.

It helped at first, but a few months later, I was getting constant migraines again. I started taking 50mg at night. I am sure to take the pill so I have at least 7 hours to sleep through it. I still wake up foggy and it lasts until lunch time. I am also noticing a shallowness of breath and rapid heartbeat. I am constipated. I have the ridiculous heartburn, which I had never had before. My sex drive has plummeted. I am a zombie. I have gained unexplainable weight. It does great helping you fall asleep, if that's what you need it for. I feel the electrified sensation that other people describe. I see flashes when I close my eyes. I had bad dreams at first but those quickly subsided. I wouldn't recommend this drug unless your symptoms outweight these side effects. I'm not taking it anymore, even though I am running out of treatment options for my migraines. It's just not work feeling like the living dead. (These side effects are very similar to the side effects that I felt taking Topamax, which is the reason I stopped taking it.)

I did prevent migraines, as well as helped with restless leg syndrome.  However, after reading the reviews I realized this drug is why I gained 30 pounds in 6 months!  I was only on 10 mg. a night.  Even with diet and exercise I was still gaining.  I stopped the medication and am starting to lose weight - finally!  Overall I guess it worked for the headaches and rls but not worth it because of the weight gain.

My health care provider would not cover much of the cost - so I was sent to amnitriptyline - which is better than nothing.  If I had my choice - I would go back to Cymbalta - but the pain of getting a part time job to pay for it was more than the relief it provided.

Like everyone here I went through the Zombie phase that 1st week or 2. Once you get past that and the medicine builds in your blooodstream it is very effective for Muscle and Nerve issues. I feel almost Normal, which I haven't felt unless I was taking Percocets or Tramadol. Unfortunately, a few of the Side Effects I am struggling with: minor weight gain, that is difficult to lose and more concerning a trastic loss of Sexual Interest. Has anyone else dealt with this? I'm planning on stopping this medicine unless my Doctor can suggest a way to avoid that loss of interest. As for the weight gain, I can live with that and just work harder at losing it and keeping it in check.

An E.R. doctor gave me Amitriptyline as a pain reliever. I do have to say it has helped with the pain however, every couple of months i have to up the dosage. I am now on 150mg... It works for the pain but turns me into a zombie. My family calls it the zombie drug... All in all it works if you take a natural supplement called B12.

It is the only medication that helps me with my insomnia. I have tried every other drug and nothing happens. I am worried about long term effects. Literally no other drug effects me. I guess you could put this down for Depression or PTSD, which I do have. Believe me, it does'nt work for depression at all.

I have chronic fatigue, lyme disease, fibermalgia, epstein barr and an immune system disorder.  I recently went through thyroid cancer, having it removed.  My sleep...well, this med does help that BUT, I wake up VERY tired, wanting to sit and sleep even the next day..all day.  I think that this med has also caused weight gain, something that I don't want to do!!  After reading the posts on here, I think even more so then I did before that this med is NOT for me.  I am tired..but more tired of feeling like dead weight, not wanting to do anything!!  I am going to aswkmy doc to check me for PSO, but I think this med is causing most of my symptoms.  Some days I feel well, most all days exhausted!  I am SO hoping that I dont need to be weaned off this, only on 10mg/per night, but I am stopping this med tonight.  Now I am wondering how long it will be before it is out of my system.  THANKS eveyone who has posted on this board.....you helped alot.  If you take the time to read ALL the posts as I did, you will see most are against this med.  Sometimes I wonder if the meds that we take make things worse.  Good luck to all and thanks so much to WebMD for allowing us to voice our thoughts and feelings.  It really does help to know that others think and feel as we do and know that it's &quot;not in our heads&quot; as to how we feel when going through different things (illnesses) in our lives.

I started at 25mg and then went to 50mg when the vomiting persisted. At 50mg I felt tired all day and couldn't concentrate very well, so I switched back over to the 25mg. When I switched back, I had terrible mood swings for about a week and I still have mood swings if I forget to take it. I worked out running and weight-lifting all summer and could not lose any weight, so I am assuming that the med had something to do with it. I am planning on switching to a different medication at my next drs visit because I do not like taking an antidepressant.

I started out on 25mg which worked well until I was put under a lot of stress. We bumped it up to 50mg. I have maintained a consistent weight, even though I am working out. There is some constipation/diarhea, but it isn't too much. My headaches are gone, but if I forget to take it one day, they do come back. My doctor was afraid about me taking an anti-depressent at my age, but I have had no mood swings, no weight gain, no depression, no suicidal thoughts or actions. It made me very sleepy and lethargic the first month of taking it, but now I feel like my normal self. I am able to enjoy life as a college student migraine free and it feels great! This is all due to a PA that finally listened to what I was saying.

This drug probably saved my life.  I now sleep and can easily go back to sleep if I get up during the night.  The only (but serious) drawback is the weight gain.  I've been on it for 1 year and gained 10 lbs in 6 months-all fat and my cholesterol has skyrocketed despite a strict diet and exercise regimen.  I've tried to wean off, but then the insomnia returns, but at least I'm sleeping again.  Tough choice.

I told my doctor after reading the reviews that I did not want to take this medication and she talked me into it. Worst Mistake I could have made! I didnt even realize how bad the side effects were. I had two of the worst headaches Ive ever had, magnified my pain, I was spacey and my body felt like an electricity charge that kept gaining energy. In the middle of our 12 year old sons birthday party I started to breakdown by the time everyone left our home I was up against the wall in our bedroom with a death grip on our pillows, shaking, crying, screaming, my entire body was in a knot and I thought my head was going to explode. Thank God no one other then my husband who was scared to death saw it. After he managed to get me down I slept for 14 hours. Ive been sick trying to get this stuff out of my system for the last week, clammy, night sweats, tired, miserable. I took it back to my Doctors office and told her to get rid of it because it wasnt going back home with me! This is one drug I will be reporting the negative side effects of to the FDA.

I have tried 3 other meds for my condition, none have worked as well as this med.  Within one dose I can feel my pain is less, plus I do not have the migraines, which is worth a bit of weight gain. I sleep through the night instead of getting up 5 or more times, I am a bit foggy in the AM but nothing more than what I am used too with the fibro. If you want a life without fibro pain or migraines than I would say this med is so worth the bit of weight gain. This is the only med that works for me in controlling my pain and migraines.

I don't have any headaches anymore and my stress level at work has went way down.  I used to come home from work venting everyday but not anymore.  This works very well for stress along with headaches.

Other	six, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	8/13/2009 6:32:40 PM	I was prescribed 10 mg of Amitriptyline last month because I dont sleep; I have chronic pain from Degenerative Disk Disease, PTSD, Night Terrors, and Depression. I came home from my doctors appointment and I looked this drug up on WebMD and started reading reviews, I ended up back at my doctor in tears trying to negotiate a way to not take this drug. She reassured me that this drug was safe and the very best option for me. I take this drug in combination with Hydroco/APAP5-500MG Vicoden and Fluoxetine-20MG Prozac. 10 MG of Amitriptyline helps me sleep and its supposed to help block the pain receptors, so far I seem to be in more pain then what is normal for me but its still new, we might need to adjust the dose to see if we can achieve that response. I have needed to take more Vicoden then I am comfortable with but so far Ive had more rest then Ive had in years, even on the nights when I have that wide awake sleep Im still resting, huge difference for me. I no longer wander my house at night, even when I wake up sometimes as many as six times a night I am able to just roll over and go back to sleep. Ive had none of the scary side effects that I read about on this site and am adjusting to this quite well. I love being able to go to bed and sleep!
Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	25-34	8/13/2009 4:18:36 PM	I was taking 10-15, 25 mg benadryl, a day so I could sleep at night. I was taking them during the day just so I could get tired before dark. Now I take 1 or 2 of these a couple of hours before I lay down and i fall right to sleep ans stay asllep all night. I might wake up once and get something to drink and use the bathroom, where as I was getting up all during the night, when i did finally fall asleep, when I was taking OTC sleep aids. Thank God for Amitriptyline!!!!

I have been increasingly tired all day and starting to crave sweets more and more. I am so glad to see that it is also effecting others the same. I thought I was just getting lazy. I want to sleep all day. I sleep very well at night but dont ever want to wake up. When I do, I dont want to do anything. I am now worried about the weight gaining. I am overweight as it is....ALTHOUGH not one migraine, which is fabulous.....Vanity is nothing compared to being migraine free!!!!

It worked wonderfully,except the sweets cravings,I had to lower the mg to 10 to control the cravings. I was using this med. for five years; at the fifth year my family and I noticed severe memory loss (small amnesia moments). I since got off the med. but now suffer from tremors and am considering using it again. Migraines were gone when I used it and I was more happy; maybe because it made me forget the things that would normally stress me or cause tention in my muscles. Pain or memory loss? what to do? Over all feeling happy beats feeling mad due to pain. I will be getting back on this med. soon. NOTE; if you read others comments on this drug; notice how many mention how they forget things.

I felt very foggy-headed most of the time, like I couldn't recall stored information easily. Every day, all day was a fight to stay awake. I felt that at any givent time I could fall asleep. I gain about 10 lbs. and craved sweets frequently. I had dry mouth and drank so many caffienated drinks throughout the day. My speech slurred at times. I was very constipated. I felt that reality was distorted most of the time. most of all, I felt that I was not me. My dose was lowered to 25 mg. about 3 weeks ago and I still have the same symptoms. I would rather deal with the pain.

I am so glad I am not alone.  I have been running and weight training more than ever in the past four weeks and I have gained pounds and it is not muscle! It didn't make sense and I was getting very frustrated.  My craving for sweets has gone off the charts which is so unusual for me.  Now I know that this med has got to go.  My migraines are less frequent and less severe and I sleep great.  However I am not willing to gain weight as a trade off.  Thanks to all for leaving your reviews, I now know that I am not alone.  Tine to go to the doc for a new med.

I have gained some weight but didn't realize it was from the med. Makes me feel less anxious about that. I was told that it takes at least 6-8 weeks to have full benefit of the med. I'm at that stage now &amp; will keep taking it as I think it does help. Especially w/sleeping. No other side affects for now.

I gained weight (two sizes) and constipated. I had a dry mouth, blurred vision but good sleep. All the side effects have passed. My hair near all fell out BUT it did get me though. Infact it was weired my 'happiness', probably because I survived Necrotising Fasciitus (the flesh eating bacteria). Its been 6 months and I want to stop it but I'm told that's not easy but overall it did the desired effect, despite the adverse effects.

It has helped me sleep well at night but it makes me so tired all day.  I just want to lay around and sleep.  Also, I've been wanting chocolate badly since I've been taking this.  I never craved chocolate.  
Neuropathic Pain	Maricarmen,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female		4/24/2009 6:21:58 PM	Hola. I have been taking this medication for a few months now for fibromyalgia, migranes, and insomnia. While it does ease the pains in my legs and arms, the migranes are worse than ever and it takes hours for me to fall asleep, no matter what time I take it. Recently I discovered that it may cause one to crave sweets, and lately that is all I want. Unfortuately, I've been gaining a lot of weight b/c of this. The dry mouth is also agravating but at least it doesn't interfer with my appearance or health. I plan to quit this ineffective medicine ASAP.

I still have headaches, but I sleep good. I would say I sleep well because every morning is like going through a fog, and I actually NEED caffeine to finally wake up. Currently, I am considering jumping through other hoops to resolve these headaches, and this annoying &quot;aura&quot; b.s.

The trick is to take it at least three hours before you want to go to sleep. I crave sweets, am thirsty. Gained 15 lbs. the first time. Stopped for three months am back on.I do like the weight gain.  I love that it helps me get a restful sleep. And i'm ready for the day when i awake. Feel nice and relaxed all day. Haven't had a bad migraine while on it. The trick for me is to roatate days taking it. and it keeps me mellow and focused. I feel like me again.

I always read the reviews, but I've learned I need to check back.  I've just been told I need to have nearly all my teeth removed from horrible decay from dry mouth! This stuff really helped with the insomnia &amp; pain at night (however, weird dreams &amp; sleep walking - cooking, washing dishes, eating, etc.)I'm not so sure about helping the depression.I drink a lot of water (up to and over a gal/day). Just started craving sweets (dr. said the new steroid may be doing that) &amp; gaining weight.Dr decreased dose to 25mg. I'm starting that today.  I will update this.Good luck fellow sufferers!

Only taking 25MG. but my craving for sweets is overwhelming. I NEVER crave sweets. Also, my muscles feel weak and I am embarassed by slurred speach. This was the reason I stopped last time. I plan to continue this time, at least for 1 month. Helps me sleep without neuropathy but it whears off soon after waking up. I feel oversedated &amp; just generally ILL.

I am definitely sleeping better and I wake up more refreshed than before. Immediately after I wake up, I feel very drowsy, the feeling disappears within half an hour to one hour. Also, my mouth is very dry, especially when I wake up. The pain in my muscles and joints has only decreased insignificantly. I do get fast heart beats at times, but it does not last. Sometimes I briefly feel slightly dizzy. My appetite and weight have remained normal so far. I am definitely more energetic and more focused at work and can finally monitor my daughters homework again after a long day of work. Unfortunately I still get the headaches, though, I think less frequently. I wonder if my doctor will increase my dose. I don't want more or stronger side effects, I'd rather be content with the improvements I am experiencing so far.

I have been living with pain for almost a year now. I have been on several different meds. I started with Trazadone 50mg then over time uped to 100mg then last 150mg and thats when i started having bad migraines and feeling like crap in the morning. Doctor started me on the amitrip a week ago so far i like it i also take celexa in the morning in combinatioin but the celexa 40mg isnt helping my anxiety started at 10mg worked my way up. I am 23 have told my doctor that I have been on xanax and klonipin for my PTSD and anxiety and it helped but he wants to explore more options before he gives me an addictive drug. Im just over my conditions taking over my life and wish my doc would listen but overall amitrip is better then trazadone by far!

I never really ate sweets before i started taking this. It's making me have crazy dreams and i'm doing things in the middle of the night that i can't remember. ive started kicking real bad in my sleep. i'm always thirsty. and about 2 hours after i've been up i start feeling like i took a xannax or something. i've also noticed that i'm losing my hair. i am not liking this medicine at all b/c of the side effects. but as far as preventing my migraines it's done okay

My doctor changed me to amitriptyline 10mg to start.  Then he bumped up my doseage to 25mg, then 50mg.  I started noticing that my hair was falling out at an alarming rate so I weened myself back off of it and no more hair loss.  Back on Cymbalta, but I've got to stop that one too because of the arm and leg swelling so badly.  I guess I wasn't meant to take these medications. Oh well.

I am so grateful I found this so that I can function. Now I only get a migrane when I have my period. It has also helped me be more even tempered, but it does make you very tired. I suggest taking it a few hours before you want to sleep and are just relaxing at home. It takes a while to get used to the drowsiness. That is my only complaint. Otherwise I have really been helped by this medication.

At first, I found it very hard to wake up in the morning, would sleep through my alarm and not wake up until someone came into my room, woke me up and waited until I was out of bed so I wouldn't fall back asleep. Gradually, I have gotten more used to the medication and although it helps me sleep through the night I can now wake up with my alarm clock. Currently, I only take 25mg at night and 50mg the week I get my period because my headaches are worse then. Overall, this drug has been very effective at reducing the frequency of my headaches. I used to have a headache nearly every day and 3 migraines a month. Now the headaches are much less frequent. Also, I take Zomig for the migraines and so far it is great. One side effect that I have noticed is very extreme, realistic, terrifying nightmares that usually seem to occur quickly after falling asleep. Also, the have decreased in frequency over the years.

Also, this pill has caused me to have difficulty waking up to alarms. Also, if I have missed one dosage my anxiety levels the next day are skyrocketed and I begin to obsess over my eating disorders. This pill is extremely difficult to get off of and if I had known that, I wouldn't have begun it at all. The migraine pain is better than the nightmares and mood swings! Good side? This pill has caused zero weight gain.

I finally went to my other doctor and asked him to help me slowly get off of it and he gave me a chart and I should be off of it in May. Now that I am taking in on different days and slowly coming off of it I feel different and I have more energy in the day but the nights I have to take I am not happy the next day I sleep and I am in a bad mood. So beware taking this pill It may help but the side effects I went through for eight years I'd rather have delt with the pain. I did research while I was on this Doctors tend to give this but before taking this see if there is a different medication to avoid the future problems of this pill.

Migraine Prevention	crinkle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/15/2009 8:52:14 PM	I have had migraines since I was 8yrs old. drug after drug nothing had worked until this drug. I get a better nights sleep since I started taking it 4 months ago. Don't wake up very quickly in the morning anymore. In fact I've slept thur my alaem a few times. Not a big deal. And I have noticed my temper has a shorter fuse. The only side effect that really bothers me is the weight gain. I have gone from a size 8 to a 12 in just the last three months. I have not changed my diet and the pounds just have added up so quickly.  Overall I am happy with the results I have gotten. From a migraine twice a week to maybe two a month. Now all I need is a drug to melt the weight without any side effects.
Depression	Silent7Reverie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	1/15/2009 2:30:20 AM	WHAT IS WRONG WITH DOCTORS THESE DAYS?  YOU CANNOT STOP MOST DRUGS COLD-TURKEY!  AND PATIENTS NEED TO TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY WHEN TAKING AN RX.  MANY DRUGS REQUIRE THAT THEY BE SLOWLY LOWERED OVER TIME, NOT STOPPED COLD-TURKEY, BECAUSE OF DANGEROUS SIDE EFFECTS!  TALK TO YOUR PHARMACIST AND YOUR DOC BEFORE STOPPING ANY - AND I MEAN  ANY- MEDS.

After a month of staying awake throughout the night. He increased the dosage to 50mg. Amitriptyline nightly has proven successful in pain reduction and sleep deprivation. The next day I feel a little groggy but once I am up and moving, I feel fine.

After many different tests and several doctors, I was referred to a neurologist who said I was experiencing &quot;menopause&quot; and he told em to take 1 pill every day at bedtime and see if it helped.  Within 10 days my vertigo had stopped, as did the nausea, and by day 12 my migraines ceased.  I am thrilled that such a low dose has relieved my symptoms - now I just wonder how long is this menopause crap going to last???

I cried so much and worried my self to death about getting cancer or some incurable disease and dying from it and im only 24. I also never slept. I started using this drug about six months ago and i sleep good and feel much better. I dont worry so much about every thing. only side effect i had was i didnt want to get up in the mornings but once i got up and got going i was fine. zoloft and lexapro made me nauseous and dizzy. I am very happy to say that i hadnt had any effects like that from this drug. it truly helped me.

I have been experiencing the sudden attraction to sweets (was not a big candy or sweet fan before) so concerned about weight gain.  Big bonus has been that i am getting 6+ hours of sleep each night!  They started me on 10mg doubling the dose every 3 days and to stop increasing if i begin having side effects... then will reRX at my effective dose.  Talk to your Dr about this one...

After 10 yrs of not taking it duw to other medical issues... Had a T-6-7 Sping injury that left me with only numbness and tingling from my rib cage to my toes, and upper arms.And chronic pain, and not being able to sleep, I am only on day 4 of restarting this med. And I do Sleep 7 hours before waking up with less pain. However the othersymptoms will never go away, A good nights sleep helps me function the next day. I havebeen extremly thirsty this go round, but as before I know it will go away the longer Itake it.  I have never gained weight from this drug as others have.For those of use with spinal injuries and chronic back painIt does the job very well. The longer takenthe better results. speaking from past experience, and hope to have the same results this time.

Have slowly gone to lower doses over the years. Can't tell any difference except I am having sleeping problems now. Have been off (25mg dose) for a month now. I had gained weight slowly, total of 40 pounds in 15 years. I am not a real exerciser, so that could be part of the problem. I am a 65 year old female with the thinking of a 35 years old! I thought when I stopped taking it that I might have more back pain but I don't.  So my advice to you is don't stay on it a long time in case it isn't really helping you with pain.

Hey, but I'm alive ;-)  Amitriptyline has been a blessing.  I've been taking it for 3 months and this is really the first time I've slept in years.  BUT -- and there's always one -- I've gained 6 pounds in 3 months.  I'm already overweight and have been fighting to get my weight down.  I see the doctor again in December.  By then I'll really be waddling like a fat old duck!  --But I will be well-rested.  It's a horrible trade-off for a good night's sleep.

I went from being underweight to being overweight.  I was 98lbs when I first started taking it and am now 150lbs.  Not happy with this at all.  Had to replace wardrobe twice now.  Have now stopped taking this med even though it did help my headaches but I couldn't handle the side effects (fast weight gain).  Headaches did come back after I stopped taking this med, went to the neurologist and he put me on different meds.  Hopefully it helps and my weight will return to normal.

I have to sleep with a towel under me. I like others have gained alot of weight. This medicine has also brought my bloop pressure and pulse way up. Here's the funny thing.......my doctor did not take me off this medicine. She said all my problems were because of Paxil. No more Paxil and these problems are getting worse. So she gave me hydroclorthyazide. Funny how it took me getting on this website to know I don't need that &amp; I definately will not take this medicine again. In my case, the good effects do NOT out weigh the bad.

It messed with my brain to the point that it took me an hour and a half to work out how to help my 4th grade son on a math problem. They switched me to this and now my memory is back where it should be. I have not had any of the bad side effects that everyone else lists here. I was having migraines hitting every other day. It took two or three weeks to get my dosage regulated right. I now take 100 mg every night. I started taking it 11 months ago and since I was moved up to the current dosage, I have had maybe 5 migraines hit. It works great for me. I know medication affects some people differently but I would not change from this one for anything else.

I thought it was due to hormonal changes since I am menopausal due to surgery.  It seems like its a combination of both! At first, the pill made me very groggy in the morning, but now, after 4 months of taking it, my body has adjusted.  I take one 25mg at bedtime. That seems sufficient to help me sleep although I do wake up in the middle of the night sometimes, but I get back to sleep.  It helps take the edge off the pain, I must admit that (I have fibromyalgia and arthritis) so in the morning I am not so stiff.  I do not like the weight gain so I am going to consult my doctor for alternatives.  Thanks for all the comments - they are very helpful.

I would wake up with  pain which prevented me from sleeping through the night. Before being prescribed this medicine, I could only sleep for about 4 hours then would wake up in tears. My quality of life was horrible. While on the medicine, I was very thirsty. I started drinking LOTS of water, sometimes up to a gallon a day.  I think this prevented me from gaining weight; in fact, I was able to lose weight and felt good due to being rested, as well.  I have NOT been taking it for a couple of years but think I will go back on it as menopause symptoms are interfering with getting any restorative sleep.  My dad was recently prescribed 75 mg for cluster headaches after trying several other medicines. It's working well for him, as well.  I think this is truly a wonderful medicine.

Started taking med 2 yrs ago and headaches no better. I gained 40 lbs and very upset.Stopped taking med. Friend suggested message theropy and that has helped the most and DR. prescribed it so insu. pays for it.  Migrains can come from tightening of muscles in neck and arms (can take years before migrains show up after a car accident). I highly recommend a few sessions and a book about pressure points with some Biofreeze to help relax muscles. It honestly works. The headaches are not gone but they are under control and I have only had 4 sessions and I am still learning. My muscles are so tense acupuncture may be my next step I hope this helps. I will report back.

Was size 8; am now size 12 and VERY unhappy with self. Also experience memory problems, grogginess/drunken feeling upon awaking, want to sleep longer, have constant CRAVING for sweets, am constantly hungry, have dry mouth, constantly clearing throat, drinking lots of water due to increase in thirst, constipation, lack of energy.  It HAS helped with prevention of migraines;  however, not worth it to me to continue taking.

Over the years have increased to 20mg which produced side effects of shakiness, ringing in ears, cold hands &amp; feet, heartburn, fast heartbeat, some nausea. As for weight gain, yes but minor and controlled with excercise and watching what you eat. If I don't take it , I don't sleep very well and my fibromyalgia pain flares up. Will be talking to Dr for alternative, but unfortunately most other sleep medications are very habit forming and not recommended for long term.

Migraine Prevention	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	4	5	5	Female	19-24	7/1/2008 12:41:16 AM	I was put on this when I was 19 to prevent headaches that I would get about everyday.  For about the first month, my headaches would be a little less often, but more severe.  After about a month of use, it really kicked in and I was headache free.  I didn't experience any of the side effects that others have been talking about.  I put on a little less than 5 pounds this past school year, but that could be the freshman 15 and not a side effect of the drug.  I have recently noticed that my headaches are slowly but surely happening more and more often now.  I don't know if that is due to it being summer and I have extremely bad allergys or due to the fact that I am getting immune to the effects of the drug (which I have been told can happen).  If it keeps going like it is, I might have to up the doage to experience the results that I had for about 6 months.  I'm hesitant to do this because of all of the side effects that are possible, but I believe being headache free is worth trying.  I believe I am on 25 mg a night which seems pretty low compared to others.  Overall, the drug has worked wonders and I hope that it continues to do so.

I'm going to give it till the end of the 4 weeks to see if anything changes. Oh, another thing is, I'm bipolar and have a fear that I may go into a mania.  
Migraine Prevention	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	5/30/2008 8:16:29 PM	I was in a very bad car accident and began having severe headaches all day and night long. My doctor (after 3 months of telling me ohhhh it will go away) sent me to a neurologist who put me on this medication 40mg a day. I have been on it for about 2 months or so. I still have the same terrible headaches and now have terrible pain in my ear, I have gained almost 15 pounds, sleepy all day long and extremely cranky all the time. I have a very active 3 year old to run after and I rather have the headaches then all the side effects. After the doctor decided to send me to a neurosurgeon the first thing he said was this is one of the worst medications and I should have listened to him, after reading these reviews I am stopping this med tonight.. I attempted to contact my neurologist but she is out of the office until Sept. NICE right.. and no one else there to help me so I took my neurosurgeons advise and am going to see a new doctor next week.

This medicine has really helped me to get at least 6 hrs. a night. It has helped so much with sleeping that I am better able to deal with the constant pain. I have had a few of the sides effects..numbness/swelling in hands. Dry mouth and blurry vision. But not bad enough to stop taking this. I highly recommend it for anyone with sleeping problems.

It is the first medication that actually did anything for me. It immediatly got rid of all of my headaches. The only side effects were tiredness (eventually that wore off) dry mouth, and weight gain. Those were well worth it, since i had gone from having headaches every day to not at all. But just within the past few days, it is just now starting to get warm and sunny here, so i have been outside alot more. Ever since i started being out in the sun, my face started breaking out really bad. My whole face was covered in these red bumps that look like a rash. I have realized that the bottle says to avoid sunlight, so i am pretty sure that is what it is from. I am going to stop taking it, because i cant deal with my face being like this. Has anything like this happened to anyone else? I will call my doctor to make an appointment to see if there is another medication i could switch to.

I only took 12.5MG each night.  I've never had another headache.  Also, I noticed that I had no more attacks of irritable bowel which was a great bonus.  Because I, ve taken it so long I have decided to go off of it.  I cut my pills in half.  This is my second week doing that and I plan on doing it for another week, then 1/2 every other night.It's dangerous to just stop taking it even though I had the lowest dosage.  I've had 2-3 nights of tough sleeping but I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing.  This medication worked very well for me with no side effects.  I was surprised to see such high dosages that other were on.  I am a 58 year old female.

I was put on this med. when I was 16, and now am 28. I stopped taking this when we decided to have a child. After that was over I returned to taking this med. Well, I decided I didn't want to take it anymore and stopped. Friday I was given topamax and was a confused zombie and could take care of my family, and called the doctor and now started something else. Inderal LA. Well, I almost feel like I may come back to this because it's been very good to me for the most part. It's the one pill that I have had zero side effects at all, nothing. After a while it seemed to not work as well as it did in the begining, but it still helped with reventing less headaches for me. I took it at night so the tired feeling wasn't bad, and when I woke up int he morning the first few days, I was groggy, but after that, fine. So, I do recommend this med to anyone who needs something it was a lifesaver for me, and chances are I'll be going back on it in the next month.

I take it in conjuction with 500 mg of magnesium and 500 mg of B2. The amitriptyline helps me sleep through the pain but has caused many problems for me including tooth decay,severe dry mouth, weight gain, anxiety, and increasing paranoia. I am in search of new treatment.

I am 32 and have suffered migraines since age 5.  I've taken this medicine for several years now and am searching for something else.  This med doesn't prevent as many migraines as I'd like, it causes drowsiness, uncontrollable body movements, dry mouth which leads to tooth decay, constipation, ringing in ears, cold fingers &amp; toes and irritability.  I would not recommend taking this for migraine prevention unless you have no other options.

I have gained 40 lbs and suffer from severe agitation and excitement.  I have also suffered with dry mouth, uncontrolable movements, constapation, persistent heartburn, restlessness, uncontrollable movements of my hands,ringing in the ears, nervousness, shakiness, sweating, unusual hunger, increased thirst, urination and constipation. I have stopped taking this med because of these side effects and encourge anyone else who begins to suffer of these side effects to please contact your doctor.

I know the &quot;depression&quot; is still there but I dont ride that roller-coaster hourly any more.  I am also on Effexor 300MG in the morning and the combination works well for me.  I have friends that could never take that high of a dose!  But my suicidal thoughts are gone, I feel back on track.  I admit that I have been thru the gamit of antidepressants before one doctor said &quot;lets try this...&quot;  I'm glad i waited.  Only side effets are, yeah, eating, mostly sweets, and dry mouth.  But i'm not gonna change meds for that!  I hope other people get help from it like I did.

This knocks me out and helps when I'm in a cluster period with the Migraines. But you need to ensure you dont take this late at night if you got an early up schedule because it will make you drowsy. Get the sleep and no problems. Never knew it was an anti-depressant drug.

The only two good side effects are I get more sleep and it helps with my back and hip pain. If I had read this before taking this drug, I would not have started it. But I have now learned that what works for some wont work for all. If you are thinking about taking this med, I would say take it. You most likly will have the same responce I have had from the drug. Dont let the bad side effects that some people have put on here scare you because you may just pass on the drug that really works for you. And works well!

Migraine Prevention	jsellman, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	1/20/2008 10:22:27 AM	When I first started taking this medication to hopefully decrease the number of migraines I get, it pretty much only helped with my insomnia. The dosage was increased to 50 mg I think, and it helps most times with the insomnia (but not always) but there are times when I still wake up with a migraine that is an 8-10 on a scale of 1-10. Like waking up with a hangover although you haven't had anything to drink. So honestly, I don't think it's working for the migraines. I recently started taking Fioricet for the migraines because Excedrin Migraine caused an ulcer. Although amitriptyline and fioricet can have adverse interactions, I don't think it's too bad. I also started tracking my moods because when I went on vacation for almost 2 weeks, I couldn't take it. When I started back, for like a week and a half to two weeks, it seems like I was easily agitated and irritable. It's better now I think...I'm still tracking.

Migraine Prevention	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	1/6/2008 11:22:14 PM	Really hard to wake up in the morning with this med.  Also have to deal with the weight gain after losing a bunch with another drug.  Works ok for a while, then less effective.  Currently combined with Topamax and it is ok again.   Haven't had a migraine for about 4 weeks, which is great!  Just don't have much energy...

Migraine Prevention	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	1/3/2008 10:07:51 AM	It has reduced my migraine intensity, but not frequency.  I can exercise now though so it has lessened my triggers.  I have gained about 10 pounds : (  This will not stop me from using it though because now I have more of a life.

The only thing that bothers me is the weight gain side effect.  I am not a big eater to begin with and truly watch what I eat anyway - but it still made me gain weight.

I prescribed 10mg doses once a day.  I followed that dosage for two weeks with no improvement.  I was instructed by my physician to increase the dosage to 20 mg.  This decreased the insomnia and general anxiety.  However, I do feel twitchy and have twice experienced short term ringing in my ears.

I was able to eat well again and gained back the weight I lost (plus a few more, but that could be do to all the muscle I've gained from being able to work out again).  It also helped with minor depression I was experiencing and possibly some dizziness caused by an allergic reaction to cipro a year prior.

Other	RiverCityAl, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	65-74	11/19/2007 10:38:55 PM	My doc presribed this medication for me following post herpitic neuralgia; I guess this happened after contracting shingles. I didn't ask for help with sleep, but the MD ordered this to be taken at bedtime.  I experienced some difficulty in the mornings with a feeling of slight drunkiness, especially if I have to get up early (less than 7-8 hours sleep).  Since I am a recovered alcoholic (no alcohol for over 10 years), I am particularly concerned about possible dependency, and getting to the point of enjoying the early morning numbness.All in all, I can't really tell if it's doing anything for or against my normal habits. But, the burning sensation on my chest and back are continuing; and it's a  h___ of a feeling.  I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.

Worked great for these conditions but I gained 60 lbs in about 10 months. Until reading this message board, I didn't know that it caused weight gain. I didn't know why I had gained so much, but now I have a pretty good idea. I have always been thin, unable to gain weight even if I wanted to. I was 5'8&quot; tall and weighed 110-115 lbs. Now I weigh almost 170. I am angry that I was not warned of this potential side effect.
