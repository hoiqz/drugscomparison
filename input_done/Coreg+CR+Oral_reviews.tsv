I expressed that I wanted to quit it, but he expressed that he it was very low dose, and that he was going to double it...so now I have been taking 6.25 mg for 1 week, and really can't drive a car + I can't even seen to get myself motivated to do my regular daily routine...just want to take a nap or stare.I am only 58 years old, and otherwise very healthy.Good thing I work from home, or I would be fired from job.I hope others have a better outcome than I.Kimberly
Other	katz, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	9/29/2011 6:21:30 PM	I was given coreg cr 80mg after having a heart attack. This has not worked well for me. I'm always tired, dizzy and unsteady, drowsy, joints ache, sleep too soundly, itchy patches on my skin, and heart still skips a beat occasionally. I previously told my doctor about this several times. he didn't really listen and said this medicine was best for me. I think the side effects worse than any good the medicine does.

Another possible reason for taking it is to prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation. My a-fib was controlled with an ablation. Side effects of the medication have been dizziness, sedation, sleepiness,and loss of mental acuity. In my opinion the side effects outweigh any possible benefits.
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	55-64	3/14/2011 8:05:47 AM	This med was prescribed due to hypertension and to lower heart rate and strain on heart. I took 40MG along with Exforge and HCTZ.  My heart responded well with BP and heartrate at very acceptable rates, sometimes below ideal.  Side effects were not constant but several showed up.  Tiredness and sleepiness were constant.  Woke up at least twice per night. Had heavy feeling in legs when exercising.  Had occasional dizzinesss and a sort of spaced out feeling.  Most unusual side effect was profuse sweating.  Very pleased with the control of BP and heartrate but side effects are annoying to say the least. Have changed to Bystolic oral and hope for fewer side effects.

High Blood Pressure		3	4	1			9/1/2009 1:40:01 PM	I had a really hard time sleeping while taking this med, and I was so spaced out during the day that I could barely function (office job).  I also became pretty deeply depressed, which may have been a byproduct of my exhaustion and spaciness.  In all, this is the worst medication I've ever taken.  My doctor switched me to Bystolic with an alpha blocker in the evening, which has been equally effective treating my high blood pressure, but with minimal side effects.
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	55-64	6/24/2009 4:41:14 AM	Coreg CR did lower my heart rate so that my heart no longer raced on occasion.  However, my blood pressure did not go down.  The side effects of complete lethargy to the point of just wanting to sit or sleep all day and a complete lack of sex drive made this medication a nightmare.  Just switched to Bystolic and after only 1 week have tons more energy.

Coreg CR has worked well in keeping my heart rate and bp at a liveable rate. Before my bp was excessive and now 90/60, where the doctor wants it. Heart rate is low, but that is where the doctor wants it as well. I also take LISINIPRIL with coreg cr. I would recommend this drug to severe heart failure patients even though the side effects of tiredness is there, I was much more tired before I started taking coreg cr.
