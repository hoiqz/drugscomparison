Other	TravelingSoul42, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	9/4/2012 11:34:46 PM	As I read the 'low satisfaction' reviews I saw myself in most, if not all, of these women. I had taken one type of BC before this and it was terrible for me. I switched to Tri-Sprintec and it worked for everything I needed it to. Until recently I thought I was losing my mind, conversations seem like dreams, extreme fixation on certain things, examining them closely with such distorted vision. The HEADACHES made me vomit, I would stay in my room for hours. My sex drive is shot, it's so frustrating, I feel like an impotent male. My anxiety triggers were right under the surface, I would watch fights from the backseat of my mind, little to no control over what I was saying. I take an anti-depressant for God sake, and I am back in bed feeling defeated?! No, I'm done, this pill made me think I was becoming Schizophrenic, I'm done. BEWARE, you have a choice, DON'T MAKE THE WRONG ONE.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/3/2012 12:36:02 AM	I have been taking tri -sprintec for 2 months now, i just started on my 3rd month. This is the first form of any bc i have taken. I  was prescribed sprintec for my abnormally spiratic and long periods. In the first month of taking it, i was miserable. My first menstrual cycle while using sprintec lasted 2 weeks and was very heavy. I was kind of freaked out. But i took my doctors advice and waited it out and continued to stick with it. Here i am going on month 3 and am extremely pleased. I now know almost to the day that my cycle will begin and have 3 wonderful cycle free weeks every month! My advice to anyone starting bc for the first time with my kind of situation is to wait it out! It is well worth it in the end.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	19-24	4	5	4		19-24	9/2/2012 5:40:48 PM	I have only been taking this for about a month, and when reading reviews I was almost nervous to try it, there were several negative remarks, even when taking it for a short time. However, I started taking it for help with ovarian cysts. At first I noticed my skin (already had acne) broke out a little worse than usual, however has significantly cleared up and my skin looks much better than it did before I started taking it! I've had no noticeable symptoms, crazy moods, spotting or weight gain (if anything may have lost some). At first it I noticed a little stomach upset, but that very well could have been other factors, or maybe the pill, Either way, it went away after a week. Overall, I had no problems though with this medicine. It just depends your body and how it may react to it.  
Birth Control	Mae, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/31/2012 1:13:44 AM	I love this pill. Super easy, I just keep it on my nightstand and take it before bed. I have had no side effects at all, actually I'm less moody/ pmsy then on no birth control and my acne is clearing up! I am very pleased and have actually lost some weight too!
Birth Control	jaidot109, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	13-18	8/27/2012 7:17:50 PM	I just started this pill today and if its as bad as how most of the women that commented said it is I'm going to the doctor and getting on a different BC because I'm blind enough and I don't need any more pain at all that is not need!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	8/22/2012 10:56:29 PM	I just started Tri Sprintec after taking Yaz for years.  My insurance changed and it got too expensive to buy Yaz.  So my doctor put me on tri-srpintec.  I haven't been very satisfied with it so far.  I feel awful all the time.  Feeling emotionally drained too.  I sleep all the time and lay on the couch a lot.  Also, the first week I took it I had severe stomach cramps and diarhea.  It was awful!  I'm still on my first pack so I will give it time for the side effects to get better.  If not, I'll be swtiching to somehting else.  I can deal with the physical side effects much better than I can the mental/emotional ones. :(
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	13-18	8/16/2012 10:29:23 AM	slight bleeding during the month
Birth Control	XQ, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/7/2012 3:19:49 AM	I started off taking Ortho Tri Cyclen, but soon switched to this generic alternative because the price was much more affordable.I've been on it for almost a year now and it has given me no serious side effects, just some moodiness/extra emotional sensitivity during the first month.  It's doing its job by preventing pregnancy, and it also shortened my periods by a couple of days and made them FAR less painful.As far as physical changes, I don't think it had an effect on my breasts at all and there has never been any weight gain.  If anything, I think I actually LOST a few pounds, even though I was already tiny at 105 lbs.  My skin was always clear, so I can't tell if there was any change. I would also say that it slowed my sex drive slightly. Nothing too devastating though.I'd recommend this pill to anyone who goes through very painful or long periods and is seeking relief.
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	ApplesofGold, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	8/2/2012 3:22:23 PM	I was nto satisfied with Tri-Sprintec. I was fine for the first month. Then the second month, I began to notice my outer thighs were itchy. Didn't think anything of it. (I thought it was allergies since I have seasonal ones). Then the third month, it began to make hives on my legs and spread up and down my thighs. The third month it was pretty severe and I was itchy, all the time. When I got on my 4th week of the third month, the rash moved to my inner thighs. I stopped taking it and now I am symptom free after 2 weeks.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	8/2/2012 1:01:16 PM	This pill is the devil! I have never had so many side effects in my life. I thought I was going crazy. I took it for 3 months like my doctor said to stabilize my hormones and I was severely depressed, crying at the drop of a hat, irritable, very moody, bad headaches, nauseous, and fighting with my boyfriend for no good reason. I have never had PMS before this pill and it gave it to me. Not to mention it increased the length of my periods and gave me horrible cramps. I would not recommend this pill to my worse enemy. Stay away from it!! 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/25/2012 2:24:11 PM	Have used for over 5 years. Very effective for birth control. Actually shortened my period to three days. My cycle comes right on time like clockwork. In the second row of pills, my face breaks out on my cheeks and I get a tinsy bit agitated. Tried Yaz for 4 months because of these side effects and had a horrible experience with skipped cycles. Back on this med with hopes that my running an average of 15 miles/week and using my face mask more than once a month will help with the side effects I previously experienced.
Birth Control	nasagirl2012, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	7/18/2012 11:33:02 PM	This is the only type of birth control I have ever taken. I am into my third month, and it has worked great so far. For the first two weeks I experienced some mood swings and stomach pains, but those quickly went away after I established my regimen.I have only been sexually active for a short time, but they have worked great so far. They have not helped with the heaviness or length of my cycles, but they are more 'on time' than before. Overall, a good pill if you can remember to take it everyday!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	7/16/2012 11:43:42 AM	I started this pill 3 and a half weeks ago. The first 2 and a half weeks i was naueous and had stomach pain every single day.  I would take my pill at noon everyday and not eat at all after my pill because of the nausea but the past week I havent been nauseous at all and feel right back to my old self.

Birth Control	Sarah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/9/2012 1:40:48 PM	Been on this pill for 1.5 years and I have had no major issues.  My periods were around 3 days which I of course loved, and it helped with cramps a lot!  Only thing I didn't like was that I felt like my sex drive was non-existant but I've had that issue with other pills before. No weight gain, acne, or emotional issues.
Birth Control	Ellasmommy221, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	7/5/2012 1:18:18 PM	After reviewing other comments now I know what has been going on with me for the past 8 months. I feel like im going crazy, super moody, almost ended my marriage, NO SEX drive what so ever, Chest pains that are painful, acne, my knees feel as though their going to give, emotional over every thing, and no motivation to do anything. I can't wait to tell mu husband as of to day im no longer taking this medicine again. My whole family has noticed changes in me and I just thought it was depression but after reading about 20 comments and 18 saying the same thing I now know what I need to do. Thanks everyone for your comments its helped me!  
Birth Control	Ariel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	7/5/2012 2:47:21 AM	I been taking this pill for 3 months. Everything is fine, no mood swings or cramps. I do have acne and I, guess it's sorta clearing up. The only side effect that i'm having and I haven't read anybody else write is that I have heavy discharge. But other then that it's working fine. 
Painful Periods	JP, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	6/28/2012 8:59:36 PM	I have been on this pill for at least 2 years now. My breasts do get tender from time to time but I also have fibro-cystic disease and this pill actually has helped relieve the symptoms of that. Along with that my periods, which used to be extremely heavy and painful are now a controlled 4-5 days long, much later and minimal cramping; just enough to tell me &quot;IT'S&quot; here. I have had no weight gain with this pill, although I hear some do, and my acne is not as severe. If you have extremely heavy and painful periods this is a good pill to ask your doctor about.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	2	Female	35-44	6/26/2012 9:11:04 PM	I am about 75% through my first pack and have had a rough time. My symptoms are so close to pregnancy that I am finding it weird. It is like being pregnant only my symptoms are actually worse than first trimester symptoms. I am tired and falling asleep halfway through the day, feeling depressed for no reason, not sleeping at night as I feel anxious for no reason, my breasts are tender, I have spells of nausea, food cravings, and food aversions. I am trying to stick it out to see if the side effects go away, but my husband already is begging me to switch! I feel like Mrs. Hyde!

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	lou, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	6/19/2012 9:22:30 PM	This pill is the worst birth control pill I have ever been on. It took away my acne at first, then brought it back ten fold. since i started i can't stay away from food, yet i am so nauseous that i have actually thrown up twice. this pill messed my system up. i haven't been able to stop crying, either. 
Birth Control	funny_smiles, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	6/17/2012 7:50:13 PM	Well, my doctor changed me from monophasic Ortho-Cyclen which I was taking for 6 years with no negative side effects into triphasic Tr-Sprintec because insurance doesn't cover my old one, and the triphasic pill supposed to better mimic women cycle...I'm starting next week. I'll keep you posted unless I'll die by then. I guess that woudn't be a surprise after reading all these horrible reviews.

Had no energy, sex drive, or appetite.  After my third pack I spent three days in the hospital with a substantial blood clot in my left leg.  I would think before taking!!!

The pills work just fine and yes I did have terrible mood swings for the first three months, but let's face it, it's birth control, it changes your body so you have to give your body time to get used to it. After the first three months my attitude went back to normal since my body got used to the medication. I love how affordable this medicine is and it's extremely easy to take and it is also very effective!

Let just say it didn't work.  I had such serve headache, always feeling down which I have never felt before, no sex drive at all!  This was the first time I have taken this pill.  My doctor was trying to save me some money bc my normal pill would have cost around $75 a month bc of my insurance.  Well just found out two weeks ago I am 9 weeks pregnant thanks to this pill.  I never ever ever missed a pill in my life.  Always took it the same time every single day.  I wish I could sue the maker of this pills.  I wouldn't advise anyone to take this at ALL!!!

Total lack of appetite and sex drive.  Was finishing my third pack and ended up in the hospital for three days with extensive blood clot. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/26/2012 9:54:28 PM	Very pleased with this medication, even moreso than the name brand version. It's even shortened my periods to 3-4 days, most of which are pretty light. No noticeable side effects. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a new prescription.

I HAVE HORRIABLE MOOD SWINGS AND HAVE BEEN DEPRESSED AND UNTILL I READ OTHER PEOPLE SAYING THE SAME THING I JUST THOUGHT I WAS GOING CRAZY! IVE BEEN NASEOUS VOMMINTTED 3 TIMES SENSE STARTING THE PACK. I JUST FINISHED MY FIRST MONTH ON TUESDAY.  
Birth Control	Cessy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	5/16/2012 3:10:04 PM	Pure exhaustion sine I started this pill. I have gone through two pregnancies and this side effects of this pill mimic the worste of the first trimester symtoms but without any relief. Nausea that does not go away, bloating, exhaustion, irritability, headaches and until my body adjusted (as much as it could to this poison) I had terrible anxiety from it as well. Meds work differently on everyone I guess but I say try at your own risk. I can barely stand to finish the pack so that I can make a switch!!
Acne	1335, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	5/2/2012 12:28:35 AM	This is the first  birth control I have ever used so I don't really have anything to compare it to. Positive effects: less acne, bigger boobs, lighter periods, and no babies!!! Negative effects: weight fluctuation but with a light workout the bloating isn't noticeable, extreme naseau when consuming alcohol on this product. Every morning after I drink  I have a hangover x 1,000 I throw up all day and am curled in a ball,it's terrible.  Other than that this product is great my cramps are lighter as well as bleeding. It does make me a bit depressed during some weeks, and I become easily upset but that could just be because I am a woman!
Birth Control	agh75, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	5/1/2012 1:17:10 PM	HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE pill, I've been on this pill for 3 months now &amp; since being on this pill my mood swings are so severe, depression, cry all the time or I want to, normally a happy person and on the go, now just want to curl up into a ball, by myself &amp; cry my eyes out!!!  Feel like a completely different person, so much I don't even like myself on this med! And sex drive has completely vanished!!!  It's not worth saving a couple of bucks each month for me to feel like this, this sucks!  Ready to go back to my normal pill, spend the extra money &amp; be back to my normal self again!!! Would not recommend this med to anyone!

Also I've always had terrible cramps and heavy blood flow. I've been on tri-sprintec for exactly one month and I'm pretty happy with it. I do see a good change in my acne. On this period my cramps aren't as bad as normal but I have gotten break through bleeding. My breast are also heavier and more sensitive. I have gotten weird stomach pains and im not sure why , but I would recommend this product if you want to clear your acne , enhance your breast size , and eliminate terrible cramps.

I am very happy with this pill. I havent had any negative side effects. No break through periods, abnormal discharge or mood changes. You must allow a good 3 months for the pill to be in your system before you can determine the real side effects you will have. It's changing your hormones therefore at first you will feel different. I highly recommend this pill. :)

I've definitly not gotten pregnant, my acne has completly cleared up and I've actually lost 10 pounds without trying. So, it has really worked well beyond my original reason for taking it.  
Birth Control	Nicole, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	4/9/2012 10:19:58 AM	This has been the worst birth control pill I have ever tried! I feel like an emotional train wreck. Already suffering from pretty severe anxiety, this pill has increased it as well as making me feel somewhat depressed. I can go from happy to snappy in the blink of an eye. My boyfriend has noticed the change in my mood and is thankful we found out what's finally wrong with me. I have also had awful cramps and constant spotting. I feel like I have gained some extra pounds and look four months pregnant. I can even see the weight in my face. I also have had severe breakouts. I only made it through one month of this awful bc and I will be going to my doctor so I can get on something else. Ladies, don't take this!!! It's awful!!!!!
Birth Control	SadgirlMadgirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	4/8/2012 3:45:03 PM	Beginning week 2 after switching from LoEstrin FE (which did wonders for my skin and overall happiness! insurance wouldnt cover it anymore, so it got too expensive *sigh*). I have felt either very angry or very sad with little happiness in between. I snap easily. I cry even more easily. I'm an emotionally sensitive person to begin with, but this is making it so much worse. I've had strange stomach pains and discharge (as if I'm still in the end days of my period, which ended 5 days ago). Will be asking for a different pill as soon as I can.

Birth Control	k.tina, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	3/21/2012 3:23:55 PM	I was off of birth control for almost a year when I decided to get back on birth control due to my relationship status change. So my primary doctor prescribed Tri Sprintec because it was low in cost. I really do not like this birth control pill at all...Ive been on and off birth control for a very long time and never had any side effects like I am having with this particular pill. This first week was horrible. I was an emotional wreck...the weeks following, I have had horrible stomach and bowel movement issues. Ive even tried to change my diet which has not helped whatsoever. Im going to give this medication 3 more months and if the symptoms continue Im going to switch.
Birth Control	girlygirl77, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	3/20/2012 9:23:16 AM	i have been on Tri Sprintec for about a month now and honestly i havent seen any major changes. Everything has stayed the same except for the fact that my breasts are very tender to the touch and fill much heavier even though i havent noticed a change in them growing wise. i have never had bad acne and i still have clear skin. I noticed in the first two weeks my mood could change very quick and sometimes i over-react more to things than i would if i wasnt on the birth control. Overall i would say this is a good form of birth control and ill continue to use it.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	19-24	3/8/2012 11:55:38 PM	I had been on this pill for nearly four years when I stopped by accident (I'm in college and didn't have time to go get it refilled). In less than a week I (and the people around me) noticed a major improvement in my mood. After being off of it for almost 2 months, I feel much better than I have for the past 4 years. I never realized how much tri-sprintec made my mood change. I'm glad to be off of the emotional roller coaster this pill took me on.
Birth Control	Tink13, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	3/5/2012 5:23:11 PM	Tri sprintec is the worst pill on the market I'm so glad I'm back on ortho tricyclen as of yesterday. I've been taking it for 3 months and I have the worst vaginal itching and dryness but my doctor keeps saying I dont have an overgrowth of yeast so it's not an infection. My sex drive isn't completely gone, but being dry has made it unpleasant, even my periods are unpleasant when using tampons because of no discharge. Not to mention I have pityriasis rosea now (a skin rash of red patches all over my torso) which appeared about one month into me taking tri sprintec. I seriously thought that I was having major unexplained vaginal problems and this rash issue until I started doing some research and reviewing online of Tri Sprintec and saw that I'm not the only one with these issues and it has calmed me down a lot! Also the acne is so bad proactiv doesn't even work on me.

Birth Control	none, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	3/4/2012 7:14:30 PM	the whole first month was pretty awful. mood swings for the first few days. it made me nauseated randomly for about 2 weeks and extremely fatigued for the first three. im starting the fourth week today and all side effects have worn off. still feel fatigued every now and then though.
Birth Control	boiler1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	2/28/2012 5:48:12 PM	I started taking Tri-Sprintec when we moved and switched health care providers.  I have been on birth control for almost 17 years and never had any issues...until I started Tri-Sprintec.  Over the  past two years, I noticed increasing amounts of nausea, fainting/lightheaded feeling, dizziness, trouble sleeping, mood swings, anxiety, depression, low sex drive, and random pains in my legs, chest, arm and shoulder. I also had problems with my left leg going numb almost every night and I would get headaches/pains just on the right side of my head. I discussed all this with my doctor who ran blood work to check for blood clots, vitamin D, thyroid, etc...but all tests were normal.  He basically told me that I was suffering from seasonal depression. I didn't agree with him and began tracking my symptoms and found a pattern within my monthly cycle.  I immediately became suspicious of the pill and started to research it.  I could not believe how many people had the same issues on this pill!  I finally found my answers!  Within a week of quiting Tri-Sprintec I was back to my normal self and it feels great!!! I will NEVER take this pill again and am very hesitant of trying any others.  There are plenty of hormone-free birth control options available now which make more sense than ever now.
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	19-24	2/28/2012 5:02:52 AM	This pill is HORRIBLE. I've been on it for two months and it's been the worst two months of my life. My breasts are tender the majority of the time, so much so I can't sleep on my stomach anymore. I had trouble wearing my contact lenses, and just today started an irregular period with the worst cramps of my life. Don't take this pill, you will be sorry. Pay more for something that works better and isn't so full of hormones. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	2/28/2012 1:21:58 AM	Horrible pill. I was on a different birth control pill before and never once experienced these side effects. I've only been on this pill for 8 days and have been sick to my stomach, nausea, vomiting, extreme fluid retention, just overall feeling sick. This pill is definitely not for everyone!   
Birth Control	mrs.m, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	2/27/2012 9:43:32 PM	I began taking BC at 17 and had bad experiences with the first two different pills that I tried. My doctor put me on this one to help prevent ovarian cysts, which run in my family. The 1st month was terrible, I had symptoms so bad, I thought I MUST be pregnant. No, just the pill. I have been on this pill around 3 years now, and absolutely hate it. I didn't realize until recently how this pill has made me miserable over the years, and it's been the worst the past 6 months. I gained 10 lbs. immediately after starting this pill. I began having numerous yeast infections and suffering from terrible mood swings, when I am typically a happy, bubbly person. I noticed a major decrease in my sex drive and extreme vaginal dryness. My husband asked me if I wasn't attracted to him anymore, and that is not the case at all. It is so frustrating, and I end up crying over this pill so often! Recently began having chest pains, leg cramps, varicose veins, breast tenderness, and fatigue. I have finally convinced my husband that there are easier ways to prevent a pregnancy and will not be taking any more of these awful pills. I am so happy that it is the week for the placebo pills! I will be calling my OB/GYN TOMORROW!!! Do not take this pill unless nothing else works.

Birth Control	Geeez, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	2/15/2012 5:01:10 PM	I am now going on to my second month with this  pill &amp; my overall experience with this birth control pill has been excellent. My moods haven't really been effected, expect the first couple of days I began the pill, I sometimes have slight headaches but even before I began the pill I had headaches so I'm not going to blame it on the pill, I have had no weight gain, when I started my period I didn't have ANY cramps like I usually do, nor do I ever feel nauseated. I love this pill &amp; it works great for me!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	25-34	2/15/2012 1:57:14 PM	I switched to this pill becauses ortho was to expensive and wasn't covered by insurance! I have been taking it for 3 months now, the worst 3 months ever. I cry all the time, and I am in bad mood most of the time. And normally I'm a happy person. I have gained weight over the past few months, which hasn't help my emotional state. I have cut back on food and execrise more to try to get the weight off!! I have one more week of this taking this awful pill and I will be coming off this birth control. I honestly feel like I am going to lose it somedays. I read the reviews before taking and I thought no it will not happen to me, I will be fine. Well the reviews were correct!! Please do not take this pill!!! 
Birth Control	Guest, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	19-24	2/14/2012 8:29:33 AM	I have been on this bc for about 5-6 months now. I didn't really realize that the reason for my mood change and my depression was because of this until I read these comments. I also have bad dreams constantly. It is effective, in the fact that it has kept me from becoming  pregnant. I also haven't been breaking out nearly as bad as with my last bc. I am getting a discharge though and i'm going to a doctor soon to see if it's because of Tri-Sprintec. As far as pains in my abdomen and tender breast, that has not occurred. As for sex drive, I think mine is just as healthy as ever. 
Birth Control	dy90, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	2/12/2012 9:35:49 AM	Birth control newbie. On it for only a week. So far, so good. Light nausea. Did vomit the second day of use. Mood swing? No. Weight gain? No. Just have to eat less, exercise often. Will keep posted after using first pack.
Birth Control	1st time user, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	19-24	2/10/2012 8:27:36 PM	Just started birth control. Tri sprintec was recommended by my doctor because he said it would help clear acne- no changes yet. This is day 5 of taking the pill. The first 3-4 days I've felt nausea here &amp; there during the day, but thats the only side effect I've had to endure for now. It hasn't affected my mood like it has with others, but my sex drive is low, and I find myself more hungry (which will probably be the cause for weight gain later). I have a 3-month supply to try it out then I'll report to my doctor if I feel like switching. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	2/8/2012 11:55:17 AM	This pill is alright. I havent had any major side effects but what i did get was weight gain, cramps, and breast tenderness (which i feel is worse than all). Over all it has served its purpose in preventing pregnancy!
Birth Control	LLu, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	2/7/2012 8:03:43 AM	After reading the reviews about this pill I was scared to start it, and now I see what everyone was talking about!! Horrible pill!!  I started this pill on a Wednesday and by that Sunday I had crying for 3 days straight..I'm talking hysterical sobbing which is so not like me...when I wasn't crying over the slightest thing, I was SOOO insanely irritable that I would have lost it on someone if they even looked at me the wrong way...again...so not me!! To top it off I had headaches constantly which is not something I normally deal with.  This pill was awful and I'm so glad to be off of it!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/4/2012 2:05:31 PM	Been on this BC for about 3 months and have not had any undesirable side effects as of yet.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	2/1/2012 9:27:52 PM	I have been on this BC for one year now. Since starting this BC I have had the following side effects that I did not experience before I was pregnant but thought that these side effects were just from having my child.Mood swingsIrritabilityNO Sex driveSevere headaches w/ neck pain 2-3 times a monthWeight gainLower abdominal pain

My skin broke out, I've had hot flashes, terrible depression and nausea for over 3 days. I'm taking a pregnancy test very soon.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	Jennielee, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	1/30/2012 9:47:12 PM	This was the worst birth control I have ever taken! I need the pill in the first place because without it I wouldn't have a period! When I first started taking Tri Sprintec January 2011, and it helped enough. I gained 20 pounds since, and I have had mood swings, but all in all it allowed me to have a period and not get pregnant.. so I coped. Sometime in June/July of 2011 my periods started coming irregularly. I would either not get a period again, or i would get two in a month or i would get it late, or early.. not sure what happened. I switched to Junel and am now very satisfied. Losing the weight and everything!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	1/30/2012 9:36:32 PM	I've been taking this for 3 months and I am so happy that this will be my last month! Ever since I started taking the pill, I now get severe stomach pains that last all day, ortho is more expensive but I never had any side effects! 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Ana, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/30/2012 12:28:40 AM	i used to take trinessa and was switched to this when i switched pharmacies because they didn't carry trinessa. i've been taking it for a little over than 2 months and only side effect i notice is a little bit of nausea every now and then. but it doesn't last long. other than that everything is fine. actually made my period a lot lighter than when i was on trinessa. and i have not lost my sex drive!! :)
Acne	Ebbd, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	1/29/2012 12:43:40 AM	I have experience NO side effects what so ever on this pill that i can notice. No weight gain.. and since i been on it i haven't broken out. The 1st week my appetite increased slightly. I know i haven't been on it long but i figured if i was going to experience side effects i would have by now
Birth Control	Girly13662, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	35-44	1/27/2012 2:33:23 PM	I have been on this medication for a few years now and never noticed any side effects until now.  My sex drive is almost non existent, and I have been very moody lately which is probably the reason why my bf and I haven't been getting along.  I am always tired...always looking for a spot to catch a nap.  I originally took it for acne but since I am sexually active, it has served its purpose for preventing pregnancy.  I think it has made me unable to lose weight...not so much gaining it, but just a harder time to lose it.  I am 36 years old and at this point in my life, if I go off of it and got pregnant, I wouldn't be upset.  But I am also on it for cysts on my ovaries which can be uncomfortable at times when I am not on this medication.  I am going to my gyno soon because I need to switch to something else...if not just because of the sex drive and tiredness alone.
Painful Periods	Ari-Cait, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	3	Female	19-24	1/26/2012 6:25:55 PM	I've only been on this pill for a week&amp;1/2. So far I've had a Migraine, and constant lower back pain. But the back pain may be due to my kidneys(I drink to much coffee) I'm waiting to see if it helps to stop my painful periods. I would get sick, have diarrhea, killer cramps, I would be in bed All day. So I really hope this works. But as for the back pain, has anyone else gotten that? I would like to know. :) 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/24/2012 1:39:37 PM	Been on this pill for 6-7 years.  Had mild nausea first few days of the month for the first 2 months, but that went away.  Periods were usually lighter and only 3 days.  I used to have pretty bad acne, but being on this drug cleared up my skin 100%.  After 6-7 years I am only changing to a new pill because since turning 30 my periods have gotten heavier and I'm going to try something else.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	1/20/2012 1:12:49 AM	Began this birth control in June and it caused a 10 lb. weight gain and complete loss of sex drive. It also caused my vaginal wall to thin out and become inflamed; which creates severe discomfort on the rare times that my BF and I make love. Visited my OB today and got switched to a different BC with a higher estrogen content (which my OB said should help).

The only time I showed ANY side effect was Nausea the first month of taking this Birth Control. I was worried to start this pill from all the bad reviews but I this pill is perfect, at least for me. I have been on it a little over a year now and still without child, love that ! I always recommend my BC to people. :)

Birth Control	bea, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	25-34	1/8/2012 9:27:52 PM	I am finishing up my first month of this BC.  I have been spotting almost non-stop. After reading the side effects, this may be common for the first couple months of use.  Overall, it is an annoying condition, but nothing that I would consider painful or hinders my life.  I am sure time will improve my experience. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/5/2012 1:06:17 PM	I have been taking Tri Sprintec for a few years. I haven't had any problems at all. I take it around the same time every night. I have PCOS so I need this to regulate my cycles and help with the symptoms of PCOS as well as birth control. I'm very satisfied with this birth control pill. 
Birth Control	Lucy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	12/28/2011 5:21:05 PM	I have been on Tri-Sprintec for over 4 years and have not experienced any problems from it.  No weight gain, no nausea, stomach pains, etc.  I'm a non-smoker.  I try to take my pills at the same time everyday but it doesn't always work out that way.  I mean there have been times where I have had to double up several times because I have forgotten to take them and I am still without child.  I believe in Tri-Sprintec, my husband and I have not used any type of protection in two years and it's still working great for me.  I still have acne breakouts so I can't really speak on the effectiveness it has for that although I've never had a serious issue with acne, just a bump or two here or there.  As far as the pharmacy switching up your pills it really depends on the pharmacy you go to and if they carry Tri-sprintec, so if I switch pharms I make sure they carry Tri-sprintec before I take it to them. But overall I say give it a try.  It works for me.
Birth Control	heathermarie,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female		12/28/2011 12:12:53 PM	This pill cleared my acne up really good, but when it came time to take the placebos I would start my period immediately and start breaking out with deep cycstic acne on my chin (which takes weeks to clear up if it even does) and I would bleed from the first placebo until three active pills in, resulting in 10 day periods. I also became very depressed, to the point of withdrawing from my friends and family and crying myself to sleep a lot. I have switched off the pill and I feel like my old self is returning.

Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	lstewy412, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	12/24/2011 7:51:39 AM	This is the first BC I've ever used and I'm so happy with it,. Since I was 13 I have had extremely painful periods due to ovarian cysts and I was tired of it effecting my everyday life and activities but now I can tolerate the cramps, they get intense from time to time but nothing a otc pain killer can't handle I've had no weight gain,  weight loss actually. And no other side effects. I also recently became sexually active and BC helps remove a lot of worry. Overall, very satisfied! 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	12/16/2011 9:26:35 PM	This is my first time on birth control and it has not been a positive experience. I've only been taking it for 6 days and I've had the worst nausea of my life. I took the pills with food at night and I would wake up in the middle of the night with anxiety. My nausea would last ALL day and night. I also noticed large clumps of hair coming out when I showered. I will be prematurely terminating my use of this medication. 
Birth Control	Kato, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/6/2011 4:44:11 PM	I read large numbers of reviews for birth control before I began taking it. To be honest, I was frightened by all the negative reviews for Tri-Sprintec. Then I remembered something I learned in my business degree: the very dissatisfied are the loudest. I vowed at that point no matter what my experience was, I would write a review. I began taking Tri-Sprintec in January 4 months before my wedding. I chose not to tell my fiance when I started so that if he noticed hormonal mood swings, I would know that this was not the right pill for me. I had no emotional problems. I'd struggled with acne all though high school and college. Tri-Sprintec continues to clear my skin. I have had no weight gain or issues that others have reported. My cramps which used to be very severe and almost gone and can be marginalized with OTC pain killers.My only complaint is that the pharmacy keeps changing the pills that I'm on. First it was Tri-Nessa, Then Tri-Preventum, Then Tri-Sprintec. It's hard to keep track of what prescription I am taking.Last, be aware. One of those three was changed due to recall. The sheet of pills had been placed in upside down. I now pay attention to make sure that color the inactive pills are supposed to be is the color that they are so I don't take the wrong week.Overall, I'm very satisfied, and I'm not pregnant after 6 months of marriage, which was my main reason for choosing birth control. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	12/6/2011 4:41:47 PM	At 23 years old, this is the first BC pill i have taken. during the first week i noticed an increase in acne. shortly thereafter, it tapered off. it did not seem to effect the duration or intensity of my period, my libido or my mood in general. it has however decreased my appetite, which has resulted in weight loss. i have not experienced any of the common adverse side effects as of yet.
Birth Control	TriSprintec Kills Health, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	12/5/2011 5:49:26 PM	Trisprintec ruined my life. Trisprintec stole my health from me. After being on a low hormone birth control for 6 years, and being healthy and satisfied with the low hormone BC. I switched to TriSprintec only for the cheaper price. Biggest mistake of my life! After just a month i experienced fatigue, weight gain,complete numbness in my arms and legs at night,and terrible mood swings and panic attacks. After a year i started complaining to my doctor about the fatigue and got blood work done. I ended up with thyrodid disease and a nodule in my thyroid. I was advised to stop taking Trisprintec immedietly becuase my symptoms traced back to it, and now I am stuck with thyroid disease and wish i would have never tried this BC.

I guess I've been lucky bc other than a little weight gain (which may or may not have been the BCs fault), I feel perfectly normal. I just don't like the packaging. I'm abstinent so I can't tell you if it works well in that regard, but I haven't had any more problems with cysts.
Birth Control	veronica121679, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	11/24/2011 11:43:37 AM	This is the worst birth control I've ever taken. I am almost done THANK GOD and then I'm going to switch back to tri-nessa, where I didnt get any side effects. From the second day taking it I started to get stomach aches, felt like I was going to throw up, and constant on and off dizzy spells. I had lost all energy on week two and even had to lay down a few times because I honestly was so sluggish I FELT pregnant. I am on week three and so far I have NO desire to eat and when I do it comes out (constant runs). I've also experienced tightness in my chest and the most horrible breast pain (worse then when I was actually pregnant). I had horrible cramping to the point of taking 600mg of ibuprohen to be able to move off my bed. I NEVER experienced ANYTHING like this and I was on ortho for 15 years!!!! If you cannot afford ortho (its very exoensive w/o insurance) then go with tri nessa, where I NEVR had any side effects. I didnt even FEEL this bad when I was pregnant with my daughter!!!

Absence of Menstrual Periods	Brittany, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	11/21/2011 10:10:06 PM	I started taking this pill to have a monthly cycle. I immediately started having terrible side effects more so then any other pill I have taken. My breast became extremely tender, horrible anxiety attacks, gained 7lbs in 8 days, horrible breakouts and I have very clear skin. Cramps have been all month long and the second month of taking this I have keep bleeding through the entire month after my actual cycle. Got on it because it was cheap but it's so not worth It in my opinion.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	11/18/2011 9:02:19 AM	This drug has been horrible for me. Different pills work different for everyone. I switched to generic for insurance reasons after having no problems with YAZ for 5 years. My minor acne became cystic all over my face to the point where I don't want to leave my house. I have constant nausea, my eyes are bloodshot, and I have the worst nightmares every night. Please beware.

I didn't get pregnant. My sex drive was normal; I didn't notice any mood swings, and I actually lost weight.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	11/17/2011 1:27:36 AM	Breast pain,hair loss
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	11/10/2011 12:05:13 PM	I was on this BC for 7 years and out of no were I started gaining weight and my sex drive went out the window. After talking to my doc she suggested a change in BC but All in all it works yeah I had side effects but nothing that's not worth it over having a kid before I am not ready for.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	11/9/2011 11:43:00 AM	I have been on this pill for about 3 months and every time I take it, my stomach hurts and that is with food. I also have had breakthrough bleeding which I have never had with birth control. Lastly, my periods are starting 2 weeks early and then 2 weeks later I have another one. I am going to try something else, I got on this because it was cheaper.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	11/7/2011 3:25:42 PM	I have been on birth control for over 10 years and have never experienced the side effects like I have after 1 1/2 months on this medicine. The worst has been blurred vision, dizziness, headaches, and terrible dreams.  When I went to research this drug and found so many negative comments about side effects I immediately called my Doctor. Have not heard back yet, but this medicine's side effects do not seem to outweigh the potential benefits.  I have decided to discontinue use and hope doctors and pharmacists become more aware of the dangerous effects of this drug.
Birth Control	PeachWicket, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/4/2011 1:55:51 PM	Within 24 hours of coming off of this medication I immediately started to feel better. This prescription made me lose my sex drive, develop vaginal dryness, and have agonizing migraines a few times a month. I was on it for 2 years and didn't even realize it was this particular medication that was causing so much stress in my life. I've been off of this medication for 2 months now and no longer have side effects.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	10/30/2011 9:50:29 PM	It made me feel pregnant! HATE IT!! Ive been so sick to my stomach, lower back pain, cramps, moody, extremely tired.I actually even took a pregancy test! Come to find out it was these stupid pills! def not for everyone
Acne	MickeyB1020, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	10/30/2011 9:29:36 PM	I was originally prescribed this medicine to treat my acne- and boy, does it work! My skin produces far less oil than without the pill. It has also done wonders for my menstrual cramps, period heaviness, and even my nails, hair, and body shape. It's a miracle pill! I knocked a star off its effectiveness rating, however, only because I don't know how effective it is as stand-alone birth control. My only negative side effect was mild nausea for the first 2 months. I find Tri-Sprintec to be somewhat more effective than Tri-Nessa at treating acne. This is a fantastic brand- cheap, effective, and low-risk for otherwise healthy patients! I highly recommend it!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Cynny, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/28/2011 2:26:19 AM	I've been taking this birth control for about a little over a month now, and I love it~ My acne has cleared up completely, I am not experiencing any mood swings at all, and my periods have gotten so much lighter. I used to feel super queasy and had horrible pains in the past, and it's such a relief for it to have stopped. I love this pill! 
Birth Control	meganelainemckay, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	10/26/2011 6:29:58 PM	This birth control does prevent pregnancy as it is supposed to as well as keeping my skin clear. However, the side effects of this birth control turned me into a complete nutcase. My happy, upbeat self evolved into an emotional monster along with anxiety I've never experienced before. Being the age that I am (21) I know that mild emotions and anxiety are normal but what I experienced was not. After 8 months of taking this, several dr. appointments for depression and anxiety the topic of my birth control came about. While discussing with my Dr. I was informed that there are 3 different levels of estrogen in Tri-Sprintec and they increase as the months goes on. When I asked if this could be responsible for my once happy self to turn into a sincere psycho he said definitely. We switched my birth control and I'm now taking Junel Fe which has the lowest amount of estrogen possible. It has now been a month and I can honestly say I'm starting to feel like myself again! I started Tri-Sprintec when I first started dating my boyfriend and he is also noticing the difference in my emotions since I've been off of it! Me being happy, laid back and fun is what he always liked about me before we started dating and then when we decided to date I started Tri-Sprintec and turned into a looney bin! I'm sure I had him worried a good few times this last 8 months that the girl he thought he knew was gone!! I (as I'm sure he is too) SO happy to be off of it!!!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	10/24/2011 11:19:24 PM	So far, I'm having BAD nausea.  I feel like I want to trow up but an unable to!  It's not cramps, it's nausea. I hope it gets better!  I feel awful!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	10/24/2011 6:21:27 PM	I have been on birth control before for acne and have NEVER experienced side effects like the ones I had while on this pill. Just weeks after starting it, I began to notice hair loss, weight gain, extreme emotional mood swings, headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, and awful heartburn and indigestion. I have been to the doctor several times to have blood work done and I've even had an edoscopy to check for what might be causing the heartburn and indigestion. All the testa have come up with nothing. Then, I started thinking that it might be the birth control. I've been off of it for a week and a half, and things are starting to change. The heartburn isn't as bad (still there on occasion though- hoping this gets better with more time), the headaches and nausea have stopped, my sex drive is increasing again, and hopefully the hairloss will ease up as well. I would NOT recommend this pill to anyone. I'd rather pay more and not have every single aspect of my life go wrong except pregnancy. For that purpose, I was pleased... still not pregnant. Though, when you have no sex drive and therefore don't have sex as often, that will cause that too.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	10/16/2011 3:54:07 PM	I was on Ortho Tri Cyclen for awhile and then I switch to Tri Sprintec b/c they were cheaper. Boy!! After reading some of the reviews on here, I was wondering why I have NO sex drive at all.I felt like I didn't want my man anymore. I'm always arguing with him about little stuff. I'm always moody,depressed,and irritable. I have gain 10lbs and my hair is thinning. I don't really know if that is the cause of my hair to fall out.I also have headaches. I will be switching back or just stop taking the &quot;pill&quot; all together. Stay away from these ladies!! Not worth it. Stay healthy!!
Birth Control	Kassy, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	13-18	10/12/2011 11:14:28 AM	I have been on this pill for awhile, and i'm (for the most part) satisfied. It has cleared up my acne and i'm not pregnant, so that's good. =] BUT, i do have mood swings quite often, and spotting. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	10/3/2011 4:02:57 PM	I took this medication to regulate my period and it made it worse! Horrible side effects. I was horribly moody snd lost a lot of hair. I also had cramping and swelling of the abdomen. I got off after a month.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	19-24	10/3/2011 12:09:33 PM	I started taking when I was 17, now I am 24. I was so impressed with this BC for the first 5 years and have never been on anything else. However, I started noticing changes in my 6th and 7th year being on this pill. I started  to notice changes especially in the winter. I had horrible depression, total loss of sex drive, and mood swings. I am not so much depressed anymore but the other effects are still there. I feel bloated yet hungry almost all the time. 4 months ago I stopped the pill d/t nausea when I would take it. During that time I regained my sex drive, had no mood swings, but was still tired alot. I lost 8 lbs when I got off of it and went down a cup size in my boobs. I started back up last month. My mood swings are back, my legs are incredibly itchy all of a sudden which had lasted for 2 weeks, gained my 8 lbs and boobs back, and sex drive is gone again. However, I have never had acne. The effectiveness to prevent pregnancy has always been 100% satisfactory for me. I have had no cramps during any of my periods. My periods are regular, ontime, and last 5 days. The side effects are starting to make me want to switch, however, I am very satisfied with the effectiveness of preventing pregnancy. Since I have been on this product for 7 years, I am very nervous to switch because of the effectiveness it has had for me. I would recommend this pill for its effectiveness, however the side effects are different for everyone I am seeing as I read the reviews.
Birth Control	IzzyA, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	10/2/2011 11:45:43 PM	I have only been on tri sprintec for two months and so far all the symptoms I've experience where nausea, increase in appitite right after i take it, and little mood swings. These symptoms don't happen every day so that's good. I dont know if it will protect against pregnancy because I have not had sex yet while takeing these. Overall this birth control isnt bad at all for a cheap price.
Birth Control	lauren, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/25/2011 6:17:04 PM	I've been on Tri-Sprintec for a few months now and I love it. I just switched from Beyaz which made me really emotional (I cried before every period without fail) but now I'm pretty emotionally stable. My acne is cleared up and I haven't gained any weight. The only side effect I've noticed was an increase in vaginal fluids which hopefully will stop in a few months, but if not, it's not a bad exchange for birth control without mood swings! I would definitely recommend this pill. I would also recommend people keep in mind that if you start a pill and aren't pleased with it, you're much more likely to post a negative review online than  you're likely to post a positive review if your pill works perfectly well, so don't be discouraged by the negative reviews. Everyone's body works differently!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	4	1	Female	19-24	9/18/2011 10:52:20 PM	Although the pill did its job &amp; kept me from getting pregnant, I have experienced SEVERE mood swings.. acne breakouts.. &amp; water retention. I suffered with awful mood swings and felt like a completely different person. My fiance has unfortunately suffered the worst of it. I have gotten angry over the silliest thing &amp; that's not who I am. I cry when I am happy and cry when I'm sad &amp; end up looking like a complete psycho. Pills are obviously different for everyone, but I would not recommend this for anyone!!!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	MJ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	9/9/2011 10:44:25 AM	My daughter has depression and general anxiety disorder. This generic form of Orthotricylen is horrible. She has been severely depressed and has horrible mood swings.  I had also experienced the same thing when I was switched to this medication. I would not recommend this to anyone with depression becuase it will only get worse.  My dughter was only on it for 1 month and now I have her on Orthotricyclen - I hope this one works!!  I've been taking it for years &amp; have no problems.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	7/30/2011 1:56:38 AM	So far i have been on this pill for just over a month, i swtiched over from trinessa because i lost my health insurance and this is what the palned parenthood gave me. So far i have had terrible head aches, awful mood swings, signs of depression, abdoninal pain that i have never had before, and now i have a yeast infection, that im almost certain is due to this pill. I am not impressed and am going to be searching for a new pill as soon as i can.

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Veebee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	7/9/2011 6:44:25 AM	I wanted to tell you other users, that if you experience nausea, you may  want to try taking this pill right before bed, it helps a lot. My first day starting this pill I actually lost 4 pounds! Then gained it all back a week later, boo. But I also slept the WHOLE day, I was so exhausted. I was sleepy and light headed for the 1st week but that wore off. I do still get nausea and hot flashes every night, at times waking with dry heaves. But that does seem to be improving with time. I started this pill because my periods are so heavy theyre causing anemia. It has not made it any worse or better, but it caused a lot of menstrual clotting, which was weird. Breasts are slightly larger, which to me is a plus. Overall the nausea is a LOT better than it was on ortho tri cyclen. Remember it  takes 3 months for any type of BC to stabilize inyour body. This is only my first pack so I will update more later.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	libby, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	19-24	7/7/2011 7:35:59 PM	I've been on this pill for almost three years and it is great. No pregnancy. Also, instead of having heavy, unpredictable periods, I could always know exactly when it would start. It made it a lot lighter and shorter (3 days). I never had breakthrough bleeding or spotting. No acne. And absolutely no weight gain; I actually had quite a bit of weight loss. I sincerely had zero side effects. I'm very satisfied with it.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	7/4/2011 2:02:23 AM	I rated this as &quot;somewhat effective&quot; only because I switched from ortho novum just this month and haven't completed this first cycle of pills...hopefully the pill is doing its job of pregnancy prevention, though! on ortho novum I became pregnant and went on to miscarry...I am hoping this pill is more effective. I am also hoping that it regulates my periods, because for a long time I wasn't getting my period, and my MD said that this pill would help w/regulating my cycle. so far my biggest complaint is acne/painful hard pimples along my jaw line....started in my 2nd week. I assume its related to the pill and hope it clears up w/time. 
Birth Control		5	5	1			6/26/2011 4:33:49 PM	I took this drug for about a year after switching from a different birth control. I recently went off of it cause it lowered my sex drive. However, after experiencing some breakouts of acne, I decided to return to taking it again. Worst mistake ever! I never realized how moody and irritable I was on the pill, and I constantly have pounding headaches. I have had a nonstop headache for the past three days. Definitely reconsider taking this pill, the side effects are not worth the cheap price!
Acne	Lydia, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	6/21/2011 1:09:35 PM	I began taking this only two weeks ago.  Actually, not even two weeks. I started the 2nd week of pills, and had to stop.  The first week I was feeling fine, but on Saturday of the first week I noticed I felt bloated and this has continued.  Now my stomach feel swollen.  Not to mention, my heart rate is through the roof!  Last night after having lied in bed for an hour, my heart rate was over 90 beats per minute.  My chest feels very tight, and breathing is becoming more difficult.  Also, one last comment, I did not experience any nausea except for the last few days.

She has had pain in her stomach area as well. taking her off now. I would like to know how to reach the MOther who lost her Daughter taking this medication. I would like to help w/ awareness. I'm so sorry. 
Painful Periods	anonymouse88, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	6/8/2011 3:16:57 PM	I started with Yasmin and switched to Tri-Sprintec for a more affordable pill and stayed on this for about three years. The drug works well overall for controlling my moderately severe menstrual pain and making my periods lighter and regular. The only drawback I've found is moderately uncomfortable breast tenderness the week prior to your induced period. I will be switching to a new pill this fall because I'd like to avoid the breast pain and have fewer overall periods. I never experienced weight gain, bloating, blood clots, yeast infections, or related common outcomes of taking birth control pills while taking Tri-Sprintec.
Birth Control	lovesshoes86, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	6/8/2011 2:57:04 PM	I have been taking this for 2 months now and I am 5'2 and weigh 120 and so far have not gained any weight, I do eat pretty healthy but I don't really exercise like I should. The main reason I am on this is for birth control. However, I was doing some research and learned that some people take this for acne too, so I thought why not give it a try and plus it is only 9 bucks a pack. My doctor was originally wanting to start me on seasonique but I just did not feel comfortable taking it. I have found that on the third row of pills I get really painful under skin or cystic acne on my jawline in which I have never had before! I am still going to give this time and hope that it continued to prevent pregnancy and help with my acne. I know that everyone is different and so I'm just going to give it a few more months and hope that this helps with my hormonal acne. Has anyone else experienced cystic acne while on this pill?
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Michelle, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	6/8/2011 12:23:59 AM	I'm 18 and I weight 104 pounds and I'm 5' 4&quot;. This is the first time I've taken a form of birth control and I'd say it works really good. I was scared about taking it at first, reading all these bad reviews, but it really all depends on you and not anyone else. I am sexually active pretty much everyday, and after 2 weeks of taking this my fianc&#233; partially ejaculated in me, but I didn't get pregnant. I would say to wait a whole month instead of a week before you start having unsafe sex just to be safe. I didn't gain a single pound, I never felt sick, it got rid of my horrible, horrible cramps (that I almost have to go to the hospital for) that I use to have every month along with my 7-8 days long period, turning it into a light 3 day period!
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	13-18	6/6/2011 7:36:37 PM	As a birth control it does it's job. Since starting though I've gained about ten pounds. The first month I was also very puffy from water retention which I got rid of by drinking more water throughout the day. I do not know if the medicine is to blame for the weight gain or not, but it only makes sense because I was losing weight before I started the pills.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	6/3/2011 6:17:09 PM	My dr switched me to this after several years of taking zovia to help control acne. At first it was a dream, my skin was perfect and my periods short but then I started to feel anxious, get really bad headaches during my period and incredibly depressed. I didn't even notice I was changing until my friends pointed it out. It took me 9 months to realize this was the reason for all my emotional problems (I wasn't a depressed or anxious person before). I had gone to therapy, meditation and nothing was helping. I've been off them for about 2 months and I already feel more like myself but my cycle is still a mess. I also had a lot of hair growth that was unwanted as I had lasered it off!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	6/2/2011 11:10:59 AM	I've been on this pill for 1 yr now and never had any issues until the past few months. At first I had the nausea and then it went away after the first month. I DID experience breakthrough bleeding if I was only a couple of hours off and then about 5 months ago I got pregnant while on this pill, miscarried, got back on it, and lo and behold... I'm just finishing up my first trimester of my second pregnancy WHILE ON THIS PILL. Mind you, while unplanned and unexpected, my boyfriend and I are happy, but I'll never go back to this pill.
Birth Control	Heather82Feather, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/24/2011 5:31:49 PM	I loved this pill and the price. I had been on it for about 3 years and didn't have any problems until about the 3rd year.  I started experiencing migraine headaches about 3 times a week and vaginal dryness the week after my period.  My doctor suggested I switch brand because of the headaches, otherwise I would recommend this pill to anyone. 
Birth Control	ramar4478, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	5/22/2011 12:09:42 AM	I took Ortho Cyclen from the time I was 17 until I was ready to start a family (at age 25) with little to no side effects.  Three children later (I am now 33) I decided to go back on BC to help with painful ovulation and avoid the hassle of condoms.  I mistakenly thought I could pick right back up where I left off.  I have taken Sprintec since March 2011, and have had the dizziness, floating feeling some have complained about.  I just realized the pill may be the cause.  Also have had elevated BP at my last two dr.'s visits.  And the last week have had increasingly worse lower right abdominal pain.  It was really bad today and that's when I decided it is not worth it.  Not taking anymore and going to call my doctor first thing Monday.  I'm sure it works great for some but has not been fun for me.
Birth Control	rerosado, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	5/18/2011 6:24:58 PM	I have been on this pill for 2 months. Before this, I was using Aviane and for the last two week that I used it, I had frequent breakthrough bleeding and it lasted for the last 2 weeks. It also made me loose my sex drive.My first period on Tri-Sprintec was awful (painful cramps, heavy bleeding &amp; every other PMS symptom). But; I toughed it out and thought its probably because its my first month, ill give it a few more months. Well, my second period (this month) is AWESOME! I thought I was late and got scared but my period came on the second day of my sugar pills. It was very very light (little to nothing) and I had no PMS symptoms.I hope it continues to work this way. Just a note - if you have a bad first month, give it a few months to adjust your hormones. Every womans body is different so my experience could be the exact opposite for you.
Birth Control	Nancy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	5/11/2011 11:08:51 AM	Basically i am giving this pill 5 stars because as a BIRTH CONTROL pill it is very effective. I can predict when my period will be coming down to the day, sometimes hour. HOWEVER, I have been eating healthy, drinking tons of water, and exercising regularly - and for some reason can't seem to lose weight. I have read many posts and it is finally clicking that I think my pill may be the issue. I feel like I have swollen hands, wrists, arms, and ankles. No matter what I do I feel like I cannot lose weight. I also feel like I have no sex drive and mood swings for no apparent reason. 
Birth Control	Beachbride2011, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	5/7/2011 10:45:54 PM	This is my first time taking birth control ever and I just finished the 2nd row of pills today and tomorrow I will start the third row. I take this every night at 7 on the dot. I have not had any bad side effects, the only thing that I have had is just a little breast tenderness (nothing unbearable), and I do feel a little more hungry than usual but I can control the hunger cravings with no problem. I am 5'2 and still weigh 115  so hopefully it will stay that way. When I read the reviews I was really freaked out! Everyone is different though, so I definitely think that this is worth a try especially for 9 dollars! I also did my research and learned that this pill is FDA approved to help with acne which is another plus, so I will see how well this helps with this 25yr old acne I've got going on. I will update later on to let everyone know if it still works for me and experiences.

Acne	TFLET, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/11/2011 10:13:24 AM	I was on ortho tri cyclen lo for 6 months but had to find something cheaper. Ortho was $40.00/pk and tri sprintec for me is $9.00/pk. I started the pill for my acne. The ortho helped it but when I had to find another birth control I was scared that it wouldn't help my acne but the Tri Sprintec improved my acne more than the ortho tri cyclen lo did. I was amazed. I've been on Tri sprintec for a month and can't beleave the improvement in my skin and I haven't had a single side effect. I was on Loestrin before the Ortho tri cyclen. I had so many negative side effects from that pill. But I love Tri Sprintec. It's made my life so much easier. Also it's a very effective birth control my husband and I don't use any form of birth control other than the pill and I haven't gotten pregnant. :)
Birth Control	relentingrelic, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	4/9/2011 2:07:51 PM	This drug made me instantly sick. I only managed to take it for 5 days before i said enough. But the problems didn't stop. No the headaches dizziness continued with my entire body aching. Then two days after i stop taking it I developed the symptoms of a UTI. Uncontrollable bladder, the constant urge to pee and the best yet the continuous burning sensation. 1 week after taking this pill and the symptoms still persist. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	3/31/2011 12:55:58 PM	this birth control started of so horrible and continued. had bad headaches, feeling nausea but never threw up. most of all lost about 10-15pounds just within 6months - 1year. now that is major because im a small framed person. the periods were still long, flow was still heavy and cramps were still there it was like i was never on anything....the only thing it did was regulate the period 
Birth Control	MrsP1206, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/30/2011 10:18:35 PM	It never occurred to me that all of my problems root from a single pill.  Because of problems in my marriage, I began researching a single symptom ... no sex drive.  Results were stress, medications, and possibly HSDD.  I didn't want to go worst case scenario.  I hate limited space in comments, ugh.  I'm not stressed except for the fact that I dont want sex &amp; its driving a wedge between me &amp; my husband.  So i started researching the side effects of the only medication I'm on ...this stupid pill.  The only good thing about this pill is that i'm still alive &amp; i didnt get pregnant.  My side effects are:  nausea, occasional severe headaches that leave me bed ridden-but are not migraines, bloating, dizziness, vaginal discomfort due to dryness &amp; irritation, acne &amp; blotchy skin-i've always had great skin, spotting &amp; missed or heavy periods, cant wear contacts, water retention, weight gain, shortness of breath, confusion, swelling/warmth in calf muscles, tingling/weakness/numbness in arms &amp; hands, lack of coordination, vision changes, a lump in my breast-unexplained by dr's &amp; tests, mental/mood changes-depression-i was misdiagnosed with being bipolar and schizophrenic, sleeplessness, tiredness-no urge to move at all, hot all the time, no sex drive, irritable, hungry but no appetite satisfaction, anti-social behavior, etc.  I've come up with so many side effects I've quit looking for them.  Its too many. I'm not even going to finish my pill pack.  I'm not even taking a pill tonight.  when my sex drive comes back my husband can wear a condom.  Although he said he would get snipped so i wouldnt worry.  these side effects have created so many problems in my life, if i wouldve been able to think clearly i may have been able to figure it out, but that was one of the side effects. i will quit ranting now. thank you.

Birth Control	amcrutch, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/29/2011 6:57:13 AM	As far as birth controls go, I was using ortho tri cyclen lo for several years before I recently switched to tri-sprintec about four months ago.  While I like the higher dose hormone for birth control reasons, the side effects far outweigh the benefits; at least for me personally.  I've noticed a significant change in mood to the point where I can go an entire weekend moody and unhappy with my husband for no reason while my periods are long and spotting is regular.  This is not an improvement at all.  While pregnancy is not an option at this point, neither is the increased depressed mood swings (and alternatively increased sex drive).  I thought I just needed time to get used to it, but now that I've given it a few months, its definitely time to switch back to ortho tri cyclen lo.  Ironically, I've also managed to lose 5lbs on this medication as opposed to gain weight but there is still a feeling of bloatedness and water retention.

Water retention. This month I had two periods on it and I went to my dr, and got switched to loestrin 1 20 hope this one works for me.

My breasts painfully ache, I am eating everything in sight, I am bloated, and I am always tired. I don't know whether to stop taking it and get on something else, or give it more time???
Acne	Jordan, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/14/2011 1:51:51 PM	I can't believe all of the negativity about this pill.  You must believe that all bodies and systems are absolutely different, and how people tolerate medications can be like night and day.  For me, this pill is perfect!!  NO nausea, vomiting, mood disorders, headaches, bad periods, etc.  I don't smoke or drink, which can affect serious side effects and reactions.  I eat well, exercise, and try to control my stress levels daily.  I am over 35 and take this pill for acne - which has absolutely worked!!  People, please...before spewing such negativity about this pill - take in consideration your lifestyle (habits, stress, responsibility taking the pill, etc.) before commenting.  Give the pill a chance also!  Sometimes it may take your body 2-3 months to adjust to the hormones. Thanks!

The end of February I missed a couple of the placebo pills. I read the information that comes with the BC and it said to stop the current pack and start with the new. I did and now I have been having a period ever since. I gained almost 10 lbs. I am ALWAYS hungry...lost my mojo...but I need to take something because I have been told I have PCOS. I guess it is time to try something else.

It makes me feel like my head is in a fog all of the time. I am making this my last month on it and I will never ever get back on it again. Im sick of feeling out of control of my emotions. I might as well be pregnant oh and my poor finace has to put up with me but thank God he understands it's the pill. DONT TAKE IT!!!!!!!
Birth Control	Cate, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/6/2011 11:40:11 PM	i have been on tri-sprintec for 3 years now. i've read a lot of negative posts about this pill, but for me it's been WONDERFUL. i haven't experienced any of the negative side effects everyone is complaining about. no nausea, no moodiness, no bloating...no nothing. it's been great for regulating my period and i no longer experience painful cramping (a wonderful bonus). in addition, i've lost close to 20lbs from it...most of it came off the first year i started taking it and i've stayed at a constant weight since then (no fluctuations up or down). i'm unsure why everyone hates it so much, i guess it's because everyone's body responds differently to prescription drugs. i'm just so lucky ortho tri-sprintec agrees so well with me!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	3/3/2011 8:55:37 AM	I started this BC in Nov. No complaints. In December I missed my period. January came and I noticed how moody and irritable I had become. My January period was almost 2 weeks long. I didnt get a period at all for Feb. I was a total wreck the whole month, extremely moody and an emotional nut case. I cry at night for no reason and little things get on my nerves now. Were a few days into March &amp; I still havent gotten a period. Took a test &amp; it came back negative (which is a good thing) but where the heck is my period? I have an appt. to see my Dr. in a few weeks. I will be switching to a different BC. (Providing this one did its job effectively and Im not pregnant!)

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	13-18	2/21/2011 12:30:16 PM	I started taking birth control because my periods are extremely painful (to the point where I can't move) and recently I got 2 periods in the same month for 8 days each. I started on Loestrin, but they made me break out and I was very insecure/crying/stressed/.. just too emotional. I then switched to Tri-Sprintec and I am now finishing up my second week. My doctor switched me to this to help with moods and it is fantastic! I feel so content with myself and nothing really bothers me. Also, on Loestrin I gained a lot of weight right away, and I actually think my body looks better now on Tri Sprintec. The only problem is.......... I have the WORST acne of my life. I like how I'm more confident so I'm going to stay on this pill.. but I reaalllyy hope this is just an initial breakout. and it is only my second week so.. I know I can't really expect anything great just yet. Oh. And I'm only 16 so... I'm not too sure if its good at preventing pregnancy... but I feel happy and confident around my boyfriend! :))
Birth Control	anmated, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/18/2011 10:36:58 AM	Well, I must say that TriSprintec definitely works as contraception. I have been on for 2 months now. In the beginning, I noticed a lot of bloating and no sex drive at all. But after my first period, things became normal. I do notice that I have small breakouts on my face during the 3rd week of pills but nothing serious. I would continue using it if Medco hadn't switched me to Tri Previfem.
Birth Control	AJ2007, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	2/16/2011 3:46:07 PM	My doctor put me on this medication after my second child was born. This pill is horriable. I only took it for a month. I had bleeding non- stop, bad acne, headaches, depression, and weight gain. I would definitley not recommend this pill. I finally stopped taking this pill in hopes to get my body back to normal.

I swiched to save money and its not worth it. I had horrible stomach pains,sick to my stomach and a severe headache.I felt like i got hit by a train and survived.I never had any pill ever effect me in this way so lets just say i switched back to Loestrin 24 Fe,it might cost me $45.00 a month but it is well worth feeling good!!! :)

I like that it's affordable, which as a college student is always a plus. I tend to not start my period until almost the end of the white pills but other than that I think this medication is a good choice.

Within the first month, my boobs grew from a 32 C to 38 DD. Each month my period last around 2 weeks.  It's not the best (side effect wise), but it does its job, and keeps me from getting pregnant!

My daughter passed away from this pill in 7 weeks.  Have you taken time to report your case to the FDA?  If not, would you be willing?  This is the only way the FDA and pharmaceutical company knows there are problems, because no one else is reporting this for you.  Please consider reporting to the FDA if you have not already.  Thank you and God Bless You!

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	1/12/2011 9:44:21 PM	I wrote a review when I first started taking this pill (about 4 months ago) and I was very satisfied. However, I am now about to start my 5th pack of pills and I'm disappointed. The past 3 months I have been extremely moody. I thought it was &quot;winter blues&quot; until I realized I have been having horrible mood swings at the end of the 2nd week of pills. So bad that my boyfriend doesn't even want to be around me. At the end of the 3rd week it happens again. I also get more cramps now being on the pill than I did when I wasn't taking anything. The headaches I had during my very 1st week of use continued to happen for about 3 months, each 1st week of the pack, and always around the same time of day (4pm-ish). I'm also worried now that I may be pregnant, as my period has been VERY regular since I started this pill and I'm late now. I only took this brand because of the low cost and no health insurance, but now I have insurance so I think I will switch to something else once I see a gyno.
Birth Control	TwinsMa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	1/10/2011 11:24:39 AM	This pill has been making me violently ill. I can take it and within a couple of hours I'm having nausea and hot flashes. By the end of the day I'm throwing up and can't keep anything down. I had to stop taking it just to keep food on my stomach. I'm waiting for my period so that I can start a different kind of pill. I hope this next one doesn't make me this sick. This kind has been horrible and I took Ortho Tri-Cyclen before I had my kids and it never affected me like this!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	12/21/2010 2:43:12 PM	I was on this BC for about 9-10 months and absolutely hated it. I had 2-3 week long periods every month, and often just felt miserable. I just switched to my third attempt at finding a BC that works for me, and hopefully it will because I'm considering going off BC completely because I've hated it so far.

I also had abdominal pain that really wasn't that bad. I am very concerned if me vomiting is a normal side effect. Hopefully it is. I am really thinking of switching because I can barely function throughout the day because I have to worry about me getting blood on my pants and me feeling not having total concentration.
Birth Control	bshivler, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	12/8/2010 11:12:56 AM	This is my 1st month on this pill and so far I have not been having a good experience. I started it on the 1st day of my cycle since my midwife told me I could be protected right away if I did. My normal 4-5 day period has now been 9 days long, some heavy and some light bleeding with no consistency. I have also been having stomach cramping and extreme bloating. I am having issues with nausea every day as well which could or could not be related to the pill. I read the side effects and most of these symptoms were listed so I hope they begin to get better as I continue to take it, but so far, I'm pretty miserable with it.

It has even cleared my acne..great no more antibiotics for me.Now if I could just remember to take it at the same time everyday.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/28/2010 2:22:44 PM	I have effectively been on this BC for close to five years, i have tried several others, I had problems with migraines before as well as spotting.  Tri Sprintec has been very good, no real problems, still having somewhat unpredictable headaches for random amounts of time during my period, from hours to a couple of days, which may or may not be related to this pill.  This week, i havent taken the placebo pills, i usually don't, and have been experiencing very high blood pressure... unknown cause.  It is a listed side effect for this pill, but i have no other risk factors, ie. smoking etc.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	headahurtin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	11/27/2010 12:15:58 AM	I began taking Tri-Sprintec to control my lack of having periods.  I have read many reviews.  Many of which have a complaint and only some that are satisfied.  I feel I have the right to tell you all what I think, personally.  Ever since I've been on this pill, which has been three months, I've had severe headaches and very painful periods.  Only recently, though, have I read the little insert that the pharmacy puts in the bag with medications.  As I started reading the list of possible side effects, I can say that I had a good amount of them.  I know that everybody will react differently to certain drugs, but if I were to be asked if I would suggest this birth control to other people I would have to say no.  I read more about the pill on here.  Some of the stuff on here wasn't listed on the paper from the pharmacy.  Recently I had a urinalysis done, I had abnormal levels of many things.  Some of which, now, I am wondering if I can attribute to this medication.If you're currently on this pill and it's working well for you... Great!  Good for you.  But please don't get aggravated with those of us whom it is not working well for.
Birth Control	Sweet Dee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	11/24/2010 4:59:35 PM	After having issues with a lot of BC, my doctor prescribed this (I Had been on Ortho Tri Cyclen when I was 17 - had to get off it b/c my periods were over a week long &amp; heavy) - The cramps start 2.5 weeks before I'm supposed to get my period and usually last through my period, at about this time my PMS Starts (Craving all sorts of food, especially sweets &amp; chocolate) along with moodiness and crankiness and sleepiness.  I gain ~ 5 lbs for 3 weeks of the month then lose it and get back to my normal weight for one week - my PMS and period weeks last 3 weeks so I'm bloated and heavier that whole time.  It's awful.  I just eat and eat and I don't want to eat but I can't stop.  I've been eating healthier and exercising for the past 10 months, and this bc has made all my progress go the opposite direction.  Also, I will get my EXTREMELY HEAVY period on Tuesday or Wednesday, (literally have to wear both a tampon and a pad)and then it will last until Friday night - it will be gone all day Saturday and then return Sunday night - light, but enough that I still have to wear a pantiliner - and that lasts 2-4 more days.  It's very frustrating to not know why it's coming back and be gaining all this weight even though I'm trying to stay healthy.  I am not a fan of this, although it has been easy &amp; effective at preventing pregnancy, altho I use condoms as well for double protection.  These side effects are enough to get me to stop taking it, I am calling my doctor next week.

Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	5	Female	13-18	11/12/2010 12:37:03 PM	i have one blue pill left before my first white one. this is the second month ive been on this. thankfully this month has been much better than the first one. my mother put me on birth control because i had my wizdom teeth out and i didnt get my period for 8 months. the first two weeks were ok, but by the third week i started spotting and i eventually got my period two weeks before the white pills. when i took the white pills the flow was so heavy i had to change an ultra tampon and high absorbancy pad about every 15 minutes. you cant go to the bathroom 4 times every class. i had to stay out of school for two days and i always went home twice cause it leeked threw my pants. once i started the blue pills again i still had a very light flow for about three days then it stopped. all together i ened up having it for 4 weeks. it felt like the longest month ever, but so far this month is going great.

Birth Control	ccny778, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	10/28/2010 12:37:51 PM	While I agree with many of the other commenters that everyone's body is different and everyone's reaction to this pill will be different, I still feel compelled to share to maybe help put others at ease who might feel that this drug is being strange.  I have been on this pill since March.  At preventing pregnancy, at regulating my cycle and at lightening my period (on the last one I was on I was bleeding for like two and half weeks out my cycle), this pill has worked for me and been spot on.  However, the side effects are troubling.  Fortunately, I have had no issues with sex drive or crazy mood swings, but I did have other issues.  At the beginning, acne was horrible.  Now, 7 months later, clear as crystal.  I have also gained about 15 pounds.  Not cute.  I am also constantly bloated and gassy.  Even more not cute.  My boobs are bigger (bonus), but I feel sort of large all over so that sort of doesn't make it as enjoyable.  My period also comes like clockwork, but my periods are getting lighter and lighter each month.  My last period lasted for two days (TWO!!!) and it was super easy.  I hope this helps some people are having similar symptoms and want to feel less alone.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	lifegirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	10/15/2010 9:12:28 PM	I have been on the B/C for A  week now and I have seveve abnominal bloating. I can't even fit into my jeans. I am so bloated I look like  I am 6 to 7 months period. I wantr to stop taking these pills immediately. Has anyone else had these problems? 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	db, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	10/13/2010 12:10:17 AM	I have neen on this birth control pill for one month, and I don't like it.  I have been bleeding since starting it.  Not spotting, a real period for one month.  My appetite has increased, or so I think.  I have noticed I am very emotional. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	10/9/2010 1:56:37 AM	I started this pill almost a year ago. The first day I took it I woke up very sick in the middle of the night. Had slight nausea for the first couple months. Around month 4 I started having mood swings. They got increasingly worse. I want to cry over the most insignificant things, and have a very short temper. Some days I just wake up mad and stay that way. This is NOT my normal disposition AT ALL! It makes me feel like I'm losing my mind. I have also experienced a big decrease in sex drive. It did make my boobs bigger, which is fine, but I have been unable to lose any weight despite getting exercise and eating healthier than I ever have in my life. It took a while but I seem to be having fewer breakouts. Ever since I started I have had light spotting between the 2nd and 3rd week of pills. It is very affordable, which as a student is great. It has also been effective, however I am asking my doctor for other options because I am fed up with the mood swings. I'm tired of feeling like a crazy person.
Birth Control	BC/DC, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/19/2010 3:19:59 PM	Nothing special about this pill versus any other BC. I purchased it for the low cost and the very regular periods. I have been on several different brands over 22 years and they all have the same side effects. I have never tried one that was any better than any other. All birth control pills may increase depression, water weight gain, breast tenderness, headaches, etc, etc. Birth control comes in different dosages also, if you have problems with one strength, go stronger or weaker, talk to your doctor. Many of the side effects expressed on this website are going to be seen regardless of which BC pill chosen unfortunately.
Birth Control	soromantical, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	10/19/2010 11:06:56 AM	I am just finishing up the first month of Trisprintec and can't say I have any complaints. I remember the first week I started, I had very bad headaches almost every day, but they did go away and haven't had one since. I'm pretty sure I haven't gained weight, no breast tenderness either. The only thing is, my thighs started to get really itchy the past few days - I thought it was from new sweatpants (lol) but read another comment that she had itchy thighs as well. Still, not a horrible side-effect. The only thing I'm concerned with is I've now taken 2 white pills, and only had VERY light bleeding, I mean almost nothing, except when I had intercourse the first night of the white pill, there was some bleeding. Hopefully I will get my period today or tomorrow, if not, then VERY light periods on this pill! Overall, very satisfied.

I have had my period on an exact day of the week every month and very mild periods. On the other side my hormones just recently have went way out of control and I had to stop the pill due to depression massive mood swings and just feeling blah. Been off it for 6 weeks now and still no period....that is a concern to me because I am sick in the mornings now and my breasts are very tender and I seem to have a little more of a umm pudge on my lower abdomen :(. I am now doubting its effectiveness. Has anyone else had this problem?
Birth Control	eclipse23, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	3	Female	19-24	10/5/2010 1:47:37 AM	Been on Tri Sprintec for 4 months.  I do not take it at a specific time and sometimes even forget and miss a pill here and there, but have not gotten pregnant, so it is very effective.  Side effects: Horrible breakouts the first 2 months, but it is now clearer than ever.  Very tender breasts first month or so, but that has gone. My period is IRREGULAR now vs regular before. It has increased my appatite dramatically to the point I wake up several times a night needing a snack.  I've never done that before. Taco bell and mexican food has become a huge craving when I've never liked Taco Bell, although this is starting to subside. I had headaches in the beginning, but that has gone. I've had severe depression my whole life, and this medications seems to make it worse. I am constantly tired. I get sick when I make up pills. Bottom line...most of the side effects truly are becoming less or non-existent now. So DO give it time. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/26/2010 9:56:53 PM	I just finished my first pack of pills tonight.  I don't think I will be continuing them. My first week I had headaches and nausea. The second week my breasts got real tender and I got a yeast infection on my breasts. The third week I started spotting. I didn't spot he avily but I spotted for eight days and then started my period.  My doc wants me try them fvor three months before I go off them but I don't feel I should.  I figured my husband and I haven't used any kind of protection since our son was a babyand now he's 8.  I figufed if we haven't got pregnant yet then why put muself through this.  if god chooses to bless us with another child then that's his will for us.  I'm tired of always having sideeffects.
Birth Control	caramel, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	9/23/2010 11:59:43 PM	I have been taking sprintec for a week now and ever since i started i've been having vaginal irration.

Excessive Hairiness	Marki, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	9/22/2010 8:01:41 PM	I experienced the worst bloating and breast tenderness ever after one and a half weeks into tri sprintec 28 day.  I gained 5+ pounds in this short amount of time although I exercise and watch calorie/sodium intake.  I haven't been on it long at all, but I'm quitting because I feel awful and my clothes are too tight!  
Birth Control	Jacutie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	9/18/2010 10:51:58 AM	I began taking birth control to regulate my period.  I had the worst irregularity and I constantly thought I was pregnant.  I was on Yaz for about 6 months and they switched me to the Generic version.  I had no problem with Yaz or the generic one except for a migraine for the whole first week.  My acne was gone, my periods were regular and I knew exactly when I would get them...the Thursday after starting the placebo pills.  Due to all the bad reviews my provider switched me to tri-printec and at first I hated it.  My appetite grew with this pill and I gained 5 pounds in 1 month!!  I didnt gain a pound on Yaz for the whole 6 months i was on it.  My acne came out...about 2 pimples a week for the first 2 months and during my periods I felt slight cramps and LOTS of bloating.  All of these symptoms were nonexistent on Yaz.   I just made my 7 month mark on these pills and now is when I am seeing the benefits.  Over all I had gained 15 pounds in 6 months and NOW I'm loosing all the weight.  Im down 10 pounds.  I might get 1 pimple a month...my periods continued to stay regular but they last 4 days only and NOW I have no cramps.  The only symptoms I do have now are random fatigue and bloating.  But the bloating is not nearly as bad as it was before.  Over all I recommend it, just allow it to take time.  I prefer Yaz but I can handle these pills now.  The worst part for me was the weight gain. and my sex drive did slightly decrease but i still have one lol
Birth Control	JN76, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	9/16/2010 10:28:53 PM	I have taken yasmine or the generic for the last year recently I switch to tri sprintec because of cramps. Big mistake! The second week of taking it I thought I had a uti, my dr put me on cipro and I thought I was good. Five days later my symptoms hadn't changed so my dr said &quot;oh yeast infection&quot; except that test came back negative. I've had a horrible prickly sensation and feel the need to urinate all the time for two weeks and it's much worse at night. The dr has no explanation as to why I feel like this so I'm going to switch to my old meds.  Srsly the worst feeling ever.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	9/7/2010 3:17:06 PM	I have been on Tri-Sprintec for a month now.  I have read all the horror stories out there but this is my take on the drug.  Firstly, I am not pregnant, so this does the job.  I had unprotected sex after the first week.  Then again on the second and third.  I got my period the second day within my placebo pills.  I took my pill at the exact time every day, I am very careful to do so.  In the first week, I had some little bouts of depression, but they went away.  A wave of nausea or two.  The second week was a breeze and it was met with no side effects.  The last week was a little rough, I had more nausea than usual and it lasted longer, and I would feel a bit more emotional than usual.  But I never took it overboard.  Weight wise I am the same.  I had clear skin before and I had 1 really bad pimple the whole time taking it and it disappeared quickly.  I am glad I can take the generic, because it's so gosh darn cheap.  This is my first time taking birth control.

Other	hmt, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	8/25/2010 9:32:38 PM	possible allergic reaction to Tri SprintecI have used Ortho Tri Cyclen for about 8 years now. I just filled my prescription at a new pharmacy and didn't realize they gave me the generic Tri Sprintec until I walked out and it was too late to return. I've only been taking it for a little over a week, and I've experienced itching on my arms, legs, and face, chest pains, blurry vision. Also, as I type this, my tongue is swollen! I did go to an urgent care doctor today who gave me a steroid shot, Prednisone, and etc who assures me I should be fine in 4-5 days (seems like forever), if not, to return. I'm convinced my allergic reaction is to Tri Sprintec, because I haven't changed anything else. It is quite frightening to have this happen. I called my old pharmacist, and he said that he hasn't received any negative reports about Tri-Sprintec from his customers - probably because the ones with issues don't even consider that their birth control could be the root of their problems! I know that every woman reacts differently to birth control, but it's unfortunate it takes this scare to find out Tri Sprintec is not for me.  I am going to discontinue this generic completely, and I hope these problems will subside as a result!
Acne	Anne, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	13-18	8/22/2010 2:02:30 AM	I started taking Tri Sprintec about 3 months ago. My dermatologist recommended it for acne. With most skin products, the first few weeks caused me to break out but now I have a great complexion. I only get bad pimples a few days before my period, which is normal. Also, my periods are shorter and lighter (and who doesn't love that?) My dermatologist also recommended that I take a vitamin B6 and B12 to help keep me from being moody. It's been working quite well. 
Birth Control	love_storyx3, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	13-18	8/16/2010 1:45:59 AM	I'm on my last week of this BC its my first time using birth control pills and the entire month up till today have been rough , I've been nauseous and have had times where I was vomiting until very recently(yesterday) and its gotten to the point where I couldn't eat. I haven't yet gotten my period and just started week 4. I really have no complaints other than when I was feeling sick to my stomach which I think was just my body adjusting to the medicine plus other medicines prescribed by my doctor recently and low sex drive is definitely a complaint by both me and my boyfriend. I've had no breakthrough bleeding and no migraines like in other reviews. Everyone is different and all medicines effect people differently but I would recommend this for the fact that I'm not pregnant and that is what this is supposed to prevent. I'll see how my first period goes on these pills and will determine if I really should continue use or switch. Other than all that the pills are very easy to take and remember due to my alarm everyday on my phone. All I can say to people who are looking to take this I'd give it a chance and see how it effects you considering it obviously effects many people differently. I will say it has had its moments of making me more emotional which has caused problems in my relationship but its really not that bad of a birth control.Also I must add on this birth control has not given me any weight gain and has helped with acne. 
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	8/13/2010 1:31:38 AM	Started taking this in hopes of helping with cramps. Instead of the usual one day before and first three days of period cramps, I started cramping the whole week before and about five days during. Also, it really messes with my emotions. I frequently cry for no reason. If I'm not crying, I am completely numb (emotionally). I am nauseous a lot of the time, and can only manage to down certain things. Overall, I am very unhappy with this medication. Basically, my cramps are worse, I am depressed all the time, and I am nauseated most of the time. I definitely don't recommend Tri-Sprintec.

My doctor switched me to Tri Sprintec to stop the bleeding caused by my fibroids.I'm on my second pack now. So far I've had irregular light to moderate bleeding, moody,depression,breast heaviness, low sex drive,light acne, and just feeling plain WEIRD! I mean like kinda dizzy but kinda lightheaded at the same time.  I'm having a myomectomy next month. I hope I can finally get off these pills after my surgery.I just want to feel normal again.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	7/31/2010 5:08:52 AM	The pill has worked for me except when I had to take a prescription for an infection (UTI) I became pregnant right away. Other than that one time I have been on it for 3 years and the only problem I have is EXTREME nausious feelings shortly after taking the pill. I take the pill before bed and the nausious feelings get so bad that they wake me from my sleep. I tend to feel nausious off and on throughout the day as well. I also have a decreased sex drive except for during the time of the white pill (wrong time to have an increase in the sex drive). I also break out just before and during the white pills on my chin and cheeks. It clears up by the last 2 days or so of the white pill. Its actually great its like a WARNING of the period thats coming. Then I am always ready!!! It aslo keeps my periods regular its down to the day I LOVE KNOWING WHEN... And after 4 kids I am NOT PREGNANT... Guess its working GREAT!!
Birth Control	Pink1234, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	4	Female	19-24	7/25/2010 10:52:31 PM	I gave this birth control 3 stars bc I have only started the first pill of the second month.  My first month on tri sprintec was rocky.  Every other day from the first pill until the 3rd to the last placebo pill I broke out with nodular/cystic acne only on my chin.  My sex drive increased around the second week however the embarrassment and painful irritation the acne was causing me killed my mood.  The third week I was experiencing cramping from ovulation I assume, and later on that week for about 2/3 days I would cry over everything.  My period is light with regular cramping...I type &quot;is&quot; bc I still have it 5 days later even after taking the first pill of the second pack.  It looks as if my chin is starting to heal an I'm goof on 4 days without an additional breakout..so I'm going to continue with tri sprintec and hope my body if beginning to adjust to the new hormones.

No side effects. I took it for birth control, acne, and abnormal periods. I never got pregnant, and my periods did become a little more regular, but they still last different amounts of time each month and start on different dates. It helped a little with the acne in my hairline, but not so much. I still have moderate acne, and it hasn't really changed. I didn't want to gain a cup size, and as promised by my doctor, I didn't. Overall, I'd say it's you get what you pay for.

The only bad side effect is morning sickness that's relatively bad but goes away within a few minutes.

I have done a little research via the internet and found that this is a problem that a lot of other people have experienced also!

While on the pill my periods became regular and shorter with  lesser flow but I was always fatigued, moody and tired!  Oh yeah, I also had a lot of headaches! Now that I'm off of it I feel I have so much energy in comparisson to when I was on them... I'm so not taking these again!

Birth Control	tdubb3887, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	6/7/2010 7:00:42 PM	I've been taking this pill for over 3 years. It has made my periods very regular and pretty short. It made my boobs grow which was incredibly painful at first, but doesn't hurt anymore. It also made me have larges amount of discharge. Some days it felt like I wet my pants, no kidding. I talked to my doctor about it and she told me that it was the birth control. The biggest problem I have with this medicine is that it made my sex drive non-existent. Literally. This has put a strain in my relationship with my husband (understandably) and that's the main reason why I am choosing to get off of it. I've read a wide range of reviews from people absolutely hating it, to people loving it. It seems to affect people differently, so don't assume that what happened to them will happen to you. Just keep the symptoms in mind as possibilities for how this medicine might affect you.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	6/6/2010 1:40:04 AM	This was my first birth control, and I'm pretty sure my doctor pointed at random to a name on a page because this was the WORST bc for me to take.. it started off alright, a little bit moody but lighter periods.  THEN, my moodiness hit an all-time high, I started having black outs and panic attacks, my cramps became a different kind of pain (more like a stabbing pain rather than spasms), my entire personality changed drastically and I felt like I was trapped behind thick glass and detached from the world.  It wasn't until I went back to my doctor and told him about my problems with it that he decided to ask background questions and I finally found one that works.  Two of my other friends were on the same pills and they had experiences identical to mine.  I would rather eat ninja stars than recommend this to ANYONE!!

When I first started it after about two days I was really sad and would cry about nothing, however that went away after the first week. After about 5days of taking the pill I began to experience horrible breast tenderness to the point where they hurt if I stand up. The pain has been getting worse but hopefully once my body gets use to the pill it will go away. Other than that I am satisfied with this pill so far.
Birth Control	drsf, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	5/27/2010 7:10:55 PM	I've been on this pill for 3 weeks and I am depressed and irritable and prone to cry at just about anything.  My breasts are sore and I have 3 pimples, whereas I usually have very clear skin.I've been taking birth control pills for the last 14 years and have never had any significant side effects. I have been on a few different brands, my favorite being Ortho Tri Cyclen.  I am getting off this pill as soon as possible.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	5/25/2010 5:24:18 PM	I took tri sprintec for about a year and a half and I would not recommend it. At first i thought my mood swings were from going away to college but then they got really extreme and i would fight with my boyfriend over nothing at all. Recently  I talked with three of my friends who all started on tri sprintec at the same time as me and all of them have stopped it because it made them so emotional. I would not recommend this pill! I did not have any other side effects except breast tenderness and mood swings though.
Birth Control	ella33, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	5/16/2010 2:30:39 AM	ive been taking this bc call tri sprintec for 3 week and ive experience some migraines other then than everything find. but is it normal that i havent had my period?
Birth Control	zreynol2, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	5/8/2010 10:31:19 PM	i have been taking this for 2 months and have aquired acid reflux, sickness after eating, very gases, naseous frequently. i was excited about the pill at first but the side effects are just too much for me looking for a better alternative. 
Acne	beachykeen, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	4/29/2010 4:03:13 PM	I'm only on day 4 on tri sprintec and so far it has been awful. I'm sick to my stomach every day and have had the worst headaches. No mood swings (yet) but I seem to be breaking out more and my face itches.. I have taken seasonale before and it made me a little moody but cleared up my face and never gave me a headache. I'll finish out the month, but after reading all these reviews i dont expect it to get any better.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	4/26/2010 11:05:33 PM	In short: I had to stop taking this after 4 days of switching from Jolessa. The side effects were unbearable. Since beginning the drug I had severe headaches and incredible mood swings. On the the third ad fourth day I had extreme nausea and dizziness and blurred vision. It got to the point where I was scared to continue taking it and went to the pharmacy to make sure I didn't need to go to the hospital. My first week on tri-sprintec ended up being a very scary one. I have been off of it for about 4 days now. The headaches have continued but are decreasing in severity and the mood swings are not yet under control. I just can't wait till all of this is out of my system!
Birth Control	cls007, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/15/2010 7:52:24 PM	I must say, I was reluctant and somewhat scared to start Tri-Sprintec after all the horror stories I read. I'm almost on my 4th week now, and I'm pleasantly suprised! Into the 3rd week my skin became almost flawless. I'm not pregnant. I haven't gained any weight, nothing beyond gaining and losing 3 lbs which is a normal fluctuation for me. I'll sometimes take it in conjunction with 5-HTP (a natural and very effective supplement you can get at any wal-mart), with makes me more than sunshine-y happy and controls my appetite. It works for some, doesn't for others. For only 9 bucks a month I'd say it's well worth your investment to find out!!
Birth Control	topchic, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	19-24	4/14/2010 5:35:29 PM	when i got on this drug (switching from ortho tricyclen lo) i experienced mood swings and cystic acne due to too much progestin in my system.  now that i have quit taking it the withdrawls are as bad as getting on it.  i wouldnt reccommend to anyone not already used to the level of hormones contained in this medicine.  it was also difficult for me to lose weight while on this pill. 
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/8/2010 5:27:54 PM	I just started taking this pill a week ago because I has Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. I was on Orthotrycyclin Lo years ago and it made me EXTREMELY moody and gain a bunch of weight so I stopped taking it. When I was diagnosed with the Syndrome they put me on this and I have noticed a huge improvement in my mood. This pill is working wonderfully for me so far, the only side effect I experienced was bloating the first couple days. From what I understand this birth control is a hormonal birth control and is not for people who have not had problems with their period or hormones.
Acne	ash711, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	3/30/2010 2:37:56 PM	i'm on my 3rd week of my very first pack. my face is killing me. i wake up every morning with a new zit. i really want to stick it out for at least 3 months to see if my skin changes. other than the acne, its pretty good. anyone else have this problem?
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	4	5	Female	19-24	3/26/2010 11:22:38 PM	I started taking this medication a year ago, and I haven't become pregnant, which I'm sure is the most important thing.  I lost weight when I started taking it, although I've recently put a few pounds back on (not because of this medication, but because I recently had surgery for a torn ACL, so I've been less active).  For what it's worth, I've gathered from the reviews I've read that the majority of women who are dissatisfied with it had switched from lower hormone pills, but if you're just starting on BC or are switching from an equal-hormone pill or Depo, it would probably work for you.  I'll be switching to TriNessa at the end of the month, but not because I'm not satisfied with Tri-Sprintec.  I'm just switching to a different pharmacy that doesn't carry it.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/21/2010 12:10:52 PM	I switched to Tri-Sprintec after a year on Ortho Tri-Cyclene Lo to save money.  Although the drug was easy to use, I experienced severe, severe depression and mood swings; I constantly felt like crying and didn't want to get out of bed.  I never experienced anything like that on Ortho-- only some slight nausea that disappeared after a month.  I switched from Tri-Sprintec to Trivora (another generic), and within a week was back to my normal self.  I'm not a doctor but I think if you're subject to mood swings, don't take this.  Trivora and Triphasil-28 (which I'm on now since Trivora isn't available in South Africa where I'm now living) are both good options that did not cause extreme side effects for me.
Birth Control	Londa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	3/20/2010 4:17:04 AM	 I just wish I had listened to all the negative reviews, since I started this medicine 50 days ago I have had severe headaches blooting, painful cramping,extreme mood swings crazy rash and for the last 19 and counting bleeding not the light stuff but heavy. I would tell anyone thinking of taking this pill DON'T! Its not worth the benefits! I stopped 2 days ago and am still trying to get back to my normal self! 
Painful Periods	Ldubs, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	35-44	3/11/2010 4:21:37 PM	Just about every single side effect that can be had has happened since I began using this drug.
Birth Control	lelliott988, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/5/2010 1:40:04 PM	I was on the depo before this, and the pill is soooo much better. Im losing all the weight i gained from the depo and I was able to keep my boobs. They didnt go away with weight loss for the first time in my life. I love this birth control. I now have very short light and very predictible periods. even though its not right for everyone it works on me amazingly!!! and it is super cheap. better than ortho tri cyc.
Birth Control	TJJ, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/3/2010 11:12:43 AM	I switched to this pill because I was having bleeding 2 weeks before my period with other pills. This pill prevents that for me. The week before my period my breasts swell more than on any other pill and the first day I have a headache from my change in hormone levels. I experience shorter periods and normal bleeding with this pill. Cramping is slightly greater for me. But it's better than having a period for 3 weeks at a time.
Birth Control	rebeccalyn311, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	2/26/2010 10:59:46 PM	Well first of all I think people should stop posting comments if they have only taken the drug for a week. I haven't had any major problems on Tri Sprintec. A little depression when I first start my period. I'm hoping it will make my breasts bigger too! Lol.
Birth Control	Val14, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	2/26/2010 12:47:39 AM	It was very easy to take, besides remembering to take it everyday. I was on ortho tricyclin low first but switch b/c the first was way too expensive. On Ortho, i had mild mirgranes every so often, but now on Tri Sprintec I have massive migranes/headaches at least 2-3 times a week. I'm also always in a bad mood, the littlest thing can trigger an emotional state &amp; half the time i have no clue why i'm upset or feel like crying. Lately, the migranes have only gotten worse and they seem to be in the same spot (left temple), but now they are spreading down my head towards my neck &amp; around to the other side. I would not recommend this as a birth control method, yes it's cheap, but the headaches eventually become unbearable &amp; i've taken so much aspirin for my headaches that i'm developing stomach ulcers!
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	13-18	2/25/2010 11:44:42 PM	i have developed a lump in my breast since taking this medication and also suffered from constant headaches

I couldn't stand the smell of beef. I take it regularly but not at the same time everyday. I do bloat, but my boobs got bigger!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	2/24/2010 6:24:09 PM	I was prescribed Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo but my pharmacy shipped me this generic instead. I was upset at first, but overall I am pleased with this medication. The only side effect I experienced was breast tenderness.
Birth Control	Viv, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	2/23/2010 4:13:16 PM	I'm going on my 2nd month w/ the pills and so far I'm so overly emotional and I would over analyze things. My high sex drive never changed though. But I definitely hope it gets better bc I can't keep picking fights w/ my bf. 
Birth Control	ab, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	2/12/2010 1:48:31 PM	I HATE HATE HATED this pill. I have taken birthcontrol for several years but recently switched to this brand because it was so cheap. I became extremely moody and would fight with my fiance over nothing. Had no sex drive whatsoever. While my breasts did get bigger(which was good) they were extremely sore. I would not recommend this pill to anyone. I have taken yaz and avaine before this and they never gave me any of the side effects that this pill did. do not take!
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/27/2010 5:16:58 PM	Been on it for a long time, have no complaints

Birth Control	mtngirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/21/2010 1:38:08 PM	I started out on Trinessa, but switched to this medication because I switched pharmacies. The symptoms I've noticed most are bloating, headaches, and sensitivity to light (dry eyes). It was pretty severe for the first 2 months of use, but has gotten better. My sex drive has decreased somewhat, but I continue to use this brand because of cost. Most importantly, it has been effective so far, which is good b/c I don't always take it at the same time each day.
Birth Control	Alex, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	1/20/2010 2:21:42 PM	I have no major complaints. I switched to this pill because Yaz made my face break out horribly. My skin is now very smooth. My periods are also no longer unbearably painful. I have noticed that I no longer have an appetite(not that that's a bad thing!)...I can usually go until 4pm without feeling hungry. One downside may be that my sex drive has decreased. The biggest plus is that my breasts have slightly increased in size.
Birth Control	Pamela, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	1/19/2010 9:48:52 AM	I have been taking Tri-Sprintec for almost a year now. I don't know why I haven't switched sooner, because I have had the following symptoms the entire time: a VERY low sex drive, vaginal dryness to the point where I dread intercourse because of the pain, and worst of all extreme irritability. Every two weeks I am upset, crying, yelling, and unable to control my emotions. It has taken a toll on my relationship and my life. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, I recommend switching BC quickly because the symptoms do not go away over time.

Birth Control	Lbohannon, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/15/2010 11:25:28 PM	I have just got put back on this med. but was on it when I was 15 years old and I loved it it made me have normal period &amp; less acne. I also know there is alot of people who say that this BC causes weight gain But NO oral BC causes weight gain. only depo causes weight gain. I would recomend this to anyone (although side effects are different for eveyone)
Birth Control	KL2B, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	1/15/2010 4:14:09 PM	This is my fourth month of Tri-sprintec, and am being taken off of it by my Gyno. I continue to have breakthrought bleeding, making my periods start 2 weeks early, brown bleeding until my &quot;regular&quot; period, therefore having a 2 week period. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	1/15/2010 1:01:14 PM	I had to start taking this to replace Yaz, which we could no longer afford. I could definatly feel when this took effect. I gained weight, despite my best efforts. I am bloated and tired for three weeks. I actually look forward to my period, because it all eases up for a week! I make it a point to NOT recommend this to anyone!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	1/12/2010 5:02:47 PM	I've been using this pill for one week now and feel incredibly tired, and am only hungry for taco bell or other cheesy foods.  I am becoming bloated and irritable and am starting to think having a baby would be better.
Acne	cjywtw, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	1/6/2010 10:55:04 AM	I've been having acne for about 6 years and tried everything. Friend suggested me to take BC so i tried and was really hopeful for it to help clear up my skin. For the first month it kind of did so i continued to the second pack but that's when everything started to get worse. My skin has never been worse than it is now. I'm breaking out even more sever on my chin all the way down to my neck. I asked my doctor and thought I should wait after 3 months but I'm finishing my 3rd pack now and it's just not getting any better. the pill also makes me really moody and nausea all the time. HORRIBLE.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/4/2010 5:33:37 PM	People reading these reviews should keep in mind that most people go on the internet to complain, and usually not to say how well something works for them.  I have been using tri-sprintec for a month and really like it.  My skin has cleared up and the only side effect I've experienced is breast tenderness that is starting to go away now.Please understand that birth control pills do not cause you to gain weight.  That is a myth.  If you gain weight on the pill, it is because you are eating too much, not exercising enough, or both.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	hurting, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	1/3/2010 9:36:45 PM	I have taken 1 week and 1 day of this medicine and I feel like I am having a heart attack.  2 days of severe, nearly constant stabbing pains in my heart area.  I also have &quot;period&quot; like cramps and my legs were so dry they felt like fire with little red bumps.  I haven't noticed a real change in anything else, emotionally or acne wise, but this chest pain is killing me.  I took Nuva Ring for 3 months before this and noticed chest pain right away but not like this.  Before that I was on the patch for several years and although I didn't want to pay for it think I am going back.  I got more vaginal infections on that but otherwise never had acne, no cramps and awesome periods.  I don't think I can possibly continue this drug to see if it gets better...

And thought that my body just needed to adjust.But I was beyond wrong, I've had spotting every other week, nause, I'm always hungry now.Omg the list goes on,I'm so happy I decided to check the reviews on this pill now I know its not me its the pill.
Birth Control	jill, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	12/28/2009 6:40:08 PM	I have been taking this med for BC for a few years.  I started having vaginal dryness, to the point where it would split open (very painful).  My doc even told me it looked like an elderly woman who has no estrogen, but a blood test showed my levels were perfect.  I had no idea what it was from until I started researching this pill.  I really thought I had something seriously wrong with me.  Maybe it's time for a change!
Birth Control	jan123, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	12/27/2009 12:16:59 AM	I have been taking this medicine for 1.5 weeks. I have experienced things such as: itchy skin, breast swelling, cramps in stomach, fatigue, some shortness of breath, and i have more acne on my face. i was hoping that it would clear up my face, not make it worse.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	12/17/2009 7:48:05 PM	HATE THIS MED- never had a weight problem in my life- I eat healthy and go to the gym daily, I gained 10lbs in 2 months. It made me completely irrational, everything drove me crazy and i couldn't stop crying. I was exhausted, had head aches, and my eyes were so dry i couldn't wear contacts. Cramps too. WORST birth control ever.
Birth Control	rinrin, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	12/17/2009 4:41:12 AM	I had the following symptoms: 1. Depression- After a week of taking this I got horribly depressed.  If you are prone to depression I would recommend a different birth control.  2. Low Libido- My sex drive use to be really high, but when I started taking this, I didn't really feel in the mood any more, it was hard to get aroused and I had vaginal dryness which made intercourse painful.  3. Acne- I have always had acne, if you are taking this to improve your acne, I didn't see any results, it may even have got a tiny bit worse.  4. Weight gain- I gained about 2 lbs in the first month, I think it was water weight because I felt very bloated, puffy.  5. Sore breasts- After 2 weeks of taking this, my breasts became large and very sore.  They hurt to be touched.  6. Fatigue- I couldn't stay up late, I got too tired.  Parting thoughts:  This birth control may affect everyone differently.  The symptoms may also improve after a few months once your body gets used to the changes in hormone level.  I don't know that for sure though because I stopped taking it.  I didn't like feeling pregnant all the time.  BUT, at least that part of it was effective.  I started having intercourse after 6 days of use and did not take the pill at the same time every day, always at different times.  My boyfriend did not use protection and I am not pregnant.
Other	MISSwint, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	12/15/2009 8:23:41 PM	Today would be my 3rd day on this pill but I'm refusing to continue using it. I have experienced the following side effects so far, and the side effects outweigh the benefits: diarrhea for over 48 hours/mixed with constipation, headaches, heavy chest, nausea so bad i have called off work, vomiting more than 5 times a day, (shaking) chills, fever, extreme fatigue (i have slept a total of 17 hours so far today), lightheaded/blacking out, all-over body aches. This might be good for someone else, but it is NOT the pill for me.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	12/14/2009 4:43:59 PM	Okay, so I had really bad periods. I bled a lot and it was every two weeks. Horrible cramps. Turned out I had cysts on my ovaries, especially on my right side. Now, I have no issues with cysts anymore, and my sex drive is still the same. I didn't get sick on it or anything, and trust me, I get sick really easy from medication. The women on my side of the family are called &quot;fertile mertile&quot;, but luckily, this birth control has worked for me. I honestly definitely recommend it.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/13/2009 1:01:15 AM	Though only day two, this pill has not made me sick at all. I have bad acne so I'm hoping it will clear up. So far so good :)
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	1	1	Female	19-24	12/12/2009 11:43:45 PM	I began taking this medication two weeks ago.  Three days ago I began experiencing tightness of chest, shortness of breath, and have had a very difficult time breathing regularly.  It has interfered with my fitness routine, work, and sleep.  Ultimately, I've experienced increased levels of anxiety.  I've never been on birth control before and I am 23 years old.  I was nervous to start because I am very health conscious.  My weight has already began to fluctuate daily.  Perhaps I am stretching, but I am and always have been fully aware of my body and its functions.  And this medication and I.. are not working out.  
Birth Control	Karen., 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	19-24	12/7/2009 4:39:25 PM	It makes me super emotional and my body gets achy but other than that it works. Haven't goten pregnant. Its making my period regular. I dont like the pill but its working soo i do recommend it for the most part. But i do get the side effects i have good days and bad days.
Birth Control	AnaB, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	11/30/2009 10:44:32 PM	Previous birth control pills I've been on (Desogen and Ortho Tri Cyclen) have only resulted in minor weight gain for me, but I was able to work it off. I was put on Tri Sprintec and the first day I took it I had a horrible headache and nausea. The following days were better, but I'd still experience minor headaches. I'm into the 2nd week of my first pack and I'm also noticing shortness of breath; I feel like I've just ran a few laps even when I'm laying on my bed. I've also noticed an increased heart beat. Something doesn't feel right so I'm stopping this pill and seeing my doctor to get switched.

But it has helped me a lot!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	11/21/2009 12:18:43 PM	I was initially taking tri-nessa, they switched me to tri-sprintec and said it was the same medication. i didnt stop beeding for over a month straight, which lead to fatigue and dizziness,it was not a fun situation
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/20/2009 9:36:40 PM	I have been on Tri-Sprintec for 4 months now and have had no issues with it.  I was on Ortho Tri-cyclen Lo before but switched because of the expense. I have no nausea, no headaches, and best of all no pregnancy. On Tri-Sprintec my periods are slightly shorter than they used to be and I have hardly any cramping, whereas before going on the pill I had horrible cramps for the first two days.  I would recommend this birth control pill.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	Marie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	11/17/2009 3:53:03 PM	I'm 31 and have been taking Tri Sprintec for 11 months now for birth control and to keep my periods regulated. The cramps are still present but are better than when not on a pill. I have little to no sex drive which is negatively affecting my relationship as well as moodiness.  Things easily set me off and the bad mood is hard to come out of. Sex is uncomfortable due to dryness 3 out of the 4 weeks. I haven't gained weight but I do notice I am intaking more calories in week 3 than the other weeks -- thankfully I work out often. I will most likely ask to switch pills to see if another might work for me better. Overall, it is better than past pills but I still don't think I've found the right one yet. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	19-24	11/16/2009 1:12:06 PM	I was given this because I'm a student and can't afford expensive medication. At first all I noticed was that I could plan my periods and not worry about it, because I hadn't been getting them. I didn't get sick or dizzy. But a month or two in my sex drive went to zero, I got depressed and didn't care about anything, I started snapping at people constantly for no reason and basically just realized this pill was probably the thing that ruined the last year of my life. Thanks a bunch, Tri Sprintec.
Birth Control	adrian, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	11/11/2009 4:03:36 PM	Its my first month on the pill and feel good the first week felt fine no side effects at all with the second week i did get a little nausous. i never suffered from acne before and now have mild acne and itchy dry skin on my face did any body experience that in the beginning if so did it go away after a while?
Birth Control	Jecca1087, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	1	Female	19-24	11/8/2009 5:39:02 PM	I have been on this medication for 4 years, since then, I have had painful urination every single day!  I hate to even think of going to the bathroom.  Went to dr, they aren't urinary tract infections... what could it be?
Birth Control	KansasRN, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/7/2009 3:35:39 AM	I am just starting the 2nd week of my 4th pack of Tri-Sprintec. So far, this pill is effective in preventing pregnancy and easy to use, I just set my cell phone alarm to go off at the same time each day. I haven't had any irregular periods from it, but the mood swings are horrible and I gained 12 lbs. in the first month of taking this!!! I have also had a very decreased sex drive, difficulty climaxing, and increased vaginal dryness...never a problem for me before at all! I have also had increased insomnia,bloating, fatigue and some mild acne. I'm not sure if my body is still adjusting to this pill, but if these side effects do not change soon, I will be finding another form of birth control fast!!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	11/4/2009 11:04:46 PM	I was happily on Yasmin for 5 years until i was forced to switch because of yasmins &quot;issues&quot; that I never experienced. Now I'm on Tri-Sprintec and Im fat and depressed :( I would do anything for my Yasmin back.
Birth Control	MiracleBaby, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/4/2009 2:51:14 PM	 I haven't been on it long but I've noticed I'm in a better mood mostly now, no nausea other than usual for me (acid reflex), and my sexual drive has increased. I've had a small, insignificant outbreak on my chin but it could be due to stress lately. I guess this could change after being on it for a few months but so far so good. 
Birth Control	brezzybreeze, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	25-34	10/29/2009 12:46:37 PM	I started out on ortho tri cyclen lo in the beginning (I first started takin BC pills at the end of 2007) After about a year my Doctor put me on the Generic Brand Tri Sprintec (I only pay 5 bucks for mines) My skin is clear, I may have gained some weight but it's not much. The only problem I have is my period is longer and heavier than it was before I went on Tri Sprintec. Before BC and even while on Ortho lo my cycle was 5 days...first two days heavy last three days light. Now it last for at least 7 days and is HEAVY all seven days. Am I the only one experinceing this????? I plan on talkin to my doc about this when I go in for my next check up. Also, I almost always start my period before the reminder pills...for instance I'll start my cylce while still on the dark blue pills and end the next week after my reminders pills are done. That is far too long to be on a period, it drives me nuts. :-/
Other	froggylove16, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	10/23/2009 12:46:18 PM	I have been taking the pill for a little over 3 months. It was suppossed to help with irregular spotting. I find I have abnormal periods, terrible cramps, and very moody. I used to take Junel the generic for Lo Estren but I found this pill cheaper and I'm unemployed. Now I wish I had never switched. I have had 2 periods a month. I was never one to have cramps before, or be moody. I have gained about 12  pounds since I started this pill. My cycle is heavier than it was with my last BC and I am very emotional with this pill. I also have had bad abdominal pains not even during my cycle. I would never recommend this pill due to all the problems I have had with it. The pill has had a small effect on my sexual drive. I feel exhausted, dizzy and fatigue all the time. I cant wait to go back to the doctors and switch my pill back.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	10/17/2009 11:52:51 AM	I have been taking tri-sprintac from almost 6 months now for BC and painful cramping. I agree that it suits its purpose as a birth control, but as far as cramping they are worst then before plus the weight gain and moodiness I cant wait to go back to the doctor and get my script changed. I am still a favorite of the depo shot, works wonders!

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	10/13/2009 11:17:27 PM	Of course it is easy to use in that you just have to remember to take it!  I gained like 15 lbs since taking this pill.  I, like many, used to be on the Ortho. brand, but thought I could save money and switch to the generic.  I can't wait to be off the pill, those were the best times of my life when we were not trying to prevent pregnancy.  This pill makes me so moody, zero sex drive and just unhappy!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods		1	5	1			10/9/2009 7:16:00 PM	my doctor put me on tri-sprintec in feb. 2009 to regulate my periods. i was not sexually active. i never missed taking a pill and i always took it at the same time. i was on the pill for only six months. my boyfriend and i became sexually active in june 2009, senior prom night. my last period was august 2009. i continued taking the pill until the middle of september thinking that i just 'skipped' my period. WRONG. i am now ten weeks pregnant. my advise is if you take this pill for birth control you probably need a back up method. 
Birth Control	 Female  (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female		10/7/2009 12:51:47 AM	I was on it for a year and gained 13 pounds. Other than that, I had no other side affects. 
Birth Control		5	5	1			10/5/2009 3:07:36 PM	I have been on this pill for almost a year and a half. Recently i ran into a girl, we somehow started talking about the pill and which ones we were on and she told me that she had been on tri-sprintec and had to quit it because it just made her feel generally off and unwell... For the past year plus i have been feeling depressed, nauseas and generally not myself and until reading these reviews i thought it was me and not the pill. I am so happy to be reading these reviews and hope that by changing pills i will start to feel like myself again. This pill may work for some people- but i would rather have a baby that feel like i have felt this past year.
Birth Control	sprintec, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	10/2/2009 7:37:47 PM	Upon having bad menstral cycles I decided to ask my doctor for BC. With in the first week i suffered from serious acne on my chin. I have never had acne a day in my life and upon taking this medicine ive had THE WORST break outs. But worst of all I encountered numerous mood swings where i jsut felt the need to cry or run 5 miles (weird.. i kno). anyway, i have stopped taking the medicine for a week and now i am started my menstral again! this medicine is horrible! 
Birth Control	Della, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	10/2/2009 12:04:08 PM	I have been taking Tri-Sprintec for over a month now. So far I've only had sore breasts and some spotting which has gone away. I am very happy with it.
Painful Periods	becalynn, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	10/1/2009 5:16:40 AM	Hello everyone,I started taking this medication about a month ago and well umm i am not good at routine but managed to take 12 pills now i don't know if that is long enough to produce some side effects but I have gained about 15 pounds in the month that i have been trying to take these. i came off of the nuva ring and started these almost right away. i also have had excessive tiredness, and moodiness. the only thing other then this that has changed is my job and what i eat. now i eat better and not as much sweets as i used to. so could be do to the change in job but i don't think enitirely. i do not recommend this pill to anyone i will go back to the nuva ring i don't care what it costs or i will go without as i do not have intercourse i was only on birth control for painful cramps and irregularity. good luck to all you ladies just check other opitions before you try tri sprintec
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	9/29/2009 11:17:43 AM	I have only taken it for a month and I haven't had any of the side effects. Reading through the comments, it looks like it depends on the person. So far it is effective with not having a baby but I have only been taking it for one month so I hope it works for longer. 
Birth Control	Courtney , 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	13-18	9/27/2009 9:55:17 AM	This medication is horrible, I would not suggest anyone to take this pill. Today will only have been my 7th day to take this medication and I've had horrible side effects. The killer, though, is nausea. I wake up with it, I suffer through it all day. I've also been taking Doxycycl Hyc for acne, and from what I heard, one of the main side affects from this medication is nausea. So I thought it was maybe that, so i stopped taking the antibiotic for a few days, and the nausea still accured. As far as other side affects due to this birth control, I get head-aches, stomach pains which i mistake for cramps. Im always hungry, EXTREMELY moody, and at the most random of times. Especially right after i take my medication. Im going to consult my care physician soon. I hate this pill.
Birth Control	Kat 79, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/25/2009 1:45:33 PM	This is generic of Ortho Tri Cyclen. It only costs me $9.99 a month which is awesome. I am 30 years old with some acne it works well. I have no side effects at all. No breakthrough bleeding, nausea, weigh gain. I was on Yaz for 1 year, terrible headaches on a daily basis and breast soreness. I tried Femcon for 5 months and I had non stop breakthrough bleeding and I was going bald. You should give 3-4 months for your body to adjust. So unless you have some serious side effects I would ignore bad reviews about people who only have been on any bc for few days or just weeks. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	9/23/2009 10:12:37 PM	First of all, I started this pill only 3 days ago. 3 days ago I felt very happy and content, my body felt fine and I was emotionally well balanced. In these past three days I have been the most unhappy person, I have been crying at ridiculous things or things that I really don't need to cry about and I feel like I am going to throw up every night. My body is tired, but I can't sleep well. I took Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo before and NEVER felt this bad, minus the breast tenderness and low sex drive. This pill is terrible and I am calling my primary care in the morning, I can't live like this everyday. 
Birth Control	Slim, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	9/16/2009 3:52:14 PM	This is my 2nd month on this BC. I began to have heightened anxiety, nervousness, dry mouth, and depression. I'm always achey and have no energy... I thought I had an serious underlined issue with my health. I would have never thought it could be these pills. After a friend recommended I google reviews on this pill, I was shocked to see that so many women have experienced my symptoms.  I'm glad to know I'm not alone, I began to feel crazy! I was on Ortho tri-cyclen lo for a long time and had none of these issues. I'm going to see about going back to ortho tri-cyclen lo or stopping birth control altogether for a while. This is overwhelming!!
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	9/13/2009 9:22:07 AM	I started this about a week ago and it has been the most awful week! I cry everyday, have horrible mood swings where I freak out on people for no reason, I have acne on every inch of my face, and am hungry all the time. I took ortho tri cyclen for 3 years and never had any of these problems but because of insurance reasons switched to this horrible stuff. After reading these other reviews I will definitely be stopping this pill today and I would never recommend it to anyone!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	9/13/2009 12:29:44 AM	Was on yasmin for 5 yrs, changed cuz changed jobs that does not have ins. Loved Yasmin just couldn't afford $65 monthly. Asked doc to change me to Tri-Sprintec, cuz its only $9 month. I've been on it for a month and half. Have had some awful side effects: nausea, stomach pain, headaches, tiredness, can't catch my breath, hungry and can't feel satisfied, started spotting 2 days ago a full week b4 my period (never had this problem with yasmin), no engry (all i want to do is sleep), no sex drive, stinky pee, and muscle aches.  Never had reactions like this b4 with any medicine, i really thought something serious was wrong with me (until i read these reviews). I'm stopping this BC today, luckily i have some yasmin refills still. 
Birth Control	Rose, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	9/11/2009 12:19:48 PM	I had the following negative side effects: severe headaches, anxiety, nervousness, depression, tired easily, overall abnormal feeling, and severe acne breakout.  My pharmacy pushed this drug on me.  Naturally I accepted the fact that I had to switch (so I thought). Come to find out, they were &quot;recommending&quot; this drug over Tri-Nessa, probably b/c they were getting compensated on the back end.  I told my doctor and quickly switched brands altogether.  Not a satisfied customer of Tri-Sprintec.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	9/9/2009 4:46:59 PM	I switched to it from another BC and loved it since. Have no bloating, no acne, no mood swings or any crazy cravings girls here talked about. I actually lost weight. Breasts do get bigger by 2nd or 3rd pill of last week which my BF loves. But other then that no problems just peace of mind. I take it before going to bed so pretty easy to remember.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	9/8/2009 10:11:57 AM	I just switched to this BC because it was cheaper then the one I was on previously. I have been on several BC during my life but this one even though I have been on it for only 1 week I am not impressed at all.After 2 days I noticed headaches along with feeling bloated. I felt hungry but yet nothing I ate filled me up or nothing sounded good at all to me. I stared getting light headed and naseauted all the time and very moody. I also noticed bad dry mouth and hot flashes..yeah all of this in just 1 week of taking this BC. I am DONE! I will not take anymore until I see the doctor. I mean if I am going to have these side effects I might as well be pregnant with my 4th child!
Birth Control	pill_awareness, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	9/4/2009 9:19:24 PM	****Are you having severe headaches, vision problems, dizziness, ear pain, nausea?? If so, you may be experiencing what my daughter did. Please, please seek immediate treatment from your physician and request a CT or MRI. This is the only way to detect blood clots. Unfortunately, my daughter did not have that chance. She was 18 years old and on this pill for exactly 7 weeks. I do NOT want to scare anyone! I want to raise awareness of the side effects and prevent any of you going through what my daughter did. Listen to your body and go with your gut. If something doesn't feel right, you need to get it checked out. You may need to be very persistent with your doctors too. Don't give up &amp; give in to them. If you are having any of the side effects I listed above daily, you need to follow-up with your physician right away.  But first and foremost you must quit taking this pill!!****
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	19-24	9/2/2009 7:02:55 AM	This medication would give me breakthrough bleeding. Some months I would be fine and other months I would have my period for 2 weeks or more because of the breakthrough bleeding. Also, if i took the medication an hour later than normal, i would have breakthrough. My Dr. switched me to a monophasic birth control instead because there is only one level of hormone all month, not 3 like this one. I Don't reccomend this one.
Birth Control	thinksmart, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	9/2/2009 12:04:15 AM	Effectiveness? I guess so, I haven't had sex in weeks with no sex drive and no vaginal fluid. My skin is horrible! I have the worst acne I've ever had in my life and my skin is incredibly itchy!  I'm a scabby mess and have gained 5 lbs in the 2 months I've been on it. I'm done.  
Birth Control	cryalot, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	8/31/2009 7:31:05 PM	The pill is easy to swallow of course, I've been taking it for about 6 months are more.  My mood change has been drastic, my male friends have noticed these changes. I go from happy to sad within seconds.  I get angry at the smallest thing, and I even thought about suicide which was so not me.  I thought it was just me at first, until I read the postings.  I just stopped taking the pills two days ago and I never intend on taking them again...not to mention I have been having difficulty sleeping and crying for no reason at all on a regular basis. This medication is not for everyone, if it makes a healty individual think about suicide imagine what it could do to someone who is mentally unstable.

From the begining my breasts were very tender &amp; as time went on i bacame extremely moody. I was put on birth control to shorten my usual 7day period &amp; i endend up having a period for 3 weeks.

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	8/29/2009 3:10:29 PM	I have been on oral contraception for over 8 years, and during that time I have used a variety of different types (tri-cyclics--brand name and generic, monocyclic--reg and lo estrogen), but never have I experienced the *breast tenderness* that I have had with this medication. I am going to try to wait it out to see if it dissipates over time, but sheesh...my nipples are sore!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	8/29/2009 11:19:18 AM	I hate this medicine. I was on Ortho tri cyclen lo and then got switched to tri lo sprintec. I have had the worst acne of my life, no motivation and severe depression. I'm going back onto ortho tri cyclen lo or switching BC all together

The only side effect I experienced the first and second months was breast tenderness. It has gone done since then. Other than that, no weight gain or mood swings.My peroid starts 4 days after (on Wednesday, for Sunday starts) and lasts for 4 days at a light-med flow. I am happy with 
Birth Control	nesian, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	8/26/2009 12:51:25 AM	I've only been on Tri Lo Sprintec for 3 wks now and I have broke out in a rash under both my arms for 2 wks now.  Even though I don't have insurance I am seriously considering trying to get back on Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo because the itchy rash is INCREDIBLY annoying and I haven't found anything to get rid of the rash.  It is not worth it.
Birth Control	feelawful, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	8/20/2009 6:47:41 PM	Let me be blunt....I hate this medication. I was on Ortho Lo and had to switch because my insurance would not cover. There are NO pros about this medication. I have gained weight, severely moody, missed periods, retaining fluid, feeling depressed, and the list can go on....I will pay the extra to go back to ortho lo. Do not take this pill it is horrible. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	8/16/2009 9:11:18 AM	OMG. I had severe itching,dry patches and rashes the moment I took this pill. My Dr. thought it was eczema-severe dry skin, common among African American females. Then I finally read these reviews. I am switching asap. I did like the 3-4 day periods but hate the severe reashes. THen my Dr. gave me steriods to stop the itching. It stoped, but the rash is still flairing up. 
Birth Control	BreD, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	8/10/2009 11:31:11 PM	I have been taking tri-sprintec for 2 months and 3 weeks. I have had no problems w/ it. I have an alarm set on my phone to take it at the same time everyday otherwise I would forget. My face has broken out a little bit but I think it may have to do w/ the amount of stress I've been under. My periods are medium to light and last about 3-4 days. I've been told I've lost weight..since I've taken this pill I've lost my appetite slightly...I mean I still eat BELIEVE me but I definitely feel it has gone down since I've started taking these pills. Another plus is my sex drive is through the roof! Before tri-sprintec I took trinessa and my periods were heavy and I had unbearably painful cramps that affected me at work..I couldn't stand straight I had to be slightly bent over and sometimes couldn't stand at all. I am quite content w/ these pills. I just hope my pimple flare up goes away now that im not as stressed 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	MsPMS, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	13-18	8/9/2009 11:41:07 PM	I've been on this for three months. The worst symptom I've had is nausea and panic attacks (due to the nausea). My PMS seemed about the same as before, but my periods are much lighter and have gone from 8-9 days to 5-6 days, and I went from using super to regular tampons. I may switch just for the PMS symptoms of breast tenderness and the mood swings.
Birth Control	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female		8/4/2009 4:36:22 PM	I have been on this pill for three months, and I have had been retaining water pretty much the whole time, then they put me on a water pill to see if it would help, it does, but i don't want to be on that either.  I think I'm going to have to try another kind.  Did anyone else have issues with retaining fluid?
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	8/3/2009 6:26:00 PM	With other pills, if I took one late occasionally, I didn't have much of a problem.  On this one, I took one pill late over a week ago and I've been spotting ever since.  So I guess I will have to be VERY CONSCIENCIOUS about taking it at exactly the same time.  Other than that, I haven't noticed any issues.  I've been taking it for about 2 months.
Birth Control	lady, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	8/3/2009 4:45:40 PM	I have been using Sprintec for a month now and I thought things were ok. I did get some breast tenderness and pain but I'm used to that especially the week before I start my period. But then I had some vaginal itching that resembled having a yeast infection, when in fact, after a doctor's examination revealed that I did not have. My body has broken out into a red, bumpy rash that is severly itchy even with the use of unscented body lotion. Please strongly consider all of these comments...as many have said, EACH WOMAN'S EXPERIENCE with this drug will be DIFFERENT. Unfortunately, many of our expreiences with Sprintec were negative. I'm switching to another pill immediately.
Birth Control	kdctam, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	19-24	8/2/2009 11:41:29 PM	I started Tri-sprintec a couple of months after giving birth and gained 15 more pounds than I weighed while pregnant! I would workout and try to diet and nothing. I was very moody all the time, and became extremly depressed a few times. Ive been off it now for a month and have begun losing weight and I'm a much happier person. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	bky927, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	8/1/2009 9:26:00 AM	I had been on OTC and decided to go to generics b/c of the expense of the name brand.  I had Tri-Nessa for 2 months and just got switched over to Tri-Sprintec as a new generic substitute.  I'll start taking it tomorrow, but after reading these reviews I'm now very hesitant.  The side effects sound awful.  I had no problems with OTC.  I've had some intestinal issues lately which coincide with when I started taking the TN, but the doc says it probably wasn't caused by the pills (???).  So now that I have TS I'm hoping I'm one of the seemingly few that have a positive experience with it.  But I'm definitely woried now.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	7/20/2009 8:24:01 PM	I tried to kill myself and ended up in the hospital when I was taking this Tri Sprintec. I cried almost every day, and felt very emotional all the time when I was taking it. I don't keep track of things as well as other reviewers on here, so I don't know exactly when it started, but I know that I was on Tri Sprintec for almost a year and cried every day almost every day. Then, when I switched to Femcon and next Balziva, I became a normal person again. Before I took Tri Sprintec, I had been taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo and didn't realize there was a problem with my moods, but now that I have the perspective from being on Balziva, I think all the tri-phasic pills cause me to feel like I want to cry all the time, whereas the mono-phasic pills such as Balziva and Femcon make me less upset. Actually, with Balziva, I feel completely level-headed and rarely feel like crying. I don't even have PMS now. Tri Sprintec gave me the heaviest periods I've ever had (Super flow tampons for five days, but without BCPs I rarely have a period and when it comes it's like spotting and nothing more), but with Balziva I wear Regular tampons for four days, and sometimes I can go for several hours without a tampon during my period. Anyway, everyone is different, but Tri Sprintec really messed me up emotionally and I don't ever want to switch from Balziva to anything else now.
Birth Control	notsatisfiedwhatsoever, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	13-18	7/19/2009 11:29:19 AM	I've been on tri sprintec for a week now and it has made me feel terrible. I've experienced terrible muscle aches and I'm normally a very active person and I have had no drive to work out, or move at all. I'm normally happy and bubbly and lately I have been anti-social and moody. I've been getting severe headaches that I wake up in the middle of the night with, and I have been nauseaus for the past 4 days. I feel very hungry but nothing sounds good. Whenever I do eat something I either have a really upset stomache of severe nausea. I haven't had the problem of overeating besides yesterday when nothing I at satisfied my hunger. I'm going to finish the pack I'm on and see if things get better. Overall I am extremely dissatisfied with this BC.

Birth Control	jessie sparks, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	25-34	7/14/2009 8:14:03 AM	Have taken other oral contraceptives before, but the side effects of tri sprintec have been the most symptomatic.  This is my first month and I know there is an adjustment period, but it seems way worse than any other I've taken.  I've had horrible headaches, extreme breast tenderness, cramping (worse than during my period), fairly heavy spotting, and increased moodiness.  Hopefully, it will straighten itself out soon! 
Birth Control	katimac37, 19-24 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2		19-24	7/8/2009 3:28:46 PM	i have been on this pill since november and recently i have experienced vomiting and left breast pain. i was on YAZ before and had no complications.. im going back to YAZ because of the side effects 
Birth Control	19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	4		19-24	7/8/2009 2:06:33 PM	I have taken tri-sprintec for three months.  The main side effects I have dealt with are nauseu and breast tenderness.  I have noticed I always have very bad nauseu during the first week of each pill pack.The first two months I was on the pill, my period started on the day of the first placebo pill.  During my third month on the pill, my period did not start until the fourth day placebo pill.  I noticed another reviewer noted this exact problem, also, and I'm wondering if this is commonly when your period will start on the pill?  I was getting nervous if my period was going to come or not!  I have noticed that my periods are shorter and lighter.  Before beginning the pill, I always experienced uncomfortable crampls and my skin would break out before my period began.  These symptoms have not occurred since I began tri-sprintec, however.
Birth Control	lotzoflove, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	7/7/2009 10:42:13 PM	I have been on this medicine for a month now and quite sastified. The first three days were not fun, I was really nauseous. The rest of the time I was fine. I could have been a little extra moody, but too bad. One thing that worried me on the last week of my pills for the first month was I didn't start my period right away. It was four days into the white pills when I finally started my period. It gave me a pregnancy scare. But it did come finally. I don't know why I started late. Did that happen to anyone else?
Birth Control	heather89, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	6/28/2009 11:02:48 PM	I just started on my third week of these pills, and within the first week, I noticed a big differnece in myself.  I have been so moody and have gotten upset over the littlest things.  My breasts have been sore to the touch this whole month! it has givin me HORRIBLE acne, and it has just made me a down right emotional person, (which is not me).  I know this medication effects people differently, but for me, the experience has been outrageous!!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	6/28/2009 9:02:54 PM	I have had a wonderful experience with this medication... not to mention it also helps with my acne ..i would highly recomend it.
Birth Control	jennyeve, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	6/22/2009 11:20:04 PM	Wow, I have been on Tri-Sprintec for a year now and in this year I have lost all sex drive, been in more emotional counseling, started on different anti-depressants, started meds for anxiety, and my marriage is suffering due to no sex drive. I had no idea any or all of these issues could maybe be from my BC pills.  I had used Ortho Tri-Cylen for 10+ years before we decided to start a family and never had issues.  My pharmacy just gave me the generic for when I got my new script and I thought nothing of it.  I though this was the same as Ortho Tri-Cylen.  The amount of horemones in them both seemed the same to me.  Not sure how they can effect me differently.  My husband recently has a vasectomy since we are doing having children and so I am now off the pill.  This will be my first week not one it (after my inactive pills) and now after finding this information I am very interested to see if my sex drive comes back and if my anxiety and depression lessen.  Thanks to all of you for posting your experiences.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	6/21/2009 1:30:08 PM	so i started taking tri sprintec because my insurance changed, i was originally on otho lo and loved it so i was told this was the closest thing to it... i just finished my second pack and within the second week i had a really bad acne flair up which has never ever happened to me before,my face my chest my shoulders,some very painful cyst like pimples and regular ones, i also got pretty emotional but i had a lot going on that could have effected that... by the end of the third week on this second pack,with taking extra good care of my skin the acne has subsided, and my emotions have come under control. im hoping maybe it was just my body adjusting to the different dose of hormones... i guess we'll see with this third month what happens... i think you need at least 3 months in to really see how your body settles in to it ~ my period has been great with this pill i do the typical start the pack on sunday deal so my last week my period starts on wednesday and is gone by saturday evening, its light to moderate, no real cramps, a little bloating but nothing to complain about.... i have set an alarm on my phone so i take my pill on time everyday and i really think that may have something to do with how it works for me!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/12/2009 2:55:26 PM	I stared taking this about 2 weeks ago and so far I am doing well. I used to take ortho lo and I felt like a mad woman. I am an incredibly easy going person who worries from time to time but ortho lo made me constantly lash out. Tri-sprintec is a bit testy with the occassional headache but mostly I've noticed a swing in anxiety more than anything. I don't necessarily lash out as much as I have major ups and downs when it comes to my worries. Of course this could be helped with excersise and supplements but when it comes to the main reason I'm on it, I can't complain. Also, I am on medication for acne and this seems to help a bit. I haven't noticed wieght gain but I do feel bloated sometimes not related to my period. I would recomend it. It gets the job done and I received a 90 supply for $7 with my insurance.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/9/2009 5:14:24 PM	I've been on Tri-Sprintec and Tri-Nessa for 10 years, and it's been great.  I don't have a problem remembering to take it each day, and over time my periods have been regular, very little cramping, and it's been 10 years with no baby - yea!
Birth Control	Diamond, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	6/8/2009 4:13:09 PM	This pill is not as bad as people make it sound. I am 15 years old and this is my first month and i have been perfectly fine with the results. I got a headache the first few days but my body has warmed up to it so i can deal with it very good. 
Birth Control	dizzy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	6/8/2009 12:07:29 AM	This is the first and only b.c. I've ever used, so my opinion may be a bit swayed. I've been on it for a few months now. I used to get my period every month, but it would sometimes vary from which week it would come, was somewhat inconsistent. This regulated my period wonderfully. I did notice some weight gain with this, but that's the only negative thing I've experienced. I had no nausea, even when I take it on an empty stomach, no extreme mood swings, no pre-mature cramps, no spotting, no pain. Overall satisfied so far.
Birth Control	A_Nicole, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	6/4/2009 12:29:58 PM	I have just switched onto this pill from Seasonique. I wanted to have my periods every month as opposed to have one only 4 times a year. With Seasonique I felt good and my pretty much normal self, but when I switched over to Tri Spritec omg things went down hill. I have break through bleeding bc I guess I am not taking the pill at the time time. Maybe like 15 minutes apart in some nights. Its been this way for almost a month. I have no desire to have sex with my boyfriend, it is just boring to me now for some reason idk. I cannot stand feeling moody all the time, I lash out at my boyfriend for stupid things. I think I am going to my Dr. to see if I can switch over to the brand ortho tri cyclen. I hate taking generic, I took generic for Seasonique and I completely hated it. I couldn't afford the 150 dollar pack every 3 months either. I am going to switch my BC I cant take this no more and my boyfriend cant either.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	5/26/2009 3:25:02 PM	I HAVE BEEN TAKING THIS FOR A MONTH NOW AND IF USED CORRECTLY WHICH IS THE SUNDAY AFTER UR PEROID THERE IS NO SPOTTING OR BREAK THROUGH BLEEDING; FOR ALL OF U WHO ARE SAYIGN THIS IS HORRIBLE YOUR WRONG IT VARIES WITH EACH PERSON!!!!
Birth Control	Evie_07, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	5/17/2009 2:34:30 PM	I switched to this pill from OTC lo because the hormone level was not high enough for me and I would bleed for two weeks at a time.  I've only been on this pill for a month but it already seems that this pill is regulating my period better.  I think that I am no more hormonal than usual.  I was on OTC lo for about 8 months and some months i got depressed over nothing, I had never experienced anything like that before I started the pill.  This month with Tri Sprintic I havent been so hormonal. And I take the pill at night so if i feel nauisous I don't have anything in my stomach to throw up, I only felt nausious 2 or three times taking this pill but it went away after about an hour so it wasn't that bad.
Birth Control	snowpony, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	5/16/2009 3:05:29 AM	I've been on Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo for almost 4 years and was getting them from Planned Parenthood for free. However I now have a well-paying job and no longer qualify to get OTC Lo from PP. I went through my health insurance and found that the pharmacy price was $40/month for the pack. I decided to give Tri-Sprintec a shot since it was only $9. My doctor told me it was almost the same as OTC lo except for the estrogen amounts. I had read mostly bad reviews about Tri-Sprintec but thought I would have a better chance of handling it because of my fitness level (-I am a very active female who goes to the strength trains 4x's a week for 2 hours each, and I play hockey). This week was my first week taking it and I had to stop as of last night (Day 5). The first few days, I was okay and only had slight dizziness at work. On Day 5 and most of today (Day 6) I have experienced rapid heartbeat, extreme migraines, nausea, sharp chest and abdominal pain, extreme moodiness, insomnia, and severe shaking/hunger as if I haven't eaten in days! I called my doctor right away and I'm immediately back on OTC Lo. I was hoping to save money and use Tri-Sprintec, but the $31 I could was not worth what I went through the last couple of days. The weird part was it made me very hungry and shaky and I have never eaten out of control like this. Trying to save $31 by being on Tri-Sprintec, I would've easily spent this savings on food, so it's not really saving! I rarely get sick, and this pill took me down so fast the last 24 hours to the point where I was in bed from being so sick and in pain- I think I'd rather have severe stomach flu! I'm sure this pill works for some people, but it seems based on the reviews it seems the negative outweighs the positive. If cost is a factor, try it and see if it works for you. But if you start experiencing what I experienced- STOP IT right away and call your doctor and get on something else!
Absence of Menstrual Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	5/12/2009 8:40:10 PM	I'm both satisfied and dissatisfied with this pill. I used to get my period three times a month and without any warning. This evened it out beautifully. I get my period once a month and I know exactly what day I'm going to get it. The downside is the side effects. I get hot flashes like crazy and my boyfriend says I've gotten a little moody. I've also started eating more. It's nothing I can't handle though. I am glad that I started taking this pill, I'll take the side effects over the &quot;surprise&quot; periods any day. 
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	Melisin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	5/10/2009 11:05:24 AM	I was taking this birth control because it was the cheapest option available ($9 at WalMart) and was satisfied, until 6 months ago when I developed a mysterious looking stain in the back of my leg. It was a splotchy purple and covered my leg from mid-calf to my upper thigh. I went to several doctors and nobody could give me an answer to what it was, until I had a biopsy done (among other tests) and it turned out to be a hypersensitivity reaction to this birth control! Do NOT take these pills! In the end I paid much more money in medical bills using this cheap alternative than I would have if I had bought a better quality birth control in the first place.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	19-24	5/10/2009 12:03:27 AM	I am really glad I read these reviews because now I know I am not just crazy. Being on this pill has made me extremely moody and lose all sex drive. I am so irritable-it causes so many fights with me and my boyfriend. In the first few months it caused my periods to last for almost two weeks as well. I would not recommend it!
Birth Control	bbbbb, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/4/2009 11:17:58 AM	Before this pill I was on Aviane28. I hated that pill mainly because my libido was gone. With tri-sprintec I have no problems! It is a wonderful pill! 
Birth Control	spitfire16, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	4/1/2009 1:10:54 PM	Until I read the other reviews about this drug, I seriously thought I was going crazy!  I have had terrible mood swings!!!  The slightest thing will set me off.  So bad to the point that I was even seeing a therapist for awhile.  I have no interest in sex anymore and I have terrible hot flashes.  I didnt even think it was my BC until my husband did some research and brought it to my attention.  I have been on BC for years, but not this particular brand until after the birth of our first child.  Which was another reason I didnt think it was my BC...since it was our first child, I thought my problems were from that.  I called my DR and she prescribed me something else.  Lets hope it helps!!  Otherwise, I will just go off the pill all together.  Not worth loosing my husband over it!!!!!!
Birth Control	April86, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	4/23/2009 12:58:41 PM	I have only been taking Tri Spintec for a month, and I can already tell I am going to hate it! I have been angry and Sad and pretty much a crazy person! Which until now I didn't think had anything yo do with the pills.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	4/17/2009 4:24:25 PM	OK, well i just started this pill today, for a condition known as PCOS, and after reading everyone elses reviews, i'm kind of skeptical on taking it anymore after today. and the pamphlet said to not take it if you have elevated cholesteral, which i do, so what should i do? should i stop taking it or try and switch to a different one, when it took the pharmacy a week to get this one because my insurance doesn't cover yaz...which is what i was SUPPOSED to be taking
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Gladitsover, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	4/10/2009 12:58:42 AM	This pill has been a nightmare for me. Aside from the nausea, mood swings, depression, dry skin, my period has lasted with cramping and heavy blood flow for over 30 days! I even fainted in Target. Please review all the reviews and think very seriously before taking this pill. I have been on various birth contral pills on and off since I was 15, I'm 29 now and I have never experienced anything like this. 
Birth Control	sleepy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	4/7/2009 6:56:06 PM	I wanted to get back on OTC, which I loved, but my HMO gave me this instead. The first two months were great, but then the side effects really began. I missed one pill by three hours, and I started spotting several days before my period. I lost my sex drive, I became even moodier than before, and I got huge, painful zits every several weeks. I began experiencing vaginal pain a few months later, and that occurred at the same time on each pack. My blood pressure went way up, even though I'd been on a low sodium diet. I finished the prescription anyway, and just demanded to get onto a new pill. The only good thing about this is that it controlled my period, which was unbearable before. However, I'd almost rather go through a day of horrible PMS and have normal BP than take this pill again.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	3/27/2009 4:34:55 PM	I'm on the third week, about to start the final week of the pack, and I know it's early but I've been incredibly moody. I usually have some mental/emotional issues and depression, but it's gotten worse. Nausea, fatigue, and excessive headaches.  I usually get headaches often, but since I started taking this I've gotten one every day, and they usually turn into migraines. I never had bad acne and all of a sudden I've got pimples everywhere. My breasts are sore and hurt to the touch, and I have absolutely no sex drive(which is a complete reverse). I find myself lashing out at people all the time, and in addition, this week I've been getting warning that my period is starting(bloody discharge) which is normal for me, but ONLY right before it starts, not at random intervals through the day. I'm going to finish this pack, and the next one, and then I'll make my decision. If this doesn't change, I'm going back to Ortho-Tri-Cyclen!
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	3/11/2009 7:41:40 PM	I recently started taking Tri-Sprintec after I stopped breastfeeding my second child.  I was on Ortho-Tricyclen for years before my first pregnancy in 2005.  Because of my insurance, I have to take the generic version.  I have had headaches and nausea since I started taking this two weeks ago.  I wasn't sure if it was my body adjusting to the artificial hormones that was causing this, or because of this formula of the pill.  I am going to give it a try for another month, and also try taking it in the evening instead of in the morning - if I still feel this way, I am going to discontinue using this. 
Birth Control	jfreeze86, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/11/2009 3:47:14 PM	I have only taken this pill for two days but I already seem to be noticing some positive changes. I started on the first day instead of sunday after because I thought it might regulate my periods a little better. I usually have moderately painful cramping during my period and some clotting, but so far I have seen neither.  I have been a little fatigued lately but that can be explained by a very physical job and nicotine withdrawal (quit smoking almost two weeks before starting this pill so I could adopt a healthier lifestyle and not worry as much about developing blood clots.) It seems as though I have been getting more solid sleep and my skin seems to be improving some (only 1-2 blemishes this period compared to about 6-7 blemishes during usual periods). I only have two concerns--my period seems to be slightly heavier than usual so I hope it doesn't last longer or cause breakthrough bleeding or spotting.  The other concern is that it may have caused me to get dizzy and black out a second at work yesterday. But only sleeping 3 hrs the night before may have had something to do with it as well.Anyway, at $5/pack (through my insurance) it's definitely worth a try.
Birth Control	jess, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	3/11/2009 8:46:15 AM	I have been taking it for 4 days and I have had SEVERE VOMITTING. I am not taking it anymore and I am calling my doctor TODAY!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	3/3/2009 11:08:02 PM	this medication gave me hot flashes and major mood swings. I am not an angry person but when I was on this I would get furious over little things. I don't know why my doctor would say this is the exact same as ortho tri-cylen because I never had these issues with the name brand. 
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	3/3/2009 3:55:43 PM	I switched to Tri-Cyclen after being on Ortho TriCyclen Lo for about 3 years because my insurance changed and I could no longer afford Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo. Tri Sprintec is cheap and effective, but it makes me SO emotional and I have terrible PMS symptoms and headaches. I never used to even have to take Advil when I was on Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo because I never even felt differently when on my period, but I have to take loads of Midol or Pamprin now or else I can't function. I do not recommend Tri Sprintec, but it looks like I'm stuck because it is cheap. Does anyone know a cheaper alternative to Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo?
Birth Control		4	4	4			2/21/2009 8:28:58 PM	I just switched to this pill from Apri -- which I was completely unsatisfied with because of my 'crazy' spurts and emotionalness. The first few days on this pill made me a little nauseous and I have noticed a decrease in my sex drive but I think I need to give this a little more trial time -- I'm anxious to notice if it helps my skin.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/18/2009 1:21:28 PM	I have been on Tri-Sprintec for about a year and have had very few problems. I actually feel more chill and less likely to erupt over silly things. I'm a little more likely to cry over sappy chick-flicks, but before I was on this BC crying over a film was extremely unlikely for me. I will occasionally feel nauseated, but it's never severe and never lasts very long. My periods are predictable, short, and light, which makes this BC a godsend as my periods prior were heavy and unbearably painful. I don't have a hard time remembering to take the pill at all; all I did was program an alarm in my phone to go off at the same time every day and since I always have my cell on me (as I'm sure most women do these days) I really don't have an excuse to forget. My acne has always been bad, but with this BC it is much easier to control than it used to be. I haven't gained any weight, at my last check-up my Dr. actually commented on my weight loss since starting the pill. I haven't had any pregnancy scares. My sex-drive is completely satisfactory for me and my boyfriend. And at $9 a month I really can't complain.
Birth Control	NS, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	2/17/2009 3:01:18 PM	This BC works fine for not wanting to get pregnant but I have been very moody during my period. I also have fainted, dizziness, nausea, headaches, and anxiety. My potassium dropped which may or may not be related to this pill. My acne has also gotten a lot worse &amp; I'm almost 30. I am in the process of switching to something that will not make me so emotional and help with the other side effects. 
Birth Control	LH2007, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	25-34	2/11/2009 3:23:26 PM	I too switched to this BC after being on others due to my insurance no longer covering any BC (which is a whole other complaint in itself) I hate this pill, I have been moody, irritable, emotional and everything in between!  I have break threw bleeding every month, I am always bloated it is just horrible!  I am going on Friday to see the Dr. and I will pay for a good pill.  It is not worth the side effects to save some money!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	2/7/2009 12:23:11 PM	I have been on this pill for almost 2 yrs. now. I am generally a very bubbly,happy person but now I am so moody, happy one minute, irate the next. My moodiness has gotten progressively worse and I finally have decided it is these pills, I also have headaches regularly. My skin is better than ever but the depression and moodiness is unbearable. I'm calling my Dr. first thing Monday morning to switch.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	2/4/2009 4:27:02 PM	This is my second day on Tri-Sprintec and I'm experiencing nausea,headaches and dry mouth.  A few months ago, I tried a different pill but I had a period for 3 weeks, so I stopped. Prior to that, from my late teens to early 30s, I never had problems or side effects with any pill.  So, perhaps it is because I'm older and my natural hormones are reacting differently these days to the pill.  I will see how it goes for the next couple months and hopefully the side effects will subside.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	1/28/2009 3:36:32 PM	extreme moodiness after only 8 days on first pack...the first week was ok, but 2nd week, crying, feeling crazy, nausea, dizziness, breast tenderness, reflux, high blood pressure. And I am never really emotional normally. I quit using.

Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	1/26/2009 10:50:30 PM	I don't know what everyone is complaining about.  I have been on this birth control for 6 months now and I don't have a single complaint.  I originally took it to clear my skin and it has done that.  A pimple might pop up during the week of my period but that's it.  I'm not moody and have not gained weight.  My boobs have grown a little, nothing drastic, but I'm not complaining about that.  I don't cramp during my period or PMS.  My periods come on the days they are supposed to and they don't last long.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	1/24/2009 1:32:42 AM	i went off of birth control for four months ( i was using ortho tri cyclan for 5 years, which was working for me fine) and I, like so many others, switched to tri-sprintec because of my insurance.  i have only been on it for a month and a half but i have been feeling a lot moodier, my acne (which was fine when i was taking ortho tri-cyclan but flared up when i went off of it) has gotten a little worse, and i have been having trouble climaxing, where as before i was climaxing almost everytime.  i think it's worth it to spring for the non-generic brand when the side effects suck so much.

More than anything is the mood swings. As I've read through some of the reviews I too can't stand myself at times. Crying for no reason..then getting upset at myself because I don't know why I'm crying. Then angry for crying. Then upset. Then I end up being ok the next day and think what the heck was yesterday??? The littlest things set me off and I feel paranoid over nothing. I want to be normal. I'm done with birth control pills. I cannot handle the horomones. I will find other methods to not get preggers for the next 6 months...then after I have my final baby next year I'm getting fixed =) The next time I will have to think about bcontrol pills is with my 2 daughters..and hopefully that is a lonnnnnggggggggggg time away =)Good luck ladies. Hormones suck.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	19-24	1/13/2009 12:54:36 AM	I just recently started Tri-Sprintec and I am in the middle of my second pack. During the first month I started my period in the 3rd week and it lasted until the end of my pack (2 weeks). My period has never lasted nearly this long. I just started my 3rd week of my second pack and also started my period. I'm afraid its going to last 2 weeks again. Hopefully my cycle will be back on track soon...
Birth Control	oh the things we do!, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	13-18	1/13/2009 12:08:03 AM	This birth control works, but sometimes I forget and when I have to take two it makes me nauseated at it gives me cramps. It makes my cycle regular, which I LOVE. The bad thing is that when I'm on my period when taking this pill I get really emotional, depressed, don't want to do anything and have suicidal thoughts. Maybe its not the pill but when I'm not on this pill I'm not like that! I'm thinking about switching birth control. Just a warning!
Other	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	13-18	1/4/2009 3:59:30 PM	i have been on this pill for 6 months and have had many bad side effects. i have noticed hair loss and dark spots which i did not associate with this pill till reading reviews. i have also had bad acne and cramping. i have felt more moody and depressed then ever before. i am normally a very happy person and lately all i want to do is sleep and eat. i go from being angry to crying to laughing in seconds. im switching to a different birth control asap.
Birth Control	DeannaH, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/2/2009 2:39:36 PM	Love Love Love this birth control.  I have been using it for a year now.  My skin has looked better in the past year than ever before.  My periods are normal, no cramping.  No emotional side effects at all, no unexplainable crying.  My sex drive is up to par. No weight gain at all in a year, I've either lost or stayed the same.  No babies, the birth control does what it is supposed to do and I would reccomend it to anyone!
Acne	tiffyjustis, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	12/31/2008 5:05:19 PM	I originally went on Ortho-Tri Cyclen Lo to control my acne and irregular period, but after just one pack, my insurance refused to pay for the next one.  So the pharmacist gave me the generic version, Tri-Sprintec.  The first month I was on it, I had HORRIBLE side effects.  My acne got SOOO much worse- pimples were all over my face.  Before, I would have generally good skin with several breakouts on my cheeks and chin.  I had spottings a week before I got my period, so I basically had my period for 2 weeks straight.  Then my period got better.  I had less bleeding, no crampings, and it came at the exact time every month, usually lasting about 4 days instead of 5.I've been on Tri-Sprintec for 5 months, and so far, my skin has NOT improved.  Only worsen by 100%.  A new breakout forms each and every day.  I've also become more moody and miserable... I feel slightly depressed, like I've been living in this dark bubble for the 5 months I was on this pill.  I was never like this- I'm normally a bubbly, happy-go-lucky, optimistic girl.  I'm getting off the pill today.  I have about 4 more hormonal pills left, and I'm not taking any of the white sugar pills.  I can't stand to be this way any longer- I want to be my natural self again!However, I'm scared of the side effects so if my acne gets even WORSE, I might have to see my doctor at school (I have no health insurance anymore) to prescribe me a different pill that hopefully will not give me any side effects.  
Birth Control	arodfan25x, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	12/12/2008 7:44:13 PM	I'm 18 and I am on my second pack of Tri-Sprintec (halfway with week 3). I've never had any type of birth control so this is a definite first for me. The first month I had absolutely no problems, but once the second pack came I started to get nausea, and some random cramping in the stomach. Sometimes I would feel sick everytime I would try to eat too. My breasts also became tender and a little swollen.  Once I saw my breasts doing that, I got really scared that I was pregnant, and I still am a little.  My partner and I have had sex with a condom the whole first month, but the second week of the 2nd pack we had sex without a condom twice.  Since that happened around when I started getting the symptoms, I keep switching back and forth if I'm pregnant or not...and It's the holidays and I really don't want to be stressing about this right now. Should I be worried? Or is it just the pill?...I'm pretty sure it's just the pill.  As you can see this pilled has also caused stress. But maybe that's just me because I worry easily. Overall, so far I'm satisfied.
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	12/6/2008 7:07:51 PM	This medication worked great at treating my intolerably painful periods.However, during the first six months I took this medication, it severely altered my mood and personality and I had a major emotional breakdown, I think predominantly as a result of this medication.  Additionally, during the first six months, it made my skin remarkably dry and flaky all over my body, and no amount of moisturizer could keep me from peeling all over.  It was incredibly disgusting.Usually my period ends before I start taking the active pills again, but then I spot brown for two or three days, which is pretty annoying and gross.
Acne	dennysgirl84, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	19-24	12/6/2008 12:07:50 AM	I orginally went on this pill to control cramps during my period. Once that stopped, I went off it. My dermatologist prescribed it for me to control my acne. I really didn't notice it working that much for my acne, but it did somewhat. Once on the pill for about 3 mos, I develpoed ovarian cysts that would flare up horribly bad and disappear when I got my period. This would only happen on my left side. I never noticed this happening when I wasn't on the pill. After taking this pill for 2 years, I went off to try and get pregnant, which never happened. So, I went back on it and once again the cysts came back. I talked to my OB/GYN and he called in a RX of Alesse for me to try. Other than that, I liked this pill: it took away cramps, never noticed my sex drive decrease till now and I have periods lasting about 3 days! Yeah! 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	25-34	12/3/2008 8:42:42 AM	I have been taking this pill for eight months now.  I started the pill initially to control very long periods and I was also single at the time.  The pill has not controlled any bleeding at all for me. Other than that, I've been getting acne, which I've never had problems with in the past and I'm a little moody/sensitive when otherwise I haven't been.  Can't say anything definitively, but I am switching pills.  The other posts are very helpful, I feel like maybe it is the pill. And I'm horrible at remembering every day anyway, so that could be a problem.  At least once a week, I'm doubling up from the day before.  Regardless of, it's not doing what I started it for, except now I need it for the BC part, which if that were the sole reason, it's great.
Birth Control	ohh, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	11/30/2008 7:59:03 PM	Im about 2 days away from finishing my 21 days of active pills of Tri-Sprintec. I have been on birth control before and have never had this experience! I started my period normal, but now that Im in the third week, I still have vaginal bleeding or spotting... what ever you want to call it. I've been having headaches, but thought it was just me getting dehydrated. I am so irritated and I am getting off of this pill.I thought it was just me, but after reading all of these reviews (thanks;so helpful) I am through will this bc...
Birth Control	jsb216, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	11/25/2008 12:36:07 PM	I have been taking this drug for two months now. Beginning the fourth day of the first pack I experienced allover body itching that has lasted until present. I have absolutely no sex drive and now in the last few days have noticed dark patches on my face that were not there before taking this drug. I also have experienced dizziness but it is subsiding. I have been on ortho-lo, ortho tricyclen, and alesse and never had any problems. I definitely do not recommend this birth control pill. I will finish the last four pills of this pack and that's it. I'm waiting on my doctor to give me something else. Good luck to anyone who decides to take this. In 14 years this is the only pill that has ever given me problems of any sort.
Birth Control	 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female		11/25/2008 12:01:28 AM	Everyone needs to chill. Please don't say you don't recommend this pill because every female will react differently to it. Just because you have had a bad experience doesn't mean the rest of the world will, like myself who has never had a problem with this pill.
Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	11/18/2008 8:14:22 PM	I started taking the pill to control my acne, I've had normal periods for about 5 days and now since the pill its 2 days.The acne is somewhat under control but I've noticed dark spots on my face and stomach My hair drops less than before. I plan on stopping it this month.
Painful Periods	chelsftw, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	11/16/2008 11:15:05 PM	I've been on this pill for a while now. My periods are definitely lighter than they were before, my acne (I had mild acne) is now gone, except for the occasional pimple before my period, and it has also worked at preventing pregnancy for me. The only thing I've noticed is that recently, I've been pretty moody. I'll be content one minute, crying the next. I don't know if this is associated with the pill because I've been on it long enough for all side effects to have shown by now, I'd think. I'd recommend this to a friend.

I was recently hospitalized because I developed blood clots in both lungs as a result of this medication. Serious side effects can occur as a result of this medication. Needless to say, I will not be taking this any longer!

I have experienced MAJOR HAIR LOSS and blamed my hairdresser after I thought it was from a bad highlight but then he said it's falling out from the root which means it's hormonal; also have white patches all over my stomach.  I have seen these symptoms on other reviews and now know it's from this awful pill.

This is only the 100th pill I have been on it seems like. I feel nauseous and have actually vomited a few times but only in the morning, could it be because I take my pill before bed? I also have dry mouth, so you are not alone!! Hopefully it gets better because I do not want to switch pills again.

My cycle was very predictable, light flow, and lasted only a few days.  I recently switched to Walgreen's version, Tri-Nessa, and began to have blood pressure and health issues, that I assusme are related.  However, the few pimples that I would get around my cycle no longer appear.  I plan to switch back to Tri-Sprintec at CVS very soon!

I never had cramping or moodiness, even before I started BC. Now, im crying one second, angry the next, and laughing after that! I never knew it was the medicine til i saw the reviews. This medicine has done far more harm than good.
Birth Control	kelso26, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	4	3	Female	25-34	10/14/2008 4:16:40 PM	I have been taking this pill for 3 months now. I was put on Tri-sprintec because I was having horrible side effects from my previous pill Camila. Before I started Tri-sprintec I read all of the reviews and was really scared and didn't want to try it. But I decided to give it a try anyway. Since I started my face is clear, my periods are predictable and a lot shorter, hardly any cramping, pretty much the total opposite of the other pill I was on.  I recomended Tri-sprintec to a friend whos insurance didn't cover the pill she was taking, she's been on it a little over a month and has had no problems.    
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	10/9/2008 12:40:59 PM	I switched from Ortho Lo to Tri-Sprintec due to the cost difference, but wish now i hadn't.  I have read every review and only 1 person has stated they have had hair loss.  My hair has been coming out in handfuls since i started taking this pill.  I have been taking it for 5 months and only recently made the connection between the pill and hair loss.  I have also gained 8 pounds that I am unable to lose, and have been more tired then I ever have been before.  I have stopped taking the Tri-Sprintec and will be starting back on Ortho Lo as soon as possible.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	9/30/2008 11:27:06 PM	I recently decided to give the pill a chance after being on Ortho Evra (patch) and NuvaRing.  I was first prescribed Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo which was great, but very expensive.  My presciption was changed to Orhto Tri-Cyclen and as a result I was given the generic, Tri-Sprintec.  Aside from getting used to the daily pill regime, the side effect of acne was indeed the worst.  I have had clear skin throughout my years on other BC, but Tri-Sprintec made my acne flare up.  Immediately upon starting it, I was getting small whiteheads along my chin and around my mouth.  It quickly spread throughout my face and neck.  Horrible!  I'm switching back to NuvaRing for its ease and few side effects.

The side effects are terrible...I've experienced severe mood swings, depression, anxiety, and paranoia. I've also had bad cramping and body aches. I haven't gained weight yet, but it makes my appetite unbearable, I'm either starving or have NO appetite at all. The only positive result is that my skin has cleared significantly.

Before my child I used the nuva ring but had to switch due to my lack of insurance.  So far I am experiencing extreme nausea, weird belly feelings, and my mouth is constantly DRY!  I have read many reviews but havent read anything about dry mouth...........am I alone on this one or is someone out there having this problem too?  I drink and drink water but it doesn't help me.

Birth Control	datlilg21, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	9/4/2008 7:24:39 PM	the first thing i noticed after about a month of taking Tri-Sprintec was that my breasts were unbearable... i thought i was pregnant but ended up its just the birth control. its almost worse than being pregnant.  I have had NO sex drive whatsoever and have been thinking i was suffering from depression until reading these bad reviews and remembering that i didnt feel this way before i started tri sprintec. i am going to quit taking it right away and it should be banned.
Birth Control	admakoehn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	9/4/2008 3:36:20 AM	I am getting ready to start my fourth month on Tri-Sprintec and don't really have any complaints.  I switched from the Nuva Ring because I wanted a lower cost birth control and something to help with hormonal acne.  My co-payment went from $50 to $10 so I am pleased with that, but I desperately miss the convenience of the Nuva Ring!  This is the first &quot;pill&quot; form of birth control I have taken and the only thing I dislike about it is the act of having to take a pill every day!  (I was on the patch for a couple of years before switching to the Nuva Ring and I was on the Nuva Ring for about three years.)  I have not noticed any differences other than my period is a little heavier on Tri-Sprintec than the Nuva Ring and I now have fewer pimples the week before my period.  It has not yet cleared my acne completely - but I remain hopeful that it might within the next few months.

Birth Control	zabine, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/21/2008 9:11:15 PM	This is the first birth control I have ever been on so I'm not really sure what to compare it to. I noticed a bit of nausea which then sometimes curbs my appetite. Also about a week into it I came down with a yeast infection. Now today I noticed I'm spotting and getting cramps and I will be taking the white pills in 2 days to get my period, which I hope will be light and less then the 5 days I usually have it! I hope the side effects I'm experiencing clear up!
Birth Control	Little Miss, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	8/19/2008 3:33:49 PM	I have only been on this for one day. But it doesn't seem hard to remember to take it. My dr said it didn't matter if I took it give or take 30 minutes each night of the original time I took it. Most of the side-effects seem okay compared to what my period normally is. 3 weeks long, 1 week of bleeding in the middle - the other two weeks are heavy cramping, mood swings, bloating, headaches, etc. 
Birth Control	Cindy S, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	8/14/2008 3:47:11 PM	I was put on tri-sprintec a few months ago after my regular pill was discontinued..Ive had lots of stomach issues since the-cramps,bloating,naseau, not to mention vag discharge and itching resembling a yeast infection. I thought I was crazy thinking these symptoms were because of this pill, but I am reading lots of the same issues I have.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	8/5/2008 2:14:45 PM	While this medication was effecitve as I am not pregnant, and I don't find taking a pill a day to be difficult, I do feel that it has altered my moods.  I am more sensitive, become easily stressed, increased anxiety, decreased sex drive.  I enjoyed clear skin and less PMS but I am reasearching a new pill to try.  For me,t he side effects are not worth it where there are so many other options. 
Birth Control	momo2angels, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	35-44	7/31/2008 10:32:33 PM	I am so glad to read these posts - I thought I was crazy.  I was put on tri-sprintec due to low cost (insurance) and noticed almost immediately a change in libido.  Just not interested in anything more than cuddling - not me.  I have been taking it for 4 months.  I have not gotten pregnant so it does work for birth control, however with no libido you don't have much sex.  My periods have been lighter.  BUT my cramps have been worse leading up to the period and I have had problems with large clots which I never had before and have had 2 babies vaginally.  The worse part is weight gain.  I have gained 15 pounds in the time I have been on the pill and have not changed my diet for the worse.  I told my dr. I was concerned about this and he said just try weight watchers.  I am hungry all the time which I never experienced before.  I am also more nervous and anxious about things and that is not me either.  I do not like this pill and if I could stop taking it today, I would.  But it will screw up my period even more.  But I am calling my dr. tomorrow and telling him all the problems others report - same as mine - and I want a different pill or I'll get off birth control all together and take my chances.  Its better than going through the side effects of this pill.  I guess you get what you pay for so make sure you watch your symptoms if you go on this pill.  Thanks.
Birth Control		3	5	3			7/30/2008 1:53:39 AM	Shortly after I started taking this pill I noticed clusters of small, white patches of skin on my stomach that almost looked like they had lost their pigmentation. It only gets worse in the sun. So weird. Anyone else experience anything like this? 
Acne	Smltwngrl, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	7/26/2008 11:07:36 PM	I was prescribed tri-sprintec a few years ago to clear up my acne and to regulate my cycle. I loved it because it finally cleared up my skin and I always knew exactly when my periods were going to start. I did gain weight, and up until now I never thought it was because of the pill. I only have one more month until my prescription runs out and I think I am going to get off of it for a while, to see what happens. If my face breaks out and I start having irregular periods after several months, I will most likely get back on it. It was nice though to read how it effected other people. I haven't had any problems with it and have been on it for maybe two years. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	7/24/2008 1:19:20 PM	I was on ortho-tri-cyclen lo for over a year and thought it was great. I switched to Tri-sprintec after I found out it was cheaper.  Although my doc did advise to &quot;stick to what you know works.&quot;  I should have listened, but I had been on tri-sprintec as a teenager and couldn't recall a problem.  At first, I didn't notice much difference, but my husband claimed I seemed depressed and over-reacted to silly things.  I just thought I was stressed, but was still unusal since I'm pretty easy going.  As weeks went by, I'd feel sad for no reason when I woke up.  Finally last week, I had a complete meltdown. Constant tears, anger, anxiety...I thought was crazy. The same week I heard of someone I knew that had thought she was suffering from depression, but it was her birth control.  Then it dawned on me.  I've been off tri-sprintec for a few days now and feel amazingly better...not quite back to my old self, but I am definitely on my way.

I have gained a few extra lbs only b/c I have been slackin off on my diet lol so I will not blame this medication for that at all. Was a little worried to take this b/c of some negative reviews I have read about it. Every women is different. I have always had regular cycles. Works for me, no side effect, A+ (ONLY COST ME 9 BUCKS EVERY MONTH) =)(27 yrs old mother of 2 kids)Tupelo, Mississippi
Other	WorcGirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	7/8/2008 7:41:43 PM	I was on the BC pill Trivora for 5 years with no problem. But I heard about cheaper $9 Sprintec and decided to try it out. It's beeen 6 weeks since I switched and I can't wait to switch back. I've been very moody, plus I've had discharge, swelling, and itchiness for over a week now, and I never had that before. I wish I had done the research and read the review BEFORE I took the pill, and not after. Oh well, hopefully others will take a hint when reading these reviews as 80% of them are not good!

Summers, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	7/5/2008 3:46:41 PM	This is the only birth control I haver ever taken, so I thought this was just what it was like to be on birth control...nasauseous, cramps, itching, and weight gain.  I'd gone off tri-sprintec for 3 months and was suddenly active, lost 10 lbs, gained my equilibrium and love of life again, and the went back on tri-sprintec.  I've been on it for a week and I am sersiously moody, and not just depressed, but anxious and stressed, I'm going to to have to go see a gyn. because my discharge is all messed up, I'm spotting, alot of times on this med I ended up with two periods per/28 days.  I've been lethargic, I sit in bed all day sometimes.  I cry over nothing.  I'm not hungry but I eat all the time.  This drug sucks, but at least now I know it's not ALL in my head.  It's cheap and worth a try, but I wish doctors would let their patients know that it's problematic for some women.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/30/2008 9:46:33 PM	I know everyone is different, but I haven't had a single problem with this birth control pill. It is my first, and probably only birth control pill I will take. No side effects at all. I was nervous at first reading all the bad reviews, but it is cheap, and it works. Don't be discouraged from trying this just because a few people had a bad experience. See for yourself, and if you don't like it, switch it. Easy enough. I'm a 19 year old college student who can't afford the brand name, so I'm glad there is something out there for me.

Switched to Tri Sprintec and love it. Much cheaper and works far better than Ortho. Had a few cramps but nothing serious. It improved my mood and made me less depressed. I love Tri Sprintec.
Birth Control	Anonymous, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	6/4/2008 10:59:46 AM	I am so glad I decided to look up this pill. All of the user reviews have been so helpful. My pharmacist switched me to this pill because it's only $9, compared to $25 I was paying before, and I've had nothing but problems since I've been on it. My boyfriend actually asked me the other night, &quot;Do you not want me anymore?&quot; and the answer is yes, but my body doesn't reflect that. I've been very depressed, I cry easily over petty arguments, the cramps are horrible, and I have frequent horrible headaches. I have my yearly checkup within the next month, and I will be asking for a new prescription, and  will be asking my pharmacist for the more expensive version for my last refill until my checkup. I do not recommend this pill to anyone. If I hadn't found this page, I fear my relationship would be on the track to coming to an end.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	19-24	6/2/2008 4:45:03 PM	I've been on this medication for a year, and I am thrilled that I'll be starting a new form of birth control in a few days.  My period lasted for the entirety of my first pack, and then spotted for the entire second month.  I attributed my mood swings and depression to my stress load of being a full time student, working two jobs and volunteering to direct a musical.  I probably should have considered the pill as the source of the problem when I spent 20 minutes bawling because my boyfriend wanted dirty rice for dinner and i wanted chicken rice.When I reduced my class load and other stress factors, but the symptoms persisted, I finally figured out that the tri-spintec was causing my depression and the almost scheduled days of crying (the first day of each new row).I never had cramps before this medication, even on other forms of BC and I get frequent headaches.  But worst of all, I started this pill after loosing 30 lbs, and then gained 12 back without lifestyle change.  I've always been a people person, and work in patrons services, but in the past few months I've had little to no patience for my job that I used to love.I absolutely hate this pill and am highly annoyed that it took nine months to connect the symptoms to the pill.  Don't use it, it sucks.
Birth Control	Molli, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	6/2/2008 2:29:55 PM	I haven't been taking the medicine for long, and yet it has caused me to hate my stomach.  I've been nautious lately and been slightly dizzy.  Cramping seems to be the worse side-effect that I've had so far, with all of a sudden it'll feel worse then the cramps I had during my period.  I started the pill to prevent pregnancy and help with some of my period side-effects.  Although, since I have to go back to the doctor soon, I'll probably be asking for a switch in prescription... Seems also to cause hotsweats.
Birth Control	jami, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/22/2008 4:55:18 PM	I have been on this pill for 4 years.  NO sideaffects. Skin is clearer than ever!  When I was in high school I had horrible periods. With this pill, cramps are better, less bleeding!  
Birth Control	SSStarry, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	5/21/2008 12:20:58 AM	I would NOT recommend this product. I have been on other birth contol pills with no side effects. I decided to try this one because of very mild acne and it is suppose to help. On the first day of taking this I had severve vomitting and diareah until the fourth day when I stopped taking this medicine altogether. I couldn't get out of bed I was so sick, I had to miss work and school. I lost 7 lbs of water weight and was only drinking pedialyte which came back up right away. Also my heart was racing so fast I thought I was going to have a heart attack. I started getting headaches. I took it for 4 days because they say symptoms are suppose to clear with treatment but mine got worse. If I stayed on it I know I would end up in the hospital with extreme dehydration. Do not torture yourself with the medicine; It doesn't seem safe to me. I would compare it to drug off the street in a underdeveloped country. Also I can't really rate the effectiveness since I probably wasn't having sex.
Birth Control	rose41, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	5/20/2008 1:19:31 PM	I hate this pill! It made me NUTS! Anxiety, extreme headaches, sick, screwed with my period, I stopped taking it after 3 months because I couldn't stand myself and my poor boyfriend had to deal with me too. I urge all women not to take this pill. 
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/18/2008 2:51:26 PM	This is a HORRIBLE birth control pill. I am so relieved to see that others have had the same issues I have. My body aches, my acne got 100 times worse, I had abnormal discharge, and my moods have been very erratic. I would NOT recommend this to anyone for any reason!!
Birth Control	J. White, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	5/16/2008 7:50:30 PM	I have been on Birth Control pills for 20+ yrs. now.  Over the years I have taken Ortho TriCylen and Tri Cylen.  Six months ago my pharmacist sold me Tri-Sprintec.  The side effects have been 1.) Not much sex drive 2.) Very, Very, Moody, I can't even stand myself.  3.) My periods are more of blood clotting.  4.)  Severe cramping.  5.)  Headaches.  So, next month is my yearly exam and I will be receiving an Rx for one of the other B.C. pills.  I do not recommend these pills to anyone.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/27/2008 10:28:44 PM	I used to be on Lo Ovral but that made my heart race constantly.  And it caused quite a bit of acne.  So I asked to be switched to something else which ended up being Ortho Cyclen, genericly, Tri Sprintec.  I've been on Tri Sprintec for one month now...and have had no problems what so ever.  My heart doesn't race like it did on Lo Ovral, and I can see a drastic decline in my acne now that I'm on Sprintec.  I would highly recomend this pill.  It works greatly!!  I love Sprintec!! Not to mention it is very cheap in the pharmacy!  
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	4/10/2008 4:01:53 PM	I just began taking Tri-Sprintec 4 days ago.  I was taking FemCon Fe previously, which I loved but the cost is $50 a month if uninsured.  Tri-Sprintec is only $9 a month.  I decided to give it a try.  So far, I've it feels like I have an increased blood pressure, although I haven't checked it.  I also have bouts of dizziness.  I'll give this pill a fair chance and try it for 3 months.  If things don't get better, I'll go back to FemCon FE.
Acne	Miriam, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	4/9/2008 4:39:20 PM	Hi,I was on Ortho TRicyclin for 5 years and i was happier than ever. It not only helped me not get pregnant but it kept my skin wonderfully clear. I would get compliments all the time for my skin. I stopped taking it because i wanted to get pregnant. When i stopped taking it, i noticed my face broke out like crazy which was major depressing. i saw the doctor to get back on it because my acne was not going away completely with regular acne meds. My doctor gave me Tri Sprintec and i am have been on it for a week and a half. My symptoms have been, cramping, mood swings according to my husband, no sexual appetite and nausea if i dont take my pill with food. Also, spotting when i take the pill at the wrong time. I cant forget to mention that when i saw the doctor 2 weeks ago i weighed 117 and now i weigh 121.I feel like i have not changed my way of eating and yet, i weigh significantly more in just 2 weeks.  i feel like this is only the beginning and it is scaring the hell out of me especially after reading the reviews others have written. I am going back to the DR before it is too late. YOu should do the same!
Acne	debtsxtopay, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	4/6/2008 12:14:08 AM	I've been on Tri-Sprintec for four months now, starting the fifth pack tomorrow. I'm on it for acne control and regulating my periods. They always come on my inactive week by the third pill and stop after my first active pill, so my periods are now regular. My skin stays pretty clear unless I eat a lot of break-out inducing foods, like chocolate. My only complaint is I've gained around 10 pounds due to my appetite increasing. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	4/1/2008 10:21:07 PM	Wow! Thank you guys for opening up and posting your symptoms.  I'm so glad that I have decided to some research on this drug.  I can't believe that so many people are have the same problems as I am.  I didn't realize that so many problems could be connected to my birth control.  I began taking Tri-Sprintec-28 about 5 months ago.  I have been having such severe mood swings, lack of ability to climax during sex (that sucks royally), painful cramps during my period.  That is just the tip of the iceburg.  The worst is severe anxiety, dizziness (to the point of nearly falling), mood swings (anger towards everything like I have never felt before).  I have been to doctors, and had many tests done, and always -- no diagnosis.  I truly have been considering that I might be crazy or need need some mental help.  I am 31 years old, and I have been taking birth control pills for 16 years.  I was put on these due to unexplainable breast pain.  I think I can live with a painful boob, instead of this hell.  I will not take another pill, I will try to get back on Ortho Tri-Cyclen.  
Birth Control	Brunette247, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	19-24	4/1/2008 7:36:17 PM	I had been switched from one pill to this pill and I hate it. The first two months were okay but now I feel sick all the time.  I get headaches all the time and my body aches constantly.  I gained weight from this pill when I actually lost weight from the first pill I had been on.  I am getting off of this pill this week and I would not recommend this pill to anyone.
Birth Control	Cora, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	3/31/2008 3:23:36 PM	I just had my second child and went on this pill due to insurance reasons.  I started with nausea (never had this problem before with the pill) for a week, cramping that would take my breath away, of the 5 months on Tri-Sprintec I had light periods that lasted the whole month (once after having sex and the other because I missed 1 day and was tring to catch up), severe mood swings, contact problems (which I've worn for years and had a recent exam fr new ones), and dizziness.  I do not recommend this one cheap or not. I'm switching back to Tri-Nessa (I was on this one before I had my second child and had no problems with it).
Birth Control	13-18 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	13-18	3/26/2008 10:21:01 PM	Overall I'm pleased with this birth control.  I was on Ortho Tri cyclen lo but decided to make a switch to this.  For me its only 5 dollars a month so how can I complain?  I've been on this medication for quite a few months now and I haven't noticed any horrible side effects like many other women on here are talking about.  I may get a little more emotional than usual sometimes but it seems pretty normal to me.  As far as my acne goes, I'm not really sure if this pill is doing its job.  And as far as skipping periods and break through bleeding goes, this pill fails.  If you mess up ever so slightly you will have break through bleeding for a full month until your next period.  But I do feel very protected on this pill.  And now that I've changed my starting day I don't mind my periods as much.  I guess I can't expect magical things to come out of this pill.  It's prevented pregnancy effectively and I'm happy enough with that.  I may change my pill the next time I go to the gyno but its definitely going to take a lot of thought.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	3/22/2008 4:12:38 PM	I've been taking this medication for 4 months now (starting 5th month tomorrow).  The first 2 weeks I had nauseous feelings and mood swings but it could also be because I was stressing over finals in school.  After the first month things were okay, I did spot light when I was late on a pill (about an hour) but that went away quickly.  My &quot;period&quot; or withdrawal bleeding started on the exact same day every month (4th day of placebo pills) so that was helpful cus I knew when it would come.  Periods are almost painless now as compared to before taking the pill.  It's great for the price! =) I think we all can experience these side effects on ANY BCP's, brand or generic, we just like to blame the generics more.  Why pay more for the same thing? I work in a pharmacy and I see people switching to Tri-Sprintec from Ortho Tri-Cyclen frequently.  It's actually one of the most dispensed medications I've seen.Try it for at least 3 months and if symptoms still occur, then you'll have a reason to switch. A few days or 1-2 months is not enough to hate it. =) Good Luck to all.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	25-34	3/20/2008 7:26:20 PM	After taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen for about 5 yrs I had to switch to Tri-Sprintec b/c of health insurance coverage. I have now been on Tri-Sprintec for about 1 year, I do not like it. It is causing major mood swings and most days I feel like my world is just crashing down even though nothing is wrong! I also feel like my sex drive has gone way down which sucks!  
Birth Control	rabbit, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	13-18	3/17/2008 11:53:45 PM	I've been on it for 9 days now, and it seems like everyday I'll get these minor little cramps. It's really irritating. My libido has already drastically changed. Sex just doesn't feel good anymore.
Birth Control	nik83088, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	3/9/2008 3:42:28 PM	i just finished my first month of tri-sprintec. i seemed to have experienced every side effect possible. my skin broke out really bad when i first started. my mood swings are insane. ive never really been an emotional person, and now i cry over the smallest things. i get feelings of depression. ive worn contacts for 5 years, and now its becoming almost impossible for me to keep them in. i had alot of spotted bleeding, and got my period a week early, which last much longer than usual. im having serious pain during intercourse. im also suffering from vaginal dryness, and vaginal tightness. this has seriously been the worst month ever. i got my doctor to switch me to a new birth control, but im thinking about just quitting the pill all together.

Other	nancitagraciela, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/4/2008 3:57:46 PM	I just switched from taking ortho-tricyclene-lo for 7 years! I have been on tri-sprintec for a month now and see no difference from when I was taking ortho tri-cyclene! It is great and at only $ 9.95 it is much more economical than my $50 ortho tri-cyclene-lo! :-)
Birth Control	kayela, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	3/3/2008 5:21:40 PM	The pill help by me not getting pregnant, but I deal with the side effects nausea, depression,severly tired, lack of sex appetite,headaches,weight gain, and different eating habits.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	4	5	1	Female	25-34	3/3/2008 9:06:46 AM	I had horrible reactions to this pill.  I was taking it for a year and a half and had reactions like nauseation and abdominal pain and I didn't know that it was the pill but after a year I started having unexplainable intense pains all over, mainly muscular(a cat scan showed that nothing was out of order with regard to my organs) and my nauseation and dizziness became more intense.  I got to the point where I began to have medical issues that happened only during certain times in my packet and after I was done with that week of pills I was fine.  Don't take this pill.  It has created more discomfort and agitation than it was worth.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	1	1	Female	25-34	2/22/2008 3:44:40 PM	I never stopped bleeding with this pill, and have been nauseous every single day I've been on it....I have even vomitted from being so nauseous. My breasts were also very tender, almost painful. I've finished the first month, but called my doctor and made them call in a different pill.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	2/20/2008 3:31:02 PM	PLEASE read all the side effect of this pill before you take it. HELL that is what I feel like, this medicine is easy to take but holy cow the way it makes you feel is awful. I have taken it for 10 days and have had a headache everyday and it gets worse everytime I take a pill, I feel sick all day and have awful mood swings, my face has broken out so bad that my daughter wants to know what is wrong with my face, now that is bad. I have talked with my DR. and am getting a new med so please use caution this pill is awful.
Birth Control	hadit, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	13-18	2/19/2008 7:52:15 PM	I have been taking this medication for 2 weeks to help clear up my acne. My acne is worse, I have nausea, I can't eat, I'm spotting, and I have terrible mood swings. I'm calling my doctor to switch immediately. My boyfriend can't even stand me any more and I cry all the time. Do NOT take this medication. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	2/12/2008 3:14:22 PM	I've just started my 2nd pack and after reading all of these (and many other) comments i've realized it must be Tri-Sprintec that is responsible for my horrendous mood swings, strange cravings, and horrible skin.  I've never had a problem with skin until starting this stuff, now i have pimples that just will not go away! I have daily headaches and constant nausea that doesn't stop until evening.  The only food i seem to be hungry for is sugar and carbs!  Last but not least, my mood swings are crazy!  The slightest things upset me to the point of tears/rage!  My poor BF has been the brunt of much of it, and like some other ladies have commented, it has almost caused us to break up.  When i started my placebo-pills this previous week i noticed my mood going back to normal!  Only now (after one full month) have my pimples started to diminish.  My skin seems to be better, but still worse than when i started.  On the bright side, I've not had any problems with heavy bleeding/spotting/cramping/yeast infections.  I'm willing to give it the full 3 months before i ask my Dr. to switch.  So far...NOT so good!!
Birth Control	chelleb, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	2/9/2008 10:42:05 AM	I was on Ortho TriCyclen for about 5 years prior to having my second son.  After his birth, my insurance made me get the generic, Tri Sprintec. What a HORRIBLE experience! I've been on it for over a year now and my dr still doesn't think it's the pill.  STRESS can cause ALL the symptoms I have.  Well, I know my body and know that this is not normal.  I have spotting several times between my periods if I miss my pill by as little as an hour off schedule.  Two months ago I had break through bleeding that lasted the entire month!! From one period until the next.  DR told me to continue to take as directed. My lack of sex drive is putting a terrible strain on my relationship.  And now to top it all off, my period is six days late.  I've taken my pill at the same time every day this past month... so HOPEFULLY it's just the wrong pill for me.  Needless to say, I'll be contacting a new doctor this week.   This is the worst generic medication I have ever taken.
Birth Control	Dhygirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	2/8/2008 3:26:32 PM	Irregular bleeding in the second month that has last two weeks during active pills
Birth Control	droman, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	2/4/2008 2:17:17 PM	Tried it for one month and was treated for shortness of breath. I was nauseated and vomiting for a week and calf pain.I don't use glasses or never needed glasses and vision problems occured blurred vision. I am 25 yrs old and never had any of these problems before. Very difficult to take this pill.
Birth Control	immeandthatsallicanbe, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	1/30/2008 10:26:59 PM	I have overall been very happy with this medication...I had never been on any other Birth Controls before though but I like it. I've been on it over a year now and my acne has significantly gotten better (I was once a taker of accutane and had WAY WORSE side effects than this Birth Control so far). I don't know for sure how well it actually works for birth control because i've only had sex once and the guy wore a condom and so idk...but overall I haven't experienced anything bad and my GYNO told me to just keep taking it. I did have some weight gain but I was also a freshman in college at the time and I was eating pizza and pokey sticks at least 3 nights a week and my residence was within walking distance of Zaxby's which I would eat many time a day! Overall good experience though! I'll update it I experience any great changes though :)
Birth Control	Vonnie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	1/12/2008 11:29:34 PM	It is effective as birth control if used correctly.  However, I experienced weight gain (10 pounds to be exact) which is a real change since I am a naturally small girl.  It took me forever to realize that I'd gained weight for that reason and not from food or lifestyle changes.I also experience mood swings occasionally. I used to be on ortho tri cyclen lo and am planning to switch back to that pill.  This one was pushed by my doctor even though I suggested ortho.  She said the choice was mine but she recommended the higher hormone pill.Again, the savings in money are not worth the side effects.
Absence of Menstrual Periods		3	5	3			1/10/2008 1:45:16 PM	I have been on tri-sprintec for about 3 months. I am on it to regulate my period because I would go months without getting one and from being backed up I would have spotting. My doctor decided to put me on this medication. I have never taken birth control, so I dont know what the others are like. I have experience a few of the side effects. My breast are really tender. If i lift my arms they sore. I also cramp the week before I start my period. Its very uncomfortable and i noticed that if i eat, the cramping almost goes away (go figure). I havent gained any weight or experienced the severe mood swings. The worst side effects for me is the dryness/itchiness in skin (which doesnt help because i have eczema) and the severe yeast infection I had last month. I never had a yeast infection before so that nearly scared me to death. So now i make sure i eat yogurt at least 2-3x per week.I see my doctor in a few weeks and i am going to request trying something else. 
Birth Control		2	2	1			1/6/2008 1:56:23 AM	I switched from ortho-cyclen to sprintec and I cant wait to start my regualr ortho cyclen again, the generic brand is not worth the savings in money. I have experienced horrible mood swings, cramping, and lots of discharge. The only good thing about this is that it has cleared up my acne.

Acne	xipromise, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	13-18	12/20/2007 5:40:35 PM	I'm taking this pill for acne control and regulating my periods. So far, I've taken 4 pills. I'll review again after a couple months. The first day, I completely passed out in the bathroom the morning after taking it. I came to maybe a minute later. It hasn't affected me emotionally at all. My acne has stopped popping up, I just have some pimples that were there before starting the pill. My skin's a bit dry, but that could have nothing to do with the pill. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it so far. Hope it continues to be like this.
Endometriosis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	12/19/2007 10:31:10 PM	Made me very depressed and emotional, can't stop taking it because it is required for my health.  I have had no other side effects from this though

Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	13-18	12/8/2007 2:30:41 PM	While on this drug I have experienced a significant clearing of almost all my acne. It is very effective for treating this condition. BUT. I have experienced terrible mood problems. Usually, I'm generally happy and easy-going, but on Tri-Sprintec, I find myself crying about the most insignificant issues. Also, I have expericenced a severe loss of appetite and light nausea. I plan to cease taking this drug.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	12/6/2007 11:17:20 PM	I have been on this pill for over three years.  I have never had any problems with it.  I began taking it when I was 19 so I am not sure if my acne cleared up because I grew up or if the pill helped to clear it up.  All in all, I have been pleases with the results.  
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	Aviana, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	12/3/2007 6:06:21 PM	I was given this to stop abnormal spotting that had lasted 9 days (after already having a period that month). The NEXT DAY after my first pill I was bleeding ten times worse, cramping to where i can't get outta bed, and today i was so weak I fainted at home alone and hit my head. I unerstand it takes a while for these kinds of medication to work... but are u telling me I have to go through this for 1-3 MONTHS before I'll even know IF it works. BULL! I was better off spotting, at least then i wasn't throwing up, bleeding worse and passing out.
Birth Control	JessicaMayBe, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	12/2/2007 2:29:15 PM	While I had no problems using Tri-Sprintec (missed it once in 7 months, set a timer every day so I took it between 9:20pm-9:30 every night), I began to experience side effects afters my 5th month using it.  Hair loss, high blood pressure, hot flashes, mood swings, lots of crying.  I was put on blood pressure meds by my doctor after having an anxiety attack one night.  During the anxiety attack I experienced over an hour of uncontrollable shaking (whole body), racing heart, trouble sleeping, needing to go to the bathroom every 20 minutes and general &quot;freaking out.&quot;We thought the blood pressure meds were helping, but after being on them for two weeks I experienced another anxiety attack, and this one was worse: all the aforementioned symptoms, in addition to 5 HOURS of shaking, insomnia, tightness of the chest, and feeling like I couldn't get enough oxygen (even w/breathing exercises).  I went online (thinking I was dying) and realized that this was actually an anxiety attack, and could possibly be brought on by the pill.  Since both attacks happened 1-2 hours after taking the pill... yeah.  My doctor took me off Tri-Sprintec the next day, and I've been feeling SO much better, and it's been less than a week.  Just goes to show that symptoms may not present themselves for months.  If you feel like you're going crazy, it COULD be your pill!  I've experienced a lot of stress in the past 6 months as well, which may have led to increases attacks (although I've never had anything like this before the pill).  I'm still trying to figure out what to do now, however, as my husband and I won't be ready to start a family for a few years.  I guess we'll figure it out as we go, and I will be talking to my doctor throughout the process.
Birth Control		5	5	5			11/30/2007 12:21:06 AM	Though I'm sure it varies depending on your personal chemistry (as evidenced by other reviewers) I have not had any ill effects with this drug. It has been highly effective. I do take it regularly and have never missed a dose. I am very satisfied with it. I have been on this drug for nearly a year now and have no complaints.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	11/29/2007 11:41:23 AM	I have been on this generic brand pill for 10 days and have SEVERE lower back pain already and abdomnial cramping.  I have dry mouth and dizziness and fatigue.  I got a RED BUMPY RASH on my inner arms and behind my legs and after taking bendryl it's not as itchy now - but not going away.  I also have some gross secretions and dark urine.  I haven't noticed any mood swings yet.  I am also experiencing some diarreah.   I consider myself a very healthy active person, and these are all new symptoms that I have never experienced before. This pill has now raised some big red flags for me and I plan to stop taking them as soon as I finish this pack.  Hope this helps you make a decision about whether or not to take it.   If your insurance will allow, maybe you should try the BRAND NAME ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN, I hear it's much better with low to no side effects.  Good luck.
