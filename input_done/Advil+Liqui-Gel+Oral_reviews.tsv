I find that that liquid-gel absorbs faster and quick when there is present pain in the joints etc. I tell people follow the instructions in its use. And you will get the desired results.

I felt dizzy, light headed, had broken veins in my legs, and arms. Headaches frequently also.Is this common when taking Advil 200mg(2 every 4-6 hours)?
