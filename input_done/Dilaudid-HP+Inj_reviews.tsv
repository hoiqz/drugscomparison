Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	mizzocajon, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/2/2012 2:23:00 AM	I have RA in my spine and MS. I take Oxycontin and Oxycodone on a daily basis, but when I overdo some days I have to have extra help in managing the pain. I have to go to the ER and get a shot Dilaudid. It helps me very much so that I am able to come home and get some rest. It does keep me awake for a while though. Some people go to sleep on Narcotic, they keep my awake so I dont take them to close to bedtime, but on the nights that I need a shot I usually stay up until about 2a.m. or so. That is the only problem I have with this drug. It is one of the best pain releivers I have found though that allow me to relax and not have the horrid pain that I sometime have.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	8/6/2010 11:13:43 AM	I was in ER for shortness of breath, chest knotting pain and could not lay flat without chest knotting up. I was injected with this medication TWICE along with anti-nausea drug within 15 span to stop the knotting of muscles in my chest so I could lie flat for cat scan of chest. Immediate vomiting and then severe convulsions (no memory of all this - my husband said took several hours before I calmed and could talk without stutter or stop involuntarily convulsing)I now have kidney infection and pain. NEVER TAKE AGAIN!!

She was completelt out of it!

It made me so sick that I thought that I was going to die!!! I would have rathered endured the pain than taken this med! This drug should be banned!!!! It took 5 days for me to bounce back from all of the nausea, dizziness, and loss of appetite.

Overall pain relief is excellent but there's a short life of the med. so in addition I suggest a break through pain med, like an oxycodone.
Severe Pain	colee218, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	19-24	9/4/2009 5:19:56 PM	I was in the ER with severe migraines. they injected me with this and another drug to help with the vomitting. the only thing i felt during the injection of dilaudid was my face on fire, my body shaking, my hands ands feet sweating, and severe diziness. i thought the nurse was trying to kill me. within 2 minutes the pain was gone, but the experience fo being injected with it was horrible! it also made me very sleepy. i would be carrying on a conversation and then pass out right in the middle of it. i think the worst part of all was the consipation when i got home. will never take this again
Severe Pain	cj, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	8/25/2009 10:41:14 PM	I have just changed from Morphine 25ml to Dilaudid 5ml and will probably be &quot;bumped up&quot; slightly Sept 1st.  The last 2 weeks has given me more relief than I have had in I truly cannot remember when.  I am grateful to everyone at my Pain Clinic. p.s. this is my 1st time here and perhaps I may not be on the correct Dilaudid site - I have an epidural pain pump.  As  of  now  I am still having to maintain with 300mc Fentanyl patches every 72 hrs. and oral morphine tabs. 30mg. 1-2 every 4-6 hrs. no more than 6 per day.  I have had my pump for 1 1/2 yrs.

Dilaudid can do this, but, take notice of dosage; make certain that your doctor is very knowledgeable of all possible interactions. This is an extremely strong narcotic.

It worked well for the pain but the vomiting was bad.
Severe Pain	babysasha, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	11/12/2008 10:00:31 AM	This medication like to have blown my head off.  My ears started ringing, severe dizziness, nausea, vomiting, it was awful.  I was given two different types of anti nausea meds in iv to stop the side effects, however, didn't work.  I slept for a full day from 1 mg of dilaudid iv.  Will never have the stuff again!  I thought I was overdosed.
Severe Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	10/9/2008 12:59:18 PM	It is good as far as helping ease pain. I have used it for both post-surgical pain &amp; monthly severe uterine pain. The only problem I had with it was even after taking one pill, I would have these dizzy spells off &amp; on over a few weeks period. Drink alot. I found it dehydrated me alot. And, if you're prone to constipation, take a laxative to help.

Severe Pain		5	3	4			11/17/2007 10:08:44 PM	I was given this in the emergency room when I had a severe migraine and it made a noticable difference. The last 2 times I had severe pain I was given demerol with very little relief.

Acute Pain Following an Operation	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	9/21/2007 6:31:09 PM	I have been opiate tolerant due to severe injuries. Upon an emergency surgery, The only drug that worked for my pain was dilaudid. I took it in high doses(12mg), and the morphine would not phase my pain. When mixed with fentanyl inj., it worked best. I will never forget the level of comfort I had, when I was in terrible agony. This is the best drug ever made.
