Simply put, this stuff works! I swear by them. Please note that I have tried every method out there and I have realized that although there is no such thing as a miracle pill, Premsyn comes close.

My husband calls them my &quot;good girl&quot; pills.  Relieves irritability, bloating, headache, tension, etc.  It is a definite for anyone who experiences severe PMS symptoms.

Painful Periods	anita, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/8/2011 1:47:22 AM	My mother, sister, and I used this for years for multiple PMS symptoms. We swore by it. I am now 48 and haven't experienced PMS for a long time but am now having problems again due to perimenopause (pre-menopause)which is causing a resurgence in symptoms--mainly headache, overall acheyness, fatigue, bloated feeling, and emotional ups and downs. I've recommended it to my daughter-in-law but she hasn't started to use it yet so I don't know how it's working for her yet. She has very bothersome periods, though, and had never heard of this medication. It's not easy to find anymore, as the heavily-advertised brands have edged it out and stores just don't tend to carry it anymore, which is unfortunate since every woman I know that has had period problems who has tried it has sworn by it--unlike the other big names such as Pamprin and Midol. Those never did as much for me as this does. They cure some of the cramping and maybe some of the headache, but not the other symptoms--especially the emotional ups and downs. Try Walgreens and if they don't carry it they will probably order it if you ask. We need to tell the newer generations of women about it and save them from the misery of bad periods!! This product does contain a diuretic, so be sure and inform/educate yourself as to what exactly a diuretic does within the body--mainly the kidneys! For example: don't take any other diuretic medication along with this and make sure your doc knows about it!! It's a little more involved than just curing a headache with some acetamenophine. Hope this helps. If you try this stuff and it works for you be a dear and pass it on to other women--especially the younger ones!!

Honestly, without it I'm miserable and bitchy and crampy, if I take one tablet I'm a new woman within an hour. We SWEAR by this stuff and would never consider visiting the in-laws during my period without it! Only problem is it's getting harder to locate.

Painful Periods	lovelottie9, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/10/2010 7:41:17 PM	This is my first time taking Premsyn PMS Oral &amp; I have finally found my peace of mind solution to my very painful, erratic, menstrual days. I have fibroid so, the combination of my cycle and the fibroid were starting to take over my life. I am always so irritable and angry before and after my menstrual cycle, and level headed maybe 2 weeks out of each month. However, this feeling I have right now: something of normalcy has elated my soul. I feel at peace with my body; I am in control of it now. I have to say this is the first time in a long time that I do not want to pull my hair out, curl up in the fetal position, and stay in bed. I have my life back. Thank God! 
Painful Periods	ChickenBoo, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	19-24	7/9/2010 2:38:15 PM	This stuff works pretty well at releiving cramps and some other symptoms of a menstrual period, but while using it, I developed this very strange pressure-like pain on my left side under my rib cage (immediately to the left of my belly button, but completely to the side.) My doctor couldn't figure out what was wrong with me, so I stopped taking the Premsyn, and took Tylenol when needed instead. It does the exact same thing, but upon discontinuing use of Premsyn, the pain was gone within a day or two.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/21/2010 4:46:47 PM	I've used Premsyn for several years for its intended purpose. About a year ago my 8-year-old spent many weeks in the hospital during chemotherapy. I slept in the room with her every night. I started to take one Premsyn each night before bed and I was able to relax and fall asleep...waking up when I needed to and feeling refreshed in the morning. I previously suffered from severe PMS and a short bout of depression. Since taking Premsyn during the last year my mood has been well-controlled and I take no other medication.  I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from PMS and even for mild-depression like symptoms.

During this time of the month I become very edgie and have a hard time not becoming violent. Most time I can take one tablet and it will calm me down. If someone has upset me during that time of the month I must take at least two- three tablet. I become very calm where I can function to remove myself from the situation and regroup. I have heard from a co-worker that Premsyn pms causes cancer. If this is true please respond. I did not see any information in the side effect.
