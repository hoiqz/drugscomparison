I am still not convinced that this medication is all that good for the cost.

High Blood Pressure	Elliot, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	3	Male	45-54	5/3/2010 8:03:30 PM	In as much as my bp has gone down drastically, I pay the price by having chronic coughs and feeling light headed. Went off of the drug for 2 weeks,the results were..increased energy, no coughing, no headaches or feelings of being light headed...BUT, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE came back. Afraid to take anything else, living with the side effects while at the same time attempting to lose about 15-20 lbs. in order to completely come off of bp meds. all together

I started with the lower dose and am now on the higher dose of 4/240. But now I have to take another bp med (Diovan-80mg) in the evening to keep my bp low until the morning dose of Tarka. I am still not sure if both will work together ok.

High Blood Pressure	Robin, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	3/19/2008 12:34:10 PM	Tarka worked well to reduce my blood pressure for the couple of months I was on it. I had to stop taking it though b/c it caused me to have frequent upper respiratory illnesses and I developed a severe persistent cough. I coughed all day and all night, nothing relieved it until I stopped taking the Tarka. It is listed a possible side effect. I dont know why this side effect affected me so severely.

About 8 months ago, I joined Weight Watchers, used their Core Plan, and have lost a total of 31 pounds. As a result, my blood pressure has dropped a considerable amount, due to the weight loss.  My doctor and I are extremely satisfied with this medication.
