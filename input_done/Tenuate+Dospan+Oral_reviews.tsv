Overweight	John's mom, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	65-74	9/18/2012 8:54:26 PM	65yo female, 5'2&quot;, 184# when began in Feb 2012, 140# on 9/18/12. Went from size 16 to current size 6.  Started with one half of 75mg time-released capsule 1 X per day in a.m.  Began losing IMMEDIATELY (6#/wk)while eating SMALL meals, watching sugar, calories, fat, carbs.  Did not obsess about food at all but could eat when time came for it.  High energy.  Used treadmill for 1/2 to 1 hr 3X week while reading books on tape.  Added swimmercise for seniors 45 min workout 3X/wk.  Eventually stopped treadmill.  After 4 months tried whole pill of 75mg but made my heart race-felt anxious.  [Also take 40mg Prozac and up to 15mg hydrocodone w/up to 487 acetaminephen daily] (if needed) for sciatic pain from 3 rear-end car accidents in 2004.  Switched to 25mg tenuate 2X/day but could not tolerate immediate release pill.  Went back to 1/2 75mg time-released capsule.  Got very ill when tried to drink one glass wine early on so no alcohol at all until just recently.  Now I can tolerate a little wine.  I put my weight on due to over-eating &amp; drinking alcohol to self-medicate while grieving intensely for 20 years.  Going to 47th year high school reunion next month looking and feeling great!  Look like I'm early 50's. Many things impact weight gain.  This is the only time I have ever been able to lose weight - but I was determined and the medication worked.

The only side effect has been dry mouth. I does suppress my appetite but not to the point where I can't eat and it wears off within a few hours for me. I need to take the full dosage for it's full effect which is 25 mg, 3 times a day. It has eliminated food cravings but not to the point where I no longer wish to eat bad foods. So far, in one week I have lost 3 pounds with diet and exercise.

I have lost 3 puns a week by eating less (if Ido not binge at night) and with no exercise.

I used to gain a great deal of weight at each one of my three pregnancies.  After my third baby I had gained almost 80 pounds.  i tried to lose weight without medication but I was always so exhausted just trying to do plain exercises.  I could barely walk.  Then my doctor prescribed Tenuate dospan.  Over a period of 6 months I lost almost 100.  Nineteen years later I've gained only 5 pounds.  Taking the medication back then I remember being full of energy and not at all hungry.  I would recommend it if like me you've gained a lot of weight and  you can cope with it any more.

But i feel like i am losing my mind, i feel out of control and unable to deal with my emotions. Recently started feeling some chest discomfort when breathing deeply and extending my left arm.
Overweight	DMW, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	7/1/2008 12:54:57 PM	I've been on this medication for 3 weeks now, I feel lethargic and exhausted (which I didn't before) and I can't see any major difference in the amount of weight loss that I was achieving with exercise/diet alone.  Now I'm too tired to exercise most days, and my muscles ache.  I'm giving it a month to start working, so we'll see.  So far though, not that great.

Everyone in my physicians office seemed to be shocked. Even my doctor said that I should be the &quot;poster child&quot; for the drug. Nothing but a good experience!
