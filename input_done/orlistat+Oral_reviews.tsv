I would highly recommend this product.

If in the event you do - (this may sound gross) but make sure you are squatted over a toilet when you feel the need to flatulate. Orlistat does a wonderful job in seperating the fat cells to the point you will see it. Even after 24 hours of non-use it will continue (so keep this in mind as well).All that to say no diet works, this requires a change of lifestyle habits and exercise. I have eatten everything I like to eat. I lost 22 lbs in the begining 3 months because I mis-read and thought it was 19g of fat per day, but it was per meal. (based on weight).But instead of having 1/2 the pie of pizza, have 2 slices and a salad. Again lifestyl change.. Does not sound &quot;manly&quot; when watching a football game, but I for one am willing to sacrafice the &quot;image&quot; of manlihood to live longer...

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/17/2009 5:34:18 PM	I started taking Orlistat about two months ago and I have lost 12 lbs.  I am very satisfied with my weight loss and how easy it has been so far.  Because of this drug I am much more aware of the foods that I eat and am more health conscious too when feeding my three children.  I have had very few side effects (lose stool) and  it isn't as bad as the label suggest.  If you want to lose weight and learn to eat right try Orlistat today.  You will be happy you did.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	5	5	Female	25-34	5/12/2008 9:35:43 AM	I've been using alli for almost 2 weeks and have lost 8lbs. I'll say that the side effects don't seem to effect me and not even when the meal contains more then the 30% fat. For those of us how need a push or shove like in my case, this drug is for you. It will help you to loose more weight quicker and when your working so hard you want to see the results. And results will keep you on track. Im hoping to loose 65lbs. in 6 mon. Im thinking with alli I'll do it in less time.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/25/2008 1:47:13 PM	I purchased this drug in the over-the-counter form called ALLI. I have been extremely happy with the weight loss progress I've made with no significant side effects. My goal was to get back into a healthy BMI, and I can see definite progress not to mention I feel better too. I highly recommend it, and at $50 for a 3 months supply I feel it's a good value.

Overweight	Nibs, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/14/2007 5:20:22 PM	after going to the gym three times a week for over 12 months and not shifting a single pound and having the usual blood tests for diebetes etc my doctor prescribed orlistat, after 3 weeks of being on orlistat i have lost weight (6 lbs) which is amazing.  If you think yeh i can eat what i want and loose weight your wrong this drug makes you think about what your eating and i think overall it teaches you to have a better diet day to day.  If you go to your local fast food resuarant and your taking orlistat you will have nasty side effects, however if you eat low fat you will loose the pounds and have little to no side effects.
