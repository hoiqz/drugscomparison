I was worried about all the side effects. they sounds terrible. I havnt had neusea etc. the only things I have noticed is being tired, some depression ( noticed by others) and some agressiveness ( noticed by others. ) but hopefully it will work well and just want others to not worry as much about the side effects they are pretty scary.
