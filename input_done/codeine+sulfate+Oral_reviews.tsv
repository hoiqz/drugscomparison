Diarrhea	bloodsugardaddy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	9/7/2010 12:28:31 PM	 The need to take higher doses for it to be effective, or to give it a break occasionally, makes it somewhat unpredictable. It doesn't make me sleepy as it apparently does some other people. It actually perks me up a little. At my dosage (30 mg.)I don't feel (good buzz) medicated. Even when drinking. Renewals for this must be mailed, not faxedto the pharmacy or hand delivered by you.    Not surprisingly, I have found that the mailed prescriptions for this have often mysteriously disappeared between the doctor's office and the drugstore. I've never had that happen with any other drug. Not as addictive as some other opiates. Istop taking it for a week or so once in awhile and don't have any cravings or withdrawal symptoms.
Cough	pattycakes101, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/1/2010 2:34:10 PM	I have had this chronic cough for over 12 years before we found that I have a hypersensative Larynx.   This calms the tregger in my throat and calms the cough.  It worked so well that I was able to slack off to 1/4 every 4 days.  But due to the sever allergy season this Spring 2010 and a remodel job in my home, I have started coughing again.  I now take 1/4 morning &amp; night.  Still coughing badly at night.  As of today I am going to 1/2 at night.  I have a headache when I wake up but it calms my throat.  I am also going to use my nasal spray again.  If you have a cough that is just too much for you to handle....night and day....go to your Neurologist and he will perscribe it after he talks to you. His first suggestion was to quit my secertarial job and answering phones, second was this medication.  Praise the Lord it WORKS!!!  Now it is time again to up the dosage until I get it under control.  Beginning today. 9/1/2010Good Luck.

My weight dropped from my normal 145 to less than 110. I have gained at least 15 pounds back and it does control the diarrhea very well

Diarrhea	bloodsugardaddy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	1/5/2010 7:40:22 PM	I am using for diabectic Diarhea . Have foundthat it is useful at the 30 mg x 4 times dailydose that I take. Hopefully I can soon stop taking the expensive suplements. I am worriedabout the potentially addictive properties ofthis medication, but I have had other opiatebased medication in the past, for about a year perscription, and not had a problem. Isuppose the trick is to not exceed the dosage subscribed to you.

It furthermore proved inadequate at relieving pain - an Aspirin combined with Ibuprofen was approximately just as effective for me.I would avoid this medication. Either take some OTC painkillers or get something stronger in pill form; this syruppy herb isn't effective at anything but causing some pretty severe tooth pain.
