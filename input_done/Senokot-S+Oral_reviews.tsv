There are only 2 medications approed for this and they don't work very well. I take senokot S 3x times a week but my GI Dr is not happy about it. He says overuse will turn my colon black. Scare tactic? Maybe. But you have to do what you must do or never leave the house!

I have been taking this for about 2 years at the recommendation of my Endo. I just had a visit with my GP.  He said the long term use of this could cause serious problem, and for me to switch to Miralax (or it's generic).

This was Because of the Pain Medication that was Not Allowing me To Have Bowel Movements! He explained that since it was almost a Week that I should take 8 pills That Evening and 4 More the Next Morning!! I was then able to go!! I now Only take 2 Pills a Day, and Everything is Working Great!!I'll have to be on these for a while due to Chemotherapy and other Medications that I am on!! I wonder why the FDA is Making Senakot Recall this All Natural Product?? Maybe Not enough money in it for them??
