Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/20/2012 11:02:44 AM	This medication helped me with focus for school.  I previously was unable to get grades above a C and I am currently on the Dean's list working on my bachelors degree in accounting.  Side effects experienced have ranged from minimal insomnia to weight loss and loss of appetite.  The weight loss and loss of appetite were a blessing.  The only bad side effect was increased heart rate while exercising for cardio - I felt like I was having a heart attack thus I needed to alter my workout program to decrease cardio and concentrate on weights and muscle tone.  My doctor made this decision for this medication based on my inability to swallow pills and I couldn't be happier with the results.  I wish I had been diagnosed years earlier.

She mostly does well but a few days I haven't put it on (trying to give her a break from it since it's summer) but the last few times I've had her off it she's been &quot;zombie-like&quot; which scares me!  I'll call the psychiatrist tomorrow to see if the intermittent days off is messing with her levels.

Shire Pharmaceuticals has created a sleeping beast that is waiting to be abused in the rave scene. At high amounts (both transdermal and chewing), daytrana creates a euphoria unlike any other drug on the market. It's the consistent energy and speed rush of coke, along with the head high and utter euphoria of ecstasy. Daytrana needs to be controlled FAST otherwise abuse will be mainstream. MPH is a drug not to be taken lightly and should be re-evaluated. On the other side of the spectrum, Daytrana has helped me TREMENDOUSLY! I suffer from ADHD and ADD (associative depressive disorder) and let me tell you, daytrana helps me more than any mood booster and stimulant on the market. It gives me the daily drive to actually WANT to do things no matter how menial it may be. I feel that I'll be able to take whatever the day throws at me and turn it around to produce an absolute masterpiece. If controlled, Daytrana could very well be the &quot;wonder&quot; medicine for those who suffer from depression and also ADHD

The adhesive causes extreme irritation to the point where the skin is broken.  We've been trying to manage that with lotions and making sure the adhesive is removed at night. Some loss of appetite and moodiness, But for now, the best we've found. Daytrana customer service is also very helpful.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	12/7/2011 7:47:49 PM	I've been diagnosed with ADHD when I first started out my first semester of college and received poor grades. I've been taking Daytrana for a little over a month now.  At first, my psychiatrist prescribed me 10 milligrams to start out with.  It worked okay, not the best results when I was on Vyvanse.  However, Vyvanse gave me extreme side effects and I was verbally aggressive. My grades were awesome but, my mood was terrible.  After awhile taking the 10 milligram of Daytrana, my attention span wore off and it became ineffective.  So, my psychiatrist then prescribed me with 20 milligrams.  After two days off taking it, I've experienced extreme tiredness and dizziness, I feel as if I'm living my life through a daze. Also, I've been experiencing a dry mouth, loss of appetite, fatigue and nausea. I have even more difficulty studying and being able to focus my attention in my classes. I have finals next week and I'm extremely worried with the outcome of my grades.  I'm not pleased with how my body is taking effect from this non stimulant drug.

It starts working like 2 hours after being applied.  I can tell the exxact second it is in his system.  He calms down.  He is able to sit still.  Does not talk to fast and maintains a great ddisposition.  The bad parts are that he doesn't eat while on it.  If he is on it an may want a snack, I let him have what ever he wants.  But, boy watch out when he is off of it... He eats me out of the house.  He eats like a grown man.  The other down fall is insomnia.  He has a hard time getting to sleep, so every other day he gets an all natural sleep aid.  I HATE having him on medication and really hope he out grows it, but this seemed to be the best medication for him.  It makse his skin red when we take it off, but good lotion helps soothes it.

She has been on it for 6 years.We give her a break on weekends and summer vacation to help with appetite and growth. It is important that children's growth be monitored.Removal from backing can be difficult sometimes. Varies from box to box.Dr. suggested refrigeration for stubborn patches and this works.

During the school year, I have 30 mg, and during the summer, I have 15 mg. This is probably the best way to use the drug, only use the high dosage WHEN NEEDED. I have also noticed a major loss of appetite and insomnia. I can live with the them because the Pros certainly outweigh the Cons. Give it a try, start out small, of course.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	7-12 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	4	3	4	Female	7-12	4/25/2011 10:32:27 PM	My son started on this medication about 2 years ago. It has been the best medicine to contol his ADHD (clinically significant). It does take some time to kick in and it does wear off about 2 hours after it comes off. To deal with the minor skin irritation we use Benadryl cream every night on the spots. We also used a 4 spot rotation. Top and bottom left and right. He is able to focus in school and still has a personality. The only major drawback is the consistency with which the patches come off the plastic backing. One box will have no problems and the next box the backing worn't peel off. We have tried other oral meds for him but all of them seemed to overdose him and cause major stomach issues. We like that this one does not have to go through the digestive system so he will still eat.

He was previously on Focalin, which made him emptional and very angry.  Daytrana soothes him, without completely loosing his personality.  It takes longer to kick in, but the change it has made in his behavior is wonderful.  I do have trouble getting it on, and then keeping it on.

It was working well (still loss of appetite, focused at school, but depressed) until she just developed an allergic reaction to the adhesive last week.  I'm so frustrated since oral medication seems to make falling asleep impossible.

The doctor just added to his dosaged and within two days my son's speech therapist commented on how well he is doing. We went with the patch to begin with because my son will not swallow pills. He has had no side effects from this medication and we are very pleased!

I started the patch and got great response from the teachers. I notice he was a bit aggressive but it has started getting better and when the medicine wore off he was all over the place.I only use it during the week for school and give him breaks on the week-ends. i am keeping him on 10mg for a while it seems to be working. the patches stick a little and it cracks is it still ok to put it on? any feed back will be great

Does very well about 1 1/2 hours after it is applied until 1 1/2 hours after it is removed. Very rough mornings w/ lack of focus, and barely able to get through homework. No appetite during day, but eats like a horse in the morning and at night- usually 3-4 hours after it is removed. Hard to get to sleep, but does sleep well. Anxiety with bees, and other flying insects he never had before. Red areas at patch, but not too bad. It goes away in a day or 2. I LOVE it! Makes parenting much easier and the household much calmer.

I always had ups and downs with Ritalin but with Daytrana a 30mg Patch last me from 6:00am till when I get off work at 5:00pm or when I want to take it off. I believe it would last a full 24 hours if you left it on.  I had absolutely Zero Rebound. I should have gave it a try years ago.  I'm a 31 year old male, so I can probably speak for that age range, so not so sure how it would affect a child.  I love just having to apply the patch once in morning and dont have to worry about having to remember to take another dose)s) during the day. I would suggest to everyone to at least give Daytrana a try.  I've heard of a lot of people having rashes from the patch, but nothing happened to my skin. and I have extremely sensitive skin to detergents and soaps, so I was surprised that it didn't bother me. If yo have any questions, email me at caseywrice@eplus.net and I will be glad to answer anything if I can.

And if he sleeps in (like most teenagers do)I can still have him remove it early to control the time it is in his system which is something you can't do with an oral medication.Recently, we have had trouble filling the prescription at any of our local pharmacies - they are telling us they can't get it within a week.  And because of the extreme heat here this summer, our mail order was ruined.  I wish they could mail them in dry ice, or the local pharmacy could get them without any delay.  Anyone else having this problem?

No more taking pills to school, no more peaks and troughs through out the day, and a definite decrease in anger and aggression. We use a 4x6 op-site in the summer to cover it so he can go swimming like all the other kids and he really truly acts like all the other 10 year old boys. My son is growing normally in the last 18 months he's been on the patch and has a normal appetite.

Severe anxiety, Hearing voices, seeing things and finally came the suicidal thoughts and cutting. She can no longer take any stimulant type drugs. Please be careful and watch and question every change.

Finally, almost the end of the year her teacher agrees! I didn't want her to be on a pill and decided to give this a try..what a RELIEF! She is doing so much better after 6 weeks..I cannot believe the difference! She does get a red mark from where it is and eats a little less when it is on. I too do not put it on her on weekends and days off! I gotta let her get all that energy out!! Overall I am soooo happy with the results!
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	manor713,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	4	3	Female		5/6/2010 10:00:51 AM	My son is 8 and has been on the patch for 6 months now. I also did not want to medicate, but there were very few natural choices that worked. Did the fish oils, outdoor activities, and he was still very unhappy and his school work and behavior at school was failing.  He is very smart and it is very frustrating for him to not be able to work. I put the patch on in the mornings right before he finishes breakfast. It usually takes an hour or so to kick in..teachers say 2 hours..but his work is completed and his behavior is good. my biggest problem and it is very scary is that he will not eat at all when he is on the patch...he complains that it makes him nauseous if he does..so he will not eat until dinner time..i can't get him to drink anything or snack. i tried pbj sandwiches, instant shakes, protein shakes, etc..nothing. he is VERY skinny..i know he will fight me on the pills so i keep the patch..wondering what others have done in my situation.  patch redness i use aquaphor, it was worst in the beginning, but better now. I also use baby oil after showers to keep area moist and control the dryness. also for the person that has trouble with getting the patch off the backing..I never throw these away..they are very expensive:-) I warm it up in my fingers first..it makes it easier to remove the backing. just rub it between your fingers for a few minutes, it has worked for me..cause I had her same trouble in the beginning. I wish there was more I could do for him...it's very hard to see them deal with this. thanks,

The only downfalls with it are the rash from the patch. It gets red and itchy at the site. We put aquaphor on it after removal which helps but still bothers my son. Also we give to him at 7am and it takes awhile at school to kick in so I get some complaints about his behavior in the morning. So have to wake up an hour earlier at 5:30-6am to put it on. Other than that he has gotten all A's and B's where he was just passing. Is soooo much calmer and can concentrate on his work.  Hope this helps.

I like it a lot, and it is really helpful, but I do struggle with trying to figure out how to keep my hips from getting irritated. I have not had a lot of problems with it. When I first started taking Daytrana, I took 40mg for a while, but that was too much, it kind of suppressed my personality, and it was not good. Now I am on 30mg, and much happier. It is kind of a bummer that it is so big, but I like the control I have over when I take it. I still struggle a lot with school, but I think that may partly be because I got diagnosed so late. I didn't get diagnosed until 8th grade, and then it has taken a long time to figure out how I really work. I also struggle with sleeping and eating. I have also found that it is really important for me to be active during the day, which helps me sleep later, and also helps me focus. I have had an adverse reaction with Clonadine, when I took more than 0.2mg I think. I would recommend creating structure for your kids, and teaching them self-discipline early on. Sports, music, and dance are great ways to do this. I really like the structure of ballet. Good Luck!

The doctor would always put him on a pill of some kind to treat it. He couldn't and still can not take pills. FINALLY, at age 10, his doctor finally listens to me and gives him the patch after i requested it twice. He has done so well while on the patch. Only side effects are a red spot where the patch is located(most common side effect) and within an hour after taking it off, he has this 30 minute spell of sadness from being bored. Even though there s a lot for him to do, he thinks there is nothing to do and gets sad because he is bored. Other than that, it is a miracle patch. My son actually enjoys taking it bc it doesnt have the side effects as the pills. Mainly, his stomach doesnt hurt with the patch.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	parent4life, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	3-6	2/25/2010 2:06:27 PM	I have a 5 1/2 year old son who has been resently diagnosed with adhd. Me &amp; my husband have been getting complaints since he was 3 and in daycare about his behavior. Although his adhd is part of who he is it also hinders relations with other kids his age, school activities, home life. We put off medicating for as long as we could until he was in to the school system. We went through may meds. at first. concerta, adderall, focalinXR. Focalin was great but my son started to refuse the pill. I felt so defeated!! I then read up on the Daytrana patch &amp; asked his Doctor if this would be an option for him. Well Let me just start by saying this is the best thing I could have asked for for my Jade. He takes the 10mg patch and has been for about a month &amp; a half now. He is more social at school. Getting better every day with school work &amp; at home we only have to ask him to do things once as opposed to 10-15 reminders. I know you know what I mean by that!! No side effect other than redness that goes away by the next day. He eats well &amp; and falls asleep around 9:30pm verses 8:30pm. I only give this to my son on school days not on weekends, holidays, snowdays. This is only for learning purposes. Good luck to you all who struggle with this illness or have love ones who are effected. It is the hardest thing I have had to watch but don't give up you will find something that will work!!

Nothing seemed to work except eliminating food dyes brought the hyperactive down but still could not focus. Heard about the patch and so far so good no real side effects except a pink spot on the hip and for the first time in a long time he felt good about himself in school. Grades are going up and assignments are completed. What I love most about it is you have control over the patch when you need it. Would highly reccomend as a first try before trying pills.

We like it because we can put it on whenever he goes to school or if we plan something, and not put it on when he doesnt have school or is on break. We started out on 10mg and upped the the dose to 15mg.After dose being upped what a world of a diff. The teachers havnt called home or sent home pink slips in over 2 weeks.(We decided not to tell teachers he was on as we wanted to see if they noticed a differance also in school as we have at home). The only complaint is getting the plastic off the back to stick it on his thigh..We have wasted a few trying to get it to peel away. He does have redness when takin off but it goes away after a few hours, and he has comlained a few times that it itches. The only side affect we are trying to get through is his moodiness.(Outburst of crying for no reason) He was drawling a pic and messed up and started balling.So far we are loving our son on the patch as we can do more with him now and hes doing way better in school.

We delayed meds as long as possible, but his ADD is severe. Worked fantastic for 2 years.  Besides drastically improving school academic performance, it actually lessened his overall anxiety level and moodiness/irritability--it was like having our &quot;old&quot; good natured son back.  Minor patch application/skin issues outwieghed by wonderful results. However, after 2 years he developed severe and unrelenting stomach pains (even morphine drip in hospital for one week didn't help at one point).  Stopped the med and stomach pain stopped within 1 week (after several months of abdominal pain and mis-disagnoses, no one initially thought it could be the ADD med and he was tested for everything else under the sun).  On Vyvanse now for 1 year and hate it.  Works on the ADD (still doing well academically) but causes him negative personality changes, lots of sadness, anger, irritation and outbursts. Hard for both siblings and parents to handle his constant irritation, complaining and outright meanness. We miss our son. Hoping the neurologist puts him back on Daytrana and that it works for a while before the stomach pain hits again...(thats how good Daytrana works compared to the side effects of Vyvanse, that I would even consider risking exposing my son to that pain again)...

When my husband and I decided to take it off permanently, he was no better or worse.  We are afraid of long term effects, so since we stopped it, his personality didn't really change much.

Just the loss of appetite during the day has decreased.  I only medicate for school and do not use the patch on weekends which has been helping him learn to cope and function without the medicine. He is 6 now and I hope to get him off medication this next year.

I have trouble sleeping every night, I always feel deppresed, and am always feeling like someone is out to get me. I do not use this medicine during the summer, in doing this I have noticed a dramatic decrease in weight lose and the ability to get a good night sleep.

At first it was a wonderful. Now we are having issues with anxiety fearful of spiders, bees etc. He is in a complete panic state.  If someone looks at him crosswise he thinks they are trying to kill him and runs to hide. I do not know why the change in him from almost 2 years of great things to him being a basket case.  I do not know if it is due to harmones changing in boys at a certain age and the meds do not mix or what the problem is.  He is great during the day but for the first 2 hours of the day it is very difficult and at night he has to take a sleeping pill.

I have been a 13 handicap for the past 5 years.  Since I have been on Daytrana in the past 4 months, my handicap has dropped to a 6.  My focus and concentration has improved so much.  I cant stress enough that I absolutely can attribute the considerable drop in my handicap to Daytrana.You can take that for what its worth.

It was truly consistent in the way it affected him, however, he had huge welps under the patch and the doctor took him off of them as nothing was helping with the itching or redness.  He's now on Vyvanse.  We like it okay, however it's not as consistent.  I wished the people that made Daytrana could find a more user friendly adhesive that wouldn't wear a kids skin out.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	5/29/2009 4:32:27 AM	I have been reading all of the posts and often wish I could respond to some of them.  I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult and have tried several...if not all of the stimulant medications.  I have had a couple of problems, one is that my body metabolizes them to fast, so they never last as long as what they should; however a higher dosage just makes me tense, and 2 they all seem to make me mean with no sense of humor at all.  Although, I would not say that Daytrana is the most effective stimulant, it is the most effective for the least amount of side effects.  The biggest downfalls seem to be the mark that it leaves and that it takes at least 2 hours to kick in.  As far as the people who are complaining that 9 hours isn't long enough, the truth is there it enough medication on the patch to last 15 hours if needed.  Also, I have not had problems  with the sticky stuff coming off or it not sticking to me; however I did go off of it for a year to try vyvanse and have just gone back on it recently, so maybe I missed that recall.  With that being said, it is important that it doesn't get too hot or too cold...you don't want to keep it in the bathroom where it can get too hot and humid.  Also, make sure you apply it with warm hands and rub it on your skin for a good 60 seconds or so to activate the sticky stuff which will make it stick better...I put it on and then take a really hot bath which often helps make it stick.

Other	BetterFocused, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	5/28/2009 11:35:53 AM	The patches are easy to use and stay on throughout the day.  However, I sometimes experience itching at the patch site and always have redness at the site after removing the patch. The other downside is that you have to make sure to scrub the glue off when you shower!
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Brandy, 3-6 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	3-6	5/9/2009 10:53:18 PM	My son was diagnosed with ADHD at age 3.  We had 3 different doctors confirm diagnosis before we took any additional steps.  Right now, the main problem is his hyperactivity and impulsiveness.  The daytrana patch is a lifesaver!  Especially at his young age, he wouldn't swallow the pills.  He actually refers to the patch as his special bandaid that helps him be good.  We did have sleep issues also.  He is so hyper that he would stay awake all night long.  The doctors did give him a pill to help sleep at night and that has also been a lifesaver.  The Daytrana has helped him act more like a normal kid and help him focus more in preschool.  There are only 2 problems we've had with this medicine: his appetite is poor for lunch.  Breakfat and supper are the best.  Before the patch and after you take it off.  I always give him a good snack before bed such as a bowl of cereal to help replace what he missed earlier in the day.  The other is the skin irritation.  We found that using olive oil to remover the patch helps remove all the adhesive and also lubricates the skin.  I also use Eucerin cream to help keep the skin from getting dry.  I hope this helps!

In the beginning it worked great. To keep the skin from being so irritated I would put vasaline on it every time I took off the patch. The next day I would rotate sides of his hip. Also don't put it in exactly the same spot every time, move it around the hip, but becareful not to get it in the crease of their leg this will make sitting very uncomfortable. I did that once and he took it off. Not good. After a while we needed to increase the dose from 20mg to 30mg. At first it was great! But after a while I noticed things in his personality that weren't quit like him. For instance he was extremely sensitive and would have meltdowns for no reason. He got kind of paranoid about things.He saw a spider in the school bathroom and wouldn't go to the bathroom all day.It freaked him out!Not just &quot;no I don't need to go&quot;,it was&quot; no don't make me go in there!&quot;,like this was a giant &quot;Harry Potter&quot; spider and its going to get me.He also once wouldn't come in the house after the bus dropped him off because he didn't see the car in the driveway,it was in the garage.So he sat in the front yard and a neighbor called me to tell me she was standing with him in the yard cuz he was scared to go inside. What?? This was really not like him at all!This waS Just from uping the dose by 10mg. So we switched to Vyvanse. We've liked that so far....

They are more attentive. are more aware of what they need to do as of school work and home chores. But lately there are no pharmacies in Gary or surrounding areas that have the patch. 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	 on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	4	4			3/22/2009 10:54:25 PM	I was having numerous problems with my 6 year old son and when I took he to see a doctor he was diagnosed with ADHD. He was started on Metadate which did nothing for us. When I took him back the doctor prescribed daytrana. I saw instant change in him. Only problems we are having is the site being irritated, which is easily fixable. Noticing after the patch is taken off its hyperactivity all over again, which we are slowly dealing with. The one thing that is upsetting me the most is he is trouble sleeping. Overall, the 9 hours he is wearing the patch he is doing excellent on getting himself ready for school, and focusing at school and not getting himself in trouble. I have been told to contact the doctor for the sleeping issue, but I am just a bit leery on putting him on something else.

Once introduced to the patch it has worked perfect for me because the school doesnt call daily and complain about his behavior. And it's only give once a day. I love it!
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	3-6	3/10/2009 11:30:22 AM	My son is 6 and diagnosed with ADHD in Oct of 08, this medication has been a GOD send!!!! My son was constantally being sent home from school with hitting, biting, kicking, running around, causing an unsafe enviornment for all in the school, and could not focus on anything. It was a very trying time for him and I. We did and IEP, and found a school (public) that we could send him to that takes care of childern like mine, with the medication and the school I have seen a great deal of difference. He doesn't hit, he can focus, he is his teacher's &quot;work aholic&quot; and can complete tasks when given to him. He was put on the losest does which is 10mg, we recently had to put him on the 15mg, due to him regressing, hiting running around out class, not being able to concentrate, and with the new dose, it's all back to the way it should be. I was very against putting my child on medication, but his ADHD was so severe, that really I had no choice, he just started 1st grade and was already on the verge of being helf back due to him being dismissed so much by the other school. I would recommend this medication to anyone, it has helped my son become the child I knew he could be!!!! :)

He continued with poor weight gain, upset stomach, and he refuses to swallow a pill.  DAYTRANA is a miracle!  He needs the patch on in his sleep (5:30 am) and he eats breakfast for over one year now.  He is 13, and I wish I had it when he was in first grade.  Now I am tapering him off the meds for good and his true personality and creative side that is underdeveloped is beginning to emerge over the last 3 months.  He takes ATTEND twice a day with applesauce for his symptoms and he went from a 20mg patch to 15mg patch with some withdrawal symptoms.  I realized a long time ago that he would need to come off these types of meds but I am grateful for the ease of DAYTRANA and I highly recommend using it if it doesn't effect blood pressure.  The mom

The patch is effective but I have found that it takes much longer than 2 hours to get into his system.  I generally have to get up at 5:00 and place the patch on my sleeping child.  By doing this, the medication seems to be in his system by the time school starts at 8:30.

We tried Straterra, but it did not work for me.  I just started on the Patch 1 week ago.  It is wonderful.  I put it on in the morning before work, and take it off before bed. I can deal with the red mark when I take it off.  No high BP, and lots of focus at work.  Yay for Daytrana!

His reading soared.  He is still on it in the first grade, but it is taking longer (2 hours)to kick in. There is a major difference in his handwriting when he is on the patch. I found that putting a Sponge Bob big bandaid over the patch helped him keep the patch on and keep it from rolling.

After one month on the patch, I have seen (as well as his teachers)him do a complete turn around. The patch does leave a nasty redness after removing it, the redness is still present even after 4 days, two hours after removing the patch he gets very emotional and demanding. The only MAJOR problem I have with the patch is the cost, I was recently laid off and now I have to pay well over $150.00 for a 30 day supply, taking the pill is just not right for him since he has major problems swallowing anything in pill form. I honestly think this drug is great and I will continue to give it to him no matter what the cost may be.

The patch in inobtrusive and is covered by boxers or swim trunks.  It's waterproof, but often comes off anyway.  All in all, been most satisfied with it.

My first doctor would not perscribe me with Daytrana, however, for reasons of his own, but after asking a new one, she was very eager after having had patients with amazing results.  Grades, attitude and lifestyle overall has improved from motivation to focus.  I am very happy with the effect this medication has had on me.

We had a good 1st month with it. He was focusing on work at school, following teachers directions, &amp; not being distracted. And much less hyper at home...it was a different child. But, after the 1st month, he started to go back to his old ways. Disrespect to teacher &amp; classmates, not following any directions at home or school, crazy-hyperactivity. He also lost a few lbs. I had difficultly removing the backing off the patch. I was not satisfied that we had to put it on him 2 hrs before school started. Also, it left a horrible red, irritated patch on his skin when it was removed at the end of the day. He also complained that it itched alot. He told me himself that he thought it was no longer working and we needed to go back to the Dr. So, we have chg'd his med's and Vyvanse is the &quot;drug of choice.&quot; Pray that it works...I may lose my mind if not!!  
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	3	Male	25-34	11/26/2008 12:59:35 PM	It feels like I have taken almost everything out there in the sun for my ADHD.  I am 27 years old and have an active lifestyle, meaning...working out, etc and also working about 60 hours a week.  After taking it for 3 months, I have discontinued Daytrona, for a couple of reasons...slight mood swings, but for the most part, it just didnt feel right.Another negative that I can say about Daytrona is those patches got to be painful at sight application many days after, which my doctor said what might help (but didnt try) was to spray nasal decongestant, benadryl, or any antahistamine to reduce irratation.)Here is what I did like, which is one of the most important factor to me....Out of all the medications that I have taken, Daytrona was by far one of the most consistant medications that I have taken...meaning I didnt see the dips or rollercoaster feelings that I have experienced with other medications.  Also, since this medication is transdermal, none I think is processed by the liver, so any break for my liver is good.  This might sound weird, but the reason why I discontinued isnt really anything more than a &quot;didnt feel right&quot; sensation that I cant really described.I hope this helps someone.BTW, if you are interested in what meds I have taken, here they are:Adderall XR, Adderall Tablets, Concerta, Metadate, Ritalin XR, Ritalin Tablets, Vvyanse, amphetamine salt combo, and dexadrine.

The patch ahs been great! It does leave a red spot, but he handles it well and for a while there were issues with the backing not comming off. I've found that keeping them in a cool place helps this as warmth seems to make it harder to get the back off. I am thankful for this option and hopefully he'll use it for long enough until he can swallow pilss or not need it...

When it is working she has no emotion, always looks sad. The patch leaves a bright red rectangle on her skin, and when the meds are wearing off, she seems to have a rebound effect...she is angry and very moody.

Either way, once I remove the patch, the site is similiar to a raised hive and remains for several days. The aggravation has increased and I plan to discontinue.
Other	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	13-18	10/1/2008 2:00:16 PM	I started using Daytrana about 8 months ago and once I was on the correct dose, it was amazing. I have a combination of ADD (non-hyperactive) and depression and this has treated both. I had not noticed any signs of either condition until a few years ago when I became depressed and my grades dropped tremendously. The Daytrana has helped me concentrate and actually remember what I have learned in school. It also improves my mood and makes me feel like the person I know that I am, not the depressed shell that I had become. This is especially great because I can't swallow pills. The only draw back is that my mom has to wake me up two hours earlier to put it on. I go back to sleep after she puts it on me and it's working when I wake up. Other than the two hours until it works, it really is like a wonderdrug.

We started on the Dayrtana patch last year during school.  We love it.  It does leave a red place which our doctor told us to wipe gently with pure Olive Oil.  This gets all the sticky stuff off.  We love the ease of the patch and also not having to take medicine at school.  As you know other kids can sometimes be cruel and this eliminates that.  I put it on him at 6:30 am so it will kick in by school time and it last even 2 hours after it is taken off.  I feel like I can handle the mornings to give him the comfort of no medicine at school and the was it helps him.  We actually had honor roll last year in 6th grade and so far this school year we have all A's.  To us it is just what we were looking for to help us throught this time.

He has better self-esteem and can interact easier with friends.  The on ly draw back is the 2 hours before it begins to work.  I put it on as soon as he gets up so it is working by the time he gets to school, but the mornings in  out house are a constant struggle.  To make life more difficult- I have also been diagnosed with ADHD.

Although it has greatly improved my focus, I decided to stop taking the medication because it makes me feel depressed. And I have absolutley no history of depression.

I like the patch, I have to do a pill booster in the mornings. I use cortisone OINTMENT at night -- The oil in the ointment take the glue off the skin and the ointment stays on longer. As for making the patch stick -- Put your hand over the patch for a few minutes and the warm of hand will make it stick. I have a 9 and 13 yr that also use the patch -- It works for us!

I have to tape it to his arm to keep it on.  I can leave it on for only 5-6 hours or he gets a red burning rash.  So I have to put it in another place each day. Adderal  made my son angry all the time.  If we can tolerate this inconveinience of the patch,  it may be the best choice so far.

He's 125 lbs. I have noticed a HUGE difference w/ his mood, as before on Adderall he was a monster! The pills made him so mean, and when not taking them for a day, he was happy, sweet, but impulsive and too hyper. I know it is the meds. making him this way! With the patch now for a week, he is so much more happy, and no violent mood swings yet. The patch does make him itchy. I will try hydrocortisone at night. One of his hips he will not let me put the patch (too itchy when on) and between his shoulder blades is out (too itchy) so now we are using 1 hip, and moving it around to new areas on same side. All this trouble is still better than the pills! He has also taken Vyvanse (horrible side effects- very sleepy,lethargic, &amp; angry) and most recently Adderall (never again)Right now the patch is the best for him. Also I bought a box of alcohol wipe pads from Walgreens (very cheap) and wipe his skin with 1 before and when I take a patch off. Really helps!

We still battle every morning over the patch.  The patch site(s) are always red and itchy.  We do apply hydrocortisone cream at night, this helps a bit.  Started on 10mg, currently on 20mg.  Some nice improvement at school with Daytrana. Meds pretty wear off by end of activity/homework time. Seems like effectiveness wears off after about 6-7 months for him.  No probs with diet or sleep. Not sure if he will stay on patch, son has recently shown ability to swallow a pill.

I tested so high, my Dr was amazed I graduated college.  I am disabled, and have had aprrox 80% of my intestines removed, so I can barely absorb medications, esp in pill form.  Daytrana has been the most effective med I have found for my ADD.  However, I have run into 2 major issues.  First, I have found that the longer I have been on the patch (30 mg for 18 months), it has become less effective as my tolerance has built up to the med.  Secondly, almost every box I get contains at least 10 patches that are unusable due to the medicine coming off by sticking to the backing.  I know there have been several recalls, but I still keep running into this problem, which causes me to request a new prescription early.  This raises the ? of whether or not I am abusing the patches, i.e. using more than 1 per day, which I am definitely not.  Being an adult, my Dr seemed wary with my claim of lessening effectiveness over time combined w/the adhesive problems.  Should there be any other adults out there experiencing this same problem, I suggest the following: Go to the Shire website as well as other reviews of Daytrana that describe problems w/the backing and print them out.  Also, if you don't use the time on/off card attached to the box, start and mark the days where you could not use a patch and had to open and use another one.  Make sure you constantly report problems to your pharmacist so they will know you are having problems.  A lot of Docs these days are overcautious when prescribing controlled meds over fear of addiction and malpractice claims.  Keeping these records and alerting your pharmacy will help you alleviate those fears. This is an excellent med and can really help adults w/ADD.  However, if you are abusing this med and use these tips in furtherance of your abuse, you are doing so at the risk of dangerous consequences to both yourself, as well as hurting we who have benefited from Daytrana.

While her grades have improved from Ds to Bs, we have very intense and difficult times in the mornings and about 2 hours after the patch comes off.  She can be violent, says extremely terrible and hurtful things and is very mean to our dog.  We also have a lot of problems with the adhesive and recently had to call 7 pharmacies to find one that had Daytrana in stock.  Apparently most of the stock was recalled, I assume for adhesive issue and not a medical problem.

I liked the adderall but I was losing to much weight. The short acting meds can really affect your appetite because you are taking them to many times a day.  I like the daytrana.  My appetite is normal. I do not like the rash or the itchy skin.  I am taking 15 mg patch.  It really is the best so far.  The vyvanse made me feel sedated.
Other	MOM OF  SWEET BOY, 7-12 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	4	3	4	Male	7-12	3/4/2008 4:41:09 PM	My son (now 11 yrs. old) has been on the patch  for about 8 months.  Initially dosage was too high @ 20 mg. He had after affects when the patch was off - but was ok otherwise.  He then went on 15 mg. and is great at school, w/no affects after patch taken off. Initially, had problems with rash and itching but did decrease in intensity and soon stop being bothersome.  He enjoys taking off the patch after - his job. He knows and acknowledges he is doing better in school this year, because of the patch and will remind us if we don't take care of putting it on right away in the a.m. even on weekends. My main concern has been decrease in appetite which has caused him to lose weight - dr. not concerned at this time because he's gone from size husky to regular and a few brands need slim. We will be keeping an eye on his growth and weight though. Within an hour of patch off, he will then eat continuously until bedtime!  Fortunately, we have not had any sleeping issues.  He sleeps and hours and has regular schedule.  The Daytrana patch is our one and only med. because he has a very touchy gag reflex and pills are out the the question for him.

This worked so much better than the others (and we've tried them all).  She has anxiety disorder and this makes it worse.  She has the &quot;ritalin effect&quot; in that she sits and picks at her skin.  Her personality is the same on as off, except she's more focused and less hyper on it.  The worse side effects are sleeplessness and no appetite.  We give her Melatonin supplements to help her fall asleep and she's on a high calorie diet (she also has sensory problems so she's very sensitive about food to begin with).  Sometimes the backing is difficult to get off the patch and I do have to use medical tape to keep it from peeling off, mostly to be insurance that she won't take it off.  I notice that she talks in circles - repeats herself mid-sentence, and is very hard to follow in conversation while on the meds. I'm only satisfied with this medication because the others we've tried made her aggressive and emotional.  Otherwise, there isn't any medication which helps her without a drawback.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/13/2008 12:22:24 AM	My 6 year old daughter has always been &quot;active&quot;. She was constantly getting in trouble at school and on the bus, but her PCP wouldn't do anything. So when we finally got a referal to a child psychiatrist I was ecstatic! It took the Dr ten minutes to diagnose her. She could not stop fidgeting or talking or moving the whole time. HE told us that b/c of her age he was going to put her on the patch. It would be easier for her and she wouldn't have to swallow a pill. My daughter loves it!!! The first day she came home from school she sat down and looked at while she was talking to me. She told me everything that went and that her medicine made her smarter b/c she could go to one place at a time instead of going everywhere at once. I am so glad he chose this medicaine b/c although I knew she needed something, I didnt want her to be a zombie. My girl is still going, and going strong, but she's more focused and can actually get more accomplished.

My son was struggling in school. Not because he was not trying but because he said it is getting so hard. My teacher goes so fast.He has always been the kid who other kids like to be around fun/sweet.  He was the kid other parents wanted to have over because of his manners. When the doctor said he has adhd try this patch I just didn't think it would work.  To my surprise we put the patch on a Saturday morning. We waited 1 hour to start homework.  My husband and I were astonished. We have never been able to read his writing.  We could read it.  We tried some of his 5th grade math problems.  My husband and I cried.  The kid could do math. What we like most is when he needs it we put it on when he is finished w/ school he takes it off. The teacher said she has seen other kids on ADHD medication and they seem more up and down during the day.  I love the way it works.  He started to have skin issues it itched.  Again I went to the DR and said what do we do it works but I don't want it burning a hole in his skin.  He said we needed to keep skin moist all the time esp winter.  We stuck with it and I am so happy.His skin got used to the patch and he has been on it a year and he now asks to wear it for baskeball games because he says it helps.  I will tell you it is a lot more work than a pill but we have seen no side effects besides the skin but good grades and confidence. It is more expensive but evenings at our house are so much better we feel like we are paying more but getting a better quality of life for all of us.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	mommytotwo,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female		1/13/2008 5:31:19 AM	My 12 year old son has a very difficult time swallowing pills.  We would struggle taking Adderall every morning.  9 times our of 10 we would fail in getting the medicine down him, thus resulting in poor performance at school, home and generally with life. He was diagnosed with ADHD when he was almost 11, and it's been a very long journey trying to figure out how to get him to swallow the pills.  We tried applesauce, jello, pudding, juice, pretty much everything to disguise the pill.  Recently, our pediatrician suggested the patch, Daytrana, and we absolutely love it!!  The first few days were a huge improvement for my son.  He feels better overall, still has his appetite, and most important he feel's like he's in control of himself. He has the ability to focus when he is using the patch.  My son really likes the ease of the patch, and not having to strugle over taking pills.  It's a bit difficult in removing, however it's nothing compared to being able to live a normal life.

This is the best ADHD medicine he has ever used.  My son made the A/B Honor Roll this year. He has been on the patch for 2yrs now, and he has exceled in school the past two years.  The Daytrana treats his ADHD, but it also allows him to keep his appetite.  The other medicines did not give him this option.  I recommend Daytrana to everyone.  My son was diagnosed when he was four, he is now nine and this has been the best medicine he has been on.  He has tried 6 different types and this is the only one that has the best results for him.

The adhesive does stay on the skin and it can take a week or so to get off i dont mind it at all.I can tell when i miss a day, i become really irritated and cranky. Other then that i recommend this to anyone that hates pills.I saw a diffrence within the first 3 days.

This drug was my last hope since my son who was 6 refused to try any more pills. This drug improved all his problems including his aggretion and violent issues. he's been on it for 1 1/2 year with great results and some small side effects. like irrated skin which was easily treated. we feed him healthy large meals for breakfast and dinner because he losses his hunger when patch is on. my son was to young at first to understand why he was being medicated, but when he started with daytrana he told me how the patch makes him a &quot;happy boy&quot; and how being bryce(his name) was easier now. Only downfall is after a year of usage we've had to increase his dosage and it takes twice as long to kick in (around 60 to 45 minutes)now. this medicine gave me a son i never knew i had and has made my family's life much easier. He had been kicked out of 4 daycare/schools now he's in 1st grade with excellent grades and he's even his teachers favorite student.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Male	35-44	11/9/2007 7:25:13 PM	the great thing about this (as an adult with adhd) is put it on once and it lasts all day - no bottles of pills to pop all day.  Also it is a constant rate of delivery eliminating the annoying ups and downs with immediate duration meds.  third bypassing intestinal system means less variability over food eaten.  Well it sounds good in theory.I find it works, but less constantly than theory would suggest.  3 hour lag before initial dose works, 3 hours before bed remove patch or you will be up all night.  patch is flimsy and rips when attempting to put it on.  not as effective as focalin instant release.however it's effective enough, it keeps me in a balance over the day rather than up and down, no pills to carry and lose, etcI feel the biggest thing is the smoothing of the ups and downs experienced with 3 hour ritalin; and the lack of food (esp fatty food) delaying onset of next dose.I've been on it a week and am going to try it for at least a month before deciding; but I really hope i can get more predictability and constant effect as time goes on.

I took him of and called his doctor when he scrawled 'KILL' on my bathroom mirror. He is normally NOT agressive  I did not see a huge improvement in his ADD symptoms.

I have been extreemly satisfied, and think that this product is a life saver.  For the passed 3 yrs I have been experimenting with a lot of the ADHD meds out there, and have had no success. I recently decided that as a last resort I would try Daytrana, my other option was going to be quit the ADHD meds all together. This one is the only medication that I can control how long I need it, have no apitite loss, and have experienced No negitive side effects! i am 17 and in high school and have every intension of using this product on into collage!
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	10/9/2007 12:48:41 PM	my son was perscribed this med, and after about 30 days, once fully in his system, he became extremley violent and physically attacking me and siblings....i have discontinued use and with-in 60 days of dis-continuing use his violence abated...although easy to use and it DID work on his ADHD problems....the violence was so out of character and extremely damaging...one more outburst and would have dialled 911 (my son is 8).....never again will i medicate him for ADHD...the outcome and possibility of permanent damage is too great!  I advise anyone who is using this to document all behaviour every day and as soon as you ebgin to see escalation i would call the MD and STOP meds!!  This could have been deadly for his little sister and has left me with bruises and emotional scars no mother who just wants to help her son should have to deal with...worse, my son has never forgiven himself, even though we have and told him we have....too much burden for an 8 year old!

Compliance has been an issue, as has rapid weight loss (10 lbs in the first 2 months) and decreased growth (less than 3/4 inch in a year).  The drug is nice in that the patch can be taken off right after school, and used for a few hours a day on the weekend, thus increasing the time his appetite is normal.
