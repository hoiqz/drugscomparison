So through trial and error I found that breaking it in half and taking it a bit more often works fine for me.

Other	None, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	6/29/2009 1:02:54 PM	This was prescribed for me because I was getting dizzy, and sometimes falling or walking into walls.  I took this for about 2 weeks and quit it.  I felt like I had narcolepsy, and would close my eyes and fall asleep anytime.  What made it really bad, and the main reason I quit taking it was I would struggle to stay  awake while driving.. It did not help with the dizziness at all, in fact it made the dizziness worse. I was missing steps and falling down,

Sensation of Spinning or Whirling	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	19-24	5/7/2009 11:55:03 AM	My Dr. gave me this for a virus I have in my ears that cause my equalibrium to be off...causing me to be dizzy and nauseous. I took it today (Thursday) for the first time. It's made me even worse. Maybe it's just my ear acting up again because it's hurting, but I haven't felt this dizzy yet.

The actual first dose seemed to take a while to 'kick' in, but I think I have found that if I go ahead and take it regularly (mine dosage is 1 tablet every 8 hrs.  It's been great to relieve the symptoms.

A few weeks ago I had another attack and was given 25mg pills which stopped the nausea, vomiting and most of the spinning sensation within 6 hours. I thought that was very effective.
