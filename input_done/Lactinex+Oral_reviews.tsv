The minute I feel one coming on I take some.  If I take it at night usually the beginning of the cold sore is gone by the next morning.  You have to ask the pharmacist to look in their refrigerator.  Been taking it for years.  Miracle med!

About one a year, my young son gets a fever blister.  Now, when he starts to feel the onset of one, the very early onset, I can give him this medicine and the fever blister never comes out, it never even gets red.  It stops it in its tracks immediately.

Other	65-74 Female 	4	5	5	Female	65-74	12/3/2007 9:59:29 AM	A musician told me a long time ago about using Lactinex tablets to fight cold sores.  It has proven very effective, especially if taken at the first sign of a cold sore.  The tablets seem to be more effective than the granules.

I went and got something that had it in there Lactinex I take the pills and granules everytime I'm sick and gave to my kids. So far we haven't had any serious colds. the worst that happens is I get all this thick mucus and spit it all out. Common sense made me think if you digestive track can take a pill and get affects from it, or if you eat something bad and it affects you. Then why not take positive bacteria and let it fight the bad stuff in you. You notice how a cold starts at the top of your mouth and then slowly works its way down to being swallowed and then after that you feel all like you got the flu or a serious cold. Every since I thought of that I spit out all flem and blow my nose. I say out is better. The old ppl always say you are what you eat. So until someone says its bad to take I will still take it. Cause I had a Pharmacist and ppl say oh that doesn't work ya  okay I'm not getting sick so you tell me why??????
