Herpes Infection of Brain and Surrounding Tissue	Venus2000, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	6/13/2012 6:40:37 PM	I suffered for over a year before I experienced some relief. I can't even describe how sick and helpless, I was.My condition was somewhat rare, and the Drs. prescribed so much diuretics (to deal w/fluid retention in my middle ear), I got very ill w/stomach and intestines ulcers. I travel over seas (where they sell Acyclovir w/o prescription) and bought it over the counter. I asked the pharmacist how to use it. I bought a 15 days 400mg AM and 400 mg PM treatment the first time.I experienced relief within  a few days after starting the treatment. But because Drs. here in US didn't want to prescribe me, this virus became very strong and I had to medicate myself starting from an extremely high dose of Valtrex 3000mg a day, then gradualy I droped the dose as I was getting better and better. It took me about 3 years to get to todays dose.As of today I still take 200 mg AM and 200 mg PM of Acyclovir.  I feel very well. I don't know if there will be a point on time where I'll be able to stop completely, but even if I can't, I am a successful user, and compare to how I was before, I wouldn't mind if I had to take this medicine for ever.

If I had to repeat another treatment with the same med., I will gladly do it, because it deliver it's promise. It would be great if some how the treatment instead of 5x per day can become maybe 1 0r 2x per day at the most. Any of ways, thank you.

Shingles	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	65-74	4/17/2012 11:34:17 AM	I have taken this drug for seven days now and , of course, the number of pills required daily seems excessive. My insurance would not pay for the more expessive alternative. I am clearing up rather well. I have been told that one may acquire the vaccination for shingles after having a bout of it. I have been told two different amounts of time which must ensue after the case has cleared up. Guess I shall consult a doctor or pharmacist about that. I keep track of my pills by simply placing the daily amount in the lid of the container ...That works for me. At least they are not offensive in taste or smell.Good luck to all on this regimen.

Genital Herpes	Breezy89, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/16/2012 8:54:21 PM	A few days after new years I found out I have genital herpes. It was very devastating to me. I have gone a year with unprotected sex with my fiance and a day after new years I had an outbreak that I thought was a bad case of a yeast infection. Both of us were tested and I am the only one carrying the virus. Knowing now that my ex before my fiance had cheated on me and I know now how I got this. How I went a year without an outbreak with my fiance has been beyond me. who knows how long i have been caring this virus. My doctor had prescribed me the medicine and it has worked well and today was my last day of a 3 times a day for 10 days dose.  Im still very heart broken about this new part of my left for starting a new year but reading reviews and knowing im not alone in  this has been comforting.  The support of my fiance has been more great for my feelings. he is sad too about this but said we would get through it together and i know that is a life long happiness for me.

Thankfully your comments have made me feel better and I know i'm not alone.

My outbreaks have been very inconsistent with area of outbreaks/rashes from my buttock to lower back to head and the last two on my upper lip and side of face. The first couple of times the medication seemed to work pretty well but about the last three times the side effects have been horrendous. Although the Acyclovir and Vicodin alleviate the pain pretty well, I have had the most horrible diarrhea for 6 straight days now even after stopping the 2 meds 2 days ago. The last episode  the diarrhea lasted 5 days and the time before that, just 3 or 4 days. And this diarrhea is very intense and unpredictable! And very foul! VERY FOUL! and very uncomfortable.

Over the years I have been on several different drugs, I have out breaks several times a year now. THis last one to the point I can't function. I have not had side affects from the drug but taking 800mg five times a day and not getting better is irritating....
Genital Herpes	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	3	2	Female	35-44	8/3/2011 7:07:55 PM	I started taking this medication and within 2 months my hair started falling out. I have stopped taking it immediately and now it will be a waiting game to see if I lose more hair. Unfortunately going bald is not an option for me. I was using as a suppressive therapy 400 mg a day. This is apparently a rare side effect, but I wanted to let people know that it does happen. I had not made any new changes in my lifestyle and had never experienced hair loss before, so I am SURE it was due to the Acyclovir. Other than the hair loss everything was going well. I am so sad!

I try and exercise as much as possible, eat right (but I slip with the diet every once in a while!) and really try and stay relaxed. I also take acyclovir 200mg 2 times a day because my job is a bit stressful. I went without for awhile as my first outbreak was not painful at all and not very severe. I have had one additional outbreak that was very small and nonpainful when I was not taking acyclovir for an extended period of time and was also going through alot of stress at the time.

I have learned to live and cope with this disease and continue with my everyday routine. I still have my moments where I get upset, but it is a price I have to pay for my carelessness. Acyclovir actually works better for me than Valtrex; plus way more cheaper.
Recurrent Genital Herpes	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	6/4/2011 2:42:29 AM	Acyclovir works, but treating this involves way more than just taking the pills.  You need to rinse a lot, use less soap, gentler soap, instead of more soap.  I never used pads before getting herpes, but now need them for the cushioning aspect.  I take ibuprofen for this, too.  Maybe this med is why I've been more tired.  Add all that on top of the emotional upheaval, and it's not pleasant.

Blisters are very painful at first, could barely walk.  Med started working after 2-3 doses, but too many outbreaks made my doctor prescribe daily use, which I'll be starting after this outbreak is over. Any comments on daily use?  Some people are paying too much.  Look for discounts on 200 mg, if your scrip is for 400mg.

I was devastated to have the virus, especially since he never experienced a genital outbreak (and the fact he broke up with me right after). With this drug, however, things don't seem as hopeless as they did. I've only had two outbreaks in three years and this tends to work within the first few days.

We lost our virginity together, waited over a year to actually become sexually active then being together for over 2 years..I started having symptoms. He cheated on me and gave me this lifelong disease. I thought my life was over. But I was prescribed this drug and this treatment is great! I have only had like 3 outbreaks in five years of being on it. And they havent been bad at all very little pain but goes away after a couple of days. I definitely recommend it.

Shingles	thatguy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	25-34	1/7/2011 2:26:38 AM	I found a rash on abdomen last week, which developed into painful blisters. I went to the doctor Wednesday and I learned it was Shingles. The acyclovir has not done much yet, and I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how long it may take to see results. I feel the rash has become worse since starting the medication. I'm not sure why I got it, but I have no other systems and I had no systems before the rash appeared. Very confused.
Shingles	I CARE R.N., 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1		45-54	1/3/2011 12:50:21 PM	My personal experience with Acyclovir, given systemically, is that it has little effect on herpes zoster (shingles) with CN V1 involvement, specifically for corneal herpetic lesions except that is MAY shorten duration by a few hours!  BUT, this is NOT to say that one should not try it for herpes simplex virus.  Better still, ZIRGAN (ganciclovir ophthalmic get) 0.15% has been used in Europe with great success in resolution of dendritic ulcers and is now available in the U.S.

Genital Herpes	frustrated, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	11/26/2010 4:09:38 AM	im in canada and i just picked up this medication today and it cost me 125 $ for 60 pills which i think is very very expensive, and that apparently is only the generic brand, i only get outbreak once or twice a year, but since i got pregnant i already had 3 which is really bad because now in pregnancy it takes forever to heal, wheter using topic Lysine cream or Abreva or not. im hoping this medication prevents another outbreak, im really worry not to contract it to our baby which is due in 6 weeks. my ex boyfriend never got it from me in 6 years relationship and never even knew i had, but the horrible random man who gave it to me, should have his penis cut off, because he literally raped me at 17 years old when he locked me out in his room, i met him at the bar that same night. NEVER EVER i went to have sex with anyone after that just randomly like that, you never know what you bring home afterwards.

Please tell me there's medication that I can take once a day and is just as effective. Also not as expensive 90 dollars with nj healtv insurance is alot and so is 116 dollars total sub the lidocine for the outbreak.

Shingles	serenelady, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	55-64	9/14/2010 11:26:13 PM	My doctor and I selected Acyclovir over another antiviral because it was less expensive.  However, it had to be taken every 4 hours.  So, I used a 7 day pill box and stuck tape on each lid.  I entered the time I took the dose and on the next lid, I entered the time it was due to be taken next.  This helped me keep on track with the recommended dosing.  Especially since managing the pain meant alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen with a little percocette here and there, mostly at night.  4 days into treatment, the nagging, endless pain let up and I was able to sleep much better and take less pain medication.

And not one out break of oral herpes in that time.  Before this, the break outs were every few weeks and very painful and my lips looks like they went through a meet grinder, lol.  My question is; I'm I suppose to keep taking this drug the rest of my life or stop, and when an out break starts to tingle, start taking again?  I'm with a new doctor and he is confused as to why I keep taking this drug everyday without symptoms?  I'm I doing the right thing?  Thank you.

The rash was on my left shoulder with some spreading to my back and under my left ear. I had pain in my left shoulder and the first rash appeared on the same day I had a Dr's appointment. He diagnosed it as shingles and prescribed acyclovir 800mg 3 x daily alond with a desoximetasone cream to be applied 3 x daily. The rash appears to be healing, very little itching but very sharp shooting pains in various parts of my body which is always around an area when the skin feels like it is on fire. I will see the Dr. tomorrow morning for a progress report. I search here for side effects and found nothing similar to what I am experiencing. diarrhea and soft stool.

I'm really hoping i'm not going to grow an extra head at 70 lol !

When I refilled, however, I found out it was no longer available in generic.  Within 1wk of starting the &quot;real&quot; Valtrex, I had a horrible outbreak unlike anything I've experienced in 20 years and the related pelvic pain is still around 3mos later!  I'm going BACK ON ACYCLOVIR even tho my pharmacy says it's extremely difficult to find these days.

He did not say what virus it was but he ordered an MRI of my ears and brain that turned out to be normal.  I have been on the med for  nine days 3x daily. It has not helped me hear any better. The side effects I've been experiencing are  fatigue,  exceptionally stinky gas, diarrhea, headaches, depressed mood, irritable mood, stiff joints, sun sensitivity (sun burn) and TMJ.

Genital Herpes	happycamper, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	5/4/2010 7:35:34 AM	I've had Herpes for 5 years and although I found the Acyclovir Oral treatment reduces the length of a breakout and the severity,I was still getting attacks pretty much everytime I was due a period. However, I started taking L Lysine as soon as I got the dreaded familiar tingle;it's an amino acid,cheap in Holland &amp; Barretts. It stopped the breakout in it's tracks! I took it for a few months each time I felt an attack coming and I haven't had an outbreak now for well over 12 months! Look it up people,my GP never mentioned this as a treatment,and even the GUM clinic I went to initially never mentioned it. Much cheaper than a presciption,no side effects and it works! I thought I'd be plagued forever but you needn't suffer,hoorah!!

Cold Sore	HateColdSores, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	35-44	4/20/2010 5:58:38 AM	Though it did help with the cold sore, I started feeling dizzy and nauseous within hours from taking the first dose. I ended up having to discontinue use after a few doses because I felt too dizzy. But it did reduce the severity of the cold sore just from those few doses. So all-in-all, it is effective, but like any prescription medication, should be taken with caution.

Genital Herpes	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	3/15/2010 2:40:51 PM	I contracted the virus from my girlfriend who has had hsv 1 for about 3 years now. We have been dating for 1 year and 3 months and she has never had any signs or symptoms in neither her face or genital area. I had my first out break 4 days ago and I considered it mild and pain free. I started taking acyclovir 800mg once a day and also denavir 1% ointment for 4 day now and I have noticed the blisters going away. My doctor told me to now just keep taking my pill once a day. I hope I get lucky and dont ever have an outbreak ever again. Definitly wish I had a better resistance to the virus like my girlfriend who has been living with hsv 1 for 3 years and she has never taken any meds or treatments for it(Knock on wood) Lucky her. So for even more precaution I will use a condom with her and deffinitly no oral sex even though there appears to be no outbreaks on her. Lesson learned: If your partner has hsv 1 with no outbreaks, she can still pass it to you in your genitals by oral sex!! I am still with her and love her very much!!! 
Genital Herpes	karmadog, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	45-54	3/15/2010 11:33:44 AM	I used to take valtrex too.  it was great 1 500mg tablet a day to supress breakouts.  then ins made me switch to this.  a 200 mg. pill, I have been taking 1 a day for last 5 yrs, then decided to go to 1 every other day, cuz I was getting scared of what long term effects this could have. all was fine, 2 weeks ago I decided to stop it all together, well, I had a break out, I took this pill 2x a day, which would be 400mg.  I really don't know if it helped, as I like the cream for the sores and itching better.  Anway, I am going back to every other day.  Break outs do not last as long as they did when I first got it.  I was almost put in a hospital, I had a breakout for 1 whole month when i first got it.  then for that whole year I broke out every month.  horrible.  now, maybe 2xs a year.  not sure if that is because I am using it every other day or not.

I never want to give this to another, so began taking Acyclovir (400mg twice daily) about 1.5 years ago and have never had a recurrance.  The drug works perfectly and my doctor says it's completely safe to take regularly.  Insurance pays for it.
Cold Sore	nkrafter, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/7/2010 4:20:11 PM	I have been taking 400 mg twice a day for 30+ years for cold sore outbreaks. Previously I took increasing doses of LYSINE (non-pharma) until I was taking 10-12 at a time which would HELP to keep cold sore outbreaks at bay but then, I imagine, I built up immunity. Anyway, now with age I  am going to ask my doctor to increase dosage to 3 times a day because I feel my immuno is low.  I have been very happy with the outcome of this drug.

Started treatment within 1 full day of outbreak.  Has worked well on the sores and stopped the spread of the rash.  Has done nothing for the pain.

Shingles	AA, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	2/17/2010 10:39:56 AM	I first had Shingles when I was 13 years old. It was horrendous and I could not move for weeks. I was given no medication of pain relief. Since then, I have had numbness and very mild 'ghost pains'. Currently having an outbreak, pain and spots appeared about 5 days ago so got on the Aciclovar very quickly. This seems to have stopped the rash and I think its not so bad as I remember the last time. No side effects to speak of, although very tired and in a lot of pain. Hoping the antiviral will work.

I have it on my back, but I must say that my mother in-law had it in her eye and due to a wrong diagnosis lost her sight, and suffered tremendously.  I think anyone with it near their eye should follow the Dr's orders.

Shingles	Cindy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	1/11/2010 5:51:55 PM	First time with shingles caused from stress.  I have found this medicine to be effective and gentle.  My pain has diminished greatly and the sores have all but dried up.  I'm into day 5 of the 10 day routine.  I agree that 5x per day is a bit hard to keep up with, but I'm trying.  I just hope the pain continues to go away and doesn't return after the medication is gone!

Shingles	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	35-44	1/10/2010 1:08:30 PM	     Developed shingles at age 44, due to STRESS, mostly from my job.  Started at my chin on the left side and ran up the side of my face to left ear.  Acyclovir seemed to work and cleared up for the most part in around 7 days.  Did not like the 5x a day though.  Also used hydrocortizone cream and Tylenol.     The shingles hurt like heck and made me take my first sick days in 21 years at my job.  
Shingles	TJ, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	3	4	Female	45-54	12/14/2009 10:06:49 PM	I am down to one more day on this medication and hope the 10 days I have been taking it has done the job. My case was not severe and the sores are already going away. I still get a burning on the surface of the skin and it sometimes feels like something is crawing on me, but that is the nerve endings. Taking it 5 times a day has been a challenge but it appears to have worked. I have felt alittle tired and have had some diarrhea,and not hungry, but no nausea. I rarely take medications and am wondering if it hasn't given me a yeast infection, although nothing I have read says it will if taken a long period of time.

I am into day 3, they only side effects I noticed was being tired and my vision is a little blurry in one eye. I recommend drinking a lot of water with the RX. I am still itching and &amp; get sudden sharp pains in my back. Hopefully this will stop soon.Age 43, I never thought I would get it, but I guess stress can cause a multitude of things.
Recurrent Genital Herpes	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	45-54	12/3/2009 10:54:29 AM	I have been using this for about 2 years. I'm not a pill taker so sometimes I forget. BAD I take 400mg 2 times daily when I feel any simptoms which always seems to be  pre-menstral.It has worked well. A few side affects I have stomach pain, dizziness ,sore throat and lack of lubercation.  These simptoms are not frequent and could be just life. I have not had another outbreak since the very 1st and PAINFULL one. Stomach pain brought me too this sight and found out my dizziness/light head is a reaction too.
Shingles	recovering16, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	11/26/2009 10:21:52 AM	I haven't started it yet and am a bit wary.  I have what looks like herpes zoster (according to my doctor) on my back, and I have been under a LOT of stress lately, but one thing is the area has NO pain.  Just occasional itching.  I'm hesitant to take a pill 5 X a day that may potentially cause liver problems.  What to do?  P.S.  I tried to not rate it because I haven't started it yet (the Acyclovir) but it required rating (by stars) in order to post - so I did.
Genital Herpes	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	11/20/2009 7:16:16 PM	I was diagnosed with HSV2 nearly a decade ago and had fairly regular breakouts occurring once every couple of months.  Recently the frequency of outbreaks increased.  I had taken Valtrex in the past and found the headaches worse than the breakouts so I discontinued use.I occasionally get a mild headache from this medication but can state that after two months of daily suppressive doses (400 twice daily) I have been breakout free.  The side effects are so insignificant that I plan to remain on the suppressive therapy into the unforeseeable future.
Other	Ms.Somebody, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	11/4/2009 12:21:21 PM	When I found out that I had HSV 1 I thought I was going to die. I wanted to kill the person who done this to me. Its ashame people pass this around knowing they have it. But I realize that things happens for a reason and this is just a lesson I had to learn in life. God knows each and everyone of our lives and how it was going to turn out. We just have to wait and see. We all need to learn from our mistakes and protect ourselves and to respect other and not pass it on. This is causing me not to eat drink or sleep, The pain is very hurtful. I just would like for it to go away. The meds are working great so far.. :) I havent forgave this person yet but in due time I will.... God says you can forgive but never forget. So when I get a lil better and calm down I will call and forgive him... To all who have this your life isnt over and one day it will be a cure for this. Just prey thats the cure.. PREY PREY PREY.... GOD IS LISTENING.... Take care.... :) 
Genital Herpes	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/29/2009 1:08:10 AM	about 2 yrs ago unfortunatly a very disrespectful man passed along this wonderous disease to me. KNOWINGLY. I thought my life was over... Fortunatly this medicine works great for me. My outbreaks are few and far between but when I do need it it works. Now that I am pregnant I have been put on it during the last few weeks as a precaution. I have been very nervous to take it during pregancy...but I have'nt heard of negative side effects during pregnancy so far. Overall this medicine works just fine. I have only had one negative side effect and that was a headache the first day I started this past time. Nothing to keep me from taking it again. I am on 400 mg 3xs a day. Dont worry your not alone. The man who knowingly did this to me will have his day. Life goes on and someone will love you!

Shingles	lee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	10/25/2009 4:28:00 PM	Have been taking a high dose (800mg 5 times a day) for a week for Shingles outbreak.  Seems to have kept it under control and keeping symptoms mild. Starting this med as soon as possible was very important and keeping to a regular doseage schedule.  Hardly any noticeable side effects - just tired but that could be from the illness. 
Shingles	JD, 75 or over Female  (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female		10/19/2009 10:53:30 AM	I am 83 and dealing with shingles.  I am taking this generic because I would have paid $261 for the brand name...this cost me $11.37.  Isn't that ridiculous!  It is very inconvenient to take it 5 times a day but I guess that is the price you &quot;don't &quot; pay for a generic.  It has helped me.  I don't have much itching but my entire trunk area is sore  on the inside as if I had them there rather than outside on my skin.  I think this medicine has decreased the spread of the blisters.

I had heard of it, but didn't know what they were exactly. I have never had anything so painful and intense. I am broke out on my right side, and couldn't sleep or stay asleep if I was lucky enough to get to sleep. I have been on this medication for 4 days. I haven't had any side effects and rash has quit spreading, swelling has gone down drastically, but itching is a still there with a vengence!!! The nerves are still extremely tender around sight, but the bruised feeling has lessened. I feel like just sleeping thru this crap...! This medication seems to be working alot, but this 5x a day isn't working for me. I end up missing one. If this is a mandatory 5x a day crap, why not increase doseage in each pill. I do good to take a pill 3x a day, let alone 5x.

Been on Acyclovir for about 8 months and have been outbreak free the entire time.  I've had the itchy/tingly sensation once since being on it, but just doubled up the dosage for a few days and was able to avoid a full outbreak.  I take 400mg daily with no noticeable side effects.

Shingles	2young4shingles, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	8/31/2009 2:48:31 PM	Medicine has worked very well with my severe case of shingles.  Itching and burning sensations decreased tremendously within 2 days of taking Acyclovir b/c it quickly began to dry up the sores. I'm taking the pill 5 times a day, which seems a bit overkill (I'm ready to be done with it!), but it's an aggressive treatment that is working.  I'm taking a separate pain medication (Tylenol-3), which I'm now only taking at night - I awake often in pain.  Not too many unpleasant side effects from Acyclovir - have noticed a litle bit of dizziness &amp; nausea, slight loss of appetite, and constipation.  However, these side effects from the medicine is much more tolerable than shingles!  I'm still shocked that I have shingles - I'm only 26 years old!  
Genital Herpes	james peterson, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/27/2009 12:48:38 PM	When I was told that I had Herpes HSV 1 I thought that I was going to die soon but later my doctor put me on Acyclovir things seem to turn out better. At the end of the day life must go on since I have a wife and 2 kids to look after. I am sure that one day there will be a cure for this. life style has to change for the better just that at times we end up doing something stupid like getting infected. Now I have the rest of my life to stay smart and hope for a cure or less pain and stress. Thank god for the WWW and web sites such as this to shed some light on me who was lost in the dark. Keep doing what you do best a lot of lost folks out here depend on you all.

Genital Herpes	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/29/2009 11:37:25 PM	I recently discovered I had HSV2.  A total surprise since NO DOCTOR had ever told me I had it. I believe this was encountered 20 years ago.  My current doc put me on 200mg of Acyclovir 1 cap 4 time a day.  After getting the meds that night (only taking one pill) I ended up in the ER the next morning by 9:30am. I had the MOST SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION to it. Unable to swallow, speak and trouble breathing. The ER doc told me he had never seen anything like it and from this drug.  I am fine now but at a loss because since this was SUCH A SEVERE REACTION, my docs do not want to try any of the associated drugs in its family.  SO I cant praise Acyclovir, but I am hoping and praying that there is something out there to help my case.  My outbreaks are plentyfull after my monthly cycle and take for ever to heal. This is such a bummer cause I recently got involved with a new guy.  REALLY LIKE HIM TOO!!  Hope the drug continues to help others, but I thought it should be known that my type of reaction can happen.  Hope this keeps everyone aware and safe.

It caused vomiting, dizziness and the feeling that I had the flu. I cut my dosage down drastically from what was prescribed because I could not leave the house for work,etc. 800 MG 5X a day, too much for me.

If I would have started this at the first sign of my break out ( which was burning when I passed gas- I ate a lot of jalepeno's the day before) I would not have gotten herpes as bad as I had. My groin was infected and my lymph nodes VERY swollen by the time I went to the Dr. I was in terrible pain ,itching and burning in my rectum.  I though I had hemorrhoids. I was better within 24 hours thanks to this medication. Please don't wait to start taking this medication.  Take it at the first sign of any burning or itching.

I used valtrex as a suppression therapy but insurance will only cover acyclovir. I have been using this for almost a year now but haven't had an outbreak for about 3-4 years. The first was so terrible! The pain was unbearable. Yes, suppression therapy works and this drug is great!
Shingles	sufferinsilence, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	5/30/2009 9:49:14 PM	I began my first experience with shingles in February 2009; it was not diagnosed as such until I began a high fever in May, feeling like I was coming down with the flu, and continuing with the three month old massive rash on my chest, up to my chin, and around the back of my neck.The Dr prescribed Acyclovir 800mg tabs (1 pill), 5 times a day...after purchasing the first 30, and not being able to swallow them, (or return them) the prescription was changed to 200mg gel caps - again, 800mg (4 pills now), 5 times a day. Today is my fourth day...Nausea set in within the first 12 hours - diarrhea struck today - the rash returned with a vengeance in the first 36 hours, when I did not get up in the night to take more meds; a seven hour gap.Needless to say - I wish I could afford the more expensive (effective/non-generic)meds, but, as a senior without any medical insurance, life will be better shorter than longer now! It's a crying shame when one has to pay to take drugs, and then get more ill! in an effort to regain health - which is NOT looking very likely to be happening soon in my case.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON GENERIC MEDS, if you have any way to avoid them!

Cold Sore	Mina001, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/15/2009 6:15:56 PM	I had scarlet fever as a child as was told that my cold sores came from this.  Not too mention the sun and any time my lips would chap I would feel the &quot;ping&quot;.  People that have cold sores know what I am talking about.  I tried zinc, lysine, blistex, carmex, you name it and nothing worked.  I was so miserable.  Then my gynecologist suggested Zovirax/Acyclovir (generic) 200mg taken 4- 5 times a day when I had an outbreak.  I was so anxious to have any help that I eagerly agreed to try this drug.  It worked miracles for me.  I was on Zovirax sporadically until I got pregnant and my OB/GYN made me get off the medicine because of little known long term use and its possible effects to an unborn fetus.  Well, during my pregnancy I began to have out breaks  again and was miserable.  As soon as I had my daughter I begged for another prescription.  My OB/GYN agreed and we tinkered with the dosage and found that for me - Acyclovir 200mg oral taken 1x daily worked.  I have been on this regime since 1985 - over 24 years.  With the low dose I have not had any side effects that I know of and if/when I get stressed or have a virus, I up my dosage to 200 mg 4-5 x a day until symptoms are gone.  I use Acyclovir (generic) which works fine for me and 90 capsules costs about 10.00 with Blue Cross insurance which is not that great.  If you have not tried this regimen and your doctor suggests it, please do.  It just may make a major difference in your quality of life.
Shingles	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	5/5/2009 7:17:35 PM	Due to internalizing my stress, I first was diagnosed with an inflammed occipital nerve, had swollen lymphnodes and then when my scalp starting itching and hurting everytime I touched it, my doc then realized I had shingles as well! (and I'm in my 30's)  Started the meds immed. and found great relief within 2 days. Really recommend drinking ALOT of water, that seemed to help me with the nausea.I think the key is recognizing the signs and getting the meds right away.I made a chart so I could check off each time I took a dose (4x a day)and that seemed to help too.

This is the first time I have had Shingles. I have a problem with the 5 times a day I keep forgetting how many I have taken and have to dump out the bottle to count the pills. The price was the major factor in taking this one.

Shingles	ritabook, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	55-64	4/26/2009 6:57:58 PM	Was diagnosed in my early 20's with genital herpes. After the first outbreak, I was never plagued again! Now at age 57, I developed shingles on the left side of my neck, chest, eyelid, and inside my left ear. I had no idea what it was but happened to be seeing my oncologist for something else, and he recognized it as shingles. So, after only about 36 hours of the outbreak, I started this med and 1% hydrocortisone cream.  The cream seemed to clear up all except my ear and my eye within another 36 hours. 5 days into this, my ear is the only thing that still hurts (but it's much better). I have NOT been good about taking it 5x/day (800 mg), but after reading the other info on this site, I realize I better keep a steady stream of this in my system. I started Tamoxifen the same day as this, and I was absolutely exhausted and very dizzy the first two days. I called the pharmacist on a Sunday and he said it was probably the Tamoxifen so I never called my doctor.  I'm not quite as dizzy, but I sure am drowsy!

This is my first time using prescribed medication for this problem. I started the medicine 5 days ago and my skin has been clearing up since. The doctor gave me a high dose (800mg tablets).

I have been takeing the med. for nearly a week now and my shingles have not spread.  There is no itching but at times a burning sensation.  this is the first time I have had shingles and I am 65 years old. I am sure a large amount of stress in my life at this time has caused this condition

After 3weeks we dropped usage from 5 to twice a day and the viral eye infection came back, so we went back to 5 times a  day. After two weeks decreased usage succesively during 10 days.

Nausea, diarrhea, not hungry feeling,very thirsty. Only taking 2 times daily, because of the side effects lasting for six hours, then gone.

They put me on these meds and nothing has gotten better, just worse. It's only been 3 days, but this is terible. Maybe it's not genital herpes, but it sure looks like it and I have all the signs....I just want this to be over, i cant take the pain anymore. I am very new to this so anyone who could help would be nice...

I was miserable for over a week before I could get to a clinic for testing. The nurse prescribed me this medicine for this episode as well as suppression therapy. It took a couple of days to start working, but wow are the pain and the breakout improved. I can actually get back to my life now. Thank god for this medicine. The only side effect I've had is a bit of nausea.

Before this I prescribed Valtrex which gave me a migraine, nausea, and fatigue. I have never had any negative side effects while using this medication. I went from taking it at the onset of a coldsore breakout to now being prescribed the preventative 400mg tablets which I take 2x a day. It works wonders at keeping my cold sores away...and I don't just get a little bitty cold sore. I get the ful blown breakout of them, so this really helps keep them away and if I DO get one, it definitely lessens the severity and length of time I have to deal with it. I highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from cold sores.

She started taking this religiously, then, all hell broke loose and she was picking fights , being redundant, and ranting and raving about everything.... she apparently has had arguments with everyone and everything was a catastrophic meltdown since she started this regiment. She screamed at me for 13 hours while on this medication, to anyone who might be bipolar or manic depressive please be extremely cautious when taking or being prescribed this medication, IT IS DANGEROUS!!!!!!

I only recently began taking medication, 11 days ago. Taking 200 mg 3x a day. I forgot a couple of times. It doesn't seem to be working too well so far. Seem to be having more discharge and still some itching, but not really bad. Maybe it needs to build up in my system? Herpes is very annoying. I may begin taking Valtrex in a few weeks because of some program my health care provider told me about. 
Genital Herpes	smiling again, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	2/4/2009 3:30:08 PM	Had my first breakout in July 2008, went with no medication for nearly 6 months and had break outs every month around the time I had my period...I was very depressed and stressed about it. I started this medication a month ago and have been clear ever since. I am thrilled with the results but I guess time will tell if it is going to be successful for a long period of time. What a bummer this virus is...If you are reading this you are probably not alone. My boyfriend is so loving and understanding, I thought he would dump me when I told him, but that wasn't the case at all. It actually helped me to understand just how close we really are. 
Cold Sore	Gray Wolf, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	35-44	2/1/2009 4:27:55 PM	Christmas morning 2008, I woke up with a cold sore.  The first one in my life and I'm 38.  February 2008 I was diagnosed with HSV2 and I had never had an outbreak so I was never put on a supression medication.  Monday after Christmas I saw the doctor who prescribed Acyclovir 400mg 3X a day - every 8 hrs.  The pain went up to my lower sinus on the right side and clear down to the jaw bone on that side for 2 weeks.  Starting tomorrow I will be on my 5th week of this medication and my cold sore still hasn't gone away.  After 3 weeks it stopped oozing and looked like a scar.  I was still having itching and tingling though.  This morning I woke up with what looked like a pimple head on my cold sore.  I hope to see my doctor this week regarding this.  To help prevent the spread of the cold sore, while it was still open and oozing, (it was the size of a quarter), I washed my bedding daily and the phone.  By the 3rd week I was washing the bedding once a week.  I have been very careful with my not touching my face as well.  
Shingles	klassye, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	1/25/2009 7:18:28 PM	I started taking this medication within the first 24 hours of the onset of shingles.  As far as I can tell it has saved me from a great deal of pain. Today is the 8th day of treatment and I am certainly feeling relief of the burning pain to the entire left side of my torso.  The areas are beginning to dry and heal to some extent.

Genital Herpes	MOByTheBeach, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	1/15/2009 5:56:17 PM	I have had genital herpes for 22 years (am now 41).  I went through the first 7 or so years with no medication and it was awful - constant outbreaks.  I now take 400mg on Monday, Wednesday &amp; Friday and have been on this regiment the past 5 years (coinciding with my marriage).  It keeps my outbreaks surpressed and - knock on wood - my husband is herpes free.  Previous to that if I wasn't in a relationship I would only take if I felt an outbreak coming on.  Occassionally I have to take more for 2-3 days (800 - 1200 mg/day) if I feel an outbreak starting - that dreaded tingly/itchy sensation - but this is very rare.  I have found if I stay on the 1200 mg / per week regiment I ultimately keep the condition under control and don't have to &quot;mega-dose&quot; anymore.  A few weeks ago I dropped to 800 mg per week and so far so good.I know some people can not tolerate this medication due to side effects but luckily for me that has not been the case.I am now pregnant and considering dropping altogether until I'm in my 3rd trimester.  I know this will lead to outbreaks so am weighing risks/benefits.  Articles have cited studies which show no risk of birth defects from this medication but these articles did not provide study details like how much medication and for what length of time.  I've dropped my dosage and am researching further.Good luck, all.  This condition is a real bear.

Because I take 1 Acyclovir per day I never have break outs (knock on wood). I highly suggest trying!

Cold Sore	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/5/2008 1:18:11 PM	i used to have a prescription for the cream and the pills years ago, but i only get about one outbreak of cold sores on one area on my top lip about every two years... nevertheless, you look horrible and the blisters hurt and i laid out of work for 3 days i was so embarrassed. luckily i happened to be going to the dr. for another reason and they suggested i get a prescription for the pills and keep them handy for emergencies. i had already had massive sores on my lip for 2 or 3 days by this time, but within hours of taking the first two pills my cold sores no longer hurt or ached. also, i remember from years ago if you take this pill at the very first sign of a tingle you can totally stop the outbreak. this is a tried and true medication. had a roomate in college in the early 90s who swore by this med, back then wasn't available  in generic. in my opinion the generic works just as well as the zovirax. i plan on keeping this medication on hand for for outbreaks...even if only once a year, it is still worth it to not have the awful stigma of nasty cold sores on your lip!

Would come on fast and spread very quickly as well. When I feel an episode coming on I start the medication and it stops it's and starts the healing process. If I catch it in the tingly stage there's no outbreak. Tried all the other creams/balms and such (not valtrex) without any real benefit.This drug has worked fantastic for me and as far as I know, no side effects. I don't always take the 5 a day, probably about 3 tablets for 1-3 days and that generally takes care of it. With extreme outbreaks I do take about 4-5 for 2 days, and that seems to wrok for me.

My insurance only covered about 1/2 the cost of Valtrex, which left me with $120 out of my own pocket. Being a single parent and going to college full time, I cannot afford that. Acyclovair is about $5 per RX. The only downfall is taking it 5 times a day, which it is hard for me to take one pill a day, let alone 5!!!

Prevent Recurrent Herpes Simplex Infection	sstanfordk@spamarrest.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	6/9/2008 12:36:49 PM	I was prescribed this medication to prevent recurrent herpes simplex outbreaks on my hip.  My initial outbreak began when I was a teenager from a skin to skin contact from a teenage boy who was playing around with his friends and fell into me while I was in a food line at the beach.  I broke out in a patch above my bikini line.  Since then, 35 years later, I continue to have outbreaks in that general area when under stress - anywhere from 3-8 times a year.  About 5 years ago, in a routine physical's blood test, I was diagnosed with Epstein Barr... even though I didn't realize any symptoms.2 years ago, my doctor prescribed Acyclovir.  I've been taking one 400 mg tablet every morning for about 16 months however, I think I need to increase my dosage to what is prescribed which is 2 times per day because even though I hate taking prescription drugs, until I read the information about this drug on Web MD, I didn't realize that I need to keep a constant dosage level in my body.  What's happening now is that when I wake up in the morning, I have severe tingling and pain in my that hip area, even though there is no outbreak... which, of course is telling me that although most of the medication has worn off and the residual is keeping my outbreak from happening, however I'm still getting painful symptoms.  These symptoms subside within an hour of taking the drug.   That said, I feel as though I'm destined to take this medication for the rest of my life and as such, I'm wondering what the long term side effects are and what the relationship is to Epstein Barr and what the prognosis is for the future... menopause and in old age?

I am a college student full time and a mother. It is very easy and simple and I haven't experienced any type of side effects.

Genital Herpes	duck duck goose, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/6/2007 11:23:06 AM	A health care professional believed I had a genital herpes outbreak and prescribed Acyclovir.  She said within 2 days the sores would heal and go away.  It started to work almost immediately but my skin is still a little red where the outbreak occurred...however there is no pain, discomfort, or sores.  I don't know if this is typical or not since she said that herpes does not leave scars.  I am on day 7 of 10 so I am still waiting to see the final results
Recurrent Genital Herpes	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	12/4/2007 3:29:08 PM	Blisters have been healed by the time I've finished the 5 days of taking meds.  My sperm count has dropped, not sure if this is from taking Acyclovir.  Was high prior to taking Acyclovir.
Cold Sore	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	11/30/2007 8:01:59 PM	I broke out in bruises all over my legs. I dont know if the dose was too strong but I wouldnt recommend taking this if your cold sore isnt bad.

Herpes Simplex Infection	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	13-18	11/22/2007 11:29:20 PM	Works well as long as I caught the break-outs within 24 hours. My breakouts along my lips were gone within 4 days. Probably the hardest thing to do was remember to take the pill 5 times a day. 
Herpes Simplex Infection	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	3	Female	55-64	11/15/2007 11:31:59 AM	I had cold sore like blisters on my nose area with at least three areas of sores.  It still took over a week to clear, and taking the meds 5 times daily was not easy to do.  Overall, I'm not sure if the meds did what they were supposed to do. 
Shingles	erramos1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/7/2007 10:46:45 AM	I was diagnosed with shingles around the eye, which is a very serious condition leading to blindness. I was put on this drug and by night time I noticed a change...redness and the blisters started to heal. I recommend this drug!

Shingles	Val1153, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	45-54	10/6/2007 10:37:57 PM	I am very satisified with this drug, it worked well for me and the cost was affordable compared to Valtrex.  The only downfall was having to take it 5 times daily.
