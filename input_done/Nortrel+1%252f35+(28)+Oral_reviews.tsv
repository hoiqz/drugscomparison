Painful Periods	parisdaisy8, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	9/18/2012 12:39:25 AM	I have not had major problems with acne but since being on this drug my chin and and jaw line are full of cystic acne. Its painful.  I had spotting before the 4th week of placeholders pills.  
Birth Control	Elon0606, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/16/2012 8:58:14 PM	I have found this brand of BC to be great. I've been on it 5 years.  I do have acne that is a little worse than normal around my mouth/jaw (one a month) but everything else is good.  Periods are lighter, no bloating, no mood swings, no weight gain, no other adverse side effects.  I do get headaches around my period sometimes since I've been on this.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	sierra, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	13-18	1/29/2012 1:54:01 AM	This pill has me very tired . I missed one pill but made sure I doubled up the next day and has been bleeding heavily for almost two weeks and have had painful cramps.  Also my lower part of my legs feel very tight and gets a tingling sensation in them . This didn't start until I got on this birth control . I do not like it at all 
Birth Control	NyssaM, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	13-18	12/23/2011 5:19:54 PM	I've just recently started taking this birth control and I've already had a bad reaction. It caused nausea, dizziness, fainting, numbness, lack of sleep, and chest pain. I originally had no idea what these symptoms were from, so I did my research and saw other reviews with these same side effects. 
Birth Control	holymo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/25/2011 3:42:36 AM	I was switched from ortho tri lo to this because I was bleeding for almost three months straight.  Haven't experienced any negative side effects.  Everything seems the same other than the ironically absent periods.  I completely missed the first one and my second one was only one day long.  I took a pregnancy test after the first missed one and it was negative so I'm hoping the one day period is from the birthcontrol. Other than that works great
Endometriosis	Kiersmomma, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	9/7/2011 11:29:26 AM	I have been taking Notrel for 5 months now and i have gained 5lbs in 5months and i work out 4 days/wk. I am SUPER bloated feeling and constantly cramping. I take this pill continousely so i dont have any cycle and it has been great with no break through bleeding but i cant handle the side effects. Acne, Bloating, Dry Scalp, and gain weight. I am switching this week and i am so excited to give a new med a try. 
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	7/20/2011 2:38:29 PM	I have been taking Nortrel for four years and have not experienced the problems that other reviewers have mentioned. Generally, my periods have been lighter, acne isn't any worse or less of a problem, and no unusual headaches. And mood swings seem to be a problem with most birth control medications.
Birth Control	liligg, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	13-18	4/18/2011 6:49:27 PM	Well, i have been taking this form of birth control for about a year now and i seem to have a somewhat strange symptom-- i have absolutely no period when I'm taking this drug. Sometimes i forget to take a pill the night before and then i will have my period but other times i still have no period. My mom made me take a pregnancy test about a year ago and it came out negative. Is there anyone else who has the same side effect?
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Latoyia, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	2/26/2011 9:36:45 AM	My mother put me on this when I turned 16. Im not 23, about to turn 24, and since I stopped talking it, I have had problems getting pregnant. IVE NEVER ONCE GOTTEN PREGNANT AFTER TAKING NORTREL!!! It is a problem since Im now married, 3.5 yrs, and we want to start a family. Its been disappointment after disappointment. DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL.
Birth Control	tchisu, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	1/3/2011 8:16:56 PM	I have been on this pill for over 2 years. I've never had flawless skin but I noticed the acne got WORSE and more painful esp around my jaw line and chin. I don't get headaches from this but I have noticed a big change that no one else has mentioned... right after my period I have the most foul smelling discharge. I have NEVER had this issue before. (I was on Orthotricyclin Lo last but switched for insurance purposes.) It's so embarrassing!  Now that my employer is contributing to our HSA accounts I am switching back to Orthotricylin Lo - forking out the extra money will be worth it. This def was not the BC for me, but stuck with it because my insurance covered generics and it did it's job as far as preventing pregnancy but this has has some of the months awful &amp; embarrassing side effects!

Experienced nausea daily, HEAVY periods when I wasn't even supposed to be on my period. Horrible cramps even when I wasn't near the week of my period. And headaches every single day! My doctor switched me to Seasonique, so we will see how that goes.
Birth Control	Sugar, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	8/21/2010 10:29:26 AM	Have been taking this pill for over 2 years and sometimes im spotting between periods and now i 4got 1 yellow pill right B4 white 1's and says no need to use back up and 3 days later had relations with my husband and im waiting for my period!? dont know if im pregnant or could be side effects...

Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	soccergirl, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	13-18	6/1/2010 2:51:43 PM	I started taking this bc cuz i get ovarian cyst. But since i started taking it i have acne on my face more, headaches, spotting before my period, cramping more in between my period when i spot. the only good thing is that my periods are lighter and less cramps then. 
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	Kait831, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	5/24/2010 10:09:30 PM	I have been on just about every type of birth control out there, but Nortrel has so far been the best. After having a period that lasted over 2 months and being on birth control at the time, Nortrel made it stop! I've only experienced 2 adverse effects. I have experienced migraines for the first time in my life and each new pack causes mood changes. Like most, I follow the typical 3 weeks on and 1 week off, but for the first 2-5 days of each new pack I become extremely sensitive. I become moody and angry at the smallest things. Its not extremely difficult to deal with, but can be very upsetting to the people around me. Other than that, I really recommend it. Obviously not everyone will have the same issues. 
Birth Control	maranay, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	5/22/2010 4:09:35 PM	I've been on Nortel 1/35/28 for 20 years, and for the last 18 years each month I get a bad migraine with my cycle that lasts 3 days with horrible tooth pain.  I've even contemplated a tooth extraction due to the severe pain, but I've tolerated the pain since Nortrel was so effective.  But in the last 2 months I've had 4 migraines. Nortrel did a completely effective job, and my periods were hardly evident, hardly any cramps, easy off and then on again to have my kids, and no other troubles other than the migraines, but I can't take the migraine pain anymore, and am finally getting off the pill.
Birth Control	ravinglunatic, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	5/13/2010 11:31:03 AM	I have been on this for one month and so far it is great.  After trying Loseasonique for a year, I had to get off it since I was bleeding more often than not (at one point for 6 weeks straight).  Normal periods, no spotting, and most importantly NO DEPRESSION.  I have been taking depression medication for 10 years for mood swings but it did not help.  After starting Nortrel, I noticed that I was even moodier when I took my Wellbutrin, so I started taking it every other day.  I was fine on the days I did not take Wellbutrin, so I have stopped completely. So as long as it works to keep me from getting pregnant, I couldn't be happier!!!
Birth Control	swimkitty, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	13-18	4/19/2010 8:42:32 AM	i spot all of the time and ive developed acne its disgusting.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	4/13/2010 12:46:45 PM	Well im very happy w the fact that even if i miss a pill the nortrel is still efective as birth control is often not effective on the woman in my family. although when i miss just one pill and take two the next morning (as i normally take it at night)i still start my period. and i cramp. but as long as i am very persistent w remembering it its great. My acne has improved tremendously and i dont have any more or worse mood swings. and as long as i take it normally i have no problems other than the first month i got a yeast infection but i took proper meds and havnt had a prob since. 
Birth Control	galfonso, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/24/2010 1:36:04 PM	This is my second time on this pill, at first I had nausea and terrible mood swing. I use to take it early in the morning and I spent the rest of the day in a terrible food and feeling sick. I now take it after lunch and I don't have nausea anymore. So if your getting sick my suggestion is to make sure your taking it it food. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	2/23/2010 12:46:01 PM	I've been taking this for only 3 days but I started getting massive headaches, dizziness and nausea within the first few hours of taking my first pill. I don't like it so far but maybe it will get better with time?
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	2/13/2010 12:49:53 AM	Okay. SO I have been on this pill for a few years now. Other than the fact that I have TERRIBLE mood swings, headaches all the time, and my skin has turned into a combination of NASTY on me. The pill is decent. NOW if you do not want to test POSITIVE on pregancy test multiple times and almost have a heart attack, as well as freaking out your boyfriend. DO NOT TAKE. I have had FOUR false positives while on this pill. Luckily I am switching the to a new pill this week. DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL DO NOT LET YOUR PHARMACY GIVE YOU THIS INSTEAD OF THE BRAND NAME!!!!

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/15/2010 10:34:39 PM	I was on Yaz before this pill, and I must say Nortrel is amazing. I didn't have any crazy mood swings or heavy bleeding like I did on Yaz. It works, and I still feel normal. 
Birth Control	melproper, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	19-24	1/15/2010 9:53:58 AM	I had been on a brand-name drug for about 3 years before this. Switched insurance and now the pharmacy gave me nortrel. My doctor had me taking the brand-name drug for 9 weeks at a time, then a week of the placebos. Supposedly it works exactly like seasonale only the drug is cheaper.Now I am trying to get my insurance company to cover the brand like I have been taking it before while still taking Nortrel. I switched to Nortrel after taking a week off from my period (which I don't usually get which I think is great because that means I don't get a week of migraine headaches with it.) Since starting Nortrel, I have had almost constant headaches. I missed a day on the pill, took 2 the next day, and got my period for a few weeks. I have had my period more during the 2 months I have been on Nortrel than I've had it in the past 6 months. The whole point of taking this birth control like this was to reduce my periods a year and I'm actually having more. Now I am trying to get a waiver from my insurance company so I can start taking the brand-name drug covered by insurance for 9 weeks at a time like I had been doing for the past 3 years. Until then, this is the only thing I can afford to do.
Birth Control	cheerlda08, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	13-18	1/7/2010 4:05:39 AM	I have 2 periods with this pill even when i take it EVERYDAY! this has happened since i started it about 4 months ago, it really cant be good, i always start the first week in a half into it, than start again when im supposed to! What it going on with it? I dont get pimples or anything with it, but mood swings are a bitch. I wouldnt reccoment this and i would love to know if anyone is having this problem with their bleeding.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	12/3/2009 9:39:20 AM	I took Necon for over 5 years, my pharmacy switched me to Nortrel 1 year ago, now I am having daily headaches.  I am planning to switch back to Necon which I had no side effects with.
Birth Control	Mere22, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	12/2/2009 1:54:57 PM	My Pharmacy switched me to this pill, I had been taking Necon for years with no problems. I took this pill for 3 months before realizing it was the cause of the pimples and zits all over my face! I'm switching back to Necon this month (so excited to have clear skin again). The only positive thing about taking this pill was short periods, they lasted about 2 days. I did feel nauseous a few times and have had a few headaches. My face is now scarred from all of the deep zits and pimples. I would not reccommend this pill to anyone.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	berrynana, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	11/16/2009 9:33:57 AM	Two weeks after starting this pill, I developed severe leg pain.  Two months into the pill I was diagnosed with a DVT. My doctor is 100% sure it was caused by this pill.  I am 50 yrs old.  Don't take this pill if you are over 35!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	19-24	10/22/2009 12:47:29 AM	I've only been on this pill for 2 weeks, but I've had experience with others.  I absolutely hate this experience so far.  Sick to my stomach EVERYDAY nearly vomitting but affraid to hurl the pill and therefore be pointless to take it.  HORRID cramps and spotting.. followed up with slight mood swings.  I would not recomend this product.
Birth Control	SpceCadet, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/12/2009 12:13:17 AM	Unlike other reviewers, this pill has decreased my headaches, decreased acne and decreased flow.  It's the only brand/generic that has not given me super mood swings and serious weight gain.  I drive 1/2 hour out of my way to get this rx now that none of the pharmacies in my town carry it.  I was given a different generic once and couldn't handle the change.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	9/10/2009 11:49:16 AM	My periods did not change at all. the heaviness stayed the same. But this pill caused my periods to be 11 days long as opossed to the 7 day normal periods. However, the severe cramping that I had before the pill has disapeared. So all in all I would NOT recommend this pill to someone wanted to decrease the length or flow of your period. But I would recommend this pill if you suffer from severe cramping and pain during your period.
Birth Control	Leeania, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	9/10/2009 2:18:22 AM	This is the first birth control pill I have been on and have had nothing but problems. Sure it does what it is supposed to but comes with headaches and weight gain. I've taken this pill for 2 years now and I am switching. I cannot wait to get off this pill.
Painful Periods	etc, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	8/18/2009 11:13:59 PM	As someone who practically dies when hit with my period, this pill is pretty helpful. It reduces the pain by a good bit. I've always had acne, so I can't comment on that (fish oil is the best thing for my acne). My one complaint is that I have to take the pill within about a 2-minute window at the same time every day, or I start spotting. Also, I've been taking this medication for about 5 years.
Birth Control	aldag, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	8/12/2009 5:39:25 PM	#1 - headaches EVERY DAY#2 - gained weight (i mean, after 2 months, my pants are tight!)#3 - hair falling out - not too sure if that is all from the bc pill, but I didn't have any problems when I was taking nothing.  I just don't want to add another baby to the mix, but I'm definitely contacting my dr to get a different pill prescribed.  Hope this helps others!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	7/14/2009 1:30:41 PM	I do have stomach cramps and breast tenderness and enlargement...but overall, it seems to work very well.
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	1dancer, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	2	Female	13-18	6/28/2009 12:17:13 AM	ive been on the pill for a month. it occasionally makes me nauscious and i might have a lil acne, nothing to bad.  i took my last pill today and my pd still hasnt come. i worried i might be prego. so we will see if the pill works or not. it sure as hell better!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	5/10/2009 10:05:56 PM	I have only been taking this pill for a month and I really hate it.  I'm already getting acne which I've NEVER had before.  I also got a yeast infection from taking this pill too.  I'm moody, gained weight, and have a dark patch on my foot.  It keeps you from getting pregnant but it makes you miserable.  
Endometriosis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	4/21/2009 12:14:12 AM	I hate this birth control, i was on yaz before and i loved it, i didn't gain weight, i wasnt moody, i didn't have such blurry vision. Nortrel side effects for me are , bleeding through out a whole month beside 3 days, blurry vision, My breast were so sore and swallon, horrible cramps,  always tired during the day, can never sleep at night, just had tons and tons of problems, super emotional.. i would not recommend this birth control to anyone!  i've been on it fore 3 months.. and im planning of changing birth control.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	12/22/2008 12:09:55 AM	I took this pill because I was having trouble finding a birth control that did not give me mood swings, make me gain weight and would help ease my cramps. Overall the pill did what it was supposed to do - not get me pregnant. I did not gain any weight, my face did not break out, and my cramps were better, but not completely gone so I still had to take Advil (but not as frequently as before). The downside to this pill is that it made me get more migraines than before. I have suffered from migraines all my life, but as I have gotten older I get them less frequently. This pill has caused me to get almost 10 times as many migraines. I am definitely getting off of this pill asap and switching to a mini pill (aka the ones without estrogen). There is all of this new research out there stating that if you get migraines with auras and are taking birth control with estrogen you are more likely to suffer from a stroke. If you get migraines please talk to your doctor before you start any pill. Be your own advocate!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	j23, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	11/10/2008 7:51:21 AM	i was on yazmine for about 6 months and it worked wonderfully for me. i had nice clear skin, lighter and shorter periods and no emotional problems. then i switched to nortrel and i immediately started having bad mood swings. i'm always so irritable. and the worst part is, i absolutely CANNOT get any sleep. i have the hardest time falling asleep every single night. i'm always tired during the daytime. and on top of that, i'd get a yeast infection the week before my period.  my doctor switched me to Aviane and i have yet to start it, but hopefully it doesn't give me any problems the way nortrel has.
Birth Control		4	4	1			11/7/2008 2:14:28 PM	I have been having acne problems.  I have always had perfect skin, but my face started becoming sensitive and then all of a sudden began breaking out.  I didn't know where it was coming from and something said check the side effects of this drug and when I did, it was one of the side effects.  I am just happy that now I know and my skin will go back to being flawless.  I highly discourage anyone from taking this pill.  It has been effective in timing my cycles, but so are other drugs that do not have such side effects.
Birth Control	jesser39, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	25-34	9/22/2008 9:22:21 AM	I have been on this pill for 4 months now and I have noticed that I have gotten really bad acne.  I never had any problem with acne, maybe an occassional zit, now it looks like I have craters all over my face!  I was previously on Yaz and it was perfect, but because they don't have a generic, and I don't have insurance, I am limited to my chooices.  I really want to change to a different pill!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	8/30/2008 10:23:42 PM	I have been on Ortho Novum Since Febrauary and Have Never Had a Problem.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	6/21/2008 2:53:00 PM	I have not noticed cramping with this bc, I have however noticed I do get headaches often.  I have used this same pill for 3 years.  I am overall satisfied. 
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	19-24	2/14/2008 10:46:25 PM	I started taking thins 6 months ago. The cramps are still here, almost worse than they were before. And yes it has made my period shorter..but its painful on the one day i bleed. I would only recommend this to someone with problems of bleeding too much.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	4	1	Female	25-34	1/29/2008 2:12:01 PM	This is the 5th birth control i've tried and absolutely the most painful! Ever since the first week I began this pill I have had constant, very painful hormone headaches. No matter how many advil/aleve/ibuprofen pills I take per day, the headache does NOT go away.  Also, I have missed taking a pill once or twice but followed protocol and took it first thing in the morning, as opposed to the previous night. I had spotting for the entire week to week and a half following the missed pill.  I have also had break-through spotting without missing any pills.  This spotting lasted several days to a week and a half as well.  I started taking birth control to releive bad cramping, but this pill has had zero effect on my cramps.  It has, however, shortened the duration of my periods and made my heaviest days lighter (that being the ONLY positive to this pill). I have stuck it out for almost 6 months to see if the headaches would disappear and my cramps would become less, but neither has happened.  I would not recommend this pill to anyone! and strongly warn against the headache side-effect!  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	11/18/2007 10:52:53 AM	If you are only taking this pill to not get pregnant, technically it does work. But if you are taking it because of terrible monthly cramps or anything to lighten your period, it doesn't do. I actually had to call into work because my cramps actually got worse. I can't wait to get off of this terrible birth control! I'm always nauseas and now I accidentally missed one pill, but followed protocol as soon as I remembered, but I still ended up getting a terrible period that has so far lasted for almost 2 weeks! The second I'm almost positive that it's gone, it shows back up. It's absolutely horrible and would advise anyone against this pill. There are so many others...might as well spend the extra money and not be miserable all the time.
