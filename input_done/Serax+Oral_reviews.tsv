I use it sparingly far anxiety attacks. My usage is about 50 tablets per year, but it really helps when I have problems. I do not suffer from depression or alcohol abuse. Using. It the way I do it is not habit forming in any way. 30 years ago I took it for agoraphobia and it worked.

I have taken up to 90mg to get me thru an MRI.  It is the only drug that has ever done every time what it's supposed to do.  If anybody knows of any long, long term effects, I'd like to know.

As a very heavy drinker, I needed some help, and so far, added with occasional Ativan, it seems to be working.

Other	BJ58, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/14/2008 11:26:19 AM	Having had problems since I was 12, and it being hereditary, I have found this the only thing that brought my life back to order. I was out on every antidepressant, MAO, andlithium, to no avail.I couldn't leave the house, go out of town, or even get dressed.While on a MAO inhibitor, and ready to commit suicide, the psych. suggested adding serax to it. The next day, I was a new person.I since had the quit the parnate, as the problems were getting worse with it, but continue my serax, twice a day. I am a manager of a company, drive 40 miles a day, and speak at functions. My biggest fear in life, is that some idiot will decide I am dependent, and try to take me off of it. I have been on it for 25 years, with no problems, and have liver enzymes checked regularly. Dependent or not, if it is the only thing that separates you from insanity....so be it.

I suffer from panic disorder and anxiety attacks. It was also easy doses to use. I was very satisfied with the results.
Anxious	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/24/2008 8:59:47 PM	This was the first benzodiazepine I was ever prescribed. It worked like a charm, as I recall at a dosage of 30 mg./day, but that was 25 years ago, so my recall isn't perfect. I would have stayed with this medicine, except that I was in college at the time, and my college pharmacy didn't stock this drug, so my doctor tried an alternative. Very effective, with a very wide dosing range, so it can be easily tailored to individual patients' needs. I understand it's also easier on the liver for elderly patients.
Anxious		2	4	1			5/8/2008 4:47:08 PM	my dad has been taking this medicine and he drinks with it which does not make it effective and he is unresponsive when we talk to him he just ends up being a couch potato the whole day.

Other	drowsy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	2/24/2008 9:20:15 PM	It's a valium derivative like temazapam in effect but it only works for 6 hours for a big guy, comes on strong, v. relaxing.  Allow 2.5 hours before you want to sleep.  When I was totally wired in hospital having been told I didn't have long to live the doc gave me one poxy 10mg pill of it for sleep, I had to laugh it was so small, 2 nights later after the night staff complaining about me staying up all night and smoking in the bathrooms he gave me 2; I took 20mg everynight thereafter for 11 months and had little problem to sleep.  Then the malignant blood pressure broke and I had no problem dropping them along w. the drugs for cancer of the adrenaline glands but I still always like to have them around for when I can't get a good night sleep for a long time or I just have to be at an early interview or something.  I think they are great and have no hangover effect like the other benzodiazapam derrivatives.  Looking back over 11 years extra life since end stage terminal heart failure in '97.
Anxious	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	45-54	1/29/2008 2:10:05 PM	I was not aware of the addictive-ness of this drug.  Although it worked rapidly and gave me a good calming affect, I would feel like I had a  hangover if I decreased my dosage.  This was after taking it only a week!   Being in therapy and a 12-step program gave me true coping tools and a support system so, against my physicatrist advice, I stopped taking the Serax after two weeks.   Although the drup was very effective, replacing one substance (alcohol) with another wasn't a solution for me.  I now take a natural GABA supplement and, with 12-step support, manage my anxiety much better.

Anxious	Rubyee2, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	11/13/2007 6:22:21 PM	I have been taking Serax for over 20 years.  I do not take it on a regular basis.  I only take half of a pill occasionally.  It has made me feel so much better and more relaxed and no anxiey when I have times that I am really anxious. I feel like a different person when I take this.   Been a life saver for me.  I hope I can take it the rest of my life.  I am 72
