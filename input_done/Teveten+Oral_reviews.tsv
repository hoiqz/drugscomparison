High Blood Pressure	chloe, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		6/3/2011 5:58:15 PM	I have used Teveten for hypertension for many years with no problems; it does the job and melds with my other medications. I agree it is way too expensive;there should be a generic but there is not.

High Blood Pressure	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	6/15/2010 11:43:50 AM	My blood pressure has been normal as long as I've been taking this medication.  I have absolutely no side effects. Cost is high and my drug insurance wants me to change to 1 of 4 other drugs, which I have researched and they have bad side effects. I am trying to get an exception from my insurance company to continue on this medication.
High Blood Pressure	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	65-74	3/12/2010 8:18:29 AM	It lowers my BP somewhat, but I continue to use it because I haven't had the horrible side effects I experienced with almost all other drugs for HP.  I had to get an exception from my insurance to continue getting this drug.  The cost is high, but I think I will try getting it in Canada!!
