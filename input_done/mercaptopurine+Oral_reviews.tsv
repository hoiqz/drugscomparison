Other	q45samuel, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	8/27/2012 4:36:42 PM	I've been dealing with epidermolysis bullosa for nearly 30 years.  I've taking prednisone periodically over this time.  Most of those years, I skipped the prednisone, but over the past 3 years, breathing is a real issue due to mucus.  I have a trach that i think was brought on by numerous episodes of acid-reflux, and having a trach allows for my airway to dry out,  resulting in dysphagia.  I finally gave in and began taking 10mgs of prednisone, and for the first time in years, i wasn't afraid to sleep.  my doctor felt that i needed to reduce my use of prednisone, so mercapturine 50mgs was started along with the prednisone.  after six days of this, my lose teeth were damn near killing me.  it took 2 days of not taking the the mercapturine, before the pain from my teeth subsided.  my teeth are loose because of my epidermylysis bullosa.  I've since reduced my prednisone to 8mgs, but the mucus is still

Best 3 years of the last awful 27 years I have had. However, I am now going through chemo for non hodgekins lymphoma, a side effect of mercaptopurine. Wish I had not taken the drug now. 
Crohn's Disease	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	1/11/2012 2:41:17 PM	I was put on 6MP in the hospital about six years ago, within days of being diagnosed with Crohn's. This was my first hospital stay, so I was already a bit apprehensive. The nurse walking in gloved, carrying a tiny bottle - sealed and labeled &quot;CAUTION: CHEMOTHERAPY&quot; - did not really help matters. I was extremely hesitant to swallow something that no one else would even touch, but I was sick and desperate enough to try anything that might make me feel better. So I took it. And took it again the next day. And again. I was on a Prednisone high at that point, happily able to function &quot;normally&quot; again, but my doctor said that it would take a while to kick in, but it would help keep me well once I was off the steroids, and I believed him. Over the next four years, I suppose it might have been helping... maybe. It's hard to say, really, looking back. I definitely was better than I was in the hospital or before treatment, but I didn't really have the energy to spend too long on my feet doing much of anything. At the time, I just took it with a grimace that the fatigue was just part of being chronically ill. But some more serious symptoms did flare up every now and then - maybe once or twice a year. I was given Prednisone and Entocort in such cases, and the symptoms quickly went away, so I thought little of them - until they returned, of course. And then, after four years, within the span of about a month, without any visible bleeding, my red blood cell counts depleted... to the point of me needing to be hospitalized and given three blood transfusions. No one really wanted to say that it was the 6MP, but my doctors never really told me anything else conclusive about what happened. After that hospital stay, I was switched from 6MP to Remicade treatments. Comparatively, since the switch, I have had virtually no symptoms and have at least five times the energy I had on 6MP. I'm sure 6MP works for some people, but it does have its risks, and it just didn't work out for me.

I took ENTOCORT EC 3 MG for over a year and as a last resort my Gastro doc put me on Mercaptopurine 50mg.  It has stopped my diarrhea and I now have an appetite but I am still not absorbing nutrients and have lost 20% of my body weight.  I'm down to 78.5 pounds (5'2&quot;).  I will continue using it but feel like I am wasting away to nothing.  I'm also taking a pancreatic enzyme every time I eat so hopefully this will do the trick.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease	eng, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	4/6/2011 5:40:59 PM	I was diagnosed with Crohn's in 2006, started on prednisone, then moved on to 6mp. Over the years I felt this medicine has helped and also hurt me. I get several infections each year, have lost a lot of my hair several times, and have passed 4 kidney stones. I should mention I am a vegetarian and eat extremely healthy. I got pregnant while taking this medication and was told to stay on the medicine by my GI--- I had a devastating late term miscarriage (18 weeks). Of course I was told it was not the medicine. I am trying to heal naturally and have been on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet for 6 months now. I have had major improvements and am hopeful to get off the 6mp soon and try to have another baby. This medicine may work for some people, but it has caused more pain then help for me. I think it is a harsh medicine and no one should take it while being pregnant. I am trying to find a GI doctor that will help me treat my Crohn's with diet and vitamins--with no luck so far. I am researching D.O.'s versus M.D's to successfully get off the 6mp. I hope it will work!

The traditional treatments did not work (all made me substantially worse, except for Prednisone which you cannot take long term).  Dr put me on Mercaptopurine 10 years ago as a &quot;last resort&quot;and I have been completely well since (it also completely stopped my mild asthma).  I have no side effects, but I have blood tests every 3 to 6 months to make sure everything is ok.

Though Mercaptopurine (6mp) is primarily a cancer chemotherapy, I was being treated for IBD with this drug in years 1999-2000, for approximately 3 months.  At the time it was widely believed to be a potentially effective therapy for IBD.  I am uncertain of its current medical status in this regard. However, having no other primary causation, I contracted sever liver cirrhosis which effects me in exceptionally negative ways.  Later, I was a cancer patient and the cirrhosis compromised my cancer treatment.  I have been diagnosed with &quot;cryptogenic cirrhosis&quot; (unknown or mysterious origin) though I strongly suspect the 6mp to be the primary causal factor. It's very powerful chemotherapy in some cases, but similarly has potentially very strong side effects. If you are predisposed to liver problems, you certainly do not want to use this drug if you can avoid it. Likewise, even if you do not have liver issues, I would try to avoid it in favor of alternatives with similar or better records of effectiveness.  The significance of severe liver disease as a possible side effect of 6mp is a high life-threatening and/or life-shortening risk, not to mention severe reductions in quality of the remainder of life.

So finally I was put on 6 mp 6 months ago100 mg per day.  and I have been doing well on it with no side effect or flare ups.So my doctor recommend I stay taking it for the rest of my life.  But my Maine concern is what should I expect from this medication if I stay on it for the  rest if my life? Anyone has the same recommendation ?

She had a clot and was on warfarin for a few months.  Her IBD worsened and couldn't be controlled with any other drugs we tried.  Once on 6MP she got much better.  She never has any bad interactions between the 6MP and the warfarin.  Her doctors monitored her warfarin carefully--she went for weekly bloodwork the entire time she was on warfarin (almost a year).  I hope you're doing better!

I was monitored closely and delivered a healthy baby via c-section. No breast feeding, but thankful for the healthy baby. I did not experience a flare after the pregnancy.

A few years ago 5-ASA failed to resolve my flares.  Tried Prednisone twice.  Worked on UC, but side effect of hyperglycemia made continued use impossible.  Have been on 6MP for 9 months.  Works fine on UC.  Found I had to change my diet somewhat as the 6MP seems to have made me less tolerant of some foods, but I can live with that.  Worst side effect, if it is one, is middle back pain from area of just above left kidney to slightly higher on right.  Came on after 3 weeks of 6MP use.  Despite various tests and imaging no one can diagnose anything else wrong, but the literature on 6MP doesn't have show that kind of pain associated with it.  Will risk going off for 6 months soon to see if that resolves the back pain.  Hope your experience is better than mine.

I would gag at least 20+ times every morning, couple times right before lunch, and a few more at nights.  I've tried changing the schedule of dosage: instead 2 tablets every morning (with and without foods) to every evening to 1 tablet each morning/evening, and to even half tablet each morning/evening, but nothing seem to be working. After stopping for a good 2-3 weeks, I flared up again! Now I'm on hydrocortisone enemas + 6mp again... hopefully soon enough I can taper off the steroids enemas and stay w/ the 6mp.  I'm gagging again... this is intolerable and I might once again stop the 6mp just to experience another flare-up.  the cycle continues... sigh!

He began 6MP in 2005 and for awhile it seemed to work. Last year he became worse; severe abdominal pains, painful urination, vomiting, diarrhea. His dr. stopped the 6MP, but the symptoms continue..blood cell count out of wack, he has lost 50 lbs and stays weak. They are running tests to determine what illness/condition he has. Maybe his pancreas? Of course, I can't prove the 6MP caused this, but with all the research I've done recently about the long term side-effects of this medication it's hard not to think there is some connection.

The only thing that was working for me was Prednisone and Colazal. Every time I was weaned off the Prednisone I would flare again. My Doctor told me that I should try Mercaptopurine and that most people tolerated it very well. I have had few side effects (hair loss and tiredness) but it beats the UC symptoms! I have lost urgency and cramping. I gained weight and feel great compared to last year at this time! I am on 100mg of it at the recommendation of my Doctor.

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	2/16/2009 2:00:52 PM	I have had Crohn's disease for 5.5 years now(since I was 18) and this medicine has been the only pill that has worked for me (I've been taking it for about 4.5 years). I went 4 years before I had even the slightest recurrence of the crohns pain/symptoms. The only side effect that I experience is extreme sensitivity to the sun- If I'm out in the sun for more than 2 hrs I break out in rashes/severe sun poisoning and I never had this problem before I started on this medication. Otherwise this drug has been extremely effective in controlling all of my symptoms. However I did read that this drug can cause gallstones and I did in fact have my gallbladder removed about a year ago- but I would rather go through one painless/quick surgery then live a lifetime of pain from the crohns. 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	2/11/2009 11:50:42 AM	I have been on 6-MP for close to 2 years now to treat my UC. Starting at 50mg and now at 100mg. So far I haven't seen any major side-effects other than thinning hair, bruises very slow to go away, and fatigue.  Although I was only diagnosed with UC a little over 2 years ago so it's hard to tell what's the UC and what's drug side-effects. I'm also taking several other meds so it's hard to say.  I've since been diagonosed with gastritis recently due to all my meds. My concerns however are more the long term use, which there seems to be little research on. At this point I have tried once to cut my dose to try and ultimately stop the drug.  This just caused my UC to flare so I had to start Predisone again and raise the dose back up.  I just think that before starting this drug people should be informed about how long term you will have to be on it, possibly forever.  I also didn't know until recently when I changed DR.'s that there is a blood test that can tell you if the dossage of 6-mp is right for you.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	1/13/2009 9:37:03 PM	I have had UC for over 15 years with flare-ups every 3 or 4 months, some that lastest 6 weeks.  My choice was colon removal or living with it.  I went to Mayo's in Jacksonville where my GE tried to talk me into 6-MP for two years.  Finally I agreed.  Now no flare ups for well over a year and my last colosostopy was so good, every 3 or 4 years is no all I have to consider.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	1/8/2009 10:36:26 PM	I am on this drug for a flareup that occurred this summer.  However I will be requesting that my doctor take me off it, as the side effects are too serious for me to be comfortable with.  We would also like to have children in the next few years.  I would encourage anyone with IBD issues to research and seriously consider the Specific Carbohydrate Diet.  I started it a few months ago and feel great - no bleeding and I've been regular for months!  Over the holidays I ate food I wasn't sure about (not sure if it contained sugars or starches) and found that my symptoms began to return, while still on the medication.  The testimonials I've read and my own experience so far have convinced me to give this diet a real try and I would like to try it without medications.  I felt compelled to share this because so many people sound so hopeless when the drugs don't work or quit working and most doctors won't mention the diet, either because they don't know about it or because they don't believe it works.  I would encourage anyone with concerns about their treatment to research and seriously consider giving this diet a chance, and discuss it with your doctor too - it's hard at first but there are many many wonderful supportive websites.  A good book to start with is &quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle&quot; by Elaine Gottschall.  I got mine on Amazon.  Best of luck.

The side effects are hair loss and diarahea but the colitis is in remission.  I tried methatrexate but experienced extreme memory loss so this is my only alternative since methotrexate caused severe memory loss.  After 10 years most of the lower dosage medications for anti inflammatory do not work anymore such as Asacol etc
Inflammatory Bowel Disease	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	1/6/2009 8:25:51 PM	I have had UC since 2004 with little improvement from taking Colozal or other meds. My flair ups come and go, but as of early 2008 my flair ups caused my doctor to start me on 6mp. I must say, reviewing all the side effects concerned me, but I thought to give it a try. I was on it for 2 months and felt a lot better, no cramps or urgencies. However, I stopped taking 6mp because of the fear of getting cancer or other side effects from long term use. I am in my late 20's and feel the risks out weigh the benefit. About 1 month after stopping all medications, my flair ups began. Is there no hope once diagnosed with UC?

( a medicine given off label for crohns, no clinical studies on children ) this medication is very potent and decreases white blood count. Therefore, leading it to be a medication with major side effects. This medication is suppose to be monitored with weekly then monthly blood tests. My daughter went every 3 months , and approx 8 months ago : I asked for all copies of blood labs , tests , etc . I noticed that her WBC and Lymp counts were out of range: LOW. The dr dismissed this by saying it was an effect of 6mp. I sought out additional help  ,and after 2 months of blood tests : she was just diagnosed with auto immune disorder with monthly IVIG transfusions for life. After dozens of hours on the internet , talking to FDA and drug manu : I am wondering if ANYONE ( child / adult ) had any side effects of taking 6mp longterm ???

It was under control with Colazal and occasional prendisone usage.  I had a big flare up during the end of 2006 and was taking prendisone for about a year (horrible, horrible side effects).  I moved and got a new doctor and he put me on 6MP (and kept the Colazal) in late 2007.  It has been pretty great.  I have noticed that I don't heal as quickly as I used to and that I need more sleep to feel well rested.  I have not had any noticeable hair loss and I don't seem to get sick (cold, flu, etc) anymore than I usually do per year.

I caught it early so I haven't had too many problems. I basically tried everything in the book for it - Asocol, Colzal, Prednisone, secial diets, etc. Some of them would calm the colitis but the side effects were far worse. Now I am on 6MP and the colitis has pretty much subsided. I am having the hair loss issues as well. I am getting married in 6 months and I am afraid that I will be bald and have to wear a wig. My doctor claims that this medicine doesn't cause people to lose their hair but after reading other people's messages, I know that it must. Thanks!

Inflammatory Bowel Disease	Slick, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	35-44	6/4/2008 1:59:22 AM	Ive had mild UC since 1984. Flared up in March when I lost my mom. New GI doc proscribed this, and switched me to Lialda from Azulfidine EN, which I had been taking for 24 years.  Ive been having muscle spasms in the neck, chest, back, and legs.  Difficulty breathing. Waking up 4 times a night to take a hot shower to relieve the pain. I cant say if this is withdrawal from the Azulfidine or due to Mercaptopurine. My UC was never terrible before, but now I cant live/walk/sleep. I dont mean to scare anyone away from a potentially good drug, but this is nuts.  Waiting on blood tests to see whats happening before he makes a change.  I have been on this less than a week now.  Note that past lapses in Azulfidine did cause joint pain and increased UC activity, but never anything like this....
Inflammatory Bowel Disease	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	4/8/2008 9:46:16 AM	I have only been taking this med for about 9 Months. I have Crohns disease - active at this time. This is the first time I have taken this med. I'am still not crazy that I'am taking this - due to the side effects. I have had 5 surgery's for my crohns. My last surgery was 3 years ago and the one prior to that was 11 years. Therefore because it came back so fast the Doctor wanted me on this med. I don't like hearing that it can cause hair loss - not good.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease	 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female		3/27/2008 1:19:29 AM	After Asacol not working and a needed 6 weeks of Prednisone to relieve major inflammation, this drug has worked for me to reduce my severe Ulcerative Colitis.  However, I have been on it for about 6 months and asked the DR when I can stop since I am in remission.  He informed me &quot;never&quot; according to the Mayo Clinic Dr.'s.  Apparently sometimes those that stop have the condition return and when put back on the meds, they no longer work.  Now 1 month later my white blood cells are so low they are telling me to stop taking the medication.  I am leary to do so as I don't want the Colitis to return but I am so weak right now I don't think I will have a choice.  I am hoping my count will rise quickly so I can resume the medication.
