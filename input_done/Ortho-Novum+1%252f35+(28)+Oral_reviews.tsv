Birth Control	MyAGA, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	5/28/2012 8:16:13 AM	I've used this 5+ years ago (20-21yrsold) and didnt have any problems. I had a baby and now back on it (27yrsold)...I've noticed that I get more pimples. I don't know if age has anything to do with it or what? or maybe because I'm more active or heat could be the reason??

I've never been on a pill before so i'm not sure if this is normal but i love the months that i do have a 2 day period. :) 
Birth Control	....., 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	4	Female	19-24	2/22/2012 12:34:14 PM	After trying struggling to find a birth control pill that worked for me (previous pills causes acne, mood swings, etc) I was put on this pill - and it worked - all my previous symptoms stopped, and my period became lighter, and only lasted 2-3 days, as compared to 6-8 days long before. Unexpectedly, I became pregnant while on the pill. My husband and I were excited, but surprised. I'm guessing that the pill just isn't for me and I'm going to need to switch to something like an IUD after our second child is born. :) Besides 
Birth Control	CamL, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	10/13/2011 11:25:53 AM	At the time I tried the orthonovum, I had taken ortho-tricyclen for many years, but continued to have my period for 6-7 days. I tried Ortho novum to attempt to reduce menstruation days.  Unfortunately, I had one of the serious and rare reactions, in that I began to have severe mood swings precipitated by rather benign events.  On one occassion, I became enraged that a particular street sign was not marked well, and I could not find my destination.  I flew into such a rage, that I thought if I crashed my car into a telephone pole, maybe they would mark the street better.  Obviously, mood swings that foster impulsive suicidal thoughts is not a good thing.  Fortunately, once I calmed down, I recognized that my recent mood instability correlated with beginning the new medication.  I immediately discontinued the medication, and returned to my baseline fairly quickly, which is typically very stable and euthymic.  This event happened to me years ago, while in graduate school training to become a Mental health clinician.  Luckily, I had enough understanding about the effects of medications that I was able to recognize the relationship between my mood instablity and the ortho novum. I was able to discontinue it after a short period of time and was able to avoid serious compications that the medication could have caused.  I do know now that I am fairly sensitive to hormonal shifts, and may have been more predisposed biochemically to have such a reaction to this medication.  Please consult with your MD before taking this medication if you already know if you are particularly sensitive to hormones, as it could potentially cause a lot of serious problems.

And this particular one worked perfectly for me - no problems, no issues. But every person is different and sometimes one has to try several different kinds to find the one.

Recently they gave me the generic, and I hate it! I'm so going back to brand. I have had no side effects and nice short periods.

Absence of Menstrual Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	4/14/2009 9:43:34 PM	I take this purely for my PCOS. I started this when I was also starting another drug (commonly used for Diabetes), Metformin. When I first start the cycle, I tend to get a little nauseous. Some random days, my night is so filled with nausea that I do throw up. It's a bit of a deterrent to taking it. I never got a period - and I was ok with that; still don't know why I need one - and when I first had one caused by the pill, it was MURDER. I remember not knowing what to do; the pads were uncomfortable - I don't use tampons, even now. I remember I had to silently suffer through a cramp that lasted for 5 minutes straight. But still, I'd tried others, and they made me moody, so I still stick with it.
