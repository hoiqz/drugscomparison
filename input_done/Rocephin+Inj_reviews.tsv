Bone Infection caused by Klebsiella Pneumoniae Bacteria	Someonewatchedoverme, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	7/5/2012 11:10:34 PM	Went into the ER thinking I had the flu.   Was in the ICU for several days.   I was in kidney failure, and was told I had sepsis which we found out was Klebsiella Pnemonia - gram rod negative.  They decided to take my gallbladder out.    I also continued to complain about the pain in my neck.  They only focused on my gallbladder.  I was released after approx 9 days.  After a back and forth being called back into the hospital because the culture came back once again as Positive with Klebsiella Pnemonia.   But, instead of starting me on an IV they released me (why who knows) with an ORAL antibiotic of levoquin 500mg.   A month later, I am back in the hospital, the MRI shows compression on my spine, I NOW have a severe infection in my neck causing spinal compression.    They called it all....Vertebral Osteomyletis of my C5, C6, C7, Spinal Epidural Absess, and Discitis from the Klebsiella Pnemonia.     I FINALLY got their attention that my NECK really was a problem!   I was placed on a PIC line, and when released the order was for Rocephin, 2gm in 20ml.   I was on this for about 6 - ish weeks.   Had trouble with the PIC line, so they pulled it and put me back on Levoquin this time 750mg.   Lesson learned... DO NOT have a patient on Levoquin beyond the MFG recommend timeframe.    The patient (me) will get tingles and numbness -- which is written in the mfg pamphlet!    So now we switched to Bactrim DS 800/160.    All in all, was on the various antibiotics for a non-stop timeframe of a little more than 6 months (literally).    I am no longer on any antibiotics, I did NOT have a surgery -- they asked me to not eat the night before just in case I had to go down for a surgery,  but I wanted another opinion.   The 2nd option doctor as shocked at my neurological state being so good they said we could try antibiotics vs. go directly into a surgery.   Thank god for listening to the little voice in your head that says &quot;yes thats the right thing to do&quot;.   I am &quot;ok&quot; &amp; healing.

Middle Ear Infection	marlmom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/16/2012 10:30:17 AM	Went to the doctor with a terrible ear infection. Had to have a Rocephin shot in the backside. The doctor and nurse warned me that it was going to hurt, but I thought they were just teasing me because I am 33 and had to get a shot in the rear end. I was wrong. It hurt like a B***h!! The shot hurt bad enough, but I suggest having someone with you that can drive you home, because for the next 2 hours it continued to burn so bad clear up into my back and down my leg that I could hardly concentrate enough to drive! At the time, I thought they had injected a 5 gallon can of gasoline into my backside and lit it on fire! Two hours later the pain stopped, and short of having sore muscles in my back and leg the next day, I felt great!! Although it wouldn't be my first choice, I would accept another one if I ever needed it again. It worked well!

I had to have another surgery 3 1/2 weeks after my surgery to clean the area out.  Now my husband has to give me an infusion of this every day for at least 6 weeks.  CDC is involved and sends out one week's supply for us and they are the ones that will need to clear me.  This rates down pretty low in my estimate!

Worked like a charm. Felt better quickly in combo with other antibiotics. I did experience long-lasting pain the the muscle where the injection site was, as well as red, swollen and painful mouth. Otherwise, it was extremely helpful. I have never been so sick in my life, and it helped me feel better sooner than I thought possible.

Mine was in my butt; nothing that didn't go away within a short period of time.Amazed at this drug!!!  Good stuff.

I go to my doctor, and he gives me a shot of it. It starts working immediately and within hours I always feel relief. Rocephin hurts going in... Not from the needle stick, but the actual drug itself. It burns your muscles/veins or whatever it is that's there (I get the shot on my butt cheek). It comes as a powder, so rather than using sterile water to mix it up, he uses lidocaine, which helps with the pain a lot. If you are getting this drug, ask your doctor if he'd be willing to mix it with lidocaine to prevent the discomfort (which can last for a few days in the area where you get the shot).

I could barely walk into the office I felt so horrible.  The Dr. told me I had pneumonia and that I had 2 options, get the 2 shots of recephin, or get admitted to the hospital.  I choose the shots, and by the next day all I had to deal with was the heavy chest and coughing which is expected for awhile.  Way better than being in the hospital.  Even though I am still a little sore from the shots.  I'm not gonna lie, they are not pleasant but they do work!

The Dr put her on augmentin and said bring her back Wed. if it is not better.  Needless to say with the antibiotic and piggybacking motrin and tylenol nothing was working.  I thought her fever broke tues. night well to my dismay she started the fever again in the morning so I took her back in.  The dr gave her the rocephin shot with lidocane, she said it hurt but within 1-2 hrs she was asking me if she could clean the toyroom, wash the dishes, sweep the kitchen floor and mop it!!!  AMEN for rocephin   Now previously about 3 weeks ago my 2yo had scarlett fever and pneumonial she got the shot and it worked great with her also!!  I am a nurse and I would strongly suggest the rocephin shot it is wonderful!!!

Dr prescribed me Zithromax, as well as zyrtec D and Nasonex. Tuesday comes, and the symptoms have actually worsened...now having fevers, can barely swallow. Went back to Dr, and he prescribed on top of the other meds some Hydromet. It seemed to relieve the pain for a couple of hours. Then today, I woke, and I couldn't swallow anything. Still had fever, and swollen lymph nodes, still lots of mucus. Went back to Dr today(friday), and he finally gave me a shot of Depoinject(steroid) and a shot of rocephin. Came home and about 2 hrs later throat swelling was already reducing. Have yet to see the remaining swelling go away, hopefully when I wake in the morning. Would love to drink some apple juice! :)

Other	NandaJo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/18/2009 9:13:44 AM	Went to my family doctor on Monday (10/12/09) with very sore throat, body aches and 102 fever. Was diagnosed with H1N1 and prescribed Tamiflu. Was given 2 strep tests, the first one came up negative at their office, the second had to be sent off (will update the results Monday if positive). Although the Tamiflu worked very well on my body aches, my throat was getting much worse... the pain intensified and it felt like I was swallowing glass and swelling so much I couldn't swallow anything but liquid, but breathing fine. On the fourth day dealing with my throat, I went to a Wellstar Urgent Care (my doctor's office was closed) and they took a strep test again (neg), a mono test (neg) and a CBC (?) blood test which was positive for bacterial and viral infection. I received a steroid injection along with a Rocephin injection (with Lidocane). I was so desperate for relief, the shots did not even bother me. I felt so much better by that night! I woke up the next day and the pain and swelling were nearly gone!! I had not slept in days until that night. The shot was so worth it to me. I was also prescribed Augmenton, which I start on today. But just from having this shot, along with the steroid, I feel like I am nearly back to normal.

Other	none, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	1	2	Male	3-6	10/6/2009 5:59:31 PM	I rushed my youngest child to the ER with a fever over 105, knowing this six year old had just recieved a hep A shot only three days earlier. Since the fever was high they did x-rays, blood work and the q-tip test both for the nose and throat. I was told one of the tests came back postive for Influenza B Viral Antigen or the flu, this shot was broken down to two shots for each leg. Now almost 24 hours later my child still refuses to stand or walk on their own and the muscles are so tight I don't see how it can work and potty trips are very hard when my child refuses to stand for the removal and replacement of clothing. I have found most reviews helpful but for someone who dislikes shots this was not my ideal treatment and this person left the ER with 5 new meds to take on top of the shot.

Pneumonia caused by Bacteria	sacredfaerie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	1	3	Female	35-44	3/16/2008 6:43:33 PM	My baby 14 month old daughter had this shot. She grabbed the needle from the nurse and we had to pry it from her tiny fingers! Then she had to start over on the other leg. It was diluted w/ lidocaine. I think at least for children they should freeze the area before the shot. It was very painful, but effective. She was also given Tamiflu and Zithromax as well.
