High Blood Pressure	eastgurl2001, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	7/1/2012 10:53:50 PM	I started out on Metoprolol, then was put on Ziac, my gyno found out I was on Ziac and demanded that I be put on something else so I was put on Labetalol 200mg bid, then due to stressfull situations I was raised to 300mg bid, then I found myself in a totally unstressfull situation, (mother in-law passed away, we moved and I changed jobs :)) and then the medicine lowered my h.r. too much, so doc lowered my does to 200mg 1xd, my pulse is still low and my b.p is reading in the low 110/68 most of the time, I have asked my doctor to remove me from the medication, and I have been off the meds for  over 1 month and I have had excellent results.  Apparently my high bp and high pulse was in response to stress. This medication was beneficial while I learned how to deal with my stressful situations and is no longer needed.

This lasts about 2hrs. , but b/p does drop dramatically, but within normal limits.
High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/27/2012 1:32:34 PM	Started this medication after I tried a few others that did not do a great job, I wanted to get pregnant and had my Dr. switch me to this 200 mg twice a day. Side effects are tingley scalp...CREEPY, and tingley legs sometimes. I had a big boost in energy (till i got pregnant). lowered my BP immediatly! went from 140/100 to 120/80 is the highest reading I get and lowest is 107/68. I will deal with the side effects, I love this new medication... makes me feel normal.. and of course I changed my diet and now I walk 3 miles a day.

High Blood Pressure	diperri, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	65-74	2/2/2012 10:23:20 AM	I am on my 2nd month of 100mg twice daily. I feel exhausted, I ache all over now, and I will say, it has lowered my BP considerablly. I can't imagine being on a higher dose.....all you people on 1500+ MG a day...it sounds like way too much and the person on 20mg almost doesn't sound as though it would work its such a low dose. I have extremely dry eyes, nose, mouth, throat and my doctor is trying to tell me its the dry air in my house. I wake up and can't even swallow....everything is just stuck in my mouth.  My tongue even cracked from it being dry. He doesn't beleive it is the med doing this to me.  I bought a humidifier and it did nothing.all my joints ache, my neck is very stiff and the neck pain is going up into my inner ears.  I can't turn my head from side to side without extreme pain. I am allergic to many meds, so am limited on what I can take.  He doesn't see my complaints as being severe enough to take me off the pill.I am also on Clonidine, but he doesn't like that pill, but it is one that has worked up until now. I feel for all you complaining because its very hard to function when you feel like crap.  It also makes you gain weight and here the doc is telling me to loose 50 lbs.....nothing like shoveling against the tide........he says go walking.  I can't stand long enough to get a good walk in.

Scalp tingling, Nausea, shakes and as the other poster said very &quot;Blah&quot; I was on verapimil before i was pregnant and it did not have these side effects but they will not prescribe me Verapimil because my liver enzymes.  I have begged to have it changed and have asked for a referral to an internal medicine doctor. I am 30 yrs old not overweight and this drug does not work. Would never recommend this to anybody. I am on the verge of stopping taking it because of how crappy i feel.

Scalp tingling for first 3 weeks --still occ. occurrence.  Fatigue is a persistent problem, especially noted with AM dose.  Also seem to have persistent dry-stuffed nose.
High Blood Pressure	Julescat, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	6/15/2011 9:40:41 AM	This was the first HBP pill I was ever on. BP usually 140-150/80's range w/out drug. Overweight by about 80-100 lbs and not good dealing with stress (which combined is why I feel I have HBP to being with). Was on Latetalol for about 1 month, just weened off. Feel so much better, tho BP still needs addressed. This pill did nothing but give me side effects. Lowered HR but not BP (couple of pts maybe). I experienced scalp tingling; dry eyes, nose, sinuses, mouth, and throat; constipation which has apparently lead to development of hemmeroids (nice!); short, infrequent bouts of tinitus (read online about ototoxic drugs - another nice!), bloody nose (from dryness), extreme tireness and could barely workout. Felt like I was gonna fall off the eliptical from lack of energy after 5 minutes! How are you suppose to lose weight to help control BP naturally when this stuff makes you a big sloth with no energy?! Would wake up at night unable to breath through my nose 'cause it was stuffed up. Had indigestion - food felt like a lump in stomach. Just not a good pill AT ALL for me. Suppose to start CLonidine, but after reading those reviews, I am rethinking. I know I am risking health problems going untreated, but I do not like pharmacutical treatment. I am going to try niacin for vasodialation, exercise along with yoga and meditation, therapy and diet changes instead. My Dr. didn't even know niacin was a vasodialator (uh, hello?). Think I need new Dr. too while I am at it. Seems effects are severe or not based on the individual. I've never taken other drugs so maybe I'm just sensetive. Didn't like AT ALL! Had best work-out in weeks last night while off this drug. Felt good!

The swelling is so bad I can't put on my shoes or make a fist with my hands; breathing is difficult, chest pain, fatigue and migraines. The Dr. nor the medication have helped me.

High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	12/5/2010 7:05:35 AM	I was switched to this medication around my 25th week of pregnancy when the Atenolol I had previously been on stopped working.  I started on 200mg a day and was gradually increased to 2400mg a day all with no real result in lowering my BP.  It did remove the headaches and swelling which I see as a con because if I was not checking my readings several times a day, my main warning signals for elevated pressure were gone.  I thought this made this medication really dangerous.  During the pregnancy I did experience the extreme nipple burning sensation that was horrible and the nausea once I got on the higer dose.  After the pregnancy I was so dizzy and I could barely take care of my baby for the first two weeks because I couldn't stand up without the room spinning and feeling like my ears were full of water.  It was really scary and I started to think I would never get better.  After stopping the medication and switching back to the Atenolol and adding hydrochlorothorizde all the crazy side effects went away but my bp is still up.

I had tingling scalp, slight nausea, but I think the worst of it has been the night sweats and the hot flashes. I at first thought I was going through menopause, but when I stopped taking the drug, the severe sweating stopped also. I was hot ALL the time! A note to all those women who are taking this to be able to control bp while pregnant. There are other good drugs out there you can take. I took methyldopa while I was pregnant and it did an okay job. I will start a new medicine tomorrow. I pray I won't have any bad side effects. I am sick of trying new drugs.

I have had the ringing in my ears mostly at night. My biggest issue is sweating and intolerance of heat. After reading the other posts I guess the med is also causing the tiredness and shortness of breath on exertion. It took care of the pounding rapid heart rate.

I was prescribed 200mg, once a day. Pros- It controlled my high blood pressure.Cons- Even after one year of taking this medication, I still have extreme scalp tingling. I began taking it at night because it made me tired. Not so much sleepy, but lethargic. This medication also did not help with the fluid rentention in my legs, so I have since been switched to another medication. Hope this helps!

High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	6/21/2010 7:21:42 PM	At 20 weeks pregnant was diagnosed with High Blood Pressure and put on this medicine 100mg twice a day.  Had many side effects scalp tingling, dizziness, and tired.  One side effect that was not listed was an intense burning pain in my breast/nipple area.  When I went back to the Dr. my bp had remained high and she bumped my doseage up to 200mg twice a day.  This made all the side effects worse and the breast/nipple pain debilitating.  1 more dose tonight then taking a different medicine in the morning.

Trying to figure out a time to take them without the dizziness and tiredness that comes right with them.  Overall the drug helps keep the BP down and with all the other meds I give him it is controlled reasonably better.  No time seems like the right time to give him so much medication.

I was switched to Labetalol by my Ob/GYN when I decided to try to become pregnant (was on Atenolol previously, which worked great: BP was 118/80 most days); dosage of Labetalol was low: 100 mg twice a day.  I had the scalp tingling side effect, but it was no big deal.  After two weeks, no change in my BP but started to become extremely fatigued.  By third week, I could barely leave the house and was crying for no reason.  I was going to stick it out for the sake of getting pregnant but the depression completely took over.  I'm sure it's a great drug for some people, but for me, it was a nightmare.

I have been taking Labetalol for about 5 months now. I still have horrible scalp tingling! It has helped control my BP, but the fatigue is still a problem. Def not the Rx for me.
High Blood Pressure	jetmac, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	5/27/2009 4:48:44 PM	Originally on methyldopa, my bp began to skyrocket after birth of my 3rd child.  Methyldopa only mildly effective, but I was not on it long.  Doc switched to labatelol with no directives on taking with food.  Made me dizzy extremely fatigued and nauseated.  Pharmacist changed label on next refill to say take with milk and food.  That helped the above symptoms, but my blood pressure has not changed at all.  Not worth the frustration of making sure I have milk/food every time I have to take it (2x/day 200mg).

High Blood Pressure	kjnross06, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	5/7/2009 1:05:09 PM	I was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 25. Heart disease runs in my family, predominantly in the women. I am 5&quot;8, 145 lbs, and would consider myself healthy besides the high BP. I was prescribed Labetalol first and just went back to have my Rx changed to a different med. I was on 200mg once a day. I experienced tingling of the scalp and that I could deal with... but the 5lb weight gain and fatigue was very annoying! I felt very &quot;blah&quot; all of the time. Although it controlled my BP, wasn't happy with the tiredness. I'll let you know how the new Lotensin Rx works.

At age 43 and pregnant I used Labetalol and it was effective in controlling my blood pressure. One month after giving birth I was still feeling exhausted and foggy feeling. My doctor slowly returned me to Atenolol and it was like an immediate change. No more foggy-headedness; my head felt clearer and I was less tired. How I felt while on Labetalol and off it was like night and day. It was amazing considering I was starting to think I was experiencing postnatal depression. Anyone experiencing this after pregnancy should really talk to their doctor to see if Labetalol is the cause. For me, it was a very effective drug while pregnant (and possibly saved mine and baby's life) but not so helpful after baby was born.

I went from 100mg to 200mg t0 300mg, and am now on 400mg twice a day. This med does not seem to be lowering my blood pressure. Also I have gained 5 lbs. and feel tired.

High Blood Pressure	13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	13-18	12/11/2008 12:10:24 PM	When I first started taking this drug, I had severe shaking for the first 3 days I was on it. My blood pressure was still high (150/90 area, I am 17) After those first three days, which I couldn't even leave my bed because I was shaking so much, the shaking started to slow down a lot. Now my hands just shake a little, and I notice that I don't shake when I forget to take my medicine. I was on lisinopril before I started this medicine and don't know if that is what caused my shaking. Now, after about 2 months in, my blood pressure has only dropped a small amount and my heart rate is actually higher (used to be in the 60s, now its usually high 70s or 80s) Overall, I don't think this medicine is doing much for me if anything at all.

High Blood Pressure	Kelly, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	35-44	8/27/2008 1:28:33 AM	Was on hyzaar and doing great.  My husband and I were thinking about having kids and the doctor put me on labetalol.  Since being on it, I gained 20 pounds in no time.  I was used to a diuretic.  My legs are so swelled, they ache and hurt all the time.  I have asthma anyway and even the lung specialist can't figure out why I am unable to breathe.  They put me on a water pill to alleviate some of the swelling, but it doesn't help much. I feel so bloated and miserable.  I have even lost 70 pounds since I gained the 30.  I would think I should be feeling great.  I can't walk from the car into Walmart without hovering over a bugging or stopping every little bit.  I am only 36, but I feel worse now than I did 8 months ago when I was put on this and I should be feeling great with a 70 pound weight loss!

After a couple of weeks I have started to get used to it and it does not cause the tiredness that it first did, I did discover that if I ate before hand it helped tremendously and I felt much better. 
High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	4/19/2008 8:49:10 PM	Only taking 100mg doses.  It lowered my BP- however, side effects included tingling of scalp and hands (lessens over time), difficulty concentrating and remembering things, and some difficulty catching my breath.  Relieved to see other state they re tired- I am too but did not know that could be from the meds....
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	3/30/2008 7:20:34 PM	Started taking labetalol about 5 months ago 200mg 2xday.  Just reduced to 100mg 2xday due to always so tired and bp was so up and down ( low100's on a regular basis) for a couple of weeks.  Just using my arms and walking long distances was wearing me out a couple of hours after taking the meds.  Hopefully a lesser dose will help with being so tired and will not raise my bp again.  
High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/22/2008 11:10:15 PM	Labetalol was first given to me to treat hypertension ranging from 140/90 to 161/105 and was highly effective in lowering it to normal levels under 120/80. The downside to it was extreme fatigue. I actually have to take 50 mg twice a day even though the lowest dose is 100 mg. (I have to take 2 half pills per day)The 100 mg twice per day was too much for me and caused extreme dizziness and I felt almost like I might pass out. Taking a half a pill twice per day (morning and evening) has caused no other side effects other than being very tired and has been very effective at keeping my blood pressure within normal ranges.

I do have a occasional VERY low b.p. ( 80/30 ) but then I can be at 200/1120 in no time with no reasons, have passed all tests, imaging. they want to change the med because of my low times and every med they try either makes me ill or causes my bp to skyrocket so now I refuse the playing around and only will take labetalol
