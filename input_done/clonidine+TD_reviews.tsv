For 2 months this seemed to work just fine. Going into the 3rd month, I began exeriencing increasing flashes again. My doctor switched me from the brand to generic and I am waiting to see results. Side effects? 1) I get a localized skin reaction where the patch was applied, so I have square &quot;scars&quot; all over from each patch. 2) I have been getting small sores inside my nose, which could be a side effect, or could be something else, I just haven't had them before.

I was doing fine until the pharmacy changed suppliers.  Now I cannot tolerate the drug and it no longer controls the hot flashes due to Tamoxifin treatment for cancer.

They put me on meds to supress any hormones my body may be putting out even tho I had a complete hysterectomy over 12 years ago. The hot flashes have gotten increasingly worse. It's like taking a shower with my body providing the water For the first month I could NOT keep the patch on no matter what. I tried just the patch, the patch with the white cover and finally with bandaids over everything and even with these clear adhisive covers. NOTHING worked! Today the nurse said to try that sports wrap the sticks to itself. It  is stretchy and I can't imagine wearing all night without taking it off in my sleep since it constricting my arm and has to to stay on. I am overweight and have large upper arms whick may be a problem with the sports wrap. I can't say if it works or not since I haven't been able to keep one on! My friend is a massage therapist and has some type of a paper tape that may be able to work. I'll contrack her tomorrow. Maybe they don't expect women to have such hot and WET hot flashes when they made the patch.

Symptoms from Stopping Treatment with Opioid Drugs	Anna, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	2/2/2011 12:51:26 PM	I was on morphine 90mg 3x a day for 2yrs. It's side effects and had stopped working so I,my Dr,husband decided to taper off. I went through withdrawals and was given clonidine for them as needed. After two mos. I was off the morphine. After a week I was still having withdrawals(my Dr.said not likely) but prescribed clonodine for my bp the cause of the withdrawals. This medication makes me feel like a zombie and my heart still races. She wants to put me on the patch. I want off this med.

One of the side effects of that med is excessive sweating that I found unbearable.  Now I wear a 0.1 mg Clonodine patch and it helps a lot to relieve this bothersome side effect.
High Blood Pressure	booskitten, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/25/2010 1:22:37 PM	have had hbp for years, olds meds did'nt cut it anymore. 48 hours after putting on the patch bp was great. the patch does'nt stick well and the cover does cause a rash, you can move the patch around but the rash stays around forever and you dont get extra covers. i cant say enough good about this patch its saved my life. bp was 140/123 now nice and normal 120/72. my only concern: i understand if you forget to replace the patch or loose it with out knowing your bp can skyrocket.

I was given a generic form and it made my blood pressure go sky high.  I almost died.  I must have the name brand.  What is the differnce in the name brand and generic that made my blood pressure go up so high?

High Blood Pressure		4	5	3			8/10/2008 3:38:34 PM	I have used this for two weeks now, and I'm not sure I'm going to continue. I have experienced extreme tiredness and very dry mouth. I have not seen any dramatic change in my BP. I have also had significant weight gain since I started using this and it has only been 2 weeks! The patch is very easy to use but the cover did cause a rash and annoying itching.
