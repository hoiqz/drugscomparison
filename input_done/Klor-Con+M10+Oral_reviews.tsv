I had to double up every other day. I don't get tested again until Oct. I guess the jury is still out on this!

Last year in May, I started getting nauseated at different times of day.  I went to several Drs, I was also dizzy.  Even tho the Drs said the nausea and dizziness could not be drugs, I started eliminating the Klor-con (after reading the reviews).  It has been a week now, and I have not been nauseated once.  I will now have to eat more potassium-rich foods.

This is in spite of drinking 8+ oz. of water and a meal
