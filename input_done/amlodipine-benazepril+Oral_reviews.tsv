Both keep my BP down, especially after exercising.  Didn't seem to have any side effects; other than initially getting lite-headed after standing up too fast; libido is normal.  I don't really follow HBP diet guidelines.

It did keep my blood pressure down.  However, in the summer of 2008 I developed a cough (dry, intermittent) which progressed to a gag reflect several times a week.  No other condition appeared to have caused this cough.  My doctor switched me in October to Amlodipine only and said that she had heard about this side effect from other patients.
