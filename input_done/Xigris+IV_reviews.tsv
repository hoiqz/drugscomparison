Sepsis Syndrome	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/25/2010 11:25:24 PM	I had abdominal surgery and the dr. nicked my bladder.  I had a bladder infections at the time and didn't know it.  The infection spread to my brain so they put me on Xigres and on the ventilator for 1 week.  I had a 5% chance of survival.  They told my family I was not going to survive and the Xigres along with prayer from friends, family and strangers saved my life.

Sepsis Syndrome	nanak, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	12/13/2009 5:19:58 AM	After the first spinal surgery in 2006 for severe scoliosis to insert screws, I was due to have the second surgery to insert the rods.  The night before the 2nd surgery, I developed a very high fever &amp; was rushed to ICU.  Multiple cultures later showed I had severe sepsis from Klebsiella cultured from my central IV line.  Two days later I stopped breathing suddenly and ended up on a ventilator for 4 days.  I was given the Xigris over about 2 days and I guess it worked because I am alive today with no side effects from it.

Sepsis Syndrome	csummer, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	8/27/2008 2:33:40 PM	In July 2002, I was hospitalized with an e coli infection of the urinary tract. Within 12 hours, my bp dropped, my kidneys were failing, etc. My doctor in conjunction with an infectious disease specialist determined that I qualified for the Xigris treatment. After 36 hours of treatment, I was out of ICU and left the hospital 5 days later. Needless to say, I would not be writing this 6 years later, if the treatment were not available. I have followed the other trials and while I cannot speak for anyone but myself, I am thankful that it was available for me. 
Sepsis Syndrome	JAB, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	55-64	4/5/2008 11:47:09 AM	In June of 2003, I was in a coma with very little chance of survival.  All my systems were shutting down.  The doctors told my wife and children that I may only live another 24-48 hours.  After administering Xigris, I began to recover and within two days I was removed from the respirator and on the way to recovery. I didn't realize how experimental this drug was at the time but, it saved my life.

He has been in a induced coma as well. This medicine seems to have worked miracles as the first night he crashed but 5 days later he is starting to wake up and may be off the ventilator in a couple of days. I am so very grateful for this medicine.

I was in Septic Shock, I had sepsis, pulminary adima, ARDS, and double pnemonia. I had this drug in 2004 when it was still experimental. If they had not used this drug I would not be here right now and I would not have my beautiful baby girl. I would recommend this to anyone who can have it. If someone you know is dying and you have no other choice then ask about Xigris.
