Acne	kate, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	6/23/2012 7:30:54 AM	SEVERE PHOTOSENSITIVITY! Been on med 17 months. Nauseous every time I took it - 2X's p/d. Must take with food. Has caused serious severe photosensitivity.  In March - arms ,feet, and hands severely sunburned from unpacking boxes in sun for 2 hours.  Painful to touch, red with raised bumps. Cannot leave home w/o 50 Sunscreen.  June - just a few minutes of sun exposure (i.e.: walking from car to store) hands and feet burn even with sunscreen.  Can not drive with hands on top of car steering wheel, must keep them on bottom palms up. Large blood filled blisters developed on toes and had to be lanced.   Must keep feet covered at all times.  Knuckles are always red and burn, must apply sunscreen several times per day.  Had to stop med. Hopefully when out of my system photosensitivity will be too - but no guarantee!  Be very careful!

Lyme Disease	35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1		35-44	3/31/2012 9:20:20 PM	I started taking this medication after symptoms of Lyme.  The first night I took it I had severe chills that lasted hours, headache,  was very restless/anxious, and had increased salivation which was so bad I started drooling.  The dr. told me to keep taking it because those side effects were not listed.???  The pharmacist did tell me to stop taking it, as side effects could get worse with continued use.  Anyone else have these symptoms?

Other	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female		2/5/2012 7:32:18 PM	I take this med for an immune def. problem. I have hair loss and sores around the hair follicles. I used doryx which is the genuine product and have had much better results. Unfortunately the price of those pills is cost prohibitive so we are stuck with the generic. With this generic pill my skin is very sensitive to the sun, I break out into an itchy rash, yeast infections and worst is the chest congestion. I realized that after getting over a bad chest cold, for a couple of days my chest congestion was gone and I wasn't short of breath. Then the congestion returned and hasn't left since.

Lyme Disease	 (Patient) 	4	5	4			10/26/2010 2:43:18 PM	I took it, twice this year after being bitten by deer ticks.  No noticeable side effects.  just a little bit of upset stomach occasionally when I take it n the morning on an empty stomach which I didn't attribute to the drug initally but after reading some of the posts it fits the pattern.  i feel like the odd person who doesn't have a problem with it.  After seeing the effects of Lymes diesease on others I am happy to have the drug.  but have been on it so much this summer i was wondering what long term effects it might have.  The darn ticks are so small that you cannot feel them on your skin like a regular tick and I almost never find them until they are embedded in my skin.
Lyme Disease	medusa24, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	19-24	9/20/2010 3:26:29 PM	This medication is pretty harsh on the stomach. Taking a medication without food is not something I am used to and I have a fairly sensitive stomach so it has not been the easiest for me. I hope that things will get easier but for people with easily upset stomachs use caution with this one.

I have sensitive &amp; already dry skin, so using acne washes just dried up my skin more, and gave me an allergic reaction. I have noticed extra discharge since taking this product and I hear it causes yest infections, so that is a con.

Lyme Disease	Staying Inside Now, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	6/18/2010 7:36:46 PM	I've been on it for a week now, with 2 more to go.  Haven't had any problems as far as stomach.  Have had a headache, but don't know if it is from the drug or lyme disease (which has been excruiating).  My main problem seems to be that I am having trouble sleeping.  I've not slept for more than an hour at a time since I've been on it, but I'm not seeing that as a side effect for anyone else, so again I don't know if it is the drug or a symptom of Lyme. It has been effective on the &quot;bullseye&quot; rash and the joint pain is getting better, so I would have to say overall it has been an okay experience.

It's best to take this medication with a full meal, preferably dinner and drink plenty of water, about 1 1/2 cups, if not more.  The only thing I experienced during the first 3 days was nausea, which happened the next morning.  I haven't experienced the pill stuck in the throat feeling, but I did experience that the first time I tried this medication, which was about 3 years ago.  Drink, drink, drink is my best advice.  Even if you drink juice, follow it up with a cup of water.

I still dont have a clear clear face though, which is very upsetting seeings how i take it twice a day. I have had no side effects and could even take it on an empty stuomach until about 4 days ago when i started having pain in my chest and it kind of hurts to swallow. I'm not sure if this is just because I've just started up school again and everyone is sick there or if its the medicine side effects? Please help?

Lyme Disease	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	65-74	5/6/2009 3:32:55 PM	Use of this drug was difficult. It was prescribed as a preventative course of action to protect from Lyme's Disease since I had been bitten by two ticks. The ticks were tested and were negative so the drug was unnecessary but had there been the Lyme's Disease present it would have warded off more serious symptoms by getting the drug into my system earlier.While I did not experience nausea, my stomach was affected. A couple of days into the 5 days course diarrhea started and although not consistent throughout the time I took it, that was followed by stomach pains after 4 days and continued a few days after stopping the drug. Since I take Prilosec for GERD I may have avoided the heartburn which some have complained about on this site. But, it is a drug to be avoided if something else will do for Lyme's. Zithromax, if appropriate, is a lot easier to tolerate and does not produce these symptoms.

In a few weeks I will be returning to my dermatologist to see exactly how effective it has been. Along with a face cream prescribed it has worked absolutely fabulously! My face is extremely clear. But I haven't noticed much help in my body acne which is a little upsetting. Another thing is that it is very difficult to use. I have been experiencing achy headaches for awhile now, and occasionally I get nausea. You just have to mess around with what you take it with. Its actually better for me to take it with a small snack, but I recommend to anyone suffering with acne to take it!
Sinus Irritation and Congestion	quarry46, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	2/15/2009 8:33:36 AM	Upon taking the capsule I was sick in my stomach within 1/2 hour.  Experienced severe pain and was not able to hold anything down.  Thought that maybe was due to taking with food so 2nd time took 1 hour prior to eating with 8 oz of water.  Experienced severe stomach pain and again could not hold anything down.  Will never take this again.  Suggest everyone to reconsider taking this medication.

Acne	shortcourt, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	3	Female	25-34	1/23/2009 5:52:15 PM	I have been taking this drug for about two months. I have seen a slight improvement in my skin (acne). I had no acne when I was a teenager and now in my 20's its embarassing in the workplace. However, I am unable to take this drug on an empty stomach. I vomit when I try to drink it down with water (very uncomfortable) and it causes me heartburn. I decided to try warm water. That seems to work better for me. Applesauce and mashed potatoes seem to help me also. Crackers DO NOT help and any kind of flavored water also makes me vomit within 2 hours of taking this medication. The results are probably worth it. I will continue taking this drug as long as I can to see what the results will be. I will also beware the warnings not to take this drug before bed. I have my schedule set up for 8am and 5pm (when I get to work and jsut before I leave work) so that if I have any problems the bathroom is nearby.

Please check all these things before using this.  I also have a question, could it be causative in the formation of kidney stones?  Remember to drink even more liquids.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	5	Female	25-34	12/11/2008 11:43:45 AM	Great drug but hard to take! I've had the same problems, take w/ or w/o food, am or pm......It works great on my acne, however, I cannot take it on an empty stomach as recommended. It cannot be taken before bed either, I had to learn that the hard way as well. It's a very trial an error kind of drug but once you get used to it I think it's worth taking.
Other	Mike CT, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male	35-44	12/9/2008 3:51:11 PM	Do not take before you go to bed! I was on this drug for months and got careless and went to bed to soon after taking 100mg. Woke up an hour later with severe heartburn. 2 days later I developed ulcers in my esophagus. Needless to say it is very very painful and just about impossible to eat. This is the 2nd time this has happened to me. I thought the first time my pain was from a physical injury to my chest because it takes a couple days for the ulcers to develop after you have the heartburn. Now I realize I had heartburn a couple days before I had my first esophagus pain. It took 2 weeks for the pain to go away the first time. This time I went to a clinic and am taking aciphex to help it heal. It has been about a week since my 2nd episode and the pain is just starting to let up a tiny bit. Still don't look forward to eating though! Besides taking it to close to bed time, I tolerated it ok if I took it after a meal.

I am still suprised that because I never had acne in my teen years, my acne started when I was 20 and pregnant. Now its taking 2 meds and still not the results I want. Also be careful some people need to eat something when taking this med or they will feel sick for about an hour after taking this med.

I am very happy with the effectiveness of the drug however, it also tends to make the consumer very photosensitive (sensitive to sun light).  As a drum major of a drum corps, I am in the sun sometimes up to 12 hours a day and this medicine makes it very difficult to keep from getting sunburned.

I have to take two weeks of this medicine and I really don't want to but I'll tough it out. I did notice that I had a few more pimples on my face than I usualy do so maybe in the end it will clear up my annoying acne on my chin. I haven't had any problems with my stomach, but tonight was the first night I took the medicine without food and went to bed I now feel like I have something in my throat. I little annoying.

After one week on the med, my eye improved. However, the side effect of light sensitivity drastically increased as well. My hands burned after only 20 minutes in the car driving. Also, my hands tingle and feel like they are burning when exposed to direct or indirect heat. Typing this note is actually making them burn.

I am currently taking doxycycline (100 mg cap) for one month and there is slight improvement to clearing my acne issue.  I take this med on empty stomach based on recommendation from this website to maximize the med full effectiveness.  The med did give me a slight headache but I was able to tolerate it.  If you can take it on an empty stomach, go for it.I have also read that the results will begin after six weeks, so be patient.  I have two more weeks to go.  I still have acne but it is less than one month ago.  I will report back in three to four weeks on my next result.  I cant wait until my face no longer has acne!I hope you will have good results.  Having acne sucks!  Good luck.

The only turn-off about the drug is I vomited after every time I took it because I didn't have a full stomach. I even ate oatmeal and other filling things and I still vomited. It might just be my stomach, but otherwise it helped me tremendously. I only had to use this pill for one month.

Also, I have learned that I need to drink more than 8 oz. of fluid when I take this medication. If I do not, I become miserable nauseated.

(most of you who are reading this understand what i'm talking about.) i'll post again in a week, hopefully with better news. i've decided to only give it 3 weeks, then i'm going back to minocycline. good luck to all. cheers! also if you have any info. that you'd like to send me please email me at mikeballer11@yahoo.com. thanks

I have seen it work in as little as two weeks. Of course with all new acne medications, it makes your skin worse before it gets better. I would say that after the first week, my skin started to really clear up quite nicely. I would recommend this product to anyone. As far as eating something with this medication, i have not felt any side effects of not eating anything. Maybe it is because I am young, so my stomach can handle it.
