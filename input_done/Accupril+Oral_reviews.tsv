Have only been able to get BP down to around 155/84. Made me so tired needed to take at bedtime.  I also always have some slight swelling of hands and around eye area.  Stopped taking and tried other BP meds but now back on Accupril as side effects on other BP Meds worse. Back to square 1 now.

Because I did'nt have high blood pressure, I had to take 2.5mg to start off with and now I'm on 5mg and don't think I am having any major hassles.  Have developed a cough that sometimes interferes with my eating and makes me a bit breathless.  Not too worried though.  I'm 41 and had a life expectancy of 10 so not doing too bad lol

Started to not be enough. Increased Accupril and heart started fluttering (double beating). Stopped all meds for a week and BP went to 156/110. Started on HCTZ 25mg and Attenolol 25mg(had taken this before). Dropped to 140/97 with a 67 pulse. Added 5 MG of Quinapril to the mix and dropped to 122/84 but pulse dipped to 49. Not sure what to do now. Feel light headed, but relaxed.

I feel less social most of the time unless it is during the time I feel good.

Perimenaupause changed all that, it seems like it went high all the sudden.   I had an pretty easy time getting adjusted to this medication, sleepy if I laided down, however I welcomed the rest.  I had not been resting well at all.
