I asked when I can stop, his answer was &quot;NOT FOR NOW&quot;. When will a generic be available because the drug is very expensive. I understand the drug comes off patent protection in May of 2012. Don't know how soon a generic will be available.

Instead of relying on Plavix for blood thinning I've become a vegan and take Omega 3.  Coming up on a year since I stopped and have had no problems.  Plavix is way over prescribed in my opinion.

I have no recourse but to now purchase them through Canada. I don't trust the F.D.A. or the pharmaceutical companys, I beleive there all in one another's pockets just like the washington itself. I'll but my trust in the Lord, he's never let me down and not looking to rip me off like the pharmaceutical companys. There is a women doctor in germany that has done alot of natural remedes in replacing plavix and i heard some people have been off of plavix for years and with no problems at all. I can tell you this, when I was a child i got real sick from something that i ate, my stomack blew way out to the point I couldn't even walk the  only doctor that was around on the chesapeake bay was an real old african american doctor who gave me a table spoon of sugar and pured rum on it till it overflowed within minutes i felt like nothing ever happen. for 30 years i would ask doctors what they throught they just all shouck there heads. when i was in maine i saw a homapathic doctor and told him of what happen. he yelled of cource, the influx of sugar neutrialized the gasses in the stomach immeadeately ever since i keep sugar in glove box. so much for the doctor's from U of Penn. along with others. The point is, always research natural remedies and prayer it works well for me and good luck to all.

I started taking Plavix months after recovering from the stroke but the Plavix almost did me in.  I was having severe respiratory problems and my heart was throbbing uncontrollably. I ended up in the hospital and now have to take Xanax because of the lasting effects of Plavix.  Make sure you check out the &quot;rare&quot; symptoms of this and any other drug prescribed by your physician.  I used to think doctors knew everything but unfortunately learned from experience that this is not the case. Make sure you check out whatever medications are going into your body before you take them.

Started to cut the plavix up. First in half, then quarter, then eighths. Felt better each time. Now five months later I take no meds.Except for the aspirin. I take supplements after watching &quot;food matters&quot; documentary. These plus diet and exercise helped the body heal. I feel great. The cardio doc is mad. Said I was going to die in five weeks. That was twelve weeks ago. I refuse to take this poison again.

I have been on Plavix(75MG) since that time. Also Metropole, Lipitor and an aspirin. Took Prilosec otc until interaction issues came up. Sure miss my little purple pill. I have not had any issues with Plavix during this time except blood taking longer to clot on any cuts etc. which one should expect when taking a blood thinner. Have had issues with shortness of breath when physical exerting. Example: walking through deep snow. I felt this had more to do with taking Metropole since it affects blood pressure. Did not consider Plavix as the problem.

My side effects for Plavix include itching, slight hurt sensation in left eye; out of breath, mid-to-late day tiredness; and most othersome, some numbness in left arm and left hand...with a hint of same in right hand.  Overall, i think this drug is far from being the right drug for everyone.  See FDA Blackbox Warning on FDA site.  Will attend again to get the Cardiologist to come up with something else.  Of course he predicts dire consequences if don't take one of the drug companies wonders over simple multiple aspirins).  It also has been instructive that virtually none of my doctors have seemed to ever monitor their patients for allergic reactions to what the drug company reps are pushing.  Good luck to all on this drug...some of us are going to really need it.

We were also told that now that he's on it he cannot get off because it could cause a heart attack.  I can't believe a doctor would put someone on something that they can't get off of when they aren't even sure of what the diagnosis was.

Now after almost 15 months, can't get out of bed, sleeping all the time, can hardly walk the pain is unbearable, pain in left shoulder and arm, confusion, headache. Went on line and found many people with same side effects. Am taking myself off Plavix and contacting my doctor this morning. I also take a baby asprin along with Plavix. I can't stand this feeling! I'd rather have surgery then go through this. I have no life! Can hardly hold up my head!! Can't concentrate. Anyone else feel like this?

My new cardiologist told me that normally they keep patients on it for about a year, but advised me to keep taking it if I chose to do so.

I have now been off of the Plavix for two weeks, and still waiting for the rash to clear up.

About three years ago, myhusband had Bypass Surgery. He was givenheperin during surgery and sent home withPlavix and aspirin. I know this is procedureto prevent further clots, but the doctors were aware of my husband's serious ulcercondition. Also, an ongoing prescription ofpercocet/oxycodone. He was not given anything for his ulcers or carafate. The doctors were aware of partial stomach andpartial intestines removed because of ulcers. They were also aware of an ulceratedesophogus.  About a year later, the ulcers in his  esophogus became cancerous. Of course, it was a pre-existing condition, butthat is why, they should have used precaution in his case.

Angioplasty opened blockages and medicated stents were fitted. Post procedure, I was prescribed Plavix, 325mg ASA, as well as Metoprolol and Simvastatin. I am a diabetic and also am prescribed Cymbalta for neuropathy, as well as Januvia, and Metformin. I also take Synthroid for hypothyroidism. Everything has been fine with my meds EXCEPT for Plavix. I had an allergic reaction: flu-like symptoms, diarrhea (every 15 mins), hives, severe rash over entire body (triggered by eating oranges), extreme itching (worse than poison ivy!), and lack of appetite. Quality of life has dropped off drastically after only one week of Plavix. Living isn't worth living if I have to continue to live this way, so I will continue with the aspirin, but it's bye bye Plavix! I hate this med! My cardiologist may not like my decision when I see him three days from this writing, but maybe he can recommend an alternative med. Otherwise, I'll take my chances. I hope this helps some of you who may identify with some of the side effects I have been experiencing. God bless those of you who have experienced few or no side effects with Plavix!

On 11/20/09 I read in the Detroit Free Press an article regarding the FDA's findings when taking Plavix w/Prilosec (generic Omeprazole) or Nexium.  Their findings indicate that the effectiveness of Plavix can be reduced by as much as HALF when combined w/these heartburn medications.  Please consult with your doctor. My husband suffered an actute myodcardial infarction (sp?) in the ER. He wanted to lay down when the pressure started in his upper chest - but I called 911 - and he had the heart attack in the ER; he was shocked to get his heart started again.  He later that a 5 artery heart bypass (arteries too weak for stents) and almost one year later is doing A-OK - he was 61 when it happened.  He takes Plavix to prevent a reoccurance.  He also takes Omeprazole (generic of Prilosec) - but THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE - he needs the Plavix and will switch to Zantac within the next 2 weeks!  I want him around - he is my best friend!

Until taking the Zyban I was always in good health so the result of the scan came as a complete surprise as, as far as I was aware I have never suffered a stroke.  I was prescribed plavix for life as I did have an stomach ulcer when I was younger and therefore could not take aspirin.  I have recently found out from a neuro surgeon that there is a danger of bleeding in the brain should I have to have an emergency operation however if I did come off Plavix there could be danger of a stroke.  Since 2000 is there an alternative that someone like myself could take and could I suggest this to my GP

Today, I can't walk because the pain is so bad that I can't lift my leg. Crying, the pain is so bad. Have missed many days of work since taking Plavix, but Dr. says that it is imperative that I continue. I don't think I can do it. Thinking of just taking aspirin.

As an educated consumer I made sure to inform myself of any possible side effect and have been keeping a closer eye to my body.  The side effect I have shown as urinary track infection which send me to the ER with severe pains caused by coagulated blood in my urinary track.  I also take 81 mg aspirin hoping to get off of both of them soon. Per WEBMD,the maximum length of time to take plavix should be 3 years.  I am hoping that after my stent's one year anniversary and my stress test results my doctor let's me try to go with out it or something else.  My urinary track is taking a serious toll.

Heart Attack	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	65-74	9/12/2009 11:44:01 AM	I had a stent emplacement in March 2009. My experience echoes those of other reviewers. I can no longer drink coffee, milk, or eat peanut butter and some forms of sugar cause the same reaction. The reaction is frightening a general pain throughout my chest and throat which carries to my arms and hands. It lasts for about 3-5 minutes and can be so acute that if I am ambulatory I must sit down. I take it along with simvastatin, a beta blocker, sarvastatin a blood pressure reducer and asprin. It is a cocktail of fear to which my genetic composition reacts violently. Can some one tell me what TTP is? I see it listed as a possible negative side effect of substantial negativity. I was gratified to see that some others have had the same reaction.

However, I have experienced an unusual weight gain and I cannot seem to shake the pounds, even with a three day a week regimen at the gym.  Is there any evidence that Plavix could cause this ? Or is there any suggestion that metabolic rates could be slowed by the Plavix, or the Plavix in combination with other meds for blood pressure, cholesterol etc. ?

It frightens me. I also take beta blockers and blood pressure medication along with simastatin. I would like to switch to some other drug to treat the same condition treated by Plavix. I dread taking it, it must be my genetic system allergic reaction.

They occur only on my hands and forearms where they are readily seen.  Our climate is too warm to wear log-sleeved shirts, so I must grin and bear these blemishes.

He is 84 and still active. Just had another small stroke~now adding aspirin.  I want him back to coumidin(sp)...dr. giving problems about this but I feel this is the most unsafe medicine on market.  Aggrenox (sp) &amp; aspirin was fantastic....this medicine is horrible. Only been on for 6 months been depressed, doesn't want to do anything, gained weight, headaches...almost a whole different person.  This medicine is the worst.

I now bruise very easily and have excessive bleeding with the tiniest scratch. I have had dizziness on occasion, but it is not a common occurrence. I am starting to get dry itchy spots on my skin that I haven't seen before. I do have psoriasis so I don't know if it is that or plavix causing the new lesions. I want to get rid of the side effects, but I guess they are preferred over a heart attack.

My husband called 911 when I passed out. I was given a transfusion. I was taking this medicine for three years along with 325 mg of asprin. I've had three stents, the last two 3/08. I saw the Cardio Dr in April and asked to be taken off the Plavix and she gave her reason to keep me on it another year then in June I was rushed (ambulance) to the hospital with a bad unstable angina attack had the angiogram done and found out one of the last two stents in 3/08 was 60% blocked so how well did the Plavix work and now I have two ulcers directly related to the Plavix and asprin. Not one physician advised me the combination was deadly. Not until this latest ambulance trip to the emergency room did a doctor advice me to stop taking PLAVIX!!!If you take this drug I would advise you to do so with caution. My stent still got clogged, my stomach was bleeding and I needed a transfusion now I have uclers to deal with. It will be a cold day before I go back on Plavix.

I was placed on Plavix right after a heart attack.  6 months later, Heart Cath for 2 stents.  1 year later, heart cath, 2 more stents and a pacemaker; 1 year later, 2 more stents.  I have taken Plavix the whole time, never missed a dose.  Since I decided it did not work in keeping platelets from sticking and blocking my arteries, my mood has increased.  I believe that Plavix made me feel mean.  Plus, Plavix cost $75.00 without health insurance.  It doesn't make one bleed more than usual, I never had that problem.  It did upset my stomach and make me bloated too.  So, I'm off Plavix!

Same thing happened to me with Plavix and aspirin daily.  Doctors did not listen to the symptoms listed above.  After eight months, went to hospital thinking I was having another heart attack.  Result: 24 ulcers, including three in esophagus, along with esophageal scarring.  The symptoms listed above were from the ulcers, which I have now been told were caused by the Plavix and the aspirin.  Am currently under treatment for ulcers with a PPI, which I have now learned (thanks to WEB MD) that the PPI can interfere with the effects of the Plavix.  Hope this helps someone.

Went to Doc that Saturday, he immediately took me off the Plavix saying I was in the 5% that could not take this drug and that if I had this side effect there were others I would suffer relating to the bones that Plavix also causes. He gave me Heparin to inject 3 times a day.

A stint was installed, I was placed on Plavix, linisopril, pravastatin and 81 mg asprin.  the only side effect I have had is easily bruising and the slighest scratch causes bleeding but nothing major.  I am satisfied with this drug.  Others have complained about the cost of the drug but I happen to be fortunate enough to have a drug insurance program by being retired from the military and it only cost me $9.00 per 30 day supply

The surgeon put in 2 medicated stents. I had large bruises on my arms and legs. I take 75mg Plavix and 81mg aspirin. I have had some chest pain and fluttering. The most bothersome effect by far, is itching from head to toe. There are lumps on my head and I cannot sleep due to itch. I have had drug reactions and allergies in the past. I nearly died from a Coumadin allergy after a knee replacement. This is the closest I've been to that felling since then. I told the doctor I was itching and had no response from him.My throat feels tight and swollen. Someone mentioned sulpha drug in relation to Plavix. I hope not, as I'm am highly allergic to them. I appreciate the comments. About to go out of my mind with ITCH!!!

It works great until he needs to be off it for a few days for any Medical procedure (even for two days, even if they switch him over to another blood thinner during that time) he has another stroke each time.  A bit disheartening and something I think about each time I see a commercial for this drug, it might be the case with all blood thinners.  Just have to pray he doesn't need to go for any kind of surgery, avoid the dentist and colonoscopies.

It might be the Plavix but it also might be the stint. I had a drug-eluting Cypher stint inserted into my LAD artery. I think the drug that coats it is called Sirolimus. I've done some research on this drug and a rash is a common side effect along with several others I hope never to experience.Is it possible that I might be allergic to that drug? How would I ever know? I need to discuss this with my doctor whose opinion I trust, but in the meantime I think the Cordis Corp. needs to do more research on their Cypher stint and work on eliminating these side effects.
Blood Clot Prevention Following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention	mr vette, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	55-64	2/11/2009 4:45:17 PM	I was prescribed Plavix by the cardiologist after the insertion of a drug-eluted stint to repair a 90% blockage in the RCA. I've only been on it for a week and I don't like what's happening to my body. I've broken out with a severe rash all over my body especially my arms,legs and chest area. The constant itching is maddening and keeps me awake at nights. Also, I've noticed the bruising after only a few days. My doctor's first respons ( over the phone) was that it couldn't be the Plavix. He changed his opinion when he saw me in person. His solution was to prescribe a steriod (which has it's own inherent problems)and Benadryl. He was very emphatic in warning me that either I take the Plavix or have a heart attack. What am I to do? I'm not looking forward to experiencing the other side effects of stomach bleeding and ulcers. I don't want to be cynical but are we patients at the mercy of overly aggressive drug salesmen and willing doctors anxious to receive their perks? What do I do? It's a serious quality of life issue vs. the possibility of a heart attack.Isn't there an alternative? Does any one know?

Do not have high colesterol--was put on the drug as a preventive measure due to 90% blockage that can't be explained.  My doctor was way too quick in dispenssing the prescription.  I was not informed to be aware of side effects of the drug.  Took myself off of Plavix-not worth the pain or the risk.

I have loss of appetite, nausia, constipation, extreme tiredness.  I stopped taking it for two days(dr gave me a choice of adult aspirin or Plavix) and my digestive problems are disappearing.  To me it is a quality of life issue.  To offset the problems I had with P. the doctor perscribed stool softener and serious antinausia meds.  I think it becomes a slippery slope when you start to pile up meds and each creates its own problems leading to more perscriptions.

So I stopped the Pravastatin - nothing--so I stopped the plavix and had immediate relief. Other side effects from this drug - body weakness (mainly legs), chest pain, pain and &quot;heat&quot; in soles of my feet, and chills when standing from sitting position.  I would not recommend this drug to anyone!

After a triple by-pass, my Dr. put me on Plavix. IT WORKED TOO WELL. A year later I developed internal bleeding in my left eye. Both eye specialists told me it &quot;probably&quot; was caused due to the thinning of my blood by Plavix. After three operations, I'm now 80% blind in my left eye.  Now, I've gone a year and a half without Plavix and so far things are fine.Has anybody else had this happen?  An aspirin a day is all I take now....1 1/2 years later so far no problems.

Clot was removed and stent inserted.  I was on 75mg plavix for about 5 months and, feeling well, went off of it.  When I went off of plavix, I started taking 81mg of aspirin.  I was not aware of any side effects at that time.  In Aug 08, I was diagnosed with a recurrence of my clot in and around the stent.  The clot was again removed and I have been on 75mg plavix and 81mg aspirin ever since and the drs tell me  probably for the rest of my life.  I am an otherwise healthy 59 year old with no heart or blood problems that the drs can detect.  The plavix and aspirin seem to be working although my arm is still (in Nov 08) slightly swollen and discolored, which worries me a little.  I have definitely had more &quot;senior moments,&quot; however that can also be attribted to a hectic job and family life!  So, overall, plavix has worked for me and I seem to have had no serious side effects to this point.

Plavix changed the platelet makeup and weakened the blood vessels in the head.  Be very careful and have your physician order regular blood tests to see what your blood count is. Blood tests are not routinely ordered when using Plavix.  They are with Coumadin.

No bleeding or bruising problems. Never considered sore muscles, joints and cramping from plavix till I read the reviews. Also had noticed forgetfullness and slight confusion at times. Attributed it to turning 65 until I read reviews. Howerer it is also attributed to long term use of lipitor. Scheduled to see doctor at Cleveland Clinic in Jan. 2009.

Besides the easy bleeding and bruising, I suffer from fatigue which is getting worse.  My hands and feet are always hot and painful.  My knees are swelling and hurting.  If I sit for a while, I stiffen up and can hardly get back on my feet.  It eases up once I start moving, but with working at a computer most of the day, this is really difficult to deal with.  I am also having sinus problems.  I have also been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.  Is it the Fibromyalgia that's hurting me or the Plavix or is the Plavix exacerbating the fibro?

Prevention of Blood Clots in the Brain	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	5	1	Female		7/22/2008 11:06:23 PM	My father was put on Plavix about four months ago, since then he experienced extreme stomach problems.  Bloating, tight and pain in the chest, bleching and more.  Very terrible side effects that keep him (and rest of the family) up all hours of the night. He  also became very confused. We are afraid to leave him home alone.  After reading other people's reviews, I asked him to stop the medication for a couple of weeks to see if his condition improve.   In my opinion, if the side effects are so awful, it is not worth benefit.

The R Coronary artery is completely closed, but collaterals have taken over about 90% of the blood flow. I may or may not have had a minor &quot;silent&quot; heart attack.  Not much ischemia, so no one is sure.  My doctor thought Plavix adding Plavix to my regimen would be a good idea.  Within days, I developed huge hematomas, the size of donuts on my arms, legs and chest.I looked like I went 10 rounds with a heavyweight boxer.My blood work  as also not much better.  Since the side effects were so severe, Plavix was removed from my treatment.  so far, so good.

I reported it to my doctor, and he said was not the plavix but probably the crestor that I had been taking.  So I stopped the crestor-nothing--so I stopped the plavix and had immediate relief.  I only hope the leg pain is not permanent.  I should hope that doctors should check this out without saying it is something else.  They MUST be getting a kick back.  Now I see the many ads telling people not to go off plavix, it will get better!!!  I took it for almost a year....

I've had blood clots which led to heart attacks within one month of each other and have 2 stents in place now.  I have NO side effects and wouldn't stop taking it UNLESS my cardiologist said so.  Recently had dental surgery where ALL my existing teeth were extracted and the dentist and my cardiologist decided to keep me on Plavix and I still did well.  I hate to hear of any heart patient not being able to take Plavix because of side effects, because I believe this drug saves many lives.

Constantly have ugly bruises on my arms, legs and body.  With my insurance the price is still outrageous. I take 325 mg aspirin.  I take prevacid to control stomach side effects.

I've had mult. problems after starting it because of a stent placed in my right coronary artery. I don't feel that I was properly informed of the side effect, and now every dr. I see tells me that I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, that I'm &quot;stuck&quot; with this treatment for at least 6 mo. I'm having such a terrible time with it that I'd rather quit taking it and take my chances with a heart attach, death has to be better than what I'm going thru!

I was put on it because of TIA's  I honestly feel like it has given me some sort of blood disease, I would have never went on this medication had I known I would be going through all these problems, and having to wear long sleeve shirts and long pants year round even in the hot weather, because I am so embarrassed about the bruising and how people look at me.  The rash that I get believe me it is no joy, and always feeling exhausted since I have been on this medication does not help me at all,  my DR blames all the problems that I am having from taking the plavix but does he take me off of it and put me on another blood thinner NO.  I contacted Plavix once but did nothing for me.  I ask the makers of Plavix how safe is your drug?  Why do I and I am sure others have to suffer like this, especially the bruising, that do not come from bumping my arms, legs, stomach, etc on any thing they just appear and in the hot weather they appear so badly and are so painful I do not know what to do.

Unfortunately, inspite of my taking daily one tablet of Plavix, within six months this artery was completely blocked and had died off, so much so that it can no longer be seen on a scan.Also my right side carotid artery is now blocked around 70% (which was 40% in 2005). Therefore I am not sure whether Plavix is really helpful in my case.But inspite, I am still taking Plavix every day.Your comment will be greatly appreciated.sincerelyRuth H. Virdiruth.hanna@gmx.net
