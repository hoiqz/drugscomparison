Once that happened I was plagued with stomach cramps and running to the bathroom. I finially bought acidophilus 30 days ago and it has worked wonders for me. I simply take one at bedtime and I am fit as a fiddle now. Highly reccomended
Irritable Colon	Desperate for a Solution, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/9/2011 2:14:25 AM	I had my gall bladder removed back in 1991 and since have been plagued with irritable bowel syndrome. It had been so bad it actually cost me my job because I was a phone rep and could not remain at my desk. I thought it was just me but every time I ate yogurt (yoplait) I can actually felt better. My dr. did tell me about this supplement but I did not want to be stuck taking pills. Long story short I just happened to read my yogurt cup and to my surprise it has acidophilus in it!!! I wasn't crazy. When I eat yougurt atleast once a day I am like a normal person and no stomach pains or cramps or excessive trips to the bathroom. So if you like yogurt yoplait has this as an ingredient and now a part of my diet. 
Diarrhea	Marti, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	8/6/2011 8:45:35 PM	I've successfully taken this supplement off and on for yrs., usually in combination with prescribed antibiotics for prevention of yeast infections.I started having non-stop, mucous-like, at times bloody stools, along with severe stomach cramps, since 6/11, with my dr. ordering every test under the sun with no known cause. I started taking the x-tra strength, 2,000,000 culture per capsule dose 2 wks. ago and FINALLY bowels are perfect with no more stomach cramping.These cost about $14.00 for 60 caps, which I only need one of daily, at Walmart. For the price, well worth it.The only down side is that I can't put them in my wkly. pill box, along with my other medications and supplements due to the fact that ACIDOPHILIS MUST BE KEPT REFRIGERATED!By the way, for only preventing yeast infections in the past, using the cheapest and weakest ones worked fine.

As a child I suffered from fever blisters and cold sores, terribly. I would get them so bad my whole mouth would be covered inside and outside. Inside my nose and all over the outside of my lips. They were very painful. A friend told me about acidophilus to help with digestion issues. I started taking and noticed the outbreaks of the coldsore and fever blisters lessend to none. I have been taking for almost 2 years and am outbreak free.

It causes lesions on my face to erupt into bright red blotches sometimes with a &quot;whitehead&quot;.  If skin is broken, pus will ooze.  When tested the pus is actually candida.  This treatment has worked wonders and I no longer need antibiotics for treatment.
