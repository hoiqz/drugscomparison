Bronchi Muscle Spasm resulting from COPD	Florance, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		7/25/2012 1:37:31 PM	Have been using Combivent Inhaler since I was 60 satisfactorily and I am 85. If side affects they were small of no consequence - use 4 times/day I have no shaking hands or problems that impact my well being. And yes, aeorsoles will be discontinued by law due to decisions made they affect the atmosphere,ha! The alternative choices are not good are complicated to use. So stock up if you can on Combivent Inhalers! No generics for me.

Works great if taken as directed, 2 mins apart,rinse mouth. Only drawback is blurred vision &amp; running out b/4 next Rx available. Took Spiriva with it, worked better, no additional problems.  Tryed Symbicort for some stupid reason, now hair loss on head and body, dry, bruising skin,with a sores on my ear &amp; when stopped taking it b/p shot up to 200/100. If they stop this med may just try Albuterol along w/Spiriva and see.  I'm a smoker for 40 some yrs &amp;  seriousely thinking of quittting for the 1st time. Don't like taking new meds, don't like taking any I don't need, which doesn't make my Dr very happy..  Oh well, it's my body and I know it pretty well..

It is supposed to have 200 doses per inhaler, instead it consistently has around 150. It's not just one defective inhaler, different lots all are the same. So I run out a week before insurance will pay for a refill! I'm getting 25% less product than I'm paying for &amp; am left gasping for air a  week out of the month.

Other	paulieg, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	55-64	8/3/2011 7:43:49 PM	I'm a 56 yr old female, diagnosed with COPD over 10 years ago.  Never used anything except Pro Air.  I stopped smoking over a year ago, and was fine for 6 mo.  Didn't need any inhaler.  In March I was hospitalized because I couldn't breathe and the pulmonary doctor gave me Flovent &amp; Combivent.  I dislike both.  If there is a side effect to these drugs, I get them, problem now is I can't stop using Combivent. I'm supposed to use it every 6 hours and I'm lucky I can wait 4 most times.  I'm upset because I was fine, didn't need any drugs.  My doctor even doesn't understand why my breathing tests are so bad, because when he listens to my lungs, he says they sound fine.  I think I have something else.

This is not very good!

It has helped me greatly-especially in coughing up mucas from lungs. I didn't know it was being discontinued and had not heard about the 'shaking hands'. I have recently noticed my hands intermittently shaking and thought it was the prednisone or other drug.

It is my understanding that Combvient soon will no longer be produced. It is being discontinued. Prolonged use over the years causes hand shaking and many other side effects.  Check with your doctor if using albuterol nebulizer since it also contains combient.
