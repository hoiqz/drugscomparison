High Blood Pressure	Ron, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	55-64	2/4/2012 1:02:10 PM	I am a 62 year-old male who underwent quadruple bypass surgery in 2008. I began this medicine as part of my BP regimen, as a way of reducing my dosage of Bystolic (a Beta blocker), with which I was having a very bad outcome (I also take Amlodipine and Dyazide.  I started at 2.5 mg, but after three months went to 5 mg.  The side effects have gotten progressively worse:  tiredness (as with all BP meds), dizziness, occasional nausea and abominable pain, deep fissures on my tongue--even toothpaste and mouthwash burn, worsening constipation and bloating, and most troublesome, unpredictable anxiety (nervous)attacks.  The only effective way of diffusing these attacks has been Xanax.  As far as I am concerned, this is a terrible drug.  On my own, I have reduced my dosage by half (back to one 2.5 mg. capsule a day), and will be seeing my doctor in the next few days to see what my alternatives might be.  Another major frustration:  there are a number of contraindications and drug interaction warnings, some fairly serious, concerning which neither my cardiologist, PCP, or pharmacists have counseled me.  From the statistics, it appears I am in a minority, but for those of us who are highly sensitive to medications, Ramipril is sheer misery.

His BP has dropped some but because these chemical drugs have all the side effects I just purchased some AMEAL PEPTIDE and NATTOKINASE which are basically natural ace inbibitors without the side effects plus the nattokinase has other benefits.  Not that he is having side effects now but I worry about his kidneys.  For those who are having problems with this drug or other BP drugs look up ameal peptide and nattokinase .. good health to all of you.

I get light headed playing golf and bending over. I realized after reading the reviews that the slight depression and inability to concentrate were possible side effects. No rash ... lots of erections but my voice has changed to a raspy sound most of the time.  My BP has dropped from 160/95 to 130/80 most of the time. I used to have constant headache from elevated BP but this has stopped that. I get back pain that is uncharacteristic for me.. but 2 tylenol takes care of that...

However, I only have one kidney and used to get many infections when I was younger.  Now my kidney function lab tests show that the GFR will range anywhere from 60 down to 42 and the creatinine levels will also vary accordingly. So the last time I went to see my doctor, he raised my ramipril meds from 10 mgs. once a day, to 10 mgs. twice a day. I am wondering if taking 20 mgs. per day would result in my feeling weak in my legs and generally feeling unwell and not able to function as well in my daily life?

Let me say in the one month I have now taken the 2.5mg of Ramipril, I have had absolutly no adverse side effects.  Both the upper and lower readings on my BP are down from 12 to 20 points.   Perhaps only those with side effects give reviews so I felt compelled to share my positive experience to date.

Fatigue was another, frequent bowel movements, reduced urine output and dry cough. The side effects started from the second year of usage. But we could not connect the problems with the drug. I went on using medicines to treat the side effects and changing life style and medicines. It was just discovered and I am tapering off the usage of this drug.

Other	TinTexas, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	2/21/2010 7:27:06 PM	I have mitral valve regurgitation which my dr said ws getting a bit worse. So she prescribed Altace, I ordered Ramipril as it's cheaper.  I started taking it last Nov. After a week, I had what I thought was food poisoning during Thanksgiving. I had sever stomach pain and throwing up. It went away. A week later it came back 10x wose and I had to go to the ER. All kinds of test were done, including ct scans etc. and nothing could be found. I stopped taking the drug. I went back for more testing and was told stomach acid was to blame. I don't know if there is a connection with the start of taking ramipril and all the issues and it all started a day later. I am now on something for my stomach and just started taking ramipril again, but I have my fears about it. A week ago, I was eating like crazy and now, i don't really have an appetite. Had a bit of stomach pain yesterday. Does anyone know about the risk of pregnancy? I'm a young woman taking this and all I've read is for studies on 55 and older patients. The issue of having a baby with defects down the road scares me, even though I have no intention of having a baby now. My dr said not to worry, but I dunno...

I too have been on ramipril and lisinopril and have experienced a horrible cough day and night (little sleep).  Also joint pain--knees, wrists, shoulders--and fatigue (probably from little good sleep).  Also have had reduced erections and difficulty getting to orgasm.  Disappointing to simply &quot;give up&quot; because I'm not getting there.  Thought it was age.  Stopped ramipril and lisinopril and voila: no more joint pain, cough is less (not gone yet), and sex life returns.

In addition, I've had the dry, annoying, neverending cough and have been experiencing headaches. The one I had today was migraine strength. My doc wanted to add a diuretic, but it made me sun sensitive. I don't see how it makes sense to take another med because the first one doesn't work good enough. I got edema with the diuretic after 2 days. I read up on edema and won't touch another diuretic. The whole thing feels like a downward spiral. I'm going to fix this with exercise and diet.

There were times when I thought the capsules didn't have anything in them because my blood pressure would jump to very high, like 175/96.  Even on Ramipril my BP is doing the same, fluctuating.  My biggest problem is getting my stress lowered.  I also take Amlodipine, Atenolol, and Synthroid.  I've actually had very few side effects with Ramipril.  Amlodipine is extra BP med if my BP gets too high.  I do have problems with my memory at times and I'm tired most of the time.  I'm now taking B12 shots once a month.  I think we all need to get our vitamin levels checked at least once a year.  My vitamin D levels were very low and I had to take shots for that.  I've not had coughing problems but keep a sore throat.  I do get vertigo every once in a while.  I keep meclizine with me all the time.  Weight and lack of exercise play a key role in stress and tiredness.  I'm working on this.  I do not have any insurance right now and the cost of Ramipril is very high.  If anyone knows where I can get it cheaper, please let me know.

High Blood Pressure	cheot, 35-44 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	2	3		35-44	7/4/2009 12:36:46 PM	This drug is extremelly efficient in reduce BP, however, in my case did not last even for 6 h (higher and lower concenrations, 1.5 to 20mg). This mean after i used a clear and strong drop in BP was observed. but this drop was not maintaned for more that 6 h even a higher concentrations. This result in extremelly low BP after taking the capsule and then start going up. Up and down is not good for experience. Then i star mixing low doses of ralipril with nifedipine and is working great, even that i am not taking ramirpil anymore and was replaced totally with nifedipine. Now my BP is 100 to 110 over 70 to 80. Good drug but not lasting enough. The main side effect was extremelly fast reduction in BP (too low) and then a fat recovery. A nice point of this drugs is the multiple concentrations that you can try and ajust your own concentration. Even some times you can take a small amount before a huge barbecue (a lot of salt) to control the sibsequent unbalances. I hope that help and feel better

Ramipril is more effective when taken with Indpamide. Indapamide excrete blood salt then Ramipril kicks the ass of the remaining aldestrone! Ref.: See research on Coversyl Plus for effectiveness of combination of ACE+Indapamide.

Chronic Heart Failure	Paul Hayes, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	35-44	12/9/2008 11:49:04 AM	I started on this drug in July of 2008 (5mg). I got rashes on both arms and legs, but my blood pressure and heart rate were normal (120/70). My doctor increased the dosage. While the rashes had ceased for the most part, my blood pressure is much lower, (usually 100/60) my heart rate has increased. (110 - 120 bpm). I'm seeing the doctor today to get the dose either reduced or switch me to Altace.

Have appt. with Dr in Sept. will check on it.  Was taking Altace and thought price of Ramipril was more reasonable, but maybe going back will relieve the rash.  Thanks

High Blood Pressure	KLO, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	4/21/2008 3:37:54 PM	Since I began taking Ramipril 2.5 mg  I have had about 2-3 episodes per week of the left side of my neck going numb, lasting for about 3-5 minutes each time.  Before taking it, my carotid arteries were checked to be clear, and I can't explain it any other way.  I took Altace 2.5 mg previously, but it was too expensive,so my Dr. prescribed Ramipril.
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	1	2	Male	55-64	4/19/2008 10:15:14 AM	Was on Altace with great results pharmacy substituted with &quot;remipril 10 mg.&quot; took it for about 1 1/2 months.  Blood pressure was no longer controlled as with Altace, had a BAD rash on legs.  Asked Dr. and he did not feel remipril was the reason. Dr. changed to Benicar since I still had leg rash and blood pressure was not controlled. Will see if this helps.  Rash is going away after 1 day of being off of Remipril.  I also take Toprol XL,HCTZ,Norvasc, and Zocor.
