After trying many different medications my tummy doc. gave me this. and POOF gone. I am ready to enjoy life! :)

Then the price skyrocketed.  My pharacist and doctor substituted 5mg of chlordiazepoxide + 10mg of dicyclomine.  Works just fine.

This drug works great for me, but today I paid $186.06 for 100 pills, last month I paid $90.00 for the same pills, same amount, month before that for 100 pills I paid 86.00.  What the hell is going on?????

Hard to access effectiveness, but seems to help stomach ache, bloating. My concern is PRICE. Last year, it cost 10.86. Now, just over a year later, 48.83, over 4 times as much. How can this possibly be? If this is what drug companies are doing, how can they justify screwing the public so blatently? Is there something I don't know here? Please, if anybody has answers? Thanks.

Over the last 2 years it has gotten progressively worse and the last six months have been intolerable. I have taken every medicine under the sun and this is the first one that is showing signs of working. Plus I haven't had any side effects! This has really been a prayer answered, and I'm looking forward to enjoying my life again.

Never had pain, just a &quot;too quick&quot; digestive system. I was skeptical that it could change the timing of occurance, which was my issue.  But within a short period of time of taking it three times a day, it worked very well.  I can now take it as needed.

I also take probiotics &amp; slippery elm herbal pill which due to this it has turn my life around since I had suffer for years. I do admit that I still have the worriness because I feel that it can be true that I am no longer feeling as sick as I use to but that anxiety is wearing out slowly but surely.

If i dont' eat anything, I have no pain.  This med works for me, but not immediatly, usually it doesn't help until the 2nd or 3rd dose.  I take it 2 or 3x a day.  However, I noticed a big weight gain after starting it; about 10 lbs in 3 weeks.
Irritable Colon	J9, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	9/15/2008 12:08:03 AM	I was prescribed this medication by my GI Dr due to possibly having IBS-D.  I only took one pill and a few hrs later had a pounding headache,felt jittery, and worse cramps than I had all day long. I called my Dr the next day and I am no longer taking it.The good thing that I *think* the meds did was reduce my bloating.  Normally I look like I'm 5 months pregnant when I bloat, and after I took that one pill, my tummy was flatter than normal for a few days.

As soon as I feel any discomfort coming on, I take Librax and it goes away almost instantly.  The pain was unbearable, but this stops it before it really starts.
Other	Shellyo8, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	25-34	5/13/2008 6:53:24 PM	Started treatment 4 months ago and still no relief. I was to take 1 capsule before meals to stop the spasms and cramps I get after eating. Being treated for H-pylori which was resistant to the usual treatment of the prev pack. Symptoms are worse and little to no relief with this med. I found that zantac ( 150mg.)1-2 hrs. before eating gives more relief along with promethazine HCL 25mg after meals. The worst part is the promethazine makes me drowsy. I have had alot of treatments for H-pylori and this is all that seems to give some relief from the symptoms of Nausea, Vomiting, sour stomach, intestinal cramps and severe heartburn. I take tylenol and advil for the pain in my chest and back caused by the H-pylori which takes the edge off but still there has to be a better treatment for this as what I am currently doing is just taking the edge off for now. It will likely stop working as the H-pylori eats my stomach up to the point of ulcers and acid reflux disease. This medication is no longer used by me Like I said I went back to my previous course of treatment. Speak to your Dr. to see if this treatment may work for any of you, Best Wishes to all
Other	knute, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	4/24/2008 10:52:35 AM	I was hesitant to use this at first because I didn't want to have 'another pill' that I need to take - but after having stomach pains that would come on and last for 8 - 16 hrs, sometimes excruciatingly bad, the first time I took this pill, it became my miracle pill. I don't have to take it regularly, just was instructed to take when stomach pain hit. Most times it take about 30 minutes to take affect, but that's music to my ears when you compare it to the time period that I was going through before I started using it. There have been times when I needed 2 - 3 pills within a four - six hour period, but only a couple.  My fear is that someday in the future I know I will become immune to its effectiveness - that's not something I look forward to.
Other	sereiytj20, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/26/2008 6:02:41 PM	For the reasons it was presribed I can only say that by the time I feel the pain it's to late and when I take the medication it takes about 1-1 1/2 hrs for the medication to take some kind of effect. I started out with H- Pylori that was resistant to the prevapac dose med and then after being on prevacid straight for another 15 days twice a day without relief. I was given this to possibly help but it was ordered as needed so to take only when I need it and not scheduled that would onl mean when there is a need but like I said by that time it's too late. If anyone had had resistant H- Pylori and has experienced continual abd. pain and has seen someone and gotten answers and relief please post it for me.
