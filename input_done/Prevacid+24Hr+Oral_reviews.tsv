Prevacid prevents this acid from rising up into my throat and choking, especially at night when resting. I am currently out and will not sleep well tonight as I can't find it on the shelves anywhere and the Ins. I have will not pay for the 30 Mg. that I used to have a prescription for.  Find something that works and it can't be found.  What's with this kind of society?

I was using aciphex previously and kept having urinary tract infections and decided to switch to prevacid. Urinary tract inf. have decreased  considerably. Since I've started prevacid I notice I have any ichy scalp that is very irritating. Has anyone else had this problem? I also have a slight shortness of breath, but it was worse when I took aciphex.
Excessive Production of Stomach Acid	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	3/6/2012 7:16:32 PM	Prevacid worked great for my persisent heartburn.  I had been using Zantac that I would then still have heartburn occur if I ate/drank tomato based foods or caffeine products.  I had used Prevacid earlier in 2011 for the 14 day regimen as stated on the package.  However when back on the Zantac I again started experiencing heartburn on a daily basis again. From the ads on TV which encourage daily use of Prevacid, I once again started Prevacid and had used for 2 1/2 months.  No problems - great to have not have to worry about what I ate or drank.  Then 12/26/2011 I began having massive diarrhea. (stopped Prevacid) To shorten the story, 1 ER visit for dehydration, later 3 days in the hospital for dehydration and a diagnosis of collagenous colitis I CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS DRUG FOR ANYONE!  And now the cost of the med (even the generic) for this type of colitis is so high, I have had to go to Canada in order to be able to afford it.  And I do have prescription coverage.  Please use caution with Prevacid.  This colitis is not worth it.

I am going to try gaviscon as I hear it has good reviews and was recommended by my sister.

And it's not pleasant gas either. I am talking clearing the room kind of gas. It is not very pleasant when your a woman! I need the medication though as nothing else works. So I am stuck with the stink.....

But then, I tried Prevacid. I take 30 mgs per day every morning. Bye bye GERD. Best pill for gerd. Generic works just as well as brand! Go for it if you have GERD!

All gave me extreme diarrhea and some stomach pain.  I switched to Prevacid 2 weeks ago, and it does not cause those side effects.  I like it very much. Tagament, &amp; Zantac did not work for me for very long.  Diagnosed with GERD 8 or 9 years ago.

It just didn't do the job. I tried taking two pills a day but it didn't work all the time. I had used prevacid for many years until my prescription coverage said they would not pay for it anymore. My doc got prior approval and now I don't have the heartburn 99% of the time...

In February, it just stopped working.  I tried taking two pills a day but to no avail.  My pharmacist suggested trying Prevacid.  I didn't feel relief until day 10.  I feel fine now.

Expect you don't need a doctors prescription and cost less then prescription.  As for me this isn't my 1st time on Prevacid (prescription). Its my 1st day on OTC Prevacid.  Took the prescription form of it for a while and switched from that to Generic Protonix.  Took Protonix for awhile and worked for a little bit.  Stopped working after that and went back to my doctor to get a prescription for Prevacid.  Prefer Prevacid over Protonix or OTC medicines I tried before that.  Was on it for about a yr before my doctor switched me again.  That time was to Generic Prilosec and worked.  Until my doctor wanted me to see it again in order renew it for another year.  Wasn't that crazy about it or my parents as well.  We decided it was best to take OTC Prilosec as what my dad takes and my mom takes.  Wasn't thrilled about it and prefer going back to Prevacid.  Prevacid was now available in OTC form of it as well.  OTC Prevacid is in the same exact form as prescription Prevacid is.
