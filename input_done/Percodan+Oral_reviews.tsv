Pain	Toothless,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female		1/7/2010 7:20:47 PM	I took this medication years ago following surgery to remove my wisdom teeth.  It worked wonderfully for the pain but made me sick to my stomach if I didn't eat enough with it.  Also, I had a side effect of having hyper sexual behavior.  And that was the same day I had my surgery.  My husband thought I'd lost my mind.

This medication turns him into someone else. Mentally it is a bad drug . I don't know why it just doesn't agree with him. I had to flush them. The hospital gave him dilaudid instead. This works great for him .So if it changes your personality you're not alone.

Pain	branoli25, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	2/17/2009 9:28:53 AM	Whem medication for my migraines don't work I rely on Percodan and it works 95% of the time.  The only problem is the taste.  Since I have severe nausea with my migraines I had to get creative in order to keep the pill down.  To solve the problem I wrap the pill in a little bread and can take it that way.
