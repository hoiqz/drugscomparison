Major Depressive Disorder	JTZT, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	9/6/2012 12:22:50 PM	I started Viibryd almost a year ago with the 10mg. I instantly began to feel better as far as my depression and sleep went.  When it was time to up to 20mg I starting having horrible diarrhea. I quickly returned to the 10mg dose which I remained on for almost a year. I'm not a believer in what Dr's refer to as the &quot;Treatment dose&quot; what works for me works for me. Ten months after starting I began to get what I can only describe as whole body twicthes that only happen at night. More Depressed than ever.  Increased the dose which made symptoms worse.  I had never been in this dark of a place in my life.  Tried the higher dose for 3 months before insisting, against my Dr's wishes that this drug was the reason. One month after switching to Geodon again lowest dose I feel great.
Major Depressive Disorder	bozknows, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	35-44	9/5/2012 1:16:12 AM	I have been on this medication for 2+ months and not a big fan of it.  I went thru the proper 10mg, 20mg then 40mg.  The diareha at first was unbearable.  My you know what hurt so freakin bad as I was literally going to the pot 6,7,8+ times a day and nothing but water.  As soon as I would eat something, it was coming out 5 minutes later.  Being in outside sales, I really had to control what/when I take it.  Now after a good 45+ days, I am still not feeling any better.  The biggest problem for me is I DON'T SLEEP at night.  Just toss and turn.  So, I get up and do odd chores and try to go to sleep.  I have to take a power nap at home and in the evening.  Not sleeping is probably the worst because my work productivity is basically nothing.  I just stay home now, don't want to talk to anyone let alone leave my house.  I am angry, irratible and just plain angry.  Lately my diareha is a little more bearable.  No dreams for me.  I just basically have acceptable that no medication will help me with my depression and this is my life at 43 years old and it won't change.  I am going to hurt myself and never thought of that, but this is all I know for 2+ years.  So, it has set in.  I took Wellbutrin before this and it was the worst thing for me.  I was 1000 feet underground with depression.  I had heard good things on Viibryd, but it seems to not work for me.  I want everyone to know we don't choose to be depressed and people just don't get it.  It really is serious and I hope/pray that you can make it happen and get out of this bad feeling.  I don't have any magical words for you, but I will have anyone's back in the future if I hear they are in a position in life like myself.  Pay it forward is what I like to call it.  Good luck review world in your journey.
Major Depressive Disorder	ZawZads, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	55-64	9/4/2012 10:56:46 PM	Got the starter pack. I think it was 10 mgs for one week. 20mgs week two. Feeling better after about a week and a half. Within the next two weeks I began to have many side effects. My Pdoc thought it was some sort of &quot;breakthrough&quot; and upped me to 40 mgs. After taking the upped doseage my life went downhill. I have been having terrible nausea, diarrhea, heart palps,anxiety,and sleeplessness.I am taking my max dose of trazodone for the sleep issue. It only works for about 4 hours. I wake up with a start, my heart pounds and I'm anxious and have a scared feeling. I get up and see my husband off to work and spend the next few hours feeling horrible.I get some relief when I can take my first dose of Ativan, around 9AM. The rest of the day is spent either in the bathroom or rocking in my chair to get some relief from the anxiety.I will doze off for a few minutes it's not the same as getting a full,dreamless sleep. I will not take my life, but I really need some relief now.I've had a call in to the dr about taking me off this horrible stuff. It's 10:00 pm and he hasn't called back as I gave his office the message at 9:20 this morning.If these doc's could realize how desperate we are to hear something. They may be the professionals, but they have not experienced what you and I have. Call your patients back the same day please! In all my experience I know that things will get better and they always do. It just takes getting through all this garbage to get there.Don't give up, I'm not! Down with Viibryd!

Had scary side effects, including brain zaps and sleep paralysis.  I'm now super anxious and I just want this drug out of my system.  I can't believe this drug is on the market.
Major Depressive Disorder	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	35-44	8/31/2012 9:51:34 PM	I have just finished the 20mg row of the sample pack, which means I've been on the medication for two weeks.  I have had very few side effects to this point.  A little gas the first couple days but no diarrhea.  I take melatonin to help me fall asleep at night and have not really noticed any problems with taking the melatonin with the Viibryd, other than maybe an occasional very minor headache (mostly with the 10mg time-release dosage of  melatonin).  I do seem to want to eat more, especially at night (I don't know if that's due to the Viibryd, though).  I'm sure it's still too early to see results, but I have not really noticed any change in my major depressive disorder or social anxiety problem.  I'll continue to take the medication at least until finished with the sample pack.  Not sure after that because I hear it's pretty expensive as a prescription.

I have epilesy and have been on Tegretol most of my life.  I started with Adderal a few years ago then was on Celexa and now Viibryd.   I did get the weird dreams and a few attackes but I think I'm slowly comming around with it.  It's been about a month since I started it. I'm up to the 40mg doseage.  
Major Depressive Disorder	Culton, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	8/28/2012 9:01:00 PM	I took Viibryd for 3 months and went no higher then 20 mg. I would have stopped sooner but was told by my doctor that it was suppose to be a great drug (I don't think he ever took it!) I so wanted it to work for me that I hung in there for as long as could. I had every adverse side effect there is, but the worst was the irritability, horrifying nightmares (if I missed a dose), anxiety and of course, the diarrhea. Towards the end I was experiencing restless leg syndrome as well. The good (and the bad news) is that the adverse sexual side effects that I was hoping to fix by changing from Zoloft to Viibryd were alleviated.

I have had no negative side effects. Only good ones, like better mood, better sex drive, fewer(0)colds,lost my interest in harming myself, the list goes on. At first I did have a headache and it was hard to sleep but that passed quickly enough and I am glad I didn't give up to soon. Only negative is that it is rather expensive but worth every penny. It hasn't turned me into superman just happier, healthier and able to keep up with life.

Major Depressive Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	8/26/2012 2:52:47 AM	I was prescribed this medication for depression.  The first draw back I found was that it has to be taken with food.  I take medication in the morning that has to be taken on an empty stomach.  My bed time meds same thing.  So I had to incorporate another med time.After about three months I did not feel any better and began experiencing what I can only describe as a terrifying experience when trying to go to sleep at night.  I would start to doze off and I would have this severe jerking movements and would feel like I couldn't breath or move yet I was aware of what was happening.I thought maybe I was developing a sleep disorder until I talked with my doctor and he told me to taper off the Vybryd and as soon as I did the problem went away.  I feel like I was actually more depressed when I was taking the medication than when I was not.  Not a good experience.

My depresssion has been basically relieved but I am extremely irritable and agitated. My mind is foggy and I can't think straight. Simple things I have to write down now to remember and I didn't do that before. I was excited at first, but had to go back to the Dr. to get weaned off. Be careful out there!!!

Migraines just about completely gone as well.  Seems like a good drug for those who other types of antidepressants do not work as well and for those who suffer from depression from a young ago or chronically, which is my story.  I take it in the morning as it kept me up at night and make sure to take with food as it seems to increase it's effectiveness.  Also, take on a regular basis and time and do not skip.  I know if I have forgotten to take it within four hours so I keep about two days worth in my purse just in case I do forget.  Love it!

Physically, not alot of change I guess. Just angry and depressed.

First couple weeks ...all good....no GI problems, some difficulty sleeping. I was feeling good, very hopeful...like a good kick in the pants. Now, at month 4, I am weaning myself off this drug. The depression is back (along with 10 pounds) even though I am an exercise fanatic! Soooo tired, sore joints, crazy dreams (although some are quite entertaining), severe jerking while resting, yawning, sweating,belching, foggy, just crave sugar and sleep.I have NO motivation...that is NOT ME! My professional opinion is that this new, &quot;cleaner&quot; drug needs more investigation. Be careful

Felt better within first few days.  Noticed it made my nightmares go away, at least until I stopped taking it. Took it for maybe 2 months, maybe a few weeks longer.  Was starting to have negative effects, but had to quit taking it since I could not afford it.  Upon quitting (did not tell my dr, so I just abruptly stopped taking it) I have had severe hallucinations (which I have never before experienced), mood swings, confusion, it has been a nightmare.  I have been off of it for 6 days now and am still very aggitated and dread going to sleep due to very vivid nightmares.

I was prescribed it after losing my son since I wasnt getting better after 15 months.I'm 65 yrs old &amp; at first, I loved it cuz it gave me energy I hadnt had for years, it gave me motivation again, I was like a 20 yr old again.  However, over time I was feeling rage and anger &amp; over-reacting to things, started swearing which I don't do. Bad dreams started &amp; my jaw kept locking when I'd yawn. It also caused the constant yawning. I was turning into a lunatic the longer I took it. When I spanked my dog that was it for me. I never ever hit my dogs &amp; when I did that I knew something negative was happening. Scared me to death. Also started thoughts of dying &amp; constanly preparing things to die like cleaning up paperwork &amp; the house just incase I died. Crazy! Way too many things started happening the longer I took it. NOT FOR ME!

First week nothing, but sweating all the time day or night, no change in mood just thought I would need to get used to this drug moved to 20mg and all hell broke loose. My hands and feet started to swell the pain is excruciating like they were going to explode! Dr put me on lasix and potassium to take down the swelling no help there. On day 4 of 20mg my hands, feet, and all over my joints were killing me. With taking oxycodone 15 Mg and morphine for a spinal injury I was still in excruciating pain and nothing has helped. Day 2 yesterday on 40mg my breast are so tender wearing a shirt is so painful like I said no pain meds are helping. Last night the night terror's started. I did not take any today but the side effects are exhausting and taking there toll on my body and spirit. Anyone out there know how long it takes till all the side effects subside? God please be careful taking this medication!! If you have any of the side effects early on the 10s or 20 Mg just know it gets much worse and call your Dr to get something else!!!!

My &quot;darkness&quot; is gone...I can still get sad but its not the depressive hole I used to fall into. Some side-effects...I get some tingling in my hands and feet sometimes when I skip doses...overly energetic but that doesnt last long. Also when I skip doses get head zaps...just take it as recommended, aside from that- in terms of sex...still love it...can still orgasm...they may be a little less intense but still feel good! and its so worth it (And sex still feels amazing!) just takes longer to get there sometimes :)

I believe i was takeing Zoloft, and it did not seem to be working very well anymore. The last few weeks I have had a cough and attributed it to the smoke in the air. (Idaho fires) It got worse and I thought I had pneumonia over the weekend. I woke up on Monday and my whole body was sick. I was vomiting, diarrea, muscles were so tight I could hardly move. I have never in my life had pain like this. I'd want to make my legs straighten out and actually cried in pain and start to shake. I had a temp. 103 My husband called our family physician and they said come in he will see me soon as he gets back from lunch. During that time I had muscle spasms and was shaking so bad I could not hold a glass of water. Then I also had what my husband said looked like a seizure. I could not stand to have anything really warm or cold touch my skin. It would hurt till I cried and send me into the shakes. Could barely walk and needed help getting into the Dr. office. he checked my symptoms against drugs I take and said It was something to do with the saratonan. He said I had every symptom on the list and sent me to the hospital for chest x ray and blood work. I was looking like a crack addict. Couldn't quit twisting and moving. The good thing. I seemed ok after3 days.(good thing because I would not have been able to take it. The bad thing ... I have been diagnosed with PTSD. without drugs I'm afraid to sleep because of dreams and the Dr. had me not take anyting until tests were back. I am not here to judge just report. I have to say if someone had not been with me I'm not sure what would have happened. I have never been so sick and would never have gussed what had done it.
Other	Dorothy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	65-74	8/20/2012 12:40:01 PM	Took 10,20, then 40mg.  Stopped -didn't seem to work.  Dr. said take for 1 more month.  I took a 40mg after being off it for about 2-3 wks.  Ended up in the ER for memory loss after driving 41/2 hrs for a 2 hr. drive.  Car was wrecked and I had total amnesia for the 4 1/2 hrs.  DO NOT TAKE THIS like I did.  Still don't know what happened.  Can't remember anything about it or how I managed to drive 125 miles and not know it. Besides being in the hospital being tested for 2 days, I am now being tested again by a heart specialist to make sure if doesn't happen again.  Would never take that medicine again under any circumstances.

What I usually found mildly annoying turned to rage.  I was having incredibly violent thoughts towards myself and my pets.  I think if I hadn't stopped it, I would have probably killed my pets and myself.  Be careful if you try this drug.

I read all the reviews online and it sounded like a miracle drug.  Unfortunately, it has only weakened my depression.  I don't feel great - just ok.  Today my doc moved the dosage from 40 to 60 mg.  40 is the therapeutic dosage so I'm a little nervous about taking so much.  I guess I'll wait a couple more weeks and see if it will start working for me.

Have taken this med since late October 2011. Was on Zoloft and felt like it was't helping anymore so I switched.  Was on Zoloft since 2008 I think.  Like Viibryd overall and would recommend it. Negative : Viibryd caused nausea and vomiting if not taken with food.  If I skipped a day, it caused me to be very tired and have crazy dreams/racing thoughts. Pro: It helped me with anxiety and how to take one problem at a time at my stressful job.  I have recently titrated off of it.  Mainly because I felt like it I didn't take it for a day, I could sleep my Saturday away if I wanted to. Was not being compliant with it anymore. I am doing ok without it.  Sometimes I feel mildly dizzy but its getting better.  Will watch myself closely and be successful without it.

Just a bit iritable but nothing drastic.

I've noticed the electrical shocks about 4 to 5 hours before my next scheduled dose.  It feels like I'm touching an electrical fence that you would normally use for a dog, but without the pain.  Just the severe vibration.  My mood still goes up and down quite a bit, I guess I have my good and bad days, but more so bad than good.  I take the medication at night because my memory is horrible when it comes to those kinds of things. My anxiety has gotten pretty bad, to where I won't go to anybody elses house anymore and I HATE going to work.  Feels as if people are constantly talking about me, but not in a good way. This is the first anti-depressent drug that I've tried thus far, so I'm going to talk to my doctor and see if there's something else I can try

I'm hypersensitive to seeing anything but nothing so far. Taking in the morning with food. Enjoying not having Celexa side effects but feel a bit of sadness / anxiety since having discontinued it without SSRI benefits from Viibryd.

Other	M.R., 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	8/10/2012 3:52:59 PM	I was taking Celexa 60mg and was told if I had to increase I would have to switch. So I asked my doctor what was comparable and was told Viibryd. I read the comments on here before I took it and I read that it was most effective for major depressive disorder, and I suffer from mild depression and anxiety, so I think this was not the best fit for me, but if I read Celexa before I took it, I would have probably felt the same. So, I decided to try it and I took it last night, had a stomach ache all night long, seriously crazy dreams, major headache, diarrhea, woke up at 4 in the morning and couldn't go back to sleep until an hour and a half later, and still had a major headache. I am just trying to make it through the day today, but feeling very lethargic! I will be going back to Celexa. If it's not broke, do not try and fix it! I pray it works for you, but doesn't mix well for me.

My doctor had me try Viibryd. I had terrible diarrhea, restless legs and arms, insomnia, violent thoughts and emotional highs and lows. I thought I would &quot;tough it out&quot; until my body adjusted and 4 weeks in I made the horrible mistake of taking a dose on an empty stomach. I had crippling stomach cramps and horrible diarrhea and I was in so much pain I woke my husband up at 4 a.m. to take me to the ER. I have since thrown the rest of the Viibryd away and gone back to Lexapro and it's minimal side effects.  The only positive I can say is that there were limited sexual side effects and my sex drive did start to return, but with the severe diarrhea, I really didn't feel sexy. 
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	8/8/2012 2:37:28 PM	After years on Lexapro 20mg to control moods attributed to hormonal changes, my Dr decided to switch me to Viibryd 20mg daily. Initially one side effect I encountered was increased appetite almost uncontrollable and gained weight. That side effect has lessened and now I am experiencing extreme irritability and anxiety. The levels of these side effects are not what I consider normal as we all occasionally experience frustration, or are irritated at something and experience anxiety when starting a new job, taking a test, etc. The extreme levels of irritation and anxiety are ones I have never experienced and have stopped the drug as of this morning.  I am following up in person with my Dr today to discuss. I have never participated in reviews of medicine, but I wanted to share my experience to help others that might have the same symptoms.

Major Depressive Disorder	namaste5, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/4/2012 7:43:19 AM	Having suffered from depression and anxiety since age six, I have taken many different medications. I am on day four of Viibryd and am elated. I have been shopping, up at 0400, cleaning, and feel like a normal person. Anxiety reduced, not afraid to leave home, and have felt rested. Nausea, acid reflux, and headache has been present. I don't care. To feel like a normal person, I will take whatever physical side effects this dishes out. Hope for a normal life at last.
Major Depressive Disorder	RNCK, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	45-54	8/3/2012 5:28:36 PM	I have been on this for about 5 weeks. The fitst 2 weeks the diarrhea was bad but then let up. It works well but you do not want to forget to take it. It causes what I can only describe as &quot;brain explosions&quot; &amp; horrible nightmares. I was hoping it would be more effective than it is. Have only forgotten it 2 days &amp; did notice that on those days I almost felt manic for lack of a better word. I am concerned about ever coming off of it though. I thought coming off Effexor was bad!

Major Depressive Disorder	lVlichelle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/1/2012 10:18:57 AM	This has been a miracle for me.  Started to laugh and have fun, we almost forgot what my laugh souned like.  I was treated for depression at a very young age.  So I've taken many drugs to control my illness. I am also bipolar, taking lamictal. My combination works well. This is the first time in a long time I am not suffering and struggling with suicidal behavior.  I have found this to be a life changing experience, for the first time in my entire life I feel normal, doing normal things and handling all my issues, problems and worries. I don't sleep throughout the day anymore. I sleep well at night. I did experience some extra irratiablity in the beginning, but well worth sticking it out.  I was aware of my behavior and worked on controlling it. It seemed to even out after a while. I've been on this for a few months and feel blessed to have finally found something that worked! I also feel that the irratiablity that I was experiencing was caused from being lifted out of the fog that I was in for so long. I was numb for years from other meds and for the first time felt something about stuff and didn't know how to deal with that at first. I am a better mom, wife, daughter, sister and friend.  This has given my loved ones a person they deserve! I am active with my kids and more loving since I'm not so numb.  I put others before myself and see things so clear now.  Before I didn't have enough energy, emotional strength to handle real or everyday issues.  Now I am amazing and a person who I love being! 
Major Depressive Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	7/31/2012 10:39:55 PM	Although Viibryd helped with my depression, it caused me to be EXTREMELY irritable, sometimes uncontrollably so.  I'll be switching to another med at my next appointment.
Major Depressive Disorder	btchkitty, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/31/2012 6:55:57 PM	I have been takeing it for 14 days and the first 7 were fine at 10 mg the next 7 I started having sleeping problems. But over all I feel great I feel like there is hope where before I had no hope. My mind is not in a fog. I find that it is easier to get up in the morning. I also take lamictal 200mg and gabapentin 600mg these seem to be working well together. I have OCD and MDD. I Like the way I don't feel so sad all the time. If you could or can understand how that feeling is so overwhelming that everthing is such a big deal and a drama. Know I take things as they come and don't obbsess and  i feel more in control.I also like the fact it works fast not in three to four weeks it seemed to start working for me in about three days!

I have diarhhea every day.  I do not feel any better and I feel very tired throughout the day even though I take it at night.  I have had MDD for at least 12 years and recently had to stop my MAOI treatment.  I think I need an alternative.

Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/27/2012 12:44:17 AM	This is my 3er day since I increase my dose to 20mg from the sample pack my doctor gave me... So far I feel like a complete different person, I've been going through some tough times, I almost broke up with my fiance, stress at work,problems with my family. And I still feel Awesome, my bipolar  tendencies are gone.I am a much pleasant person to be around and a lot of people have been noticing the change,in sooo little time. I've taken Zoloft, Celexa and Prozac in the past and I never got such great results. As for the side effects,I just got diarrhea the first day and that is it!. It has even help me quit drinking. I was drinking almost a fifth of vodka a day for almost 2 years. since the first day I started V I do no crave alcohol and I have not have any withdrawal symptoms either.

I have also lost a little weight,and have found that those quirky little ocd tendencies have greatly diminished. The only negative thing I am experiencing now is that this drug is making my blood sugars run high. My dr. increased my metformin for diabetes, which has helped. This drug is working for me, even if I have to take more metformin.
Other	tjf, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/26/2012 3:10:07 PM	I do not have major depression.  My Dr.gave me this drug for moodiness, crying spells,tiredness and symptoms probably caused by Menopause. Within the first week, I can truly say I feel like a new person.  I have energy that I haven't had in a while. I feel happier and more content. The first couple of days I did go to the bathroom more than normal, but it wasn't diarreha and passed after a couple of days. I do feel hungrier, but manage this with a glass of milk or crackers.  I haven't gained weight.  I feel like I have the energy to start exercising again and doing the things I like to do. I will continue taking this and have been extremely pleased with this drug.
Major Depressive Disorder	Ronni, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	2	Female	45-54	7/25/2012 1:24:36 AM	I have only been on V for 5 days now.  Not a lot of problems diahrea only a couple of times.  My major problem so far is that I have been so mean, screaming, &quot;flipping out&quot; and just plain &quot;losing it&quot; on everyone around me like I am possessed.  This started on day 4.  Hopefully this doesn't last or I'll end up losing my family or end up in a straight jacket!  I want to stick this out because I have heard it has changed people's lives for the good!
Major Depressive Disorder	swissymissy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	7/24/2012 11:31:43 PM	This seems to work for me although I can't really tell because it's been a long journey since I developed PTSD and also I often forget to take it, although I've gotten better.  But looking at my progress as a whole, I am better tho not elated.  I've taken this for about 7 months.  I'm diagnosed with major depressive disorder, agoraphobia, general anxiety, disordered eating (alternating from anorexia, binge eating, and bulimia although I don't purge anymore).  Before Viibryd, I couldn't leave my house, much less do basic grocery shopping or attend social events to see friends.  I used to get really freaked out and claustrophobic being around a lot of people, taking public transport, etc.  Now I'm less anxious, and actually went to a friend's party at a bar, arriving by myself a few weeks ago.  However, I haven't been able to lose weight by eating healthy; my body used to just adjust automatically to my regular weight but I could've messed this up with my eating issues.  My psych says it would help me lose weight probably assuming that I was emotionally overeating, but he didn't disclose the reasons.  My general practitioner blames the remeron I was on for about a year where I gained 35 lbs in a couple months.  I take Viibryd when I wake up; it gives me a caffeine like buzz so if I miss the &quot;morning&quot; dose and take it at night, I will stay up all night!  When I forget to take it, I will sleep all day the next day so if I forget the morning dose, I will take a 1/4 (I seem to remember I forgot to take it when night hits) and take a melatonin and/or klonopin for sleeping so I can get to sleep.  Overall, I believe it works tho I'm unable to stay employed but compared to how I was last year, I have improved significantly.  My dr is at the forefront of research, widely published in psychiatric medical journals and well known for his research; he is also the dean of psychiatry at 2 top tier med schools.  So I trust his judgment although keep in mind psychiatry is tricky.
Major Depressive Disorder	taylorm, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	7/24/2012 6:46:49 AM	The 1st 3time weeks of taking viibryd was fine..started to feel a little better...or could tell it was working. Went frm 10&gt;20&gt;40 after a week in 40mg my anxiety got so bad I couldn't leave my house. I was having panicked attack worse then I've had all day..frm time I woke up, even waking up out of my sleep w them, to going to sleep. After a few days of this I realized it was the viibryd n cut back dwn to 20mg. My dr says to stay in this but dnt feel its really working. Also, I would take the same time everyday or I got these &quot;brain zaps&quot; when trying to go to sleep or if I forgot to take it. I've heard good things n hoping it worked good for me...ima try a lil longer. It seems either it wrks for u or it doesn't...no in between
Major Depressive Disorder	songbird2012, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	7/22/2012 9:42:29 AM	After a year and half with no libido, stress from work, crying spells, and indifference to whether I lived or died, I decided it was time to do something about it. My dr. put me on Viibyrd, but was wanting me to start out at 20mg. I actually forthed the pills and took 5mg for about four days to make sure I wasnt allergic. After increasing it to 10mg, I had instant insomnia. I started taking it after breakfast, and no more insomnia, but now I'm dealing with headaches, diarreha and nausea within a couple of hours of the dose each day. I do alot of traveling for my job, so you can imagine the diarreha poses a problem. I'm thinking of waiting until lunchtime to take this dose to see if I tolerate it better.Also, Ive been very weak from the diarreha. These symptoms last for half the day after taking the dose. On the up side- within 3-4 days of starting this drug, I caught myself singing along with the radio, which is something I had not done in ages. Much happier, more positive outlook on life, and I have a desire to live. I think I will stay on 10 mg for awhile and just keep experimenting with dosage times in hopes of lessening side effects.
Major Depressive Disorder	brandie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	3	1	Female	25-34	7/22/2012 8:02:29 AM	This medacine for me was one of the worst experiences of my life. It gave me diharrea made me extremely tired almost as if I was taking a sleeping pill made me angry and aggressive could not get off during sex to save my life I would jerk in my sleep and have horrible horrible nightmares tendencies to have suicidal thoughts which I've never before had also something I can only describe as brain zaps in my head at random times. After about 3 to 4 months of takin 40mg a day I Was desperate to get off of it so I lower the dose as my doc told me but let me tell you its got horrible withdrawls something I wasn't prepared for..I was crying all the time aggressive sleepless..not myself at all I had a few breakdowns at work of all places ..I don't care what the fda says this stuff is awful! I've changed doctors and have been on celexa and prn xanax for over 4 months now and I feel like I have my life back my boyfriend tells me that &quot;I'm back&quot; ....the biggest lesson I learned was to do research before just listening to your doctor and talking to ppl..some docs just prescribe anything and some docs think that depression is bs and were whining she they prescribe bs like this...oh and this stuff is like 200.00 a script..
Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	7/20/2012 11:36:10 AM	I was put on this medication in conjunction with 0.5 mg of Clonazepam per day. I started one week at 10mg, followedby one week of 20mg, and then onto 40mg. I have self injured in the past, but NOTHING like what would happen on Viibryd. I had the typical diarrhea, upset stomach, drowsiness,  but then it snowballed. After being upped to 40mg,I began to have suicidal impulses and ended up beating, stabbing, and hitting myself so badly that I ended up in the ER. My Psychiatrist told me to continue the medication and keep trying it, that I was having the episode all on my own. After taking it for a few more days, I had ANOTHER psychotic episode and was well on the way to killing myself.  Had it not been for my boyfriend, I would be at the bottom of a lake right now. This drug has ruined my life and my ability to function normally.

Major Depressive Disorder	Morningstar, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	7/17/2012 7:05:58 PM	This drug almost KILLED me!  I had used Prozac  short term and then Zoloft for a long while-however approx 6 mos ago started having problems with the Zoloft (brain fog/wt gain/increasing depression etc) my physician gave me samples of Viibryd to try. With the third dose I experienced the Serotonin Syndrome symptoms in the extreme.I have worked in the medical field for 35 years, and my husband and mother both have medical training. Both witnessed my reactions.  This episode came on with NO warning and has taken 4 days for me to be able to walk, talk,  and think I just might not die.  Please - all medications are good and bad- just be careful with this one.

I feel better than I ever did on them and no sexual side effects.  Believe it or not it actually works like it supposed to.  I gained some weight but I'm not sure if they are related.

I have been experiencing severe diarrhea for 3 wks, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, really bad headaches, feeling faint. Occasionally it has gotten to where I feel feverish, begin to tremble and then I begin to sweat so bad that I must lay down w/ cold cloth on my face and chest, praying that it will pass. I am very concerned now and wish to be off this medication...
Other	jpw, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	35-44	7/16/2012 9:14:15 AM	This medication has worked for me and I always take it with dinner at night. If I happen to forget to take it, I immediately know the morning after. The side effects of missing this pill 1 day is going to outweigh the effectiveness for me. If I miss it, I have very weird and vivid dreams, I absolutely cannot wake (sleeping for 14 hours straight then still feel out of it and extremely fatigued), have ringing in ears with pressure, headache, can't concentrate, have difficulty making complete coherent sentences, can't handle fast movement such as drying hair with a towel, dizzy, light headed, very emotional and grouchy, overall feel worse than anything I have ever experienced for 24-36 hours. I've been on this medication for 5 months and go back to my doctor next month and I am going to demand to come off of this. I am nervous about how I will feel coming off this, as I had quit zoloft cold turkey and had zero side effects.

Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	25-34	7/15/2012 11:08:19 AM	For extreme anxiety and mild depression, I stayed with Viibryd for 2 mos (through the sample pack and dosage step-up for mo 1, and 40mg for mo 2). I never noticed any improvement, and depression was worsening, I was having weird brain zaps/static while trying to fall asleep, and I began having regular suicidal thoughts which scared me and scared my wife immensely. Thankfully, all of this was quickly communicated to my wife and my psych, and I was told to stop Viibryd altogether. After a month of nothing (except Xanax for panic attacks), the worsened depression got better, but I still had severe anxiety and mild depression. Although reluctant to try any anti-depressants after my episode with Viibryd, 2 months later, I'm now on 300 mg of Wellbutrin XL and Xanax for panic attacks. I am feeling much much better. Life is manageable again. Depression is all but gone, and the panic attacks and anxiety seem to be much less frequent.

Nothing helped I called my pharmacist and she suggested I see my doctor real soon.  He changed my med and the headache gradually went away - like slowly within 3 or 4 days.  Do not take this drug. Not enought testing has been done long term on it.

After reading the other reviews I now know I'm not the only one who has the shakes, racing heart, insomnia (I take restoril for sleep but doesn't seem to help), fluid retention in ankles and feet, light headed, static noise in my head and, if I nap in the afternoon, the vivid dreams. I had the diarrhea but no nausea.  I have to admit though, even with all the negative side effects, I feel so much better.  I've been on the whole gamut of other AD's, this one seems to work the best for my depression. I'm hoping the side effects will subside. Thanks to all of you who have written reviews.

All the GI things that can happen did. I called my doctor and she said if you can wait out the side effects the results will be great. I do have to say it has been good. I am out of the fog and have been very up beat. To all those who want to take this try it. Yes you will have side effects but they will not last.

I usually never even get side affects from anything and I have to say these last 3 days have been the worst days ever.. Just a few hours after taking the first 10mg pill I was running in the bathroom all day and all thru the night for 3 days..also I felt like I was gonna throw up every hour and the headakes are so bad that I still can't get up and do anything.. and the cramping is out of control.  Bottom line I wish I never started even taking this and would never again. The side affects awfull...

Like many others here, I feel like the old me is coming back to life after far too many years trying to deal with citalopram. I pop right out of bed in the morning and I feel more motivated to do things with each passing day. I hope my mojo will soon follow; I've heard it can be one of the last drives to return. It was essentially nonexistent on citalopram, and I can't take wellbutrin because of a seizure disorder. Worst thing about this med so far has been the brief bouts of diarrhea starting the 10 mg dose and the 20 mg dose. I hope this continues.

My Doctor has been very watchful as I've begun using it. She emphasized that I had to eat before taking it.  Because of this I eat at least a granola bar. I am on 40 1/2 in am 1/2 at dinner.
Other	RicketyCricket, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	35-44	6/29/2012 1:55:13 PM	Summary:Viibryd- At start of medication:  trouble concentrating, stomach cramps, bad energy (in a too much coffee sort of way), interrupted sleep. On day 2 (and only on day 2) I took 2.5 mg of alprazolam which seemed to help curb these negative effects.  By day 3, the negative effects still persisted but to a lesser degree and continued that way (becoming less and less) for 2 weeks.From month 1 to 6 month:  stomach cramps gone, concentration troubles gone, Interrupted sleep still persists as well as sexual side effects.Alcohol: 1 or 2 drinks I am fine. If I have more than 3, I don't feel terribly different than normal from the alcohol.  However, the next day is really harsh.  I feel as if it were double the number of drinks that I had.  Although I don't have depression, I feel as though some of these feelings creep in (as a result of the combo of the drug and alcohol) and dissipate over a day or 2.Background info: I started taking 10 mg lexapro a little over a year ago for anxiety then the doc recommending switch to 20 mg viibryd (as I complained of the mild sexual side effects and still some minor anxiety). I must say I notice no different (sexual side effects wise) between Viibryd and Lexapro.  I will add that I do not remember Lexapro being as negative when mixed with alcohol. My anxiety seems slightly less on 20mg of Viibryd vs 10 mg Lexapro.  I believe that this because I think the mg doses are comparable.  Therefore, if I think the doc up'd what he would have recommended otherwise because I mentioned still having mild anxiety.  Meaning if I only complained about the sexual side effects he would have put me on something like 10 mg Viibryd.   Lexapro is now available in generic.  I would have switched back by now if transitioning was such a rough process.  I will talk to my doc about going back to Lexapro but a higher dose than 10mg.For anyone who doesn't know coming off these type meds sucks.  You feel horrible and horrible to be around.

No constipation, but flip side is extra fluid in the body from taking Viibryd. Who knew?!

The first day was like having a colonoscopy prep - extreme diarrhea and cramping. I stuck with it another week, and although it got better, the frequent bowel activity persisted, and it was very disruptive to my life. I did take it with food as directed. After a week of discomfort on the 10 mg, I don't dare step up to 20 mg. I did not experience any therapeutic effects at this early stage, although it did not negatively affect my libido as some others have. I guess I will never know if it would have helped - too bad. 
Major Depressive Disorder	Sherri, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	6/24/2012 7:09:02 PM	Found out that taking Viibryd after lunch worked the best for me (lots of trips to bathroom &amp; discomfirt when taking after breakfast).Gained weight this week, but I know that I fell of the diating &amp; exercising bandwagon; hoping that getting back on will alleviate this problem.Strangely, my legs have been feeling weird in the evening, hard to explain the feeling, but can only pinpoint it to Viibryd.Sleeping better/feeling better mornings; stopped taking my sleeping aid Ativan cold turkey...hoping to continue not needing it.Waiting for my emotions to be more positive; reason I started taking Viibryd (ornery, everything bothering me). Lifelong constipation problems seems to be gone though.. yay me ;) (formerly used Cymbalta at least 6 yrs;  used Zoloft for 9 yrs before that).

I started with Zoloft and hated it. I had immediate positive results with Viibryd. My only negative side effect has been weight gain and the inability to lose it, otherwise I am very satisfied with the results.

I have to ask all of you women......did you notice a huge change in your desire for sex?  Yikes!!  I feel  20 again.   I have to say my appetite for food is rediculous and need to find a cure for that, just never satisfied in that area.  Hmmmmmmm

Strange, alrming dreams, waking every 15 mins. Very bad GI problems. Stomach growling, diarhea, light headedness. I am in the process of getting off this med now. Worst experience ever had and I have tried quite a few. Good luck to all.

I could tell a difference almost immediately but it took about 2 weeks to have the full effect. I had never felt better since about 17 years ago before I had my hysterectomy and my whole emotional life change. After about 4 months I started having stiffness in my legs, knees, arms, and now back. I am down to 10 mg and may have to go off the medicine. I am hoping to be able to go back on at some point because there has been nothing else of the numerous drugs I have taken that even come close to this one. I had energy and slept less and felt great that is until the stiffness.

Can someone who is taking Viibryd answer this?  I've been on Cymbalta, took it in the morning, because taking it at night made me tired at work the next day.  I look forward to anyone/everyone's reply.  Sherri

I was previously on Prozac and was always sleepy and sexless.  Tried Wellbutrin...made me angry at everyone and everything.  So far this has really worked.  I have a sample pack from my doc and will be increasing the dosage to 20mg per day starting tonight.  I dont have any side effects yet.

Couldn't stay awake and when I was awake all I could think of was &quot;is it time to go to bed&quot;? I saw a difference after the first week, after a month I feel so good, I haven't felt this good in years. I want to get up and do things.I realize meds affect different people different ways but, I hope you can enjoy the benifits I am. God Bless.Sharon Gray

The Lexapro worked for my anxiety but my sex drive was nil so the dr. switched me to Viibryd.  Must say after a little GI issues, the drug has worked just as well as the Lexapro and I no longer have the sexual dysfunction.  I am only taking the 10 mg after deciding not to increase to 20mg after the 1st week due to the horror stories of side effects I read about. I will say you have to take with food or it will make you sick for sure.  I would definitely recommend it at the lower dose.

I started out on the 10mg for the first week and within 2 day my mood was improving 2nd week went to 20 mg even better results, now at week 3 im much more happy have lots of energy and can actually carry conversations with people and not feel like im in a haze. Medication has not really helped my anxiety so i will talk to my pcp about that. over all i really like it! =)

I am in so much pain, pain I did not have before taking this medication.  I can't believe something so small can cause so much damage.  Please be careful, I was looking forward to feeling great, being productive, and getting the desire to live again, instead I got a taste of hell and pain.

I currecntly take 40mg 1x a day and though depression is always  there, it is a much smaller hurdle. i have my life back and have a far greater appreciation for myself and those who have stuck with me through it. It was worth trying.
Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	6/13/2012 2:53:51 AM	My lifelong depression lifted at first but I ended up having nightmares so vivid I could not sleep. (I actually dreamed I was being chased by a 200 foot tall Jaberwokee...and was told by other participants in my dreams that if I did something in particular I would actually die in real life...nice huh)...(I guess you would call that a lucid nightmare) They were in color and intense and I am actually reluctant to go back to sleep. I know eventually I will have to, but with dreams that intense...I am going to have to switch medicines unfortunately.

Other	jerseeegirl, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	65-74	6/11/2012 11:38:32 PM	Viibryd was given to replace 15+ years of Zoloft.  The first week I was talkative, outgoing, emotional in a good way and could cry.  In the second week I was diagnosed with edema in my right leg with weeping blisters and leg, feet and toe puffiness.  This happened once before on another medication causing extensive medical visits, tests, treatments and therapy.  The symptoms stopped when I stopped that medication.  The timing of the Viibryd and my symptoms are not a coincidence.  I am diabetic and have to be careful.  So sad that I will have to go back to being a zombie -- non-feeling by going back on Zoloft. Will see what my other doctor has to say on Wednesday.  For now, I'm wrapped in an Ace bandage and trying not to itch my leg.

Major Depressive Disorder	Me again, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/8/2012 12:42:04 PM	I have been on viibryd for four weeks. I began with the 10mg, 20mg for the first two weeks which aside from the positive feelings were awful due to GI issues, night sweats, nightmares, and just spacing out. I stayed the course and have finished my second week of 40mg, for which I am thankful. My mind and body feel better. I want to feel and live my life again, go places and do things with my family. I go to bed without the racing thoughts and worries, stay asleep (still have vivid dreams), and wake up ready to get up and face the day. My life hasn't changed, but how I cope has, gone is the pit of despair. Instead of thinking of how I can't deal with anything, I am moving on. I still have some GI issues and vivid dreams. I have lost a little weight. I now have a libido, though. I would not mix with alcohol as I had my first experience with anorgasmia after a couple of drinks.I have been on Zoloft, trazodone, wellbutrin and Cymbalta in the past with no positive results. Four weeks on Viibryd, I think I found my match. The initial side effects are subsiding, the transitions upping the dosage were rough, but I am tolerating the 40mg well. None of the other meds had the awful startup issues of Viibryd, can't believe I continued to take it, but it WORKS :)
Major Depressive Disorder	KellieB61, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	6/8/2012 11:34:28 AM	My psych decided to put me on Viibryd after Cymbalta fizzled (I took it for 2 and a half years). They were overlapped for a couple of weeks, then Cymbalta went away and Viibryd was the mainstay. Quickly bumped to 40mg each morning. My head went &quot;numb&quot; and I was slow to respond to questions, emotions, conversation - everything. I'd been on it for about 6 months when Mother's Day rolled around. That weekend was a total nightmare and long story short, I ended up in a hotel room with a massive handful of every drug I could get my hands on and I was ready to GO. I took about 7 Xanax, hoping to get sleepy enough to throw down the rest and just die. Instead, I threw up. I decided that there must be other plans, so I called my doctor and after about a 5 minute conversation, he determined I was one who got the bad side of this new, cleaner drug. It actually aggravated my symptoms. So, I'm coming off of it and it is killer: my skin is crawling, my head is swimming, my thoughts race, I can't sleep, eat, or do anything productive. I'm working my way back onto plain, old Prozac which worked well about 6 years ago when I first needed something for depression. I had no idea how badly I felt until I started getting this drug out of my system. Plus, I gained nearly 20lbs, my energy level was zero, and I got to the point I could care less about anything. Be careful - it can push you over the edge in the wrong direction.
Major Depressive Disorder	Bugleboyatl, 35-44 Male  (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	35-44	6/7/2012 10:56:19 PM	I began taking this medication about 1 year ago.  I take 40mg 1 pill per day.  I was prescribed by neurologist as substitite for a different SSRI.  It was substituted for purposes of helping with energy without sexual side effects.  Here is why this rating system is not useful:  for me, i have no energy and have a hard time with fatigue.  My mood however has been awesome and positive and i have never had the blues over the past year.  What it does not do for me, like sertraline did, was, remove the cat on the ceiling feeling-- as if you are incredibly cranky and moody all the time-- zoloft did wonders for me.  Feeling positive was an issue i had in the past that i dont think zoloft perfectly resolved.  This drug absolutely does!  My cat on the ceiling feelings are diminshed but not so much as with zoloft.  The advertisements that say no sexual side effects, i think are lies.  It is true, they are greatly diminished to the point of 80-90% but to say ey are no sexual side effects with climax would be disingenuous.  The one thing this drug does is give you that effexor or wellbutrin &quot;buzzing&quot; in the brain-- its like you better take that at 8am or by 5pm you are hearing this static.  Effexor buzz is 10x worse, but i just thought it would be helpful to mention.My other observation:  why not take nothing at all and just live side effect free and go back to doctor when problems persist?  Sometimes the cure is worse than the disease.  My fatigue was pretty well cured with my amphetamine pill but my neurologist wanted me to switch to nuvigil which is complete sh*t.  That neither works to increase wakefulness or helps.  Amphetamine i do not want to take because you have to keep increase and eventually they make you just plain nuts and kill your heart.  So, this was worth the attempt to solve my issusebut at the expense of possibly creating new and different issues.  I have slowly become annoyed at all people and friends over past year but expense of the help from pills?

Viibryd has really helped me feel better, calmer and ready to deal with life. In the beginning, I did get the diarrhea, some nausea. Both have subsided now. The only side effect I still have are very vivid dreams and some blurred vision, but nothing too bad.  I am on the 40MG

I've been on Viibryd for about 8 months now and it has been the only medication that has controlled the depression and mood swings. Had some side effects at first but nothing major. It has helped me a great deal, just wish they had come out with this a long time ago. Good luck!

I have slept better, I wake up not so tired, I have my energy back, I seem to get more done. It is hard to say if it is solely this medication as I recently started on Testosterone, as well as DHEA. I have been on a number of different meds and I will definitely continue to take this until I notice any reasons not too. My doctor warned me about the nausea so I always make sure I eat plenty before taking. I have always had headaches so I will not contribute them to any medications.

PLease do not go by reviews that you read and all of you should also know (if you take antidepressants like i do) that you CAN NOT judge a drug after taking it for a few days or even weeks... my intial reaction was not good either but that has passed and whether or not i will continue taking this i do not know yet becasue i do not know if it works for me or not.. but i will give it a chance becasue the reward of finding the drug that works for me far out weighs the discomfort it takes for your body to get used to it...

I also suffer from post-tramatic stress disorder which weighs on my mind and heavy in my heart everyday. This medication really helped my mind not think negatively about past situations. It has helped me control my mood also. I feel like a friendly more level headed woman. Pretty recently I have been having a feeling of electric shock in my head. and just a few nights ago I felt my whole body shaking and the same electric feeling through out my body. I couldnt open my mouth to yell for help or even move for that matter. It was very scary. I wouldnt say that this one event will make me stop this medication bc I like how it effects my mood and attitude. I was just making this side effect aware to other patients.

Woke up feeling normal again. Slight stomach problems for a couple days, but went away. Have stepped up to 40mg for going on 3 months -- still good! After reading other reviews, realizing that I am having the tightness in the jaw, however have had TMJ for years, so just added to it. Once diarrhea stopped have no other significant side effects to deal with. I have my life back, enjoying my family again, look forward to getting out and engaging with friends. This truly has given me my life back.
Major Depressive Disorder	JP, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	5/17/2012 10:09:07 PM	Major Depression and Panic Disorder w/ Agoraphobia/OCDStarted Viibryd about 15 days ago. Started 10 mg for 7 days, then 20 mg for 7 days. Just started 30 mg yesterday. Diarrhea and strong nausea when starting V. Was also weaning off of 20 mg Lexapro at the same time. Taken off Buspirone as Viibryd contains same med/mechinism. Increased panic and anxiety during transition. Nausea disappeared after about 8 days. Diarrhea occassionally after each dose increase. Makes me EXTREMELY drowsy and feels like I am in a &quot;stupor&quot; for 7 hours after taking Viibryd at 12 noon. Soo tired. Been advised to start taking Viibryd in the evening due to drowsiness. Scared b/c I am scared to change meds in the first place. I have been cleaning more, and seem awake and starting to be happier in the mornings. Not as much panic/anxiety waking up in the mornings. Severe panic attacks have lessened in intensity. Frequency is near the same (several a day) but slowly improving. I also take Xanax .50 mg 3x a day now (increase from .25mg 4x daily since yesterday.) Abnormal vivid dreams. Increase of some OCD symptoms. Pdoc says to stick w/ med combo now. If having increase of anxiety, says it's a sign that the med is actually starting to work. Staying with this for at least 4-6 weeks to see how things evolve. Side note, my increase in Panic/Anxiety attacks could very well be related to my 'automatic negative thoughts.' I always imagine the worst. Good luck everyone. I'm hopeful, even though it's been a struggle for me at times.

I noticed that I was actually very agitated and acting out in hostility in a way that is not normal for me. At 20mg I felt and automatic reaction that night. While falling asleep, I felt a astonishing sense of euphoria as if I was high on something that made me feel very good. I was also taking a sleep aid to help with insomnia. Eventually, I felt like a zombie, stiff and jittery jaw. Effected my motor skills and memory negatively. Id usually felt great in the morning but had some irritating days too as I progressed to 40mg. I noticed that without sleep medication I couldnt fall asleep for the life of me. Eyes wide open or tossing and turning until sunrise. The most horrible thing happened to me one night when I skipped my dose due to insomnia. When falling asleep, I felt as if my brain was being electricuted. Horrible long lasting, loud zaps that kept waking me everytime I fell asleep. I literally felt like I was jumping out of my skin. When I did sleep, I had the most vivid demonic nightmares then ZAPP!. I was scared to death, paranoid and had blury vision for days. I had to wake my husband up and go to the ER 3am because of this. The Dr said this was a withdrawal symptom, gave me valium for the anxiety, and told me to continue the viibryd. The last straw was a couple nights after when I had a nightmare that I was having a seizure (I have no history of seizures). Im not sure if it was real or not because it happened in sleep. I also had headaches, sore legs and arms, rapid eye movement and am now afraid of the dark due to the paranoia it caused. Im slowly weaning my self off of this drug. The withdrawal effect is demonic. I could hardly recognize myself and swore my physical appearance changed as if I took a blow from standing behind an airplane. My husband said I look the same. IDK. I felt like I was on another planet. Very scary. I'm starting wellbutrin once this is out of my system.

Had gotten sample of Viibryd from dr. started the 10mg dose and the first 3 days I felt great, a little more bathroom runs but great. Then prior to even getting to 20mgs I began to feel foggy, work up tired, by 20mgs I was miserable, gained weight; body aches, headaches, stomach pain, went back to 10mg. still running to the bathroom, neck aches headaches, poor rest. Now getting off of this, cutting the 10mg. in half hopefully I will feel better physically and see our I am mentally, I do take Ativan for anxiety and panic attacks which I have had since 24 yrs. of age, now 70. Had one major depression many years ago.

About 2 weeks into the highest dose after titration, started breaking out in little blisters that itched like crazy.  Still waiting for the last of them to go away even after stopping the medicine.  Very disappointed.

Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/29/2012 11:37:52 AM	I have been on many of these types of medications including Paxil, Wellbutrin, Pristiq, and a few others will little changes. I was also taking Xanax quite often for my panic attacks. Since taking Viibryd my panic attacks are almost nonexistent, when I get up in the morning I am ready to face the day, and I have lost almost 20 lbs. As with any medication it all has to do with your own body on how well it will work for you, but for me this drug is helping out so much. Even if you took Lexapro (who are the makers of Viibryd) before and it did no work as it didn't with me and gave me raging headaches, Viibryd is working fantastic.

No history of psychosis.Viibryd caused diarrhea at 10 mg.  That settled down but 10 mg had no effect.  Increased to 20 mg which after two weeks caused vivid dreams, then horribly wake/sleep/wake nighmares, sleeplessness and diarrhea.  Weaned myself off.  Will see doctor next month and request prozac which I was on years ago, and Lortabs for pain.  Both cheap and effective. Tried and true. I am 67 and the new designer antidepressants are probably not good for the &quot;elderly&quot;.  sigh
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/24/2012 8:54:22 AM	I am a 28 year old female and began taking an SSRI for lots of anxiety that I was having daily (and if you ask me, some depression symptoms as well). I began on Zoloft, which didn't help me at all. So I switched to Lexapro, which helped A LOT with my anxiety, but I was tired all the time. Like, literally falling asleep at my desk at work for 15-20 minutes at a time. On Lexapro, it was also a struggle for me to get the urge to do anything. I was totally content to just sit on the couch and stare at the wall, seriously. So, my doctor switched me to Viibryd, which she said she had about 6-8 patients currently on and it was supposed to help with the lethargic side effect that Lexapro had on a lot of people. I have now been taking Viibryd for 1 week, but I'm pretty sure that this is the right AD for me. I take it in the morning with food. Started on the 10mg for the first 2 days, then bumped myself up to 20mg, as it was causing no side effects for me (the doc wanted me to start on 10mg in case it caused me nausea). I have had no side effects while on this AD so far, not even that foggy head feeling that you get for a day or two when you switch an AD. It is helping with my anxiety as much as Lexapro was, but I have not been feeling sleepy at all. I have had more energy and will to do things during the day and I have also been sleeping so much better at night, which is a Godsend for me because I haven't slept well in years. I have actually been remembering my dreams. I'm not sure if I will need to , but I plan to bump my dose up to the max 40mg at the end of this week. So far I am very happy with this drug.

This surprised me as I had been taking wellbutrane and thought it might take a few days to feel anything. Definitely not the case. The side effects I experienced were adverse enough that I will be following up with my physician to evaluate alternatives to this drug!

I suffer from depression and panic disorder. I have been on Paxil, Zoloft and Wellbutrin (very bad experience). My psychiatrist touted this as some new miracle drug. I started on the starter dose pack and went up to 40 mg. as he said. Hee then told me I could take 20 mg. if that worked for me soI adjusted down to 20. It is not working for the depression, I am having very angry outbursts, feeling very mean and hateful (which is not like me) and now I am experiencing more anxiety too; mostly every day. I am in puert rico now and not going back to the states for a few months. I don't know if I should try to just go off of it myself or not. I always have such a big increase in anxiety when stopping these meds and have recently flown for the first time in my life. (age 52). I wish I knew what to do.
Major Depressive Disorder	sbour61, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	45-54	4/20/2012 6:57:27 AM	The initial 10 mg. dose caused me to have great anxiety and Diarrhea.On the other hand It gave me energy that I have not had in several years and also I started to engage in conversations with my husbands and my daughters something else I hadn't been doing in several years. I had been so uninterested in living life.I had given up hope..After day 4 my anxiety seemed to go away but I still had diarrhea in the morning and it didn't matter if I had protein or not.After 7 days my dosage was increased to 20mg. I once again started having a lot of anxiety to the point that my doctor prescribed diazepam and clonidin. They helped but they are drugs I would prefer not to take.I had been taking pain killer for over 15 years for Fibro and chose to go off them a month and a half ago because I still hurt regardless of the pain medicine.Im not sure my anxiety comes from being without pain meds. or the Viibryd but I have decided to keep taking it because of the energy factor.I will stay at the 10 mgs. for know anyway and I hope and pray that this is the antidepressant that gives me my life back.

When it went to 20mg on day 8, I had horrible adverse reactions to it. I had muscle spasms in my legs, constant twitching, my body felt very heavy and I became very aggressive and became disassociated with reality. Immediately had to go to the dr and get taken off this med. Then, I just had to suffer the horrible withdrawal effects for days later. I do NOT recommend this medication
Major Depressive Disorder	goldengurl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	4/12/2012 8:45:35 AM	This has been one of the better antidepressants that I have been on and I'm pretty sure that I've run the gammot from the TCAs to the SSRIs and SNRIs.  I never had the side effects of nausea and diarrhea that scares so many people away from taking it.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone that has been treatment resistent to other antidepressants.  It also seems to be helping my anxiety and helping to rid me of my daytime sleepiness.

Despite all the problems others have had, I had only very mild and ephemeral side effects mostly in the first few days.  Going up to 40mg on the starter pack was a breeze.  Feel relaxed, almost post-massage physically and upbeat psychologically.  So far, after 6 weeks, this one may be THE one that suits me.  Sorry others have had such trouble.

Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	4/5/2012 5:29:43 PM	Pros- Worked great for my depression.  I have been on every anti-depressant known to man and this one helped the most with my depression.  Cons-  Terrible side effects: Vomiting up until I stopped taking it 4 months later, dizziness, fatigue, insomnia, inability to focus, extreme hallucinations.  Overall if you can deal with the side effects to take care of your depression this is for you.  I could not take the side effects and after 4 months discontinued it.

Was weaned off Cymbalta while starting the Viibryd to cut withdrawl symtoms of Cybalta.  Afte the first week I noticed a huge improvement.  The second week was the best I have ever felt in my entire life.  It has been 4 months now and I am currently up to 40mg Viibryd and down to 20mg Cymbalta every other day.  3 weeks ago I have started to experience a huge downward slope of depression and anxiety that will not go away.  Not sure what to do, my family doctor seems uninterested and cannot get in to see my psychiatrist for another month and a half.  I think it is probably a good drug, but needs to be monitored closely.  I have a feeling that a lower dose of vibryd and re-increasing my Cymbalta may be the fix for me.

Going above 20 mgs was really tough side effects wise but after being on the 40 mg for a couple of weeks the side effects subsided and I have never been on a drug that helped my depression like this.  I have energy, focus, no sexual side effects.  I will say that the gastric side effects and the dreams were the worse for me.  Still, I stuck with it and I'm glad I did.  My hope is that it will continue to work.  I've been on it for 6 mths now. 40 mgs for three months.  Also I did have to go much slower with the increases.  I took 10 mgs for a month and 20 mgs for 2 months before going to the 40.  Overall I am satisfied with the outcome.  Getting to this point was extremely tough however.
Major Depressive Disorder	hopeful, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	3/28/2012 7:24:38 PM	I have anxiety and depression and have tried lots of meds like paxil, effexor, lexapro.  Lexapro just stopped working for the depression. Began the starter pack of viibryd 3 weeks ago.  I have not been able to get past 20 mgs. Had an initial burst of energy the 1st week, but experienced some vivid bad dreams and stomach issues.  Would have put up with it though, because the depression felt so much better. The 2nd week I started experiencing extreme tiredness, feels like a low blood sugar/glycemic attack about 1 hour after taking.  Bad head-aches and extreme irritability and increasing anxiety.  This sometimes goes away after several hours and I do have more motivation.  I am seeing my dr. tomorrow and am either going to try taking it at night instead of in the a.m. to see if it helps with sleep and I can then wake up with more energy, or just get off of it.  It's hard to give up without a fight because I hadn't felt as well as I did that 1st week in years!  Now I've taken an emotional nose-dive from the disappointment of it not working.  Hope it works well for you - but I agree with others it's a serious drug and probably not worth it unless you get much improvement!   
Major Depressive Disorder	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female		3/26/2012 10:28:20 PM	This medication was given to me and I did good at 20 mg but as it was increased to 40 Side effects were I felt sea sick all the time. Had to eat allot of protein in order not to feel sick.  Flu like feeling. I also had numbness in my legs and felt like I was on a rollercoaster some of the time. I went slowly down 40 then 30 then 20 then 10 and now none at all. SSRI withdraw is bad. Hard to work and I do feel allot of pain all over my body. Suppose to change to Paxil but can not take that either. Not a great experience with SSRI's. Keeping busy and working through this is hard.

My doctor had said that she has success with other patients with this drug and thought that since nothing else really seemed to be working, this would be the one.  I am not so sure though.  I am still always completely exhausted and want nothing to do with life.  I force myself to get through work, which in itself is a battle.  I am much more easily irritated and just about anything will send me off the edge.  Nothing has seemed to work!  I just want to feel normal and enjoy life without any struggles!!  Am beginning to wonder if it is just me pumping myself with meds that is making me crazy and nothing to do with me?  Maybe I am fine and don't need all these crazy pills?
Other	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/23/2012 3:28:08 PM	I had no relief from my symptoms.  I had sexual side effects (as I have with every other medication such as this).  I had no stomach issues which was great but every night I would have the feeling that someone was pushing me off a cliff and then I would startle - extremely strange and terrifying.  I also had very strange nightmares that felt like I was sleeping but I was awake in the dream trying to scream for help - trying to make my sleeping body move and scream.  Really, really awful experience.

For years I had fought off anxiety and agitatio through self control only to fail and hurt the feelings of my family and give an average performance to my employer.  After 3 weeks on viibryd my life completely changed.  I have full control over my temper and anxiety in the toughest of conditions.  On top of that my sexual desire at 40 has returned to levels when I was 20.  I have also had the drive and commitment to lose 40 pounds with 30 pounds to go taking my blood pressure from hypertension down to normal levels.  I have finished projects at work and home on time without hesitation or fear.  Viibryd and my Dr. have saved my life.  After 7 months of taking Viibryd, I hope it continues to work this good for the rest of my life.

However, the underlying symptoms of of not caring, not being able to engage, having to force myself to participate in life were not being addressed by the 20mg dose so I went up to 40mg. I experienced no decrease in those symptoms but did experience an increase in side effects. I felt tense all the time. I felt like my jaw was tense a lot, even when I was sleeping. I experienced an increase in some already occurring physical issues--neck, shoulder and joint pain. Yesterday I had to go to the clinic because my jaw is a mess and they referred me to a TMJ specialist. I have also noticed in the past month or so that my memory and ability to focus and think have been impaired. I'm not jumping to the conclusion that taking the 40mg dose is causing these phenomena but I will be keeping my eye on it. I saw my Dr. this past Monday and we decided to lower me back to the 20mg. I will be watching to see what happens. Oh yeah, as i have missed a dose twice before, I am prepared for the severe nightmares and god-awful dreams that I am having in lowering the dose. The nightmares are intense and not something I usually experience.

Kudos to those that it does work for and may you continue to have good experiences with it. I was only able to take the first 3 doses of this medication and it was DEFINITELY not for me. My PCP put me on this for a generalized anxiety disorder after taking prozac for about 6 months. I wasn't crazy about the way it made me feel so I stopped taking it and asked to try something else. He gave me the starter packs (1st week 10mg, etc). Within the first 2 days I experienced some of the worst anxiety I have ever felt in my life (panic attacks, feelings of derealization that wouldn't seem to go away, crying at the drop of a hat.) At one point it was so bad I had to leave my job early for the day . My anxiety has been bad before, but I'd never experienced anything to that extreme. Scheduled an appointment, was told to immediately stop taking it and am now just waiting for it to work it's way out of my system. 2 days since my last dose and I'm still having smaller panic attacks, but they are getting further apart and having less intensity.

Withdrawal symptons kick in by mid-afternoon and they can be brutal -- electrical shock-like feelings in my head, anger, etc. This worries me about ever going off it for good.

There is also a 40 mg dosage. Do not miss a dosage though or bad dreams, sweats, tremors result.

One 10mg dose symptoms not unexpected:  mild headache, nausea, explosive diarrhea, abd. pain. What was unexpected was later dev. of head pain &amp; pressure, anxiety, suicide thoughts, confusion, eyes light sensitive . . with just the one 10mg. dose.  Poison for me unfortunately. Not unlike adverse reaction to low dose of Prozac several yrs ago.  Think I'm unusually sensitive--glad to read others have benefited from Viibryd--be careful however if you have a hx of sensitiviy to Rxs.

The first 2 months was extremely hard. He had to titrate off of Cymbalta and then it took almost the full 2 months before seeing improvement.  This medication has been a blessing.  He is more alert at school and engages more with the family.  Although improved, he still has low motivation but that could also be him being a teen.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this medication.

Thanks to this med, this is the first winter that I have not cried at all.  For me, this is a miracle drug.  I have minor manageable side effects and a better life than I have had in years. It began to work almost immediately for me, and I don't need to take other anti-depressants as a supplement.

One thing I learned was 40mg is WAY too much so I break the tablets in half..with my Dr.s permission of course. My head felt foggy and slow at the full dosage-20mg is just about right for me. No real side effects and my anxiety level is very tolerable now. Life still has it's ups and downs but I seem to be able to slug my way through daily issues without flipping out!

I have anxiety/depression issues and this med brought me out of a relapse. I take 20mgs right now. Stomach troubles at first, nothing major, just annoying. Gone after about a month. Has an insomnia effect on me, but a small dose(12.5mg) of trazodone has REALLY helped me with that. I am not laying in my bed crying for no reason every other day anymore...so for that I am very thankful. Life is quality vs quantity and with any med you have to weigh the risk vs the benefit. For me this combo is great. (3 months in). Good luck.

I am having palpitations, racing thoughts, horrible GI problems, I fainted, cold sweats, and an inability (and fear) of sleep. I haven't taken this in 5 days and only took 2 doses at the 10MG level and I am still having the palpitations. I had an EKG and bloodwork done; everything checked out fine as did my blood pressure. Medicine will effect everyone differently, but for me, this was a horrible experience.

However, after a month, I was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Other side effects I experienced included alternating diarrhea and constipation, headaches, disorientation, confusion, lupper and lower abdominal pain, severe pains in the lower and mid lumbar regions of my back, intense pelvic pain in the uterine and ovarian areas, as well as severe clitoral pain. As a result, I was admitted to the hospital twice. Once taken off the medications, symptoms abated.

I tried explaining to my husband earlier how I was experiencing &quot;electric shock brain waves&quot;. Had no idea how else to explain it. I wish I would have read all these comments 10 hours ago. These must be the crazy &quot;brain zaps&quot; people refer about. Anyways, calling Dr. asap. Need to get off this drug NOW!! previously have only taken Lexapro 10 - 20mg... on/off for 13 years. It has been one of the worst mental experiences of my life. &quot;if it's not broken, don't fix it. Lexapro was working, always had. Shouldn't have changed a good thing. God bless.

Actually wrote a novel- I've never started something and finished it before, symptoms always interrupted my focus. Just started to realize you have to be diligent with taking it on time.  I get extremely itchy when i take it late, and sometimes take a benadryl with it to ease the itch.  Was late by two hours and experienced horrible brain zaps and crazy dreams- dream paralysis i think its called.  Also started taking an Imodium at the same time to help control soft stools in the morning.  Dr gave me very low dose testosterone lozenge to aid sexual abilities, but I don't even need it, after a few weeks I was fine.  Happiness helps sexual interest.  Overall, it's tricky but worth it.

I had diahrea the first week then it stopped. Take Immodium AD the first week. As for how I feel, it is more sedating than snri's, it feels like celexa. I will wait for 6 weeks to see how well it deals with depression, but so far so good.

But when I finally took this medication, I felt better- eventually. Did not feel the effects for the first 15 or so days. Nowadays, I feel a calm sensation and the negative feelings I can think of come but I am at a loss to react to it- which is good. I did feel occasional side effects. The first time I took the medication, I felt my legs shiver a bit at night but only for the first night. On 3 different occasions, I have felt a bad nausea which also caused a lack of appetite. Thankfully, for me, the nausea didnt last long (atleast till now).

At first, everything was great! I felt better anxiety wise. But after a few months of taking this medication I began to experience side effects.  I would lay down to go to sleep at night and be almost asleep and then bolt up-right with strange brain and body sensations and hearing voices.  Voices real enough to make me almost call 911 thinking someone was in my house! One month my pharmacy did not refill my prescription in time and I had to go two days without the medication and began experiencing facial numbness, EXTREME irritability and brain &quot;zingers&quot;(it feels like an electric current pulsing thru your brain. very scary and very disturbing) Also, if I am more than an hour late in taking the medication I begin experiencing the facial numbness and brain zingers. As far as weight loss is concerned, I don't know if the medication has had an effect or my turning 30 has more of an effect but I work out 6 days a week and eat a very healthy diet and have lost zero weight.  And I don't mean I kind of work out, I'm talking an hour long spin class every day and weights. I also have been very irritable with my husband and children all the time.  While it may have helped with anxiety at first it is not worth it with the crazy side effects.  I am finally scheduling an appt to begin getting off this medication for good at my husbands urging.

I only got to the 20 mg as it would cause sharp headache-like pain that would run from temple to temple acrossed my forehead within 20 minutes of taking it. Then my eyes would start to become effected in that they would hurt. I am a person who rarely gets headaches &amp; am in great health overall. I would then become nausiated within 35 to 45 minutes &amp; then would end up vomiting &amp; then would feel better. This med was awlful.

I normally suffer from daily anxiety, but on day 1, i had none whatsoever!  Day 2, however, it came back.  I hated this med.  Stomach cramps, diahhrea, disturbing dreams, brain zaps.  My sexual response improved greatly, but it was not worth the emotional nose-dive that i took.

I suffer from depression and extreme anxiety. The first few weeks were like being on speed! I felt huge energy and a huge surge in productivity. I would say I was very close to mania. Eventually that tapered down once I got to 40mg. This medication works  great with depression but my biggest issue is anxiety and it did nothing for that. I felt more anxious than I had ever been

I started very slowly, breaking a 10 mg to 5mg every 2 wks going up 5mg until I've reached 20mg. I have found Viibryd has quickly shown improvement for my overall mood and mental health. I am enjoying simple things and life in general does not seem so awful and hard. I havent really noticed a reduction in pain. The only bad thing I can say for side effects is about 10 hrs after ive missed a dose I have horrendous hallucinations, electric shock feelings and muscle twitches. The first time this happened I was terrified, had no clue what could be happening. When I take the dose after symptoms begin it takes about 4 hrs for it to kick in and relieve side effects. I also have to take it in early afternoon to avoid insomnia and wierd dreams and restlessness. As long as I remember this on time It's great! I do wonder how much worse the withdraal would get if I wasn't able to take a pill as soon as I do. I don't dare to test it out but the fact there is serious withdrawal does concern me.

Reading all of the other reviews make my reaction certainly stand out. I got up to day 5 on 10mg and could not take any more. I was in physical pain. My symptoms were and still are burning intestines. My stomache has been on fire to the point where I mcurl up in a ball. I cannot concentrate. I cannot even get out a complete sentence w/o studdering which I have no history of. I'm very confident this is not the drug for me. My doctor perscribed this to treat general anxiety disorder.

I was feeling less anxiety &amp; was happy with the results I was having until I started hearing zapping sounds in my head (like I had my hands over my ears). I also saw things that wern't there. On 2 different occasions as I drifted off to sleep I would feel as if I had a siezure, &amp; would wake up (had the feeling I need to force myself to wake up) feeling paralyzed only able to open my eyes. After 5 mins or so the numbness in my body would go away &amp; I would realize then it was just a dream. I looked up siezures in your sleep &amp; they are possible. I thought if it were a real seizure I'd be aware of that. I would assume my hair would be messed up or I'd at least be moved off my pillow or something. I wasn't. I didn't experience any of these symptoms while on 10mg. Also, I don't have these problems every night. It just happened a total of 4 nights spread out, last night was one of them. I have an appointment today, so I hope my questions can be answered.

Also if you miss a dose you feel crazy and please do not drink alcohol. After the doctor told me to swith and take it at night I begin to improve dramatically. I am very refreshed in the morning and social. Anxiety is gone and I'm not lying in bed depressed anymore. Like others I have been on many other anti-depressants but this is by far the best one. I have gained a little weight but maybe it's because I'm not depressed anymore and I'm eating. I'll take that extra few pounds any day to feel this great.

I felt so sleepy during the day. I have now worked my way up to 20 mgs and I can't sleep and I am so fatigued. I can't do the things I use to such as household chores. I'm not sure if I should just hang on for a little longer to see if the side effects go away but even so my doctor wants me to go up to 40mgs and there is no way possible that is happening. I have only felt gloomy on this medication.

Depression seems to be totally gone,anxiety levels are way way down, I sleep normal, I am very happy laughing again and overall Iam in a very positive and strong mood. Sex drive is way up, I eat healthy again, I lost nearly 30 pds. since taking Lexapro.Dont get me wrong at first I didnt know what to expect. At first Yes, there were side effects such as nausea and irritability...Within a few wekks Ill say all side effects are gone as my body and mind got used to the medication. VIIBRYD IS GREAT!...for me at least. I wish it were like this for everyone.

The first actual med I was on was Paxil in 1997 and it saved my life.  I had gotten agoraphobic and just wasn't living my life.  I've been on different meds since 1997 and nothing seems to work for long.  I tried this Viibryd stuff with high hopes of getting my moods in check.  I've been on it for about 12 weeks and I'm getting worse.  My moods are terrible and my temper is worse now.  I'm going to doc tomorrow to get some help.  The sad thing is, I was told that there really is nothing else left to try at this point.  I've been on most everything and nothing is giving me what Paxil gave me back in 97.  I tried going back on Paxil after being off for many years and it didn't work.  I'm not badmouthing this drug (Viibryd)...I'm sure it works great for others....just not me  :(

I have been on  Celexa 13 yrs and loved it but I pooped out after a major medical scare, they put me on Cymbalta which worked ok but it made me tired.  I switched to Viibryd 6 weeks ago and it has been pure hell getting on this drug. Physically I was I'll for 3 weeks nausea, sick and anxiety, which I don't have a lot of normally. On week 5 it seemed to click and it was going much better. I'm on week 6 an I am struggling again. 1 more week I will give it and then I'm done with it. I have heard pristine is great.

Unfortunately, it has gotten worse over time. I tried 40mg, way too strong, the diarrhea and dreams were too much. I cut the pills in half, but still have the dreams and some diarrhea. Now I'm experiencing very dry red eyes, (anyone else?) blurred vision and insomnia. I also know what people are talking about on here about the &quot;zaps.&quot; You hear this weird loud metallic sound when you try to sleep. I went to my Dr. and am getting off of it and going back to just taking Trazodone to help with the insomnia. I'm just tired of all these anti-depressants having way too many side effects.

This drug is very scary, I was put on 30mg. I could not sleep at all, had hallucinations and heard loud voices.  I have never ever had this reaction to a drug.  I stopped taking it, and I feel so much better. Did not work for me at all!  I felt like I was loosing my mind while I was on it. It made me feel very agitated, and angry, or could be from no sleep for a month.  The FDA needs to do more research before giving it to the public. Scary drug.
Major Depressive Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	1/12/2012 4:01:17 PM	First, remember that there is no way to predict how each individual will react to a drug - what works miracles for one person may be a nightmare for another.  That said, this drug was dangerous for me. I began at 5 mg/day for 1 week and had few side effects other than mild stomach upset for a few days.  Up to 10 mg/day for 2nd week.  No improvement in depression at all but gradually increasing rage &amp; anger until this 3th week I feel murderously aggressive and dangerous.  Dangerous as in I want to scream my head off with rage, punch someone in the face as hard as I can, speed my car up to 100 mph and crash it into a brick wall.  I have fits of rage after which I feel like I have adrenaline pumping through my veins.  I stopped cold turkey two nights ago.  Last night I had very strange, disturbing dreams, woke frequently, and sweated profusely.  But I will not allow any more of this drug into my body.  Wellbutrin had a similar effect on me, but not as severe.  Again, your experience will likely be completely different, but this is what happened to me.

I feel great and am finding joy in so many of the simple things in life that I didn't even know I could enjoy. For years I just thought I was lazy when it came to getting chores and projects done around the house, but I now know it was depression. I feel really great on viibryd. I take things in stride, I am calm, I enjoy working on my house, cleaning, organizing, running and playing with my kids in the yard and just being with me. I'm not stuck in my head dwelling on negative things. I feel great. I still recognize when something isn't right, but I handle things so much better and don't overreact or dwell on them. Here is the HATE: sexual side effects. No desire at all and an orgasm is more work than pleasure. I'm having the vivid deams and had to start taking xanax to fall asleep. I could of lived with sleep/dream issues if it wasnt' for the sexual side effects. I wanted to stick with SSRI but due to the side effects, I'm going to start tapering off Viibryd tomorrow and give wellbutrin a try.  
Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/9/2012 12:20:52 AM	Doc suggested I try this new wonder drug, but by the time that I got to 40 mg on the started pack I started having hallucinations and time lapses with no memory so tapered off med in three days. That third night as I was falling asleep, as soon as I would start to dose off I heard a loud electric sound inside my head and it would startle me so bad I'd jump. This happened 5 times that night all back to back each time I dosed off but thank goodness it has never happened since, that was very scary. I have found out that other people have has the same experience when coming off antidepressants. Hope this helps someone know they're not alone! 
Major Depressive Disorder	none, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	1/8/2012 12:45:46 AM	I thought I was losing my mind until I read other people's experiences with &quot;brain zaps&quot;.  I have been on almost every anti-depressant known to man, but until now have never known these were a real thing.  I have suffered them in the past if I missed a dose or was tapering.  You think I would have been advised by my doc.  Now I am on Viibryd and am researching at midnight because of my repeated experience with extreme brain zaps, hallucinations, and strange wake/sleep experiences as I lay down to sleep.  I'm calling my doctor Monday to get me off this drug.  It's not worth it.
Major Depressive Disorder	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	55-64	1/4/2012 1:48:06 PM	I began taking the Viibryd starter pack and things were fine until I got to 40MG. It was at that point I was nauseous every morning until late in the day, increased anxiety, slight headaches, dizzines, diarrhea to name a few. I was taking it in the morning with very little food. For the past week I switched to taking it with my evening meal and the side effects have vanished my anxiety and depression are under control and I feel much better. Try taking it with at least a 400 calorie meal and you may feel better too.
Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	1/2/2012 9:28:41 PM	I was really excited about this drug when I started it (august). My dosage at that time was extremely high (60mg). I had anxiety attacks, insomnia, and brain zaps. I had to take clonapin to stop from getting panic attacks and it was a scary month for me. My doctor lowered the dosage and I am on 20 mg which is better at alleviating  my depression but my anxiety is still very high. I can't drink caffeine for fear I will get an anxiety or panic attack. I have an appointment next week and am asking to be put on a different antidepressant that won't have the anxiety side effects. I wouldn't recommend this drug because any effectiveness in treating my depression has been outweighed by the increase in anxiety it has caused me.

I WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN AND SO STIFF, I COULD NOT MOVE.   NOW AFTER BEING OFF IT FOR ALMOST 1 MONTH, I HURT CONSTANTLY AND IN PLACES THAT I NEVER HURTBEFORE.  I HAVE ENVELOPES FULL OF HAIR THAT HAS FALLEN SINCE VIIBRYD.  THIS IS BY FAR THE HARSHEST OF ALL THE AD'sTHAT I HAVE BEEN ON.NEVER HAVE I BEEN LEFT WITH LASTING SIDE EFFECTS LIKE NOW.  
Major Depressive Disorder	hannah, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	12/30/2011 12:17:40 AM	I was put on prozac and I loved it. It was the best thing I had ever done for myself until I started to notice the sexual side effects. No desire and could not orgasim. My dr gave me Viibryd. I'm about to finish wk 3. Some loose stool but nothing terrible, actual for me it was a benefit. I helps me a lot with my impulsiveness but I still dwell on negative thoughts. Not to the extreme like I did before and I don't get myself as emotional about it, but I still do it at times. I'm hoping that will get better with time. At 30 mg, I was finding it difficult to hold my thought together in my head and think any kind of timeline or anything like that without writing it down and my short term memory was nil, so my dr suggested I go back down to 20 mg. Seemed like my heart was also a little racy at 30mg. At 20 mg I'm having the vivid dreams and waking a couple times a night. Nothing too scary, just vivid and weird. I'm eating like crazy. Borderline binge eating, but I think that is getting less sever. And I'm also on adderall which usually suppresses my appetite. My concentration and memory are also back to normal at 20 mg. In the beginning, I wasn't experiencing any sexual side effects but now I'm not totally sure. I as hoping there would be more about that in other peoples reviews. Overall sexual side effects are less but doesn't seem to work as well on all aspects of my mood/depression.  I slept better than I had in my whole life on prozac. I miss that.

At the seven week mark I just couldn't take the severity of the side effects.  I have never suffered from such severe side effects from any other drug as I did with Viibryd.  I would avoid this drug particularly if being treated for migraines, seizures or thyroid issues.  The drug interaction is too severe.  Talk seriously with your physician about the side effects of Viibryd and the drug interactions before considering taking.
Major Depressive Disorder	Grateful heart, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	12/28/2011 3:17:47 PM	While taking this drug I experienced horrible side effects which included headaches, nausea, diarrhea, blurred vision, uncontrollable crying, swollen ankles, feet and hands but the worst of all...suicidal thoughts.  I immediately called my doctor and requested that I be taken off this drug.  My doctor agreed and put me back on Lexapro which has been a life saver. Had I not had a moment of clarity in my darkness, the outcome would have been devastating for me and my family.  This drug is not for me however there may be some who can tolerate it.  I M writing this review in hopes that it will help other who may have been prescribed this medication.

Major Depressive Disorder	soulflower, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	12/28/2011 1:51:57 PM	Viibryd has been a prayer answered for me!!! I had been on Wellbutrin and this or that or some other anti-depressent along with abilify and deplen and still sliding down hill for over a year and a half. And becoming more and more agoraphobic. I had never had my depression be so bad in my life, EVER. I am 40 and have been sick since I was 12yrs old. I was ready to tell my Dr that he was going to have to hospitalize me or . . . . Never had it ever been that bad. It hurt so much and it was completely unbearable just to be awake.My Dr said that if Viibryd didnt work he was going to do ECT. I said Sure!! Lets go! Do it now!!I have been on Viibryd for about 3 weeks now (I have been on Wellbutrin for years) but thats all I am taking for depression now and I already feel a BIG difference. All of my symptoms have improved greatly. That hurt just to be awake feeling is gone. And I feel more social.I am not fully recovered (its only been 3 weeks) BUT I HAVE EXPERIENCED SO MUCH IMPROVEMENT!!!! I can distract myself and actually enjoy myself often times now. I am back up now and taking care of my house and kids and husband and I dealt with Christmas without feeling like the weight of the world is crushing down on me.I hope I continue to improve. But the difference with or without Viibryd has been like night and day. Sexual side effects no problem, ditto with stomach upset and weight gain.
Major Depressive Disorder	WOMAN , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	12/27/2011 8:10:11 PM	i was on pristiq and wellbutrin for about a year, when it's effects just kind of petered out. my doctor suggested viibryd because her other patients who have medication-resistant depression have had success. well, this drug is literally a nightmare. after starting the 20mg week, the panic attacks and trouble sleeping began. it was so bad i called my doctor at 3am one morning. the physician on call ( not my regular doctor) said it WAS NOT the viibryd and then wrote me a rx for klonopin. i didn't want to combat the side effects from 1 drug to another, so the next night, i took 10 mg. last night, i quit it altogether. i wouldn't take or recommend this med to anyone EVER.

Doc put me on this just over 3 weeks ago. tried 40 mg dose last week and had car sickness for the first time. I had vomiting again today even though I'm back on the 20mg dose. Having severe nausea and abdominal pain, cramping, and obviously no appetite. Truthfully, I can't tell that my anxiety or depression are any better. Planning on calling my doc today. I can't hang in there to see if these side effects will go away.

Prior to this I was on Effexor XR &amp; started having a very rapid heartbeat, prior to that I was on lexapro but it stopped working,paxil gave me anxiety attacks &amp; celexa made me suicidal.. but be aware if you miss a dose you WILL feel it ...so you have to be very diligent about taking your meds  I work for the Dr. who prescribed it &amp; I was his &quot;guinea pig&quot; I told him how much better I am ( I'm sure he can tell too) and he is using it a lot ... it even helps my migraines somewhat ( maybe it will be off label in the future for migraine prophylaxis)

Been on antidepressants for 8 years (zoloft 3 1/2 y, effexor 3 1/2 y, wellbutrin 1y. Also have had some generalized anxiety and last year PTSD after a physical assault and traumatic injury.  This drug helped me get back the best parts of me AND increased libido with a return of my lost ability to have an orgasm. I felt better within weeks! I love it!

Other	Sduperock, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/21/2011 4:47:05 PM	I was taking Cymbalta for chronic muscular pain in my neck but had so many negative side effects I asked my doctor to take me off of it. He suggested Viibryd and it has been like a miracle drug for me. The only negative side effect I have is weight gain but I am pain free for the first time in many years. Unfortunately it is not FDA approved for pain management so my insurance has denied it for that reason. With so many negative reviews for treatment of mood disorder, maybe the FDA should consider testing it for pain management since it has been highly effective for me in eliminating my pain without any negative physical side effects.

I switched from Celexa and have noticed an almost immediate improvement with little/few side effects. The only side effects I've noted are frequent urination and occasional &quot;brain zaps&quot;. I have not experienced any sexual side effects except for maybe an increase in sexual desire due to feeling more &quot;normal&quot; rather quickly. I'm very glad I was introduced to this drug. I had no hope before my doctor suggested that we try it. I go back in one week to report my progress. Unless something crazy happens in week 2, I'm going to continue this treatment with the blessing of my doctor.
Other	swong, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	12/10/2011 7:55:45 PM	I took this med and let me tell you, I would have rather suffered with my anxiety and depression than go through what I went through. The first week, I was unable to think, putting two thoughts together was impossible. I couldn't sleep, nightmare galore,  When I got to the 20 mg dosage, all hell broke loose. My right hand started to tremor. The day after I woke up with some much agitation, I thought my heart was going pop out of my throat. Then on top of the other symptoms, I developed full body tremors and uncontrolled ticking which made my head snap left to right and back. I was removed from the drug and the withdrawal were even worse. On top of snapping my head right to left, it started to snap front and back. My eyes would roll to the top of my head and almost felt like I was having a seizure. I had a full body tremor, hand tremor, agitation, nightmares, stuttering , slurring of speech, all for several hours a day. Symptoms would abate for only 5 mins at a time if I was lucky.  This went on for more than 2 weeks.  Felt despondent and suicidal bec of the withdrawal symptoms.. Now in my third week, the head snapping is less but still wake up very agitated. Speech is slurred due to grimacing from a muscle facial spasm. Very Painful. I was a perfectly healthy 41 yr old woman, other than the depresssion and anxiety, before I took the meds.. If I could I WOULD NOT take the medication. I have learned my lesson to be more cautious.

Nightmares, nervousness, and things actually got worse when I started weening down from 40mg to 20mg. Unstable is the way I would desribe this drug as acting. I'm feeling lousy most of the time, yet on occasions I will have this sudden &quot;feel good&quot; sensation. Very Strange! My wife says I'm a little bit manic, sometimes speaking unusually  fast!

MY side effects were very severe. Worse anxiety and panic attacks; so bad that I thought I would have to check myself into a crazy house. I also had dangerous impulses and manic episodes. Trouble sleeping and the fear of sleeping in my own bed. I haven't slept in my own bed for nearly 4 weeks now due to fear. Among other things this drug was definitely not for me. I'm going back on Cymbalta as this was perfect for me.

I see my PCP and first tried Prozac, but it didn't really seem to do anything. I then tried Celexa, and it didn't seem to help and just like Prozac, it killed my sex drive. Next I tried Wellbutrin which didn't kill my sex drive, but again didn't really do much. Lastly before this, I tried Cymbalta. It also affected my sex drive and maybe slightly helped; I'm not sure though because I only stayed on each drug for one month. Viibryd is one of the first ones I've taken that hasn't given me a foggy, spaced out feeling. It has not affected my sex drive. I have gained weight but I don't know if that's because of Viibryd soley or due to the other ones I've been taking since I started treatment for depression earlier this year.I did not have any initial side effects related to stomach/bowels, etc. as I see many people described. It actually makes me tired about an hour after I take it, so I take it before bed. I have not had any trouble sleeping. I have felt very weird sensations in my head that I have never felt before. I'm not sure if they are the &quot;brain zaps&quot; I've read about but maybe they are. It's difficult to describe, but it's similar to the sensation of when you're about to fall asleep and then suddenly wake up off guard. I haven't had any of those zaps in a couple weeks though so maybe they worked themselves out.I don't think it's a miracle drug or &quot;happy pill&quot; but I do feel more centered and less anxiety on it. It's more of a thing where I don't necessarily notice the difference while on it, but I surely feel a difference if I miss a day. Without it, I'm emotional, cry easily, and get agitated and angry easily. It has not made me more socially outgoing or had a drastic effect on my energy, but I guess won't pill can't do it all. It has a pricey co-pay of $50 but it has been worth it for me. I applied for the PAP w/ Forest Pharm and my doctor keeps giving me samples. It has affected my STM but not long. Good luck!
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	2	4	1	Female	35-44	12/1/2011 8:57:20 AM	Took Cymbalta for two years for anxiety.  Stopped working and doctor switched me to Viibryd.  I titrated up 10 mg first week and had more energy took edge off anxiety, felt good. Began 20mg second week, felt foggy headed,bad headaches. Finally 40 mg 3rd week and felt awful! Headaches all day, foggy headed, emotional, nausea all day, bloating. Felt worse than I have ever felt in my life. Never had problems remotely close to this on any other medication. Lastly, I haver never commented on a drug online but this stuff is terrible and there nisn't much info out there yet.

The problems started when I woke up one morning and could hardly move because my stomach pain was so bad. I couldnt even touch my stomach and it had me doubled over. I went to the E.R, unfortunatley, they diagnosed me with a U.T.I.(not even remotely close) Another really bad symptom is like an electronic jolt(or shock)to the brain in late afternoons and night times. It is really scary sometimes... I am still on this medication, and I really need help.

Was told..NO MAJOR SIDE EFFECTS..but should of read the fine print. Gained 7 pounds, major stomach issues that did not go away, and when I got to 40 dose I got weird dreams, and very moody. At times, mentally I felt great, but not worth side effects..Too strong for me.  It should be on the warning label not to take if you have a sensitive stomach!!! Just be careful if you are taking this new drug.

Into 1st week of 2nd month started having major memory problems, seeing things that were not there, major paranoia, and the worse thing in the middle of the night I would have zaps in my brain.  (like an electrical jolt) Bad dreams (not nightmares), nausea, constent diarhea, dizziness.

My dreams became extremely vivid, and I began having periods of sobbing, almost hysterically every day.  Actually, my emotions felt magnified, and felt very agitated.  I am a fully funtioning, working middle aged woman, and felt the effects out weighed the benefits.  I also began to get chronic diahrrea.  Anybody else go through this???

Have always suffered from depression since high school.  Tried every anti-depressant out there, nothing has ever worked until about 6 days ago.  I am on day 6 of taking Viibryd. My only side effect was stomach issues, which lasted only one day!  I am excited to say that I have never felt this good in a very long long time.  No sadness or crying at the drop of a hat.  I feel AWESOME.  I know it's still early but I hope this continues to work for me.  I'll keep you posted.

They were very bad hallucinations. Husband took me to ER. They correctly identified a bad drug reaction. However, I had drawn the hallucinations to explain to my husband what I was seeing. I was involuntarily committed although the hallucinations had stopped. I lost my job. The over-reaction of the ER was not the drug's fault, but the hallucinations were very intense &amp; scary.
Major Depressive Disorder	I have my daughter back,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female		11/20/2011 12:59:27 AM	My daughter has taken many other anti-depressants, one of which gave her a life threatening allergic reaction; this med has greatly improved her life . It has released her from the deep dark depressed suicidal feelings she experienced. I have a happy vibrant 19 year old who wants to return to college and complete her studies, when before all she could focus on was delusional behavior, death and destruction of herself. Her side effects so far have been slight dizziness. Other  med side effects have been so extreme, delusional psychotic thoughts, suicidal thoughts and just so unhappy about everything. She has a very positive attitude about life and is looking forward to the future, which she did not have before while on the other meds. I really hope that others will benefit from this med. 10mg is all she needed to get a positive result. She has been taking for 7 weeks now and perhaps may not need it in the future.
Major Depressive Disorder	rkm, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	11/19/2011 3:42:21 PM	I am writing this because, it seems, many others have had similar experiences.I have been on Lexapro 20mg and wellbutrin 300xl for 7 yrs.  Feeling numb, listless and uninterested so started trial pack of Viibryd 5 weeks ago.  Continued Lexapro during first week.   I am still on wellbutrin.  Felt more positive, more energy, interest, could go to sleep at night and wake up early, although I did experience some very disturbing dreams.  No gastro side effects.  It was wonderful!  Sadly, after five weeks, suddenly noticed severe swelling on right side one night.  Went to bed (taking viibryd at bedtime, as usual) and began hallucinating nightmares, shaking with fear, palpitations, freezing cold.  Wouldn't stop, even when awakened by my husband repeatedly over 2 nights.   Dr said stop 40mg Viibryd and start Lexapro 20mg.  Was afraid to start Lexapro since I had worked up to the 20 mg in years before.  Next afternoon and night more horrible hallucinating nightmares.  Plus dizziness and out of body feeling and exhaustion.  This is 4th day.  Had very weird dreams and hard time waking up totally today.   Still feeling dizzy, no energy, can't carry on conversation, diarrhea just started, blood pressure low.  Today, cut Lexapro in half,  took it and  2-5,000 mg D3.   Hoping to be back to normal quickly.  I hope this helps someone else in a similar situation.

Firstly, I get hypo to manic easily,secondly, my joints and back and neck, arms and shoulders are absolutely killing me.  I hurt so badly and nothing helps.  My neck and shoulders and back are so stiff and sorethat I cannot look right/lest w/o pain and extreme stiffness. I have debilitating headaches b/c of the stiff neck and shoulder area.  And lastly, my hair is falling out by the handfulls......When I wash it, I save what came out.  It is sofrightening---my husband's mouth even dropsopen when I show the hairloss to him.So, obviously, I've had enough---today is the two month mark that I've been taking it.I am titrating myself down starting today.Too too bad-----it really got me out of bedand back in the world, but now I feel too bad physically to want to be out.  And my mood shifts quickly and forcefully, so bestto just &quot;go back to sleep&quot; like Rob't Deniroin &quot;Awakenings.
Major Depressive Disorder	art42, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	65-74	11/18/2011 5:31:20 PM	Coming off of Cymbalta, did the 10mg, the 20mg and then the 40mg, never have felt so bad in my life.. this is a new drug and may work for some but it took every feeling I had away.. I decrease my 40mg to 20mg for 4 days and then to 10mg for 4days and zero for 3 days of pure hell.. started Lexapro and on my 5th day, at least my head is not totally fuzzy, I sleep better, started taking B3 5000 today twice a day.. I am not better but I know it takes time, but no where in that dark, dark place that Viibryd took me.  if you try it and notice you are getting worse, taper at once, call the doctor and get off that medicine..

Major Depressive Disorder	oliveoyl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	11/17/2011 6:51:20 PM	Starting at 10mgs for one week, then 20mgs the next, I felt nothing except a little diarrhea in the morning, some fatigue, a little headachy, a little sleepless, hungry. Minor. After 5 days on 30mgs, though, my spirit lifted for the first time in over a decade, and I've not felt better since I can remember. The only drug that has ever helped in any way has been parnate, which does conk out. I had absolutely no hope for this drug. I'm amazed and my family and friends have all noticed my confidence, my lack of anxiety; and I wake up every morning, even in this darkening fall, feeling - I can't believe I'm saying this - good.  Keep your fingers crossed for me. I've been hospitalized many times with MDD, suffer from social anxiety, general anxiety, ADD, SAD, and am a &quot;soft&quot; bipolar. I've been useless. To ye of little faith, I say, you never know. Try it - slowly, carefully with food, and hang in there.
Major Depressive Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	11/17/2011 6:49:59 PM	I was on cymbalta for over 10 years and it just wasn't working anymore.  Started on the Viibryd and in the first couple weeks I thought it was amazing.  I felt normal, like a human better than in years but within the next few weeks all that was gone.  We tried adjusting the doses but my depression was worse than ever.  I'm going on a new med and hope it works better.  I just wish there was a way to get to that state from the first couple weeks.
Major Depressive Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	11/17/2011 8:13:32 AM	I mostly had strong stomach issues on this med--diarrhea, nausea all day, could not eat normally.  My doctor kept assuring me that that would all subside.  I did have nightmares but the worst was when I began to feel  like I was losing my mind...which has never happened to me, ever.  This was at the 40 mg dose which I took once.  I shook and cried and screamed at family all day, was ravenous but could not eat, in bathroom at least 15 times that day.   This was not the med for me but glad that it works for some.  3 weeks of misery on top of major depression.     
Major Depressive Disorder	Les, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	55-64	11/16/2011 4:01:33 PM	Had side effects of nausea, diarrhea and fatigue. Unacceptable sexual side effects. I was on this drug for 5 weeks.  At that point, as the side effects continued, doctor slowly withdrew me from the drug. I was at 40mg/day. Everything Viibryd is supposed to do, it didn't do for me. I had extreme fatigue during withdrawal. Viibryd sounds great and I hope it works for everyone else.  it didn't help me.
Other	Trent Martell, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	11/11/2011 9:55:04 AM	Started taking 10mg on Monday.  Today is Friday and about to take another 10mg.  Here is how it has gone so far.Monday:  Giddy for 2 hours, then severely depressed. (i've never been depressed.  i'm taking this for anxiety)  - - I slept fine and had no diarrhea or headaches or other side-effects.Tuesday:  Melancholy/Depressed. - - I slept fine and had no diarrhea or headaches or other side-effects.Wednesday:  Mild Melancholy, but I noticed my anxiety was not nearly as severe.  I started feeling really depressed that night...maybe the medicine was wearing off.  Also that night I had restless legs and insomnia(never had this before).  I had to take Tylenol PM to sleep...My mind would not let me sleep and I NEVER have trouble sleeping.  That was weird.Thursday:  I felt actually mostly happy and my anxiety was mostly gone, but every now and then i would get these depressive episodes (and again, I have NEVER been depressed - I am taking this for anxiety).  That night, I was in a kind of melancholy where I just couldn't feel anything....it was as if I was just watching the world go by.  Also, I had insomnia Thursday night.  I would wake up every hour and I had bizarre dreams that made no sense.  I didn't have the restless leg thing, though.  Friday:  Today is Friday.  I hope that the insomnia and depression will pass(considering i've NEVER had this).  This will be day 5 of taking 10mg in the morning (with food).** Does anyone else find it odd that this medicine would make me depressed, considering I have NEVER been depressed?  It's an ANTI-depressant.  Just a thought. ****  I'll give an update in a few days **
Other	My Opinion on Viibryd., 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	45-54	11/10/2011 1:14:27 AM	I have started taking 20mg. of viibryd daily over a month now for depression as well as for anxiety. I do not think its that great of a medication as far as the other antidepressants i have tried in the past. I think it causes the same weight gains as the other drugs do.
Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/8/2011 2:46:01 PM	I was previously on prozac and abilify and things were okay but I didn't feel like myself.  I switched to Viibryd a month ago and feel wonderful.  I am still on abilify but weaning of it per doctors orders.  If your insurance covers Viibryd I suggest you try it.
Major Depressive Disorder	DVZ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	11/7/2011 6:27:00 PM	Do not take this drug. Take every single bad experience people have listed here, multiply it by 10 and that still would not come close to the horror I encountered the day of my second 40 mg dose. This needs to be pulled off the market immediately before someone hurts themselves or others.
Major Depressive Disorder	Soccer5, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	45-54	11/6/2011 6:22:33 AM	I have been on Celexa for the last 8 years and had reached the highest dose and it was loosing its effectiveness. Switched slowly over (period of about a month) to Viibryd and have just come off the Celexa completely.I have noticed that my mood seems more stable, have had some stomach issues but no severe nightmares etc. I have noticed that my joints, particularly knees and ankles have been in pain. As an old soccer player who still plays, I thought it was due to that. After reading reviews, is this cause of the meds? Will have to check with Dr. Not 100% sure about this med yet. 
Major Depressive Disorder	DarlaHood, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/6/2011 1:40:12 AM	I've been on prozac, Cymbalta, wellbutrin, paxil, and others and had sexual side effects, profuse sweating, and weight gain. Still I did not feel like my old self prior to my depression. I started viibryd 2 months ago after going off all my meds and feeling very anxious and depressed.  It was strong when I first took it, and I felt nauseous and lethargic for about 2 days when I first began taking it and then again when I went from 10 to 20 mg and from 20 to 40 mg. However, once I got past the couple day adjustment to 40 mg (which the literature cites as the optimum dose, I started to feel better.  I take it at night after dinner.  I feel great for the first time in years!  No sweats. No weight gain ( I eat a healthy diet high in protein and with limited amounts of healthy carbs like fruits, veggies, beans, and whole grains). And I do not have the sexual side effects that were so frustrating with the other antidepressants I've taken. I feel so good and so level.  My night time panic attacks are almost gone and if I wake up, I can get myself back to sleep with prayer and meditation.  I have energy and no longer have any side effects. The side effects lasted a total of about 6 days during the first month, but only 2 days at a time during dose changes.  Tis drug is working wonderfully for me.  I know different things work for different people, but this has been a gift for me. Don't discount it without giving it a try if you're not satisfied with other medications.
Major Depressive Disorder	DestressMe, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	11/5/2011 8:39:45 AM	Day 1 on 10 mg...immediate difference noticed in despression...no crying spells...not sleeping well at all...3-4 hours instead of 8-9.  Day 3-10mg...woke up weak, green, anxiety, heart racing and vomiting...I did have a couple of drinks earlier in the evening...wasn't aware that drinking alcohol was a bad mixture with this medicine....Day 13 -- 20 mg...woke with extreme headache lasting almost 12 hrs.  Day 14 -- moved up to 30 mg instead of 40 mg as instructed -- woke up confused, anxiety, heart racing, green, sweating and vomiting again...no alcohol this time, but think I didn't eat enough food with pill in the morning.  Although these side effects that everyone is talking about and what I have experienced is quite scary...I'm planning on toughing it out in hopes that the side effects will subside as other readers have stated.  I plan to take 30 mg for a couple of weeks before moving up to 40 mg...if it all.  I did start taking Melatonin supplements to help me sleep and it has helped tremendously...after one week of no sleep, I was very irritable and impatient.  I'm starting to feel less anxious, irritable and impatient and the daily crying spells have stopped!  I haven't had any nightmares as others have stated....I hope it stays that way!

I didn't feel like they were over when I woke up.  I got increasingly angry and irritable with the weeks I was on it.  I quit at 6 weeks and have no plans to go back to the Dr. that prescribed.  I've never experienced anything like it.  I was falling apart. It did nothing for my anxiety or depression except make them worse.
Major Depressive Disorder	Antidepornot, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	11/3/2011 3:11:00 PM	My doctor gave me the sample pack which contained 7 days of 10mg, 7 days 20mg, 14 days of 40mg. I didn't have bad side affects until the first 40mg. I took it at supper time. At 3:00 in the morning I thought I was having a nervous breakdown. I couldn't stop pacing back and forth, my hands were tingling, dizzy, sweating, racing heart, legs kept twitching, felt terrible. Called the doctor next morning, he said it was up to me but I should give it a chance. So, I did. Finished the pack and purchased a month supply. Everyday I had tingling in the arms and hands some in the legs. After being on the 40mg for a month I started waking up in the middle of the night with racing heart, dizziness, nausea. I also experienced diarrhea and nausea through out the day along with mind tricks. I decided I wanted to go off of it. I got another pack of 7 days of 20mg 7 days of 10mg to tapper off. Took my last 10mg 2 days ago. Still dealing with side effects such as, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, and depression. I don't want to go on anything else. I have been on Prozac, Effexor XR, Pristiq off an on for 17 yrs. None of which totally took the depression away. Side effects of missing one day of Effexor and Pristiq were terrible.
Other	sickandtired999, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	11/2/2011 8:30:17 PM	Horrible drug. I have mild depression with major anxiety disorder. Started on the pack and went to 40mg. Felt better for a good month and then suddenly, my hair was falling out like I had some kind of disease! Started to retain water and gained 20 pounds in a matter of 6 weeks! Nightmares too. Cut back to 20mg....same issues. Blood work came back with lower sodium levels than I had in the past along with Vit D deficiency. In my opinion, if you have adverse effects in the beginning, move on to something else. Ive been on almost every anti-d out there and this is the worst. Looks like Im heading back to Prozac AGAIN. Zac is the only one that works for me.
Other	crazy woman, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	11/1/2011 4:39:11 PM	This is a horrible medication and I would not recommend any one to use it.  I had horrible nightmares, hallicuations, hives, dizzyness, feelings of fainting, memory loss and tremors.  I had so many different things go wrong, I can remember them all. I can't remember when I was ever so sick.  
Major Depressive Disorder	concerned, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	19-24	10/31/2011 2:28:16 AM	I took the 10mg for a week and the first 3 days were fine. I was still depressed and anxious, but I was able to get out of bed feeling ready for the day. I was starting to feel better. By the 4th day, I had begun waking up in the middle of the night not being able to breathe, which is something that has never happened to me. I've also never reacted negatively to a medication. I expressed my concerns to my doctor who told me it was a panic attack, dismissed them, and told me to continue that night with 20mg. I woke up that night in a panic, not being able to breathe, heart racing, and threw up for the next day as well as suffering from wicked diarrhea for the next 3 days. I was shaky and just a mess. I called my doctor frantically at 3am and she didn't get back to me until 11am the next day. She told me to stop taking the medicine (well duh). This happened about 6 days ago. I tried to eat my first meal today and have wanted to throw up since and I have never been thirstier in my life. I have a constant supply of gatorade and pretzels (the two things that don't upset my stomach). I know I sound incredibly frantic, but I can't even describe how miserable this has been- especially for a college student and for someone who has always reacted well to medication. I haven't been to classes in a week and a half and had to go home for the first time in 5 months. My hope is for people to realize that, I believe, this is a relatively new medication. I'm no doctor, but I do know my own body and this medication didn't want to be in it, and decided to wreak havoc on the way out. I wish I had done my research, and if you're reading this, good for you. I never use medications that are this new. My suggestion is to wait until this has been on the market for longer. I wish you all the best of luck on the road to recovery.

Major Depressive Disorder	1manhattan, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	10/23/2011 9:00:24 PM	I'm also bipolar II, suffer from SAD and major anxiety disorder  -  life-long, paralyzing afflictions. I'm in my 50s.  The only thing that has ever helped, until it conks out, is Parnate.  Every couple of years.  I've tried everything.  I had no faith in vilazodone, and to be honest I've been on this drug for only 4 weeks, going up 10 mgs a week. Now I'm at 30 mgs and staying put. Initially, with each increase, there have been stomach, sleep and headache issues, but  they soon pass. The result is noticeably less anxiety, a clear head, a smile, and physical stamina (I do try to exercise as much as possible). The difference between now and the past several years is immense; but I'm holding my breath. Will keep you posted.
Major Depressive Disorder	Indyguy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	35-44	10/21/2011 6:00:49 PM	I started at 10 mg and had some nausea and insomnia only for the first week. The drug was not helping my mood so I ramped to 20 mg then to 40 mg over the course of a month. Luckily, I've had no weight gain, but I have had serious sexual dysfunction. This drug was advertised as not causing these problems, but by 40 mg my genitals were completely numb. Mood improvement started at 20 mg but once I got to 40 mg all hell broke loose. I started having extreme anxiety (feeling all &quot;wound up&quot;) to the point where people at work thought I was seriously stressed and about to break. I got uncontrollable hand shaking (I couldn't write or eat with a fork), night terrors, breaks with reality, auditory hallucinations and head and leg heaviness (felt like wood). I finally wound up in the hospital with convulsive fits. I really didn't want to take this drug anymore, but my pdoc left me on it at 20 mg. I have been OK at this dosage- noticeable mood improvement (and no standard SSRIs have worked well for me). No terrible side effects, but still the sexual stuff (no numbness but lack of function) and constant leg bouncing. I guess I just reached a threshold where my body couldn't deal with it. The effects of this drug escalate quickly with dosage, so I'd go really slow with it. I am now backing off to 10 mg, so hopefully the benefits will continue and the remaining side effects will abate.
Major Depressive Disorder	jfb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	10/21/2011 3:22:37 PM	Because of my sensitivity to medications, my doctor put me on 10 mg for two weeks before I increased my dosage to 20 mg.  During the two weeks, I had stomache issues, feelings of being drugged, and lethargy.  However, I felt calmer.  The day I went increased my dosage to 20 mg, I experienced a migraine-like headache and threw up everything that I had eaten that day.  I called my doctor and now I am titrating off of this drug.  Not a good experience.
Major Depressive Disorder	LivingAgain, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	10/21/2011 2:07:18 AM	Nothing less than MIRACULOUS. I suffered migraines, nausea, anxiety, and joint pain for more than a decade. It took about 3 weeks before these ailments started to disappear. I encourage anyone that is going to try vilazodone, to take it at the same time (morning for me)everyday with food. Also be weary of any supplements you take as these can cause trouble (milk thistle for example is a no-go). Drinking alcohol  while on vilazodone is a BAD idea. I've had no bad side effects. It has been a JOY to re-discover feeling 'normal', mostly meaning centered and hopeful for a positive future.

Started the packet with the 10 &amp; 20 mg. pills and had headaches, trembling in my hands, woke up in the night with what seemed like arthritis pain in my hands and suicidal thoughts (new to me).  The day after my first 40 mg. pill, I went to the ER with heart palpitations, severe pain in my left arm, tingling and numbness in left hand, high BP (168/120 also new to me), continuing headaches and nightmares.  I did not recognize this as side effects to the drug until after spending 5 days in the hospital running every heart test known to man on me which all turned out normal.  They sent me home on 4 new heart and BP medications.  After reading these other reviews, I called my psychiatrist and he told me to go back to the Celexa and see if these symptoms go away.  I feel pretty certain that they will.

Trip to the ER reveals only swelling.  Constant headaches, nausea, intermittent diarrhea, heart palpitations, strange dreams, frequently disrupted sleep due to intensity of dreams; sleep without rest; a few times, I have had the feeling of a blackout or seizure (due to the pressure in the front of my head); one day, I had electric currents twitching in my right arm.  I also feel lethargic most days but once every 30 days or so I will get a burst of energy.  I also have bloating in my belly and the feeling of heaviness in my limbs.  I will discontinue use per my doctors orders as this is not helping.

I am now off of it cold turkey for my third day... and i feel like im coming off of thc or something extremely potent, for i can't actually stand still without wobblying, and my eyes drifting. this is a VERY scary medicine and I don't believe anything good came of this. PLEASE be aware of the sudden side effects i played off as &quot;being just me&quot; WRITE THEM DOWN. after almost just one month... it almost ruined my life.

Personal side effects include suicidal thoughts, violent nightmares, numerous body aches and pains, severe arthritis with no prior arthritic history, increased anxiety, irritability, mental confusion, and nausea. This drug caused far more problems than it helped for me. Hopefully I am the rare exception to the rule or this drug should be taken off the market before people get hurt.The side effects were minimal and tolerable at first but instead of getting better they grew much much worse over 2 months of use.Use with caution.

Pristiq seemed to simply stop working.  Took my Viibryd exactly as prescribed--with at least 400 calories of food.  Had mild nausea the first couple of nights.  Began to have intermittent &quot;jimmy legs&quot; and occasional hiccups.  (Don't think I've had hiccups in years.)  Night after first 40 mg dose was awful.  Could not sleep at all due to leg and arm spasms coupled with pins and needles pain.  I felt like a fish out of water flopping around on a beach.

Did not like the way I felt, like I had taken too much -medicine head- is best way to describe it.  Short term memory loss was severe, weight gain, lightheaded, spacey, irritated,  depressed.  Went back to Prozac 40 mg and the first two days were horrible.  Was in bed with migraine and exhausted feeling, generally felt sick all over.

I feel better than i have in years regarding the depression but an having such bad anxiety attacks and nightmares. also terrible insomina. I am having a lot of pain in my hands and wrists but dont know if this is a side effect or just my fibroymyalgia acting up. I am going to try cutting the dosage in half to see if that helps, other wise I will have to once again try something else.. sigh
Major Depressive Disorder	SW, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	10/10/2011 1:07:30 AM	I started taking it 3.5 weeks ago, working my way up the dosages on the sample pack.  I had to quit taking it.  I got the worse heart burn, burning stomach and diarrhea I have ever had.  It was awful.  I was taking it at night so I could try to sleep through most of the effects but the burning would keep me out of bed.  My dreams were vivid and dark so when I woke up I was unable to get back to sleep.

I've been very calm, focused and mood is great.  I don't find that my libido is any better than when on Lexapro (48 yr old male) and issues with inorgasmia are still present. I've had horrible, scary dreams and I wake up with this dread feeling that I can't seem to shake to stop the dream cycle.  Seems like I wake and re-dream the same thing in great detail. I hope this is a transition and that it passes.
Major Depressive Disorder	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	10/8/2011 3:24:43 PM	Took sample pack and just got my 3rd refill today. Experienced some of side effects early on but never read any reviews so was not biases. Have taken most off the anti depression meds but this has definetly been the best. Take it with food in morning and sleep and other side effects will be minimal. I think alot of problems is what you take it with. I only take a xanex in small dosage at night. Hope it keeps working as good as it has the past 3 months.

Praying to God to awake me.  Felt like I was falling into a black hole sceaming to get out and back to the real world.  Afraid of going to sleep. One night my mother woke me up because I was screaming &quot;I going to KILL you!!&quot; I don't remember who I was talking to. That's not my character. Pleading to my doctor that this medication is doing it.  He keep telling me it's not the Viibryd. Until I found proof that others have the same problems. The depression did get better, but the trade off sucked. He finally agreed to ween me off today. Hell I started yesterday. Thank God for you all that told the truth.   
Major Depressive Disorder	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	19-24	10/7/2011 4:43:40 PM	Ive been on Viibryd for a few months now. I started with the trial pack and had gotten up to 40mg and started having many of the side effects I'm seeing from other reviewers like the horrible anxiety, nightmares, nausea, etc... So I explained this to my doctor and decided to cut my dosage a bit. Now all is pretty well again. I feel pretty great, started working out again, going out on dates, getting back into my old hobbies. My libido is just as well if not better than before but I've never really had a problem with that as I am only 22 =D I've also been able to put down cigarettes on this medication as it made the anxiety from the nicotine withdrawal bearable. I sleep like a baby on this drug, except when I was on 40mg as that was way too much for my body and it would keep me awake and make me feel panicky and such. Now I feel fine as I have found the right dosage for myself which is 30mg. May the force be with you.

Will be seeing a nutritiousness today to detox myself from this, be careful this drug is not for everyone.

Major Depressive Disorder	jojo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/4/2011 6:26:21 PM	Before Viibyrd I was using Effexor XR and I have to say that in less than 1 week I feel so much better than I ever have felt using Effexor. The only side effect I seem to experience is just a little diarrhea in the morning shortly after taking the pill, but then it quickly goes away and I'm fine.  I was skeptical when my doctor gave this to me and am so surprised that even with the starting of only 10mg I can feel this much better so quickly.  I highly recommend anyone who needs this type of medication to certainly try this. My suicidal thoughts and gloom &amp; doom mood have faded away and I'm feeling 'alive' again. Thank you for saving my life.

I've also 'caught' something out of the corner of my eye. Hearing noises. Woke up last night hearing my heart 'clacking' in my ears. Thought it was someone walking towards me in high heels on my tiled floor. Anxiety level has increased dramatically. I'm not normally over-anxious. Scared of nights and going to sleep. Daily leg pain.  Occasional brain zaps after taking dose that feels like my brain is being rewired. Nod off to sleep while working on the computer. My daughter said go to dr and stop med. After years of different antidepressants, I have no idea what to try. I was hoping to be happier and calmer. Sheesh!
Major Depressive Disorder	lessISmore, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	10/3/2011 8:15:05 PM	Worst depression med ever. Like effexor as far as the sleep gos, I did not get much. Like coming off of oxycontin as far as my stomach was concerned. The first night I took the 10mg i couldn't sleep, even got up at 3:30 am so as not to disturb my wife and son, diareah all week, noticable mood elevation, sleep was sparse. The first night i took a 20mg I did the toss &amp; turn all night, 2nd night i slept for about an hour, than woke to severe nausea, which led to the most violent vomiting I have experienced. So bad my tonsils were bleeding. I have come off OC's before and this was worse. I cut my dose back to 10mg to ween off, and as of last Thursday I've stopped taking it. I have felt like a crackhead ever since. Appatite is weak, no sleep, diarrhea, ect. Overall, this is a powerful fast acting mood med , that for me has to go. Zoloft, here I cum......well, it'll take a while, but that's a better side effect in my book. Those of you who make it to 40mg, good luck.

When you don't take the medication at the same time I had very bad dreams, and couldn't wake up from them. I had very bad leg and body pain.
Other	motogirlps, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	45-54	10/3/2011 10:03:07 AM	I was given this in addition to Wellbutrin to help with some anxiety and depression while getting off other meds. An hour after I took it, I had really bad abdominal cramping, loose stools, and then the craziness set in. I felt dizzy, out of my head, very confused, could not concentrate. I took half a xanax and felt a little better. About three hours later I felt pretty ok, but still unable to formulate a complete thought. I hid in my office for those three hours avoiding conversation with coworkers for this very reason. I haven't tried it since. I like what I've read, and I did like the zippy feeling. Has anyone had this experience and have those negative side effects go away over a few days?

I am on 40mg and when I first started taking it I loved it. I have been on it for three months and can't imagine not taking it. I feel amazing. Depression isn't even in my vocabulary anymore:) Really has been a blessing for me.
Other	Bryan D.,  Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		10/1/2011 3:56:50 AM	I have been on Zoloft for years due to a brain and spinal cord trauma.  I suffer from pain induced mood disorder(mostly agressive personality and depression) Not only did I notice within the first three doses that this medicine dramatically dropped my pain syndrom(from a constant 6-7/10 to about a 3/10); It was wiithin the first ten days that I noticed people asking me what was wrong with me because my moods were highly improved.  I don't know for fact that it wasn't the added benefit of the secondary effect of pain control; however this medicine has far been the most positive for myself. The cost of Viibryd at $155 per month far outweighs my $1400 for Lyrica and $60 for my generic Zoloft.  As far as side effect, the insomnia and anorgasmia have faded extremely fast in comparison to the SSRI's ten plus months.  There are no stomach issues or other side effects that I have noted.  I am not saying this drug is for everyone but I would definately say give it a try; if it's not for you it's not for you.  I do think that this medicine deserves the benefit of the doubt.

I felt foggy and had no emotions--no sadness but no joy. Then the terrible stomach pains began. Thought I had ulcers and went to my doctor. Had CT scans and other tests. Could find nothing wrong. Have stopped the Viibyrd--gradually of course. I feel so much better. I would not ever recommend this medication.

I also woke up every hour during the night in the beginning, but that went away. This is by far the best medicine I have ever had for my depression. The side effects will go away if you stick with it. Be brave.

He said that after I started this I wouldn't have HF anymore.  The first week @ small mg, I was sick to my stomach/Diarrhea/Flighty/leg twitching.  Increased dosage, same unpleasant person.  When I up'd to 40mg (day 2) WOW, and not good!  Vision,Heart racing, twitching, bones hurt, headache, overall scary feeling!  My husband said that Dr knows what he's talking about but I think the doseage to too stong.  I'll give it a few more days and if it doesn't change I'll go back to Prozac.  All of this because of Menopause and Hot Flashes!

The doctor immediately removed me from the medication.For the next four days the attacks continued followed by the most terrifying nightmares that I have ever experienced. I have taken Paxil in the past as well as Zoloft. I have never had such a horrible experience with an ssri in my life. I would not recommend this medication to anyone.

Major Depressive Disorder	lsugirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	25-34	9/22/2011 7:48:14 PM	I started with the trial pack and have been on 40mg for a week now. Im not sure if it started with the 20mg or the 40mg, but I have had horrible nightmares. I could not even tell myself if I was just dreaming or in reality. They have been such intense frightening dreams that I have prayed to God to wake me up if it was in fact a dream. One time when the dream continued I really panicked thinking it was my real life. We are talking about very scary dreams that felt like I was alive and living through them. I have never been so scared in my life. I literally could not decide if I was dreaming or not. I'm not sure why it keeps happening but I wont be continuing with this sheer terror if it keeps up any longer. And I have never had nightmares until taking this new medicine. It appears others have had frightining dreams as well, so you guys be careful. I would rather have GI issues over hallucinations/nightmares any day. I have also been very irritable and angry since starting the medicine, and that is not like me at all. Ive snapped at family a few times and thats not normal for me. I'm not an angry person at all. This is hard for me to have angry moments and get worked up over small things.

This summer transitioned to Cymbalta hoping that would help reduce fatigue.  Could not tolerate at any dosage.  My dr. then gave me a trial pack of Viibryd; had trouble with tolerating at 20mg so tapered off.  I've been off for 1 week-has anyone else experienced severe leg pain/stiffness when coming off this drug?  I don't know what else could explain it.

When I was first prescribed this medication I was started at 10 mg.  I started waking up at all hours of the night.  Then I went on to the 20 mg pills and the loose stools begain.  No diarrhea but loose stools and at least 3 times a day which is very unusual for me.  I am currently going into my second week of the 40 mg pills and so far so good.  The insomnia has improved.  Still loose stools but nothing that I can't deal with.  A little weight gain in the beginning appears to be leveling off now.  Sex drive and energy level has increased tremendously.

Fatigue, hypotonia, have to eat high calory foods to keep up with weight loss. When I am hungry, i feel so EMPTY and so depressed that I MUST EAT Immediately, or cry like a baby;  have not checked my glycemia while experiencing this hurrible side effect. Have had other SSRIs but never had such hunger induced hurrible sadness. note, I am not diabetic. No Visual side effects like Mydriasis.Generally more tolerable than other SSRIs, and I wished I had this med 10 months earlier, could have saved my marriage.

Gastric probs finally eased after two weeks then upped to 20mg. Whomp! hit again. Backed off, stayed at 10mg for a few weeks. Still foggy headed, low motivation but not depressed, though that seems paradoxical.  My doc suggested upping the dosage again.  I was skeptical but tried it anyway.  This time I didn't have the gastric probs.  At 40mg and feel like a new person.  It's like a veil has been opened.  Energy is generally good, mood good, motivation much improved.  Only real problem is increased urinary urgency that results in getting up several times a night despite Lunesta. I've been hospitalized three times and been on so many med regimens I can't count. I feel better than I have in years.  Hoping it lasts.  Also taking 150mg Lamictal daily.  I do have headaches but it's a small price to pay for regaining my life.  I'm glad I stuck it out through the cramping and diarrhea and titrated more slowly than manufacturer recommends.  For others, try candied ginger for upset stomach.  Definitely helps while not adding another chemical to the system to throw it out of whack. Won't help diarrhea but does help the upset feeling.

Other		5	5	4			9/7/2011 11:13:44 PM	I have atypical depression. I have tried Wellbutrin (allergic reaction), Zoloft (diarrhea, anxiety), Prozac (good experience), and Effexor, which made me crave alcohol every day even though I generally dislike alcohol and am not a regular drinker. All of these gave me delayed ejaculation problems except for the Wellbutrin. I pretty much gave up on meds until I had a major depressive bout and went back to the psychiatrist who suggested I give Viibryd a try. It has made everything so much better! No side effects, high energy and motivation, and has stabilized my usually volatile temper greatly. I've read  alot of negative reviews out there so I was compelled to write this review because in my case, rare as it may be, Viibrys has worked where nothing else did.

I was experiencing slight hallucinations, blurred vision, change in taste, insomnia, increased anger and dream-like states.  Scary, but I am my own advocate and stopped.  I think I'll try changing my diet before I try another medication.  Any suggestions or feedback would be greatly appreciated.  I understand that I may be more sensitive at low dosages since I am new to anti-depressants; however, I know my body and I was hoping a side-effect free reaction.  Definitely a scary outcome.

I was reducing Prozac as I was taking the Viibryd.  However, two days into the second week (the 20 mg dose), I started having severe stomach cramps.  So bad that I went to my GP who thought it might be bacterial and put me on an antibiotic.  I took the antibiotic and increased to the 40 mg dose of Viibryd. The cramps never stopped and continued to get worse as I raised the dose.  I really didn't want to believe it was the Viibryd as I was feeling better on it; however after a CT scan ruled out anything else, my doc told me to stop the Viibryd.  After a few days, stomach pains went away.  What a shame as it seemed like a great drug.  Couldn't take the constant stomach pain.

I have had weight gain with other meds so we tried this one.  It brought about headaches, stomache aches, nausea, diarrhea, horrible dreams, insomnia, a few pounds gained and an overall feeling of &quot;blah&quot;.  I took it for 8 weeks at every dose suggested and even tried halfing some doses.  I have been off it for a little over a week and on to a new drug.  Already feeling so much better.  This drug...not for me.

But I felt so much better...anxiety and mood is much better. My husband says that he finally has his wife back and I feel like myself again. Now on Day 22, and stomach pains are gone. (I am glad that I stuck it out)...I eat yogurt and bagel/ cream cheese every morning with this med...I am very satisfied now...I have tried many others and so far...so GOOD!!

Major Depressive Disorder	RLStev, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	45-54	9/2/2011 9:36:57 AM	I started this med a little over a week ago for mdd and I was having alot of anxiety. I have had diaherra,tremors,shaking very bad and restless legs,plus blurry vision,and my anxiety has worsened. Although it has seemed to help with my fibro pain and has helped my mood,I called my doc and he said to stop the med. There's not alot of reviews on this med yet,but the ones I have read don't seem to be having as bad side effects as me . I don't understand. I am on Savella for fibro and Trazodone for sleep.
Major Depressive Disorder	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	9/2/2011 3:25:32 AM	Started feeling better very soon. Not crying so often or easily.  More energy and wanting to do  things.  Wondered if I might really be getting my life back! So wonderful.  Noticed the headaches right away but thought headaches are nothing compared to depression.  Then the NIGHTMARES started.  Couldn't expain them at first.  Just woke up knowing I was having them.  Tonite has been horrible.  The nightmares are so vivid.  I know everything that is happening.  My husband and I are trying to sleep and have even gone to get our toddler to keep her in the bed with us to protect her.  It is pitch dark and people are coming by our bed and grabbing at us.  They are trying to put foam over us and saying that first we must have the foam and then the water.  I am physically touching the people in these dreams and fighting them off.  Squeezing their arms and pushing them away as they are closing in.  They will no stop!!! I have one hand on my daughter at all times and am using arms, hands and feet to fight them off.  Finally got up and turned on lights and looked up this med and nightmares.  The effectiveness is lessening and I am at about 6 or 7 weeks. I have not experienced nightmares with any other ADs.
