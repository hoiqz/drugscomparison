Repeated Seizures with Unconsciousness Between Episodes	mcdevittjosh, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	35-44	2/16/2012 4:24:59 PM	In treating my severe epilepsy, my Neurologist prescribed Midazolam IV, to be administered Nasally, using a syringe with a inhaler-tip. After drawing the drug into a syringe, the tip is then replaced w/an IN-tip. I carry-around a prepared syringe, inside of a toothbrush holder. My only concern is that I may be becoming dependent on this, more and more; however, it has stopped what would, otherwise, have been severe Gran-Mal seizures, as soon as the aura would come on.
Other	terrible drug, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	55-64	1/31/2012 8:39:16 PM	I requested an unsedated colonoscopy because of a previous adverse drug reaction to Versed.  For some reason they gave it to me anyway; as I was complainng of terrible anxiety the nurse joked that &quot;you won't remember anyway&quot;.  I remember not being able to breathe, removing the IV and getting off the table. The endo doc ran out the door and the nurse tried to grab me; I was still having difficulty breathing and somehow she became unconscious with a bloody nose. A code was called and I demanded and received IV epinephrine which improved my breathing also IV steroid.  The wanted to admit me but I was too scared to stay in this nut-house; I got some benedryl pills and left.

I awoke feeling fine with none of the after effects of nausea, etc. that I usually experience from surgery.   
Additional Agent to Induce General Anesthesia	One More Boomer, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	5/20/2011 10:41:01 AM	Received this drug as I was being told &quot;something to relax you.&quot; I do not remember the respiratory distress in PACU following surgery although it is documented in my chart.  Didn't know I would have amnesia for 8 hours but I'd keep on talking after general anesthesia reversal.  Had terrible anxiety, fearfulness and nightmares within 24 hours and lasted for months.  (This is 10 months out now)Worst part: can't go near the hospital complex for any followup (I had cancer surgery) because of panic and heart racing to point of passing out. I used to be very responsible about my appointments and treatments. I feel ashamed I can't control myself and still worry what I said that I don't remember.This was a very bad experience and a very bad drug for me. Wish I had at least been given a choice about the amnesia, and been informed about the respiratory problem. Looking for doctors two hours down the road so I don't neglect my health much longer.

Anxiety associated with an Operation	ptsdfromversed, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	11/27/2009 6:01:42 PM	Was given this drug as a &quot;sedative&quot;. Immediately lost all memory until I arrived in the OR, whereupon I felt confused over the loss of memory from pre-op and felt anxious, fearful and panicky. The anesthetist began giving me the drug again after I had moved myself from the stretcher to the OR table. He never told me a thing about the drug and administered general anesthesia directly from the Versed. I am suffering from flashbacks, anxiety, panic and it has been weeks since the procedure. This is a terrible drug that should not be used on people. The flashbacks are terrible. It seems to affect those who awaken after being given the drug and all feel a sense of betrayal. Never again will allow the use of any amnesiac drug.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	6/22/2009 3:26:36 PM	It has been working for over 8 years now with no serious side effects.

Other	jackie, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	10/8/2007 8:41:47 PM	Was given this drug without warning or explanation.  Developed extreme anxiety and rage, insomnia, etc. which lasted for months, far beyond the alleged after life of the drug.  Must have become combative AFTER they injected enough of this poison (12 mls) and also got Benadryl, Fentanyl, Isoflurane and Propofol for a simple out patient surgery.  I will not allow the use of this drug on me again and have a medic alert bracelet outling this!
