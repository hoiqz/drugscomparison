Sensation of Spinning or Whirling	tiger Lily, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/17/2012 9:23:55 AM	don't know what causes my vertigo, I am on BP meds for 12 years and I have had this ever since. dizziness if weather changes, hits me at night when I am sleeping only to wake up to the room spinning, very hard to deal with once it happens, I somehow came across dramamine and I take it 1 hour before going to bed and It works great, but if I don't take it, I take the risk of having dizziness/vertigo again so for maintanance I take it every day, sometimes I half the pill and it still works great. The doc did not put me on this I just chose to do it myself, but on my next doc visit I will tell him about it and see what he thinks. I was worried about side effects but I don't really have any at all, so I am happy with that. don't live in fear with vertigo or dizziness if I have to take this for the rest of my life then I will cause it is not fun at all living with vertigo, and can reek havic on your nervous system. Good luck with dramamine, it works for me!

It makes you drowsy though and you wake up or turn out with dry mouth. Only major issue is that it can be easily dependable/addictive, varying on the person.
Nausea and Vomiting	Erin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	7/7/2011 3:00:23 PM	I have a duodenal ulcer and get severe nausea, sometimes throwing up (due to the ulcer itself; and the vicodin/percocet I take for the pain)...and this medication allows me to be at work and do my normal activities by easing the nausea from the ulcer and the narcotic pain meds.  It makes me drowsy though,but I will take that instead of the nausea...AND it also makes me feel hungry all the time, increases my appetite.

It seems to help considerably and I am never without it. I no longer get as drowsy as I use to. I always start with taking 1/2 and then the other 1/2. The only problem I have is it seems to make either my skin thin or my blood thin because I can bump my hand and it will bleed. also leaves the &quot;purple&quot; spots you will see on an elderly person taking blood thinners. When I can go a couple of days without taking the medicine, the thin skin/bleeding quits.I would recommend this to any IBS sufferer. 
Disease with Hearing Loss, Ringing in the Ears &amp;amp; Dizziness	bam, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	1/4/2011 8:45:15 AM	I use this for the vertigo attacks associated with Meniere's disease.  It helps with the vertigo, but leaves me drowsy and I have to nap for a couple of hours.  But after that I am usually fine.

I find this even more frustrating than the initial symptoms. It does nothing to help with the ringing in my ears.

I no longer fear long drives or boat rides since i started taking this product in 2001. It works for me much better than Gravol...It causes extreme drowsiness within the first hour but after that I am fine. 
Nausea and Vomiting	klk, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	1/26/2010 7:05:08 PM	had severe n/v, unrelieved with my usual Pepto Bismol, simethicone, or cimetidine.   The dramamine chew tabs worked almost immediately. I was not fully relieved of the nausea, but it helped.   CON- developed tinnitus of the ears for first time ever.
Motion Sickness	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/6/2009 10:47:40 AM	i have motion sickness anytime I travel. I have taken it for up to 18 days(on extended travel) without any side effects, along with other medication. The less drowsy formula for 24 hours is best

Other	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	3/30/2009 3:31:04 PM	occasionally i take Dramamine as a sleep aid and will take it for several weeks. Have been doing this for years....Now I am concerned since I now have &quot;short term Memory loss&quot;, Mild...loss of balance, problem with inner ear and positional vertigo.  I am 65.  could this possibility play a part in my px?  The memory problems are not extreme maybe just my age..

Prevention of Motion Sickness	firefightra, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/20/2008 8:38:22 PM	  I am a scuba diver; but, am plagued with nausea and vomiting when conditions on the water are poor.  I have been diving in Mexico and I started vomiting uncontrollably in the water and on the boat when the waves were high. I recently came back from the Dominican Republic and had the same problems.  I actually had to cut one of my dives short; because, I was vomiting underwater from the rocking of the ocean.  I talked to some locals and they suggested dramaine.  I was hesitant; because, I am very sensitive to drugs that may cause drowsiness.  I love to dive and thought that I would give it a try instead of cancelling the remainder of my dives. The next day we were caught in 10 - 12 foot swells both in the boat and in the water and I was very mildly nauseous...it was very bearable.  If I hadn't taken the drug I would have been extremely sick.  The only side effect was that after I had finished my dive I began to feel drowsy and had to sleep for 2 hours.  I felt groggy for the rest of the day; but, it was a mild side effect.  I took dramamine for the remainder of my dives and it worked like a charm.  I highly recommend it for motion sickness and you definately need to take it 1/2 - 1 hour in advance for it to work effectively.

Feel Like Throwing Up	Lynn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/27/2008 8:34:30 AM	I live in Kentucky and seem to have all sorts of allergy/sinus problems plus migraines. All of these make me feel sick to my stomach. One Dramamine at the on set of feeling sick usually takes care of the problem. It works within 15 minutes and is a 'life saver'. Dramamine comes in a small tube to carry in my purse and can be purchased at any drug store. :)
