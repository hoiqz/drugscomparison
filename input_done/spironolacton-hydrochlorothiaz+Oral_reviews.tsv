Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	4/20/2012 12:48:54 PM	I was prescribed this for my adult acne flare ups.  I tell you worst thing ever. I felt like I was going to pass out.  In less than a week I was immobilized with pain.  My right breast and shoulders felt sharp shooting pains.  I felt lethargic and always felt like I was going to puke.  I was popping Tums every time I ate.  At this rate I will keep my acne and facial hair.  It is not worth me going through all this grief.  I will take the naturalistic approach.

It was a very close call at the grocery store today.  My hair had been thickening since I quit drinking.  But, I notice it getting a little thinner again.  Anyone else have the bladder control and hairloss problems?  Sure could use some advice.

I note my potassium is a little low - - -hmmm - good website

Its alarming to me that this pill could do this after a week!Beware!

Without it I blow up like a balloon, I hold so much water my skin literally stretches until it looks like it is going to split. I am very grateful for Spirono/HCTZ.
