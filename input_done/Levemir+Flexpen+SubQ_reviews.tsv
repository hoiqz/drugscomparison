Diabetes	jusviv, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	8/2/2012 6:25:05 PM	Levemir does me absolutly no good at all. One thing it does is increase my hunger, waking up in the middle of the night feeling starved and wanting to eat. That is the last thing an overweight diabetic needs.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	75 or over Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	2	3	Male		7/20/2012 11:04:50 PM	The flex pen does not work properly. It takes many pushes of the button to inject a fairly large dose. The process is clumsy and somewhat painful
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	55-64	6/22/2012 2:02:57 PM	Have been on the levemir flexpen for around 6 mos. now.  I take 65 units daily before dinner meal.  I also take a fast acting novalog flexpen before each meal.  With the levemir I started on 15 units and build up to the 65 now taking.  My results have been relatively slow in coming, but now I generally stay under 150 average.  I have not experienced any side effects so far.  I do test 4 times a day and log my readings as well as everything I eat with times and quanities.  I've had diabetes for over 10 years, but only the last 6 months have I had to take insulin.  When on metformin and actos for so many years, I lived as someone who didn't have diabetes but alas it's caught up with me.  I was so upset by the thought of giving myself injection, but it hurts less than the testing needle.  With increased testing and 4 injections daily, I evolved quickly into watching my diet and learning as much as I can about this disease. I've lost 30 pounds in past 6 months, but contribute that to diet.  I feel better and that I do contribute that not only to diet, but I think my body tolerates the insulin better than the metformin and actos, so far anyway.  I don't feel I know enough about the long term effects of insulin treatment, but at this point I feel it's best for me.
Diabetes	Earl, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male		6/19/2012 12:30:08 AM	I have been taking 20 mg of Glipizide XL for over 15 years but started getting too many low bs at night and some high peaks, then tried Voctoza and it about killed me with side effedts. then,Janeuvia which didn't do much good at all then tried metformin, had stomach problems and very uncomfortable. then doctor suggested Levemir 10 units once a day and I've only been on it for little over a week but seems to be doing better than any that I've tred. No side effects that I know of and feel good. Blood suger in mornings after fasting over night usually runs from 80 to 119. Evenings before meal usally 125. I go back to the doctor tomorrow 6/23/12 and see if he wants me to adjust dossage. It's good to find some thing that doesn't make your life miserabe all the time. Age here is 76 been diabetic #2 about 19 years. Earl Best of luck with what ever works for you. Earl

Started at 10 units, now up to 48. Numbers are awful &gt;240-300. Very discouraging with numbers much higher than oral pills of Metformin, Glipizide, Januvia. Eyesight has deteriated greatly. Hopefully at 55+ units it will show signs of working.

Both mornings readings of 215(was that way on all the oral meds!), and in afternoon after exercise -- I walk for a living (dog walker) blood sugar at 300!  Is it normal for this to be so slow?  I am watching what I eat!

I start having adverse reaction blood sugar up even with taking metformin hcl 500mg - twice a day and glimepiride 4 mg.I have a rash very bad under my stomach that itch very badly red inflame. I have spot rash arm, buttock,back and seem like something has started on my face by my ear. Most recent my right eye has a swelling in the crevice. I stop taking the levemir and have notice good readings since being off of the med. The rash is still there but looks like it has slowed up I need to see a doctor but I wanted to make sure it was the Levemir.

So started at 6 and 247 fbg to now it is 24 and 170 fbg.  I just want to hurry up and get to 90-110!!! The flexpen is so incredibly easy to use though, and painless.  If not for the clicking I wouldn't even know anything was in my body, including a needle!

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Grandma, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/18/2011 8:12:38 PM	I have been on Levemir (16 units before bed)for 3 1/2 weeks along with Januvia.  I had tried several different medications and had extreme intolerace or an allergy to them.  Levemir is awesome.  My fasting blood sugar before Levemir was 208 - it is now 123 fasting and about 140 after meals.  It is so very easy to use and the needle is tiny and does not hurt at all.  It sure beats getting sick from oral medications.  I would highly recommend Levemir to anyone having trouble regulating their blood sugars or intolerance to oral medications.  I also feel better than I have in over a year!

Diabetes	Feline Patient, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/25/2010 2:56:17 PM	I use Levemir for my diabetic cat. Wonderful insulin for felines! The flexipen does not allow for accurate dosing when measuring the tiny dose required for cats, so i have to use a 3/10 cc syringe to draw out his dose (using the pen as a small vial), but that works just fine. My cat's BG ranges between 60-120 every single day, 24 hours a day.Please do not put your cat to sleep if it gets diagnosed with diabetes, it is far far easier to treat a diabetic cat than it is a human. Plus using Levemir or Lantus (NOT Vetsulin or Prozinc from the vet, those insulins are horrible for cats) and right diet (low carb wet food only) the odds are very very high that a diabetic cat will go into remission. I don't think the manufacturer's of Levemir have any idea how many feline patients they have and how awesome this insulin is for them. There is a whole market out there that they have not targeted since vets never recommend this insulin to their clients, we have found out about it by researching the web.The 'flat curve' that Levemir gives is the healthiest way to treat diabetes for everyone, feline or human.

Diabetes	darharff, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	9/8/2010 1:26:55 PM	I agree with many others my numbers came down and then a few days later would go up so I would have to increase the dosage.If this keeps up it will cost a lot to use this drug. I eat a very healthy diet and have been cooking for a diabetic for 4 years but no matter how careful I am after a couple of days of being down my numbers go up.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	cj, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	3/21/2010 11:58:46 PM	I have been on this medication for 3 weeks and I am very please so far. Only side affect is the swelling of my left wrist, which is tolerable.  My readings have improved immensely.  I feared taking any kind of insulin and did not want to do it, also was my fear that I would gain weight, but actually I have lost 5 pounds in the three weeks that I have been on it. I also exercise regularly.  The needle is very easy to use and the clicking sound helps me to know when all of the dosage in finish coming out. I was defnitely not a fan of needles but I am please with this one.  I also take oral two times a day.  I wish the pen came in smaller sizes.  My dosage is on 20 units a day, so even though I have enough in the pen for two months, after 30 days I have to throw it away and get a new refill pen...what a waste.  The thighs are the best place to inject.  I have been a type II for 15 years.  I always thought that once you started insulin, you were no longer a type II.  My blood test still shows that I am a Type II but I need the small dosage of insulin to have lower readings in the mornings.  This medication seems to do the trick.  Hope this encourages someone!

After using glucovance 5/550 3x a day and having bg increase, I thought the insulin would provide better control. Bg is higher than ever and does not come down, despite my improved carb counting and exercise. Very disappointed. Seeing an endocrinologist before I do internal damage.

I have been taking this for a few years now since it came out. I started using it once a day but have switched to AM abd PM shots. This controls my blood sugar througout the day with Novolog shots when I eat. Just one thing to say to Type 2 people. If you CAN cure your diabetes with diet or weight loss the DO IT. I have been diabetic for over 30 years and it is hard work keeping healthy. Stay well.

Four weeks ago I was told that I had to have insulin.  I was introduced to the FlexPen by my diabetic  counselor.   She assured me that I could do it...... I promised that I would try. However it took me 5 days to get up the nerve to do the first one.  I have now been able to use the FlexPen for 8 days.  It is painless.  I can hardly believe that I am able  to take control of my diabetes.Thanks a lot!

Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	4/7/2008 12:55:52 PM	After years of trying to control my diebetes with medicine only.  I found i lost weight and still was unable to control blood sugar at desired levels.  Before trying Levemir, i tried a pen type medicine called &quot;Byetta&quot;.  In the beginning it worked to maintain my blood sugars.  But, two months my blood sugars started to raise.  After talking with my doctor and year of trying to avoid insulin.  Levemir became my new friend.  My treatment now consist of &quot;Actos 45mg 1/t - Starlix 120 3/t &amp; Levemir 35 at night&quot;.  My blood sugars now are 100 in the morning &amp; about 160 after meals.  Two hours after meals my blood sugars are back to 110/120 range.  I'v been on Levemir for about 5 months as of now. I now believe that &quot;Diabetes&quot; was not a death sentence.  I'm now eating more food to my liking.  But, we must always watch what we eat.  I must say living with diebetes now is the closes to normal my body has seen in years.  Levemir for now has answered my questions.  Diebetes runs in my family.  Out of six member in the family, five have diebetes.  We are all taking different forms of insulin.  After speaking with family members about their treatment for diebetes.  Our concludion is that Levemir seems to outperform,an has ease of use, moreso than the other treatments. But, the cost was higher.  So if cost in not a problem for you, than Levemir could be right for you.

The pen is easy, but the dial lever slides on me and I am afraid I may inject too much. I've used the pen for two days and my sugar is in the 300's. I too was really scared to use the injection, but the needle is less painful than my testing needle. I don't feel it at all. Maybe my doctor will up my doseage. I'm hoping that I get better results.

But after a couple of days my numbers are back up in the 400s. I also don't like that the part of the pen that is depressed after choosing your dosage. It is a rotory design instead of a design simular to a click ink pen making it difficult to depress and use.

The only thing is I was never told about taking it in the evening and I thought that I could take in the morning, first thing and now I will have to change and hopefully it will help me with my blood count.
