Convulsive Seizures	J, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	9/4/2012 2:23:42 PM	I was put on zonisamide a week ago because I have not been successful with other AED's. I have catamenial siezures and I am also going through perimenepause which has caused my siezures to increase in severity. I took my first 100mg of zonisamide last Tuesday evening and I am still experienceing muscle tremmers, sensation of burining lips and discordination. I have not taken any more of this drug; is this a normal side effect?

My doctor wants me off of this med because I have been on it for 12 years and makes my life comfortable. I love zonegran better because generics are not the same.

I have swollen lower extremities like ankles,thighs,calves. It is hard enough to walk with the back pain. Have surgery coming up and I think I will stop using it cause I'm down to 2 pairs of pants that fit. The swelling is horrible.

The first seizure was scary I awoke with paramedics standing over me I didn't know what in the hell was going on and what had happen, I had diffulculty closing my mouth and talking he thought I had a stroke, after arriving at the emergency room I was confused it seem as if every muscle in my body was in pain, upon the physicians examination he explained to me I had had a grand mal seizure and I possibily had epilespy and that my veryu first seizure was so severe that my lower jaw jumped out of socket. Since I've been on dialantin and several other anticonvulsuives, this medication appears to work and I'm less anxious about my seizure disorder.

However, I had to stop taking it after a year because I had two kidney stones shortly after I started this medication. It is supposed to be rare, but my doctor believes that the Zonisamide caused them. I AM SO SAD because I hardly had any migraines while on this and if I did, they did not last long at all. My urologist doesn't think they caused them, so I am going to find a second opinion from another Neurologist so maybe I can get back on it ASAP! I am getting migraines again without it :(

My pain Dr. has been trying to find an add on that will help with my leg pain.  We tried a regimen of Savella.  It helped my R.L.S. a little, but seemed ineffective against my pain.  He now has me on Zonisamide 100mg 1/daily.  I have been taking it for a little over a week.  I know it is too early to know if it will help, but already, my R.L.S. and leg pain at night seem to be worse.  I have been experiencing hair loss for about as long as I have been on Lyrica.  I don't know if it is the Lyrica or the stress from the pain.

Zonegran helps control his seizure better but he started hitting his head, I gave him Biotin 2500 mcg twice a day and he stops hitting his head, so my guess is all the seizure medications he took so far depleted his Biotin somehow. (By the way, Biotin helps with reducing hair loss so if any of you having hair loss while using Zonegran may try to see if adding Biotin supplement helps?)

This prevented the seizure and cut my Migraines to 1/3 of premed level.  Started on 100Mg and worked up to 400Mg (all(4)taken in the morning to prevent any sleep loss as this dose can keep me awake if taken at night) All is now good for me and it will soon be 2011.  I hope this will work for others.

I love it. I take 200mg at night with my other meds. I have lost 35lbs. I still have to take my PRN main meds but not as much. I do seem to have alot of hair coming out but that does not bother me. I would rather be bald than be in pain. And when I take it with my Ambien, I sleep like a baby. I finally have a cocktail of meds that work for me!!

So far it has proven to be ineffective for my migraines.  I have only been taking it for three weeks though, so maybe I haven't given it enough time to be effective.  So far I have not noticed any side effects.  To be fair, I will write more later to see if my opinion has changed.  I have learned though some of my triggeres for migraines are:  bananas, peanut butter, hot dogs, sausage, certain preservatives in frozen foods such as tomato sauces &amp; brown cinnamon sugar pop tarts.  I hops that this helps someone out there.
Convulsive Seizures	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	4	Female	25-34	9/18/2010 3:30:58 PM	This drug was somewhat difficult to start. Some early symptoms included fuzzy thinking and mood swings. After a few weeks, these subsided. The drug worked great with minimal side effects and few issues through the birth of our first child. Problems began about 1 year ago when I experienced a few petit maul seizures. The medication levels were adjusted upwards with good results. While pregnant with the 2nd child, symptoms returned, but were controlled with increasing dosages to maintain the same blood levels. Following the birth of the second child (doing well), I went into status and am looking for a new medication. Our main complaint is that zonisamide does not seem to be a good long term solution since I built up a tolerance to the drug. FYI treatment for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

For 5 years I had to ask for rides to work, the store, or even just across town. In the course of those 5 years I would have sometimes 10 seizures a day, 3-4 times a week it is amazing i'm even still alive. In the spring of 08 I went to see a new specialtist she prescribed me 400 mg of zonisamide. she told me it would take at least 4-6 weeks to fully be in my system. during the first month of treatment I seized once 2 months later a very mild one so my wife says it is now the summer of 2010 and I have my drivers licence again. After the neorologist did his testing he said something I will never forget.There seems to be no sign of seizure activity. Thank you zonisamide

It works great on contoling my seziures, but I have to sleep about 10 hrs a day just to be able to function properly.  I have lost about 30 lbs and have NO appitite whatsoever and have had to resort to drinking nutritional suppliments (ick).  My memory is as good as gone, I think it took a vacation with my hair, which is disappearing at an alarming rate.  On a good note, these side effects are a lot better than some of the other epilepsy meds out there.  After being on 300mg a day for 6 months, I show a 70-80% improvement in my seziure activity!  This works great if you can keep the side effects under control.  Especially the nutritional aspect of it, if it affects your appatite.  Good luck everyone!

I take 100 mg. b4 bed - I have not experienced a problem with it so far.  Re: hair falling out... My hair has been falling out for a long long time now.  I also take Depakoke ER and I have been on many other anti-convulsants that I believe to have contributed to that issue.  I'm not surprised the medication might have that side-effect.  A good person to ask is your pharmacist.  I've been lucky - my pharmacists have always been eager to share information.  Oh, and I've been taking anti-seizure meds for 37 years...I still have a head of hair.. :)Just keep the doctor informed if the hair loss gets too too extreme.  :)  All the best!!!  Bellesbark

The cancer is gone but &quot;transformative&quot; migraines appeared. He was on topomax and gabapentin. Now he is taking Zonisamide in addition. He will stop Topomax when he gets up to 150 mg of Zonisamide. This is a lot of antiseizure meds. Docs want him to stop topomax because of diarrhea and weight loss. As he increases the amount of Zonisamide, he is becoming increasingly agitated at night and is very hungry at night. He can't sleep even with Ambien and he eats several times a night. Headaches are 2 on a scale of 10 but he is very groggy and cannot work. If anyone can share tips, please email ellen.madaline@gmail.com

Now she is on this one alone along with the vegus nerve stimulator. I find that my daughters mood is the only problem with this medication.

Convulsive Seizures	Steph, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	10/6/2008 12:38:42 PM	In the beginning, it worked great! But here recently, others have been telling me how I will stop in the middle of convo's and just start babbling! My mind will start trying to &quot;remind me&quot; of things of the past, and I can't control it! It will last for up to 30 or more minutes! I get dizzy and have to just sit down til it goes away. It's very bothersome and a nuisance in my life. I am extremely tired all the time. And I have also started to regurgitate all my food. I cannot hold anything down. I'm thinking my body is rejecting it or maybe is now immune to it. Who knows? I've previously been on three others and none seem to work. I have only been having seizures since 2006. Help!
Other	Constant Headache, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	35-44	10/6/2008 8:31:31 AM	I use it to treat migranes.  I have been taking it for 1 month.  It hasn't seemed to help me very much.
Other	sunshine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/1/2008 4:24:02 PM	Having had migraines for 12+ years and been on every medication out there, I'm very grateful for this medication.  I was on Topamax but the side effects of that medication has actually caused probably permanent/ irreversable memory damage. I still get a headache once in a while, but not everyday like I would if I was off medications all together.  If you are desperate for a migraine medication and have tried them all, I suggest you at least give this a try.

Simple Partial Seizures	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/25/2008 8:03:33 PM	11 years ago I began being feeling dizzy all the time, every day.  Went to many Dr.'s,  many test's.  Couldn't find anything.  About 3yrs after this started, I found a Dr that tried Zonegran, thought it may be siezures.  It took the dizzyness away within one day.  I've been taking it for 8yrs with no problems other than I tired earlier than one would expect.  
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	9/25/2008 6:27:15 PM	I have taken this drug for 2.5yrs and until today, I didn't realize that it was the cause of all of my daily complaints.  Sure, it helped my headaches and migraines wonderfully, but after looking over the side effects, I have every single one of them.  My thought process and speech has been progressively worse and I can't remember the last time I was not tired.  The problem was, I have been on different meds and never really checked them out myself.  I will be requesting a change after reading this!

I am having alot of side effects though. And I am on some of the drugs that they warn you about.I am going to stop taking it and talk to my Dr. about it.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	6/17/2008 11:26:43 AM	I have had a migraine for 2 straight years. My latest headache specialist put me on zonisamide at bedtime (with a combo of a couple of other meds) and I have been headache free for a while now (knock on wood!). I'm glad I found this dr and he actually knew what would help.
Other	pedblgy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/2/2008 8:25:04 PM	I took Depakote for years with no relief of my true symtoms. When Zonisamide became available, my Doctor put me first in line. After a few weeks, and now 2 years, I feel brand new. It and complete overhaul in meds, and I'm a new person, thank goodness, they put this on the market for MY symptoms!
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	12/10/2007 1:59:51 PM	I have had migranes for 35+ years and thought that nothing could help - Zonisamide helps wonderfully. It makes me a little sleepy but it's worth the trade off!

I HAVE HAD ONLY ONE GRAND MAL SEIZURE AND THAT WAS WHEN THERAPY WAS INITIALLY STARTED.  THANK YOU, ZONISAMIDE/ZONEGRAN!!!
