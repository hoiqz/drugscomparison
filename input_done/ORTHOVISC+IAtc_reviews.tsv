Other	grandma of one, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	55-64	7/31/2012 5:32:43 PM	Osteoarthritis in both knees.  2-1/2 yrs ago had the series of three shots in my right knee.  Recently had another series of shots.  Had to use a different doctor this time as the doctor that did them last time is no longer with them.  This time I got the shots in both knees.  The first injection in my left knee, the dr hit a nerve!  In extreme pain for two days.  But I gained considerable mobility in the left knee that I had not had.  The second shot went smooth in my left knee but more pain in my right knee.  Seemed to have had more knee pain in both knees after the second shot.  Had the third shot in both knees and while painful the pain cleared quickly.  It is now two weeks since the third injection.  I still have some pain in both knees but considerably less.  I am able to get to my feet easier and climb stairs.  Unfortunately, due to the hitting the nerve in the left knee, it seems to have caused a restless leg problem.  I go to bed and if I don't get to sleep within 5 mins, I can forget about sleep for several hours as the left leg will start spastic moment.   If I can get to sleep before it begins, I am ok.  Not sure I will let this dr give me another series of shots or if I will seek another doctor.

First time I was pain free for almost a year. I have had a cortizone shot and received a severe allergic reaction. Now on second shot with much improvement. I found the shot very painful for a short time. Most worth the short time of pain than a partial knee replacement. Would recommend to others.

Orthovisc has been amazing and helps after the first injection.  It does not quite last 6 months for me though.  The last month before I can get more injections is annoying.  I have been taking Orthoviisc now for 3 years.

Second hurt for the entire week. After the third which was done on the opposite side because of 2nd shot pain, I feel the knee is stuffed and hard to bend. When standing for more than 15 minutes,the pain runs up and down the leg into toes.Not sure what is better ? I do Yoga and can't bend knee for most positions. Seeing the doctor for explanation.

OA and sports injury to right knee since age 35.  Had 2 previous series of injections and just beginning 3rd.  Had first injection at 9:00am and played 9 holes of golf at 4:00pm.  Minimal pain during injection and minor soreness for 24 hours after.  Never completely free of pain when standing because of the bone-on-bone condition but there is NO discomfort caused by movement.  Relief last about 5 months for me.  I wish it would work better to alleviate the pain caused by standing but since there is NO cartilage in the knee that's a bit much to expect.No side effects from the injection other than the 24 hours of mild soreness immediately afterwards.  Nothing bad enough to even consider pain meds or icing the knee.

So, for that  reason I am on my 3rd set of injections, problems with both knees. Very painful when getting the injections and a discomfort for a couple of hours after. But, it is working, pain is a lot less. Very happy with the progress. Don't let the pain of the injection hold you back on finishing the whole treatment.

Doctor recommended these injections.  All three were relatively painless.  Definite improvement, but not pain free. Bike riding is great, but most impact activities are no good like jogging, climbing, etc. Too young for knee replacement so injections every 6 months fro 10 year and we'll see.

Now 1 year post injury got 3 orthovisc injections which were painful for the first few days. No improvement. Partial knee replacement seems to be last option.

I am thrilled that for nearly the entire six months between treatments I am pretty much pain free.  Both knees are bone on bone and the osteoarthritis is nearly unbearable without them. I follow the instructions to not do any heavy activity for the first 48 hrs following each injection and have not had a problem.

I have a very bad problem with my kneecap. It has junk under it and it is worn down on the sides from playing volleyball for many years. So, I have athritis in my knee, also. I have had my knee scoped and that lasted about 1 year. So, my doctor suggested the injections because he did not want to do surgery again that soon. My first set of 3 injections was almost a year ago. The shots did ok but I should have been wearing a knee brace for the other problems. Now, a year later, I am getting a set of 5 injections every 2 weeks. After the first injection and getting the correct knee brace, I am walking 5+ miles every day with NO pain, something that I could not do without major swelling and tremendous amouts of pain. I am getting my second injection on 4/18/12. If this keeps me from having surgery again anytime soon, I'll keep getting the shots. Yes, the shots are some what painful but I have never had a shot that wasn't. It is really the initial stick of the needle, the rest feels like a lot of pressure under my kneecap. I have not had any headaches afterwards. My knee was sore for the rest of the day after the injection but the next day it felt fine. This beats taking truck loads of ADVIL, ALIEVE, TYLENOL, ect. As long as my doctor suggests the injections instead of surgery, I'll keep getting them.

I have had osteoarthritis since 1994 and the overall left knee pain and the spurs &quot;catching&quot; was common especially in cold weather.  It has been one month since the last injection and the odd headaches are all but gone.  All knee pain symptoms gone and the knee feels turgid enough for exercise to rebuild strength

I just had my first injection yesterday and can truly say I have felt relief.  Kind of nerveous after reading others reviews about the pain from the second and third injections but if it helps me walk pain free it is well worth it.  So far so good

Drugs did not help knee pain.  Trying shots now.  After first shot, 2 days later I started having like muscle spasms from my knee down the shin bone to the foot.  Had to remove shoe to get relief.  Felt like my foot was swelling (it wasn't).  After 2nd shot, again the same spasms down leg again, but I do notice some relief from the pain.  Anyone else have the leg spasms?  I also am having bad headaches.

Pain at the site much worse, feeling lousy with recurring sharp pain at my temporal area. Stomach issues, tingling. Not positive that it's related - how can you prove it other than the posts here with the same kind of side effects.

The doctor tried cortisone which was helpful for a couple of weeks, but now I am on my second injection of orthovisc and can't tell much yet.  I want to point out that my doctor says if you hit a nerve with the needle it can be painful.  So far, no big deal. Still stiff, but praying this will work after the remainder of the shots. I seem to have more flexibility and hoping for improvement with remaining shots.

I'd like to hold that off as long as possible.  i week since last orthovisc, Dr. says I can begin swimming again on Monday.  Hoping to build femoral muscles to help relieve pain.  Taking Vicodin on weekends.

I had surgery to repair the tear but got little relief. I am now on my 3rd out of 4 shots of Orthovisc and could not be happier with the results. I am virtually pain free and actually look forward to getting my shots every week. The lidocaine shot stings a bit but the shot itself is painless. I highly recommend this treatment as a precursor to surgery if at all possible. This stuff works.......

I want to mention that my dr. uses an exray machine to locate the knee joint so the medicine goes in correctly.  Anyone else get that kind of treatment.  My knee is starting to feel a little better.  I lay on a table thats has a exray machine in it.  Then he has another machine he puts on top of my knee to see where to put the needle.  That is the most painful part, after that the med. goes in.  I put on some ice and raise my leg for about 1 hr on and off 20 minutes at a time.  I have OA but don't need an operation.  I hope this helps someone.

It had gotten so stiff and painful I could not bear to bend it to walk and had to cut out walking for exercise and spend a lot of time icing and heating my knee---prescription meds were not working. I had the third shot today. People are saying how painful they are; I was told that they do get a little more painful with each one and that was not true for me.  I glad I did it.  I still have pain, but I also have good days and bad days too.  I am blessed I can still walk.

After months of shoveling snow my knee started to ache and I was having pain that led me to my Dr.  I had a cortisone shot which did nothing for me.  My Dr. spoke to me about Othovisc and the series of shots and I started last week.  The first shot wasn't too bad though I was sore for a couple of days with hardly any improvement. Two days ago I had my second shot which wasn't bad, I was sore for a day and now on the second day I am pain free.  Pain free!  I have no pain at all.  This shot is definitely working!  I am thrilled!  I would DEFINITELY recommend this product..  It worked for me :)

I am almost 3 weeks post the 3rd injection with no pain relief; in fact the pain and loss of range of motion is worse now than before.  I was also told it takes 4-6 weeks after the third injection to get the full effect but at this point doubt this treatment is going to do anything for me.  I was very active and now have trouble even walking a few blocks.  I am very disappointed as it appears to help most people.

I just finished the full series of injections...I honestly believe that my knees are in worse pain than they were when we started the injections. To me, it was like trying to put grease into a ball-joint that is totally shot, it just causes more harm than it does good.I would much rather be writing a raving review of this medicine, but my knee function has not improved even a little bit, my knees pop a lot more, and there seems to be less stability and more pain.I would like to STRONGLY like to discourage anyone with severe degeneration from using this product!

Today, I've had no noticeable discomfort. My Dr.advised me to take it easy the first 24 hrs following the injection! So, I hope by the time I have my 3rd &amp; last inj. I won't have anymore issues &amp; not another surgery!!
Other	knee jerk, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	2/17/2011 6:23:05 AM	I had arthroscopy and after the surgery my knee was feeling pretty good, no pain, no swelling. I could even start to bend my knee all the way. I am a bicyclist and I was asking for PT but my doctor was aggressive in recommending the 3 injections. In trusting him, I submitted, although the back of my knee started to hurt and swell after the second injection. He gave me the third anyway, and I've had nothing but stiffness in the joint, swelling in the calf, and sharp pain in the back of the knee ever since then. I am now much worse than I was even before the surgery, or after the surgery. I would not recommend this to anyone. Now I also have a lot of fear about who will treat or how to treat the secondary symptoms.

It had gotten so stiff and painful I could not bear to bend it to walk and had to cut out walking for exercise and spend a lot of time icing and heating my knee---prescription meds were not working.  I had the third shot today.  People are saying how painful they are; I was told that they do get a little more painful with each one and that has proven true for me. But they are still quite tolerable.  The shot I had today was the worst, but at most, the injection lasts 15 seconds, so I think about anything would be bearable for that long.  I did experience swelling and an all-over body ache, flu-like feeling from the second shot, but this is a small price to pay for mobility.  I noticed an improvement in my knee pain after the first shot;  There is tenderness for 24 hours or so after each injection, and a feeling of fullness under the kneecap b/c all of the stuff has to spread out and get into all the nooks and crannies, but after that, the pain is much better.  I feel like this has been a very positive experience for me, and I expect to be able to resume exercise walking in just a few days and get stronger from there!  I would definitely recommend it and would also recommend having a positive attitude.  I have learned that expectations usually have a lot to do with outcome!!!!

I am in pain from the waist down including my calves and thighs.  It is difficult for me to walk because of the pain in my knees.  I will start therapy tomorrow and hope this helps.  I also tried the Synvisc injections which didn't help.  My physician said that until my knees are bone on bone, he will not do a knee replacement which is fine with me but I would like some pain relief.  I have taken Oxycontin for the pain but it doesn't seem to help.  The heating pad does give some relief.
Knee Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	11/5/2010 9:47:40 AM	I shouldn't rate any stars as I just had my first injection yesterday - and looked on this site to see if anyone had an adverse reaction like I did.  I had surgery a year ago on my left knee and am still having pain.  During the injection, I had immense pain in the back on my knee (not injection site) and the nerve pain ran up my leg into my back and down my leg into my foot.  I immediately got dizzy and nausea and couldn't stand or walk for a while after -- had to stay in the room for a bit.  Threw up in my car on the way home.  I now cannot straighten my leg at all, as the pain behind my leg is as though the IT Band has snapped.  Waiting for my doc to tell me if this is &quot;normal&quot;.  Seriously afraid to try it again next week - thinking not for me.

I have had 3 treatments so far and plan to continue until I an ready to have my knees replaced.  I am in the process of losing mylast 50# and this makes my exercise tolerable.  I also work and now I can stand being on my feet for longer periods of time.  It doesn't take away all my pain and stiffness but It does take it to the level that allows me to mostly ignore it. I must continue to take my anti-inflammatory meds.Pros:1. Considerable deduction of pain.     2. Does not interact with other meds.           Cons:1. Only lasts 5 months for me. I have to really cut back last month or I will hurt longer even after new Tx.     2. If my knees are very tender when I get injections, they can be painful hurt for next hour or so.     3.  Set of injection (3)is expensive if you don't have insurance.

So far nothing has happened. If anything, my knees are slightly worse. They told me it may take all three injections and then it still might be a few weeks after the third injection for full relief. So far the only thing that has happened is that they get really stiff and painful for a day or two after the injections. When the stiffness wears off I am back to the same pain I had before. Unless there is a miracle and this stuff starts working in a few day I would not recommend it to anyone. My doctor says my kneecaps are unusually bad. That is why it might now be working. I might work for someone with moderate pain but for me it did nothing. I have replacement surgery planned for January. 
Knee Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	painfree, 13-18 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	13-18	9/3/2010 7:14:56 PM	I have had surgery and gone to therapy to try to solve my knee pain. Nothing seemed to work until this. The first 2 shots were painful and hurt for a day or two. The third, barely felt anything. Although standing for more than 2 hours may cause a little discomfort for the first 2 or 3 days. It is amazing.

With my first injection, my knee became tolerable and able to walk better. Now that I have had my 3 injection my knee feels good, I am able to sleep much better.  I have to have rt knee surgery but I am going to try the orthovisc with a brace because I am bone on bone. I will let you know the results

These shots have given me my life back.  I cannot tell you how much they have helped me walk again without pain. Each series of shots have given me better results that last longer.  I am so glad to be able to put off knee replacements for a longer period of time.  I hope these shots keep working because they have helped me to enjoy life again.

Then, all of a sudden, it &quot;kicked in&quot; and I have been pain free for a year and a half. Great stuff. Ready to use it in my other knee!

All I really wanted was to be able to do a few months before. I wanted to walk on my favourite path.  It has not help but I was told by the doctor that not everyone was helped so I was simply disappointed.  Thanks anyway, although it was not a pleasant experience (getting the shots), I wish it had worked!Micheline Chaudry

Other	OKLady, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/11/2010 12:46:14 PM	Wonderful product.  My knees are bone on bone. To young for a replacement.  For me each injection was more painful especially the third but, in the long run that pain is worth it.  I was not able to walk in a wheel chair. Now, I am walking. Most days are pain free.

The injections were not painful, but they did not work for me.  Think long and hard before spending the time and money on this drug.  Another surgery is in my future.

Noticeable difference after 1st shot. Had 3rd. Dr. &quot;freezes&quot; the spot until it burns and I feel very little of the injection. It is more in my head. Tried meditation the last time and deep breathing. Really helped the process. I can get up and down now after sitting with no problem :) and little pain at night. Pillow between the legs still helps.

I have had the first two sets of shots and will be going for the 3rd set in two days.

My knee feel somewhat better in bending but now right side of knee hurts quite a bit-I still have pain that shoots up and down my leg.  However, I can now sleep without a pillow between my knees at night but my knee still hurts when I set in a chair for very long or walk any length of time.Maybe if I give it a little longer!(Its been a little over one month)

It didn't hurt that much but the whole thought of it has made me sick all day. There is pain in my knee but I am willing to wait it out. Two more injections and I'm trying to figure out how NOT to faint when I get the other two....hope it works!

I cannot say that my lst injection was very painful.  I did develop a lot of pain and discomfort that evening and lasted for 3 days.  Today's injection was extremely painful!  I didn't know if I wanted to throw up or pass out following the injection. My doctor said that if I do not get relief from this injection than there will be no point in doing the 3rd one next week.  A lot will be determined on how I do this week as to whether I have the injection or schedule the tkr surgery.

After 2 laproscopic surgeries to repair the meniscus, I'm still having pain and swelling. My doctor suggested the orthovisc injections. Well my first injection was very painful so before I had my 2nd injection, I took a pain pill he had prescribed to me months before. It worked tremendously.. no pain at all with the injection. So I took another one before my 3rd injection but it didn't help that time. It was HORRIBLE..very painful and I felt like I was going to pass out. It kept bleeding, I was asked to hold pressure on the site, I couldn't even hold my head up. My dr said 'I must of hit a vein'.. it felt like he hit everything he wasn't suppose too.. after going through all that, I really hope to see some improvement in my knee very soon. I'm not sure if I'll have these injections again, but if I do, I'll probably find another doctor to give them because that one 'needs to step away from the needles'. I'd hate to give these injections a bad name if it's the doctors fault.. During the injections, I could feel him rolling the needle round and round ( I guess to spread the gel?) has anyone experienced that with your injections?? Thanks for listening and if anyone has any suggestions, I'd like to hear them.. Thanks

You do not realize how bad your knees hurt until they dont anymore...or how good they feel after the series of injections until it's time for the next set.  I would recommend this to anyone who has severe knee pain.  I can enjoy outdoor activities with my family again. :O)

First round lasted 6-7 months. The injections were not bad the first time - pain 10-15 seconds per. First injection during current round was the same. The injection this morning was dreadful - still in pain 8 hours later. It's still worth it if I can put off a total knee replacement for a few more years.

I had my first series of injections 2 years ago. I am now experiencing extreme pain for the first time since those injections and am going in for my second series today.  It is worth the seconds of pain (needle) for 2 years of sleeping and moving well. BCBS covered it 100%!

I do have an aching pain in the knee afterwards.  I hate needles so this was a huge experience for me.  Luckily my Dr. is excellent and understanding.  The injections are not near as bad as I thought they would be.  Just a little discomfort for 10-15 seconds.  For me the anticipation is worse.  I have not yet seen alot of improvement in the knee but am very hopeful that this will delay a replacement.  I feel it was worth a try.

Im on day 1 after that 3rd injection. Hard to know now.  First 48 hours-WOW they mean it.Limit your use, or you WILL feel it! My doctor mentioned using a cane for support.  I however have been using a walker, and found it safer and more steady. By 36 hours I dont need anything.I have experianced swelling at injection site and in the area, that ice helps with. On day 4or5 after injection,I am able to use the knee normaly on the stairs, ginger-ly. Day 6 has been much better, but late afternoons, I have felt more pain.I also dont feel comfortable pressing the brake peddle in the car either, until day 5.  I am very much looking forward now to no more injections and contiuned strength returning. I also look forward to water therapy and classes, and returing to my active lifestyle.  I really HATE to sit still, as does my black lab, Kona.  So again we are looking forward to the days and months ahead.  My doctor has had many patients that have had pain relief and returned mobility for 6 to 18months!  Thats a gamble Im willing to take!  Good luck to all others out there with their healing.BTW, heat feels good too, and helps before I go to bed for the night!

VERY PAINFUL Didn't want other 2 shots. Dr. said I would owe him $500 because Medicare only paid for full 3 shots. I relented, and after 2nd shot was on crutches. Pressure on knee was excrutiating. Third shot din't help and now use cane and legs swollen, had blood clot and leg muscles tight as a drum.

I must emphasize that it really doesn't take effect until about 3 weeks AFTER my last injection. It DOES work - you must give it TIME, and consider 2 series (twice a year)

Now, I can not stand nor walk, the pain is a 13 on a 1-10 scale.  I'm now paralized from waist down. My doctors can't do knee replacement because I have sleep apnea, this was supposed to help, 24 hrs after shot, I had pain up to my hip, I could not stand at all.  what has happened?  The doctor that gave me the shot will not return my calls or help me, let's see if he returns my atty's calls.  If anyone has a disability, or is over weight, remember me and ask if it can happen to you.

I hope that over the next 2 months it will be more effective! (Blue Cross refused to pay for this medication.)
