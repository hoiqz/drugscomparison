This is the first time however that I have been prescribed Librium for high anxiety and depression after enitial treatment for alcohol cessation. It has always been Xanax or Valium. I personally compare 25 MG Librium to 1 MG Xanax or about like 10 MG Valium as for anxiety relief to be pretty much the same. But I believe the Librium has been longer lasting per dose for me and has (for the time at least) totally removed alcohol from my thoughts. 
Symptoms from Alcohol Withdrawal	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	8/13/2011 7:52:50 PM	Ok. First I was a Meth addict for about 3-4 years and the day I turned 21 I started drinking to stop doing Meth. I been drinking heavily for about 11 years now im 32 and finally decided ive had enough. I went to the doctor about a week ago and they prescribed me Librium. I think it works better than valium or xanax because ive had both in the past. drug is used to stop DTS but not to stop cravings only you can stop that. I give this drug 5 out of 5 stars...seriously if you really want to stop drinking you can but librium is only there to stop anxiety and the shakes.. good luck everyone and believe me there isnt a day i wake up and dont wanna get a 12 pack for breakfast.....only been sober for a week.. its really hard

I had horrible head aches and this is the only thing that worked. My doctors also felt that the headaches may be mild seizures as I had Grand Mal seizures with the Encephalitis. I wish my current doctor would give it to me now, the headaches are horrible and almost daily.

Severe Anxiety	WillMilano, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	12/19/2010 9:38:39 PM	Hi, in 2005 I was picked up and held in Jail for 9 days,then let go. while I was put into the remand, I started reacting with fear due to a type of Agoraphobia I have, which is stemmed from a control factor.  I was stuck in a cell(was in a wheelchair for spinal injury at the time), and they forced me to take I believe 25mg 3 times daily, so I would be calm and stop praying.  i had no control over my body and remember very little.  When released I was sent to the local emergency for an overdose treatment for Librium.  Since I have suffered severe night terrors, nervousness, phobia is much stronger with new ones connected....sever hair loss while on it/coming off, can't gain weight, ulcers, migraines, insomnia, full body aches.  I've been checked over up and down, and after a cancerous treatment, my doc tells me he doesn't know why or what.  I get severe panic attacks and loose my balance....its crazy....my life is very hard after that...I wasn't a drug user but now smoke pot to cope with all of this, which they recently re-criminalized.  I didn't want these drugs in my system, and holding me for 9 days for a couple of fines, while locking me in a concrete room in a wheelchair and drugging me up so I can't be human messes up my trust in humanity maybe....I started and run a foundation to help any of you who need help off prescription or street drugs......This is what this does to that % of people on Librium that they don't talk about.  I feel like my life is over and going to be like this forever, I'm only 32.

It makes me dopey  by the 3rd dose in the early evening, but it keeps me so calm that even when I do think about drinking I feel calm enough to deal with the urges.  I am also taking Antabuse.  Something to consider if you need as much help as I do.

I've suffered from anxiety for decades and of all the treatments I've used to combat my anxiety including Valium, Xanax, Ativan and Librium, Librium is the only one that I found myself honestly questioning if the pharmacist gave me placebo's and kept the real stuff for themselves.

Doc would not refill script..said it wasnt supposed to be for long term use...Is that my fault?  Had the shakes so bad I couldnt write or tie my shoes....I turned to alcohol to relieve some of the symtoms..it worked but I had to get drunk to make it happen...then doc put my on 25mg librium, 4 times a day for 3day..and 3 for 3 days...and so on..until gone.  As soon as I took that first pill the shakes stopped.  I dont know whats going to happen when Im weened off for good...maybe the shaking will come back...maybe it wont..but so far...so good.
Other		4	5	4			12/26/2009 10:46:55 AM	librium really works and makes me feel like my old self. one issue is make sure you taper off of it. one doctor gave me 75mg of librium a day for two and a half weeks. not knowing anything about the medicine i ran out thinking it was no big deal. guess what happened next (i started drinking). after, i tapered of of librium one week and began taking antabuse. it was a good mix and a good solution. the librium significantly reduces my interest in drinking.

Symptoms from Alcohol Withdrawal	Dave C, 25-34 Male  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	4/19/2009 10:12:35 AM	This message is for all the Dr.s and nurses that work in detox facilities for alcoholics. Libriums does not work on patients craving for more alcohol, at least for me it did'nt. I recently went into a three day so-called &quot; intensive&quot; detox program from alcohol that cost about $6500. No matter what the cost, at least give the patient a medication strong enough to get their mind off of wanting another drink. It's bad enough we are unwilling addicts to a drug but least give us the right amount of help. They started off giving me 4 Libriums and vitamins. I've been an alcoholic for at least 20 years and stopping the shaking and making sure I get my vitamins A,B, and C isn't going to stop me from thinking about another beer or 3 or 12. In fact, the drugs were given to me in little paper cups that reminded me of shot glasses. I'm not telling you guys to give us meds for a buzz, but at least give us something to take our minds off of needing another drink.

Librium by far been the best for treating withdrawls and the anxiety that goes along with it.  I was told by a psychiatrist at a treatment center specializing in alcohol addiction that it is the best for the symptoms of withdrawl and the safest as far its addictive properties.  I have been sober for 2 years now and hopefully won't have to go through alcohol withdrawls ever again.

I SPENT 5 DAYS IN A FACILITY WHILE TAKING 300MG OF LIBRUIM. WHEN LEAVING THIS FACILITY, THE DR. JUST DROPPED ME OFF THE MEDICATION WITHOUT SENDING ME HOME WITH ANY. THE NEXT DAY WHEN I DIDN'T TAKE THE DOSE, I HAD A MILD SEIZURE. I COULD NOT GET INTO SEE MY DR. FOR ANOTHER DAY. FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS, I WENT THROUGH HELL. I HAD SEIZURES, I WAS FALLING DOWN, I COULDN'T TALK, DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS, HAD NO MOBILITY AT ALL. WHEN MY DR. PUT ME BACK ON IT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS TO WHEIN ME OFF AGAIN, HE DID IT AT A LOW DOSE. I WENT TO SEE HIM ON A FRIDAY, AND ON MONDAY I WENT TO SEE ANOTHER DR. BECAUSE I WAS ALSO GIVEN ANABUSE. THESE DRUGS ARE KNOWN TO BE DOWNERS, AND I TAKE MEDICATIONS FOR OTHER CONDITIONS THAT ARE UPPERS. OVER THE WEEKEND I HAD ABOUT 4-6 SEIZURES A DAY. I REALLY WANTED TO DIE. THEY WHEINED ME OFF SLOWLY IN 2 WEEKS BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO A REHAB AND I COULD NOT BE ON ANY BENZO'S. WHILE IN REHAB I WAS SWITCHED TO SEROQUEL, AND IT WAS MUCH BETTER. ONLY ONCE I WAS GIVEN THE LIBRUIM IN REHAB, BUT IT WAS ONLY 100MG. I WAS HAVING A TERRIBLE PANIC ATTACK. I WILL NOT TAKE THIS DRUG EVER AGAIN.

I didn't find this medicine as helpful as some of the other benzodiazepines. It works, but not in an outstanding way. My pharmacist at the time even asked me, &quot;Does this stuff really work?&quot; I requested to be changed to Ativan, which worked better for me. I was only taking 40 mg./day, so maybe that's why it didn't work as well for me as it has for some other people.

I like this drug very much because of the long half life and also because it is less potent than ativan, xanax, etc..  I never have had to increase the dosage.  It's cheap and works great.
