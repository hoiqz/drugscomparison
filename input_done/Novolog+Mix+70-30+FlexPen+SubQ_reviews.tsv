Diabetes	RCottrell (Patient) 	1	3	1			5/1/2012 7:20:34 AM	This medication makes my blood sugar worse instead of better.  I am taking 75 units of Lantus at night and the -100 /30 formula for Novolog.  For example, I checked my blood sugar @ 0612 when I woke up &amp; it was 200.  I haven't eaten since the evening before, but this has become the norm since I started taking Novolog. I took 3 units of Novolog.  Checked blood sugar again @ 0654 and it was 205.  Blood sugar went up 5 points without eating.  I am going to stop taking Novolog unless otherwise directed by my caregiver.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Janice, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	11/8/2011 6:58:58 PM	I just started taking the Novolog Mix and instead of my blood sugar going down, it went up! That was without eating a meal. My Dr. took me off all other diabetes meds. (Glipzide, Lantus), and just has me taking the Novolog. Sugar sky-rocketed to 354! Before he switched my meds, my highest reading was 205! Novolog is NOT working for me.
