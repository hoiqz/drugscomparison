I don't think I could survive without taking it now. It also seems to give me energy for my workouts at the gym. A good supplement all the way around. I recently recommended it to my sister to try.

I have used Optivite for 2 years and have my reasoning skills back!

This vitamin almost completely alleviated my PMS symptoms and gave me my life back. I have been taking it for years and I can not imagine life without it.
