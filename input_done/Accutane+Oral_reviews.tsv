Other	ladysmom, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	65-74	8/8/2012 3:44:57 PM	I was in my late 30's when my dermatologist prescribed Accutane.  I had sever cystic acne on my eye lids and around my nose.  It worked wonderfully.  This was in the early 1980's.  All these years later, I don't remember any side effects like dry lips and skin, but what I do remember and am still living with is dried out sinus cavaties.  I have been addicted to nasel sprays for 30 years.  Looking back on it, I wonder if the acne would have gone away without the Accutane.    I guess I'll never know.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	13-18 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	7/17/2012 1:26:22 AM	After suffering with acne for years, I had finally tried everything and my dermatologist was ready to put me on Accutane. Im 3 months into treatment, and my skin is finally clearing up. It's not perfect, but I still have some time left to get there. My acne had gotten worse for the first 2 months, but now Im finally seeing improvement. The side effects Im experiencing are mild, including dry skin, chapped lips (I recommend CeraVe lotion and Burts Bees chap stick), dry and cracking nose, along with nose bleeds, some joint pain, and loss of appetite. But on the bright side I only have to wash my hair about twice a week! Overall, the benefits outweigh the costs. After years of persistent problematic skin, Im finally going to have the clear skin Ive always dreamed of. My advice to anyone starting on Accutane or thinking about starting it, do it, its so worth it! But DO YOUR RESEARCH! Know what youre getting yourself into! Other than that, keep a positive outlook on the situation! Youre on your way to beautiful skin!
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	7/3/2012 2:01:00 AM	When considering taking Accutane, do some serious research on what you are getting yourself into. I completed my 5 month treatment a few weeks ago and my acne is completely gone. I struggled with acne for 10 years, trying everything on the market, and yielding zero improvement. The medicine started working right away, and I experienced a clear face for the first time in 10 years, in that I had no acne and I had a lack of oil on my face (I had very oily skin). These were great and all, but the side effects were quite more abundant. I had the obvious dry skin and dry cracked lips, my eyes were constantly bloodshot and glassy (people constantly mistook this for me being high), I developed a painful stye at one point, my upper lip and eye brows would constantly sweat reaI bad (very strange), I developed these circular sores on my arms that have left their mark still months later, my skin would split and cut very easily, the skin on my face was always red, my nails peeled and chipped away, and I developed allergies (never had them before, and its possible that they aren't from the medicine, but I find it strange that they randomly developed about a month after starting the medicines). Currently, (3 weeks post treatment) my skin is still clear and soft, which is absolutely wonderful, the oil in my skin has come back, but not to its full extent, and I can go in the sun again, which is a blessing. Yesterday though, I woke up and my eye was in pain an swollen almost shut. I went to the walk in clinic and he couldn't figure out what was wrong. I have heard of other people having eye problems post Accutane, so I think that is the culprit. This eye problem is a pain in the butt though and I don't know when it will get better/if it will be a reoccuring problem for the rest of my life. At this point, I don't regret using Accutane since it has boosted my confidence monumentally, but I feel as time goes on and I continue to experience permanent side effects, that I may regret it.

Completely wiped out my acne until a few months later all I got was a pimple here or there.  I did have some side effects though. I've always had stomach issues and it seemed to make it more pronounced.  I developed an anxiety disorder while on it (possibly due to just being a teenager.)  The worst side effect was what my doctor called &quot;striations&quot; where these long scars appeared going across my lower back liked I've been whipped, which are still there to this day. But I guess thats the tradeoff for a clear face.  Overall I believe it is a last resort, but very effective medication to treat acne.

I would not be able to eat anything and would puke if i did.  Then it eventually got better and now about a year after treatment i can eat normally, but i still puke EVERY morning. ya. not cool. its the stabbing kinda puke too, violent. just bile. got used to it by now i guess tho..doctor said to go to some gastrontologist but i never went. 
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	Chris, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	13-18	6/4/2012 12:55:26 AM	I've been on a relatively low dosage (40 mg/day) for roughly two weeks now, and I can happily testify that my skin hasn't looked better in years. The initial break out was mild and lasted only a few days, while the side effects are manageable (dry skin/lips) and can easily be treated with lotion and vaseline. In terms of psychological side effects such as depression, I haven't had any. If anything, I've had a boost of confidence from the improved appearance of my skin.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/2/2012 10:48:02 PM	I'm a 28 yr. old female, and I weigh approximately 105 lbs.  After several sporadic breakouts and then persistent daily breakouts, and at an odd age to have it too, I requested Accutane when nothing else seemed to work. (I'd tried Differin, Klaron, birth control, masks, Retin-A Micro, Pro Activ, Clarasonic, ... If I'd known Accutane (generic) worked so well with relatively few side effects, I'd definitely have insisted on it years before.) I was prescribed 20mg once daily for the first month and saw an improvement within the first week. By the month's end, my skin is clear - for the most part. I'll soon be taking 40mg once daily. Slathering layers of cream on at night help to counter the dryness. 
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	MNmom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	5/17/2012 12:36:07 AM	My 15 yr. old son was battling a severe acne issue for almost 6 months prior to getting to a dermatologist, who ultimately prescribed this medication.  He ended up using it for 5 months at 20mn the first 2 months, and 40mg the final 3 months.  He has had amazing results with the treatment, and minus the minimal scarring effects from the acne, has no more difficulty with the disease -- yet.  He has been off of the drug for 1 month, now, and has NOT had any reaccurance, nor break outs.  His mood was affected adversely in the following ways -- tired, agitated, prone to dramatic mood depression (ie: things that he would normally not be bothered by, agitated him severly), and his eating habits were diminished throughout treatment.  He has bounced back and now resumes a much more stable mood, and his tiredness is lessening.  Although I am a nurse, and had personal knowledge of the history of this medication, I am impressed by the govermental control over its use and dispension.  I am also thankful for the physicians that were and are willing to use this drug to help teens with severe acne that is untreated by other meds.  My son has a long way to go in order to see the permanent and lasting side effects. And, I will continue to post his changes and reactions during his recovery from the medication, on here for others' to read.   As for now, though, he has a normal, budding, social life, and his demeanor and response to the meds has been tolerable and positive.  I do recommend allowing your physician to at least try this medication if your child is suffering and nothing else is working.

I was initially put onto 10mg three times a week for 3 months, which has now been repeated after about a two month break.Initially my skin did get worse for a few weeks, but I hardly noticed it. The dry skin, lips and eyes was the worst part, especially the lips.I did notice that the medication sometimes made me feel sick, so I would take it in the afternoon rather than in the morning, because I would then be at home while the medication was absorbed.I have now been on the second phase for almost a week, and already the side effects have set in. I have noticed that my skin and lips are dry. I am also experiencing headaches and fatigue, which is something I didn't have during the first phase.I am confident that this second phase will clear my skin up. The first phase was quite effective and I noticed a difference in the acne at the end of the treatment. During the break my skin did get worse, but hopefully it will now improve and stay improved.The side effects are definitely not as bad as most people make them out to be. With proper care they can be properly managed.

I was sensitive to the sun and my lips cracked open, but that was all explained to me before taking the medication. These symptoms cleared up after i was done taking Accutane. The only skin problem i have now is a little bit of an uneven tone that was like that before taking the drugs. Its a rough couple of months but i do not regret it AT ALL! :)was on it for 6 months.

I was warned many times of the effects of Accutane and did my own research on it. I also want to say that no, two years later your hair loss is not caused by Accutane. Do your research before making stupid comments.

Later in my 20's I took it again becuase the acne came back. I had good results, but now that I am reading others saying that it causes IBS - I now know that it did give mey IBS for maybe 1 -2 years. (I didn't know it was the Accutane at the time, but in hindsight it makes sense.) The IBS has long ago gone away, and now at age 43 I am considering putting my teenage son on it. I did not have any reproductive or psychological side effects. I ended up having 3 healthy children. I have to say that I don't think the quality of my life would have been as good without Accutane. I really hope it is available for those who need it. I don't think &quot;vanity&quot; of acne is something to disregard in a country that only values youth and beauty, and those who have sever acne know the physical pain that also causes. I would still have endured 1 -2 years if IBS - which by the way was debilitating and limited activities that I could enjoy - for the benefits of Accutane.

I used to have cystic acne, that was very painful.  I was 32 when I took accutane.  I have had acne since I was 14 and it got worse as I got older.  I tried everything and nothing worked.  Accutane is a miracle drug for acne.  I had dry skin for the first 2 months, then my skin was beautiful and clear after.  I took accutane for 5 months.

I suffered with acne throughout by high school and undergrad years.  As a young adult it only became worst.  As a health care provider it was really embrassing so after trying everything else I tried generic accutane.  While on accutane I did suffer severe dry skin and lips and major skin peeling.  After a 2 1/2 month my skin started to improve and now is beautiful.  12 months later I am acne free!!!! It gets worst before it gets better so don't give up! Would recommend to anyone struggling with severe acne!

I hadn't had much acne in high school because after one low point in my life- I had permantly put myself on tetra-cycline, after a break out.  I thought if I stayed on it, I would never get a zit.  For ten years this worked until I got adult cycstic acne and thought to switch anti-biotics.  I figured that I had built an immunity towards tetra-cycline.  I tried bactruim but this only worked after a flare up but did nothing to prevent one.  I requested the strongest drug on the market, which it accutane (claravis).  I have been on it for 14 days but yesterday I got discouraged because I woke up to a cyst on my jawline.  I thought that this was suppose to be a &quot;miracle drug&quot; and if it is the strongest drug for cystic acne, then why is there a new cyst on my face? Also, I am bored with the compaints about the side effects--What about selling the reason why we are on this drug?

My brother took this for about 6 months. I cleared up his acne but now he would choose the acne over what he does have to deal with. For the past year he has had sever bowel problems. Whether it is constipation or diarrhea, he constantly has an upset stomache. When he is stressed or upset, it gets even worse. He has had to go to the hospital several times since due to the pain. There is no treatment for his problems, he will always will with these bowel problems and he is only 18. Now he has to go through college sharing a bathroom with roommates and being embarassed about his problems. He can't simply &quot;hold it&quot; like most of us can. That can really detriment an 18 year old's social life. In my opinion, problems like that are a lot more embarassing than some pimples. This drug isn't even worth the possible side effects. Accutane is luckily recalled - but there is still a generic that can be prescribed which causes the exact same problems. If you want to risk horrible problems for the rest of your life as well as the possibility of never being able to have children, go ahead and try to clear up your acne by taking this.

It seemed successful in healing and preventing the adult acne I had been suffering from. I had the joint pain and some hair loss but it did stop and my hair grew back. That is until about 2 years later long after the treatment was over,  when I started seeing lots of hair loss and thinning. I also began to see vitiligo spots, under my arms, on my hands around the sides of my face and in the groin area. Biospies of these areas said that there was still minimal melatonin and that it wasn't true vitiligo. Well, they are still with me and by now I know they will never go away.For my hair I did some natural remedies and that seemed to help. Then it came back and this time I began to lose my eyebrows. I saw a dermatologist for about 3 years, getting corti-steroid shots in my eyebrows and the crown of my head. It seemed to help my hair but not my eyebrows. We tried everything..the eyebrows would grow, then fall out again. I finally gave up and recently had them tattooed on. But I see hair loss on the sides of my head and around my hairline. I truly attribute this to the accutane.  I am so sorry I ever took the drug. I was told that after you stopped it, it is no longer in your body. So I thought it did what it was supposed to do and that was all there was to it. Don't take this stuff.

After a few months of treatment and no improvement or curing of my acne, the dose was increased.  After 6 months, there was still no curing of the acne.  The doctor ordered a more thorough blood test and found that due to elevated testosterone levels, Accutane would never work for me, so they took me off the drug.  The short and long term side effects have been problematic to life threatening.  Severe depression in the short term requiring psychiatric treatment.  Digestive problems, extremely dry eyes, difficulty sleeping and headaches have been long term and continuing problems.  The dry eye problem caused damage to my corneas which required surgery and there is no help for the dryness and lack of tears.  It will always be a problem.

I am a real person and here's my experience: Accutane (isotretinoin) worked for me, and worked really well. I have FEW breakouts, usually 1 small pimple every 3 months is how infrequent - and for me it's directly related to stress.I had no moodiness what-so-ever. I had no improper thoughts. The blood tests were a pain as I was 2 hours away from my pcp in college, but somehow I made it work. I was weary of the dry skin side affect as my doctor (not a review) told me it might be and issue. I am telling you - I wore SPF 30 on my body and SPF 70 on my face (Aveeno b/c it has a moisturizer with the SPF.) and had no issues! AND I taught wakeboarding ALL summer in the sun on the water. It doesn't get more risky than that for dry skin!When my dermatologist recommended this treatment, yes, I too was skeptical. But this is my experience and it has been well worth it. All in all, the worst I had it was a bit of dry lips. Which (haha) was easily repaired with chapstick.

I have had severe pelvic pain after taking acutane for about 2 months. I obviously stopped, but the pain still hasn't. When I went to get a refill of acutane the derm said it may be related and stopped me immediately. I'm 25 years old, my skin is clear, but I may never be able to have a child because of acutane. It's not worth risking your future over. I have an ultra sound this week to see exactly what is causing the pain in the area where my ovaries are. Either way, that kind of pain isn't normal and its scary to think that I might have sacrificed a lot more than I bargained for, just to be beautiful.

I took it mostly because my spots scarred my skin which was more depressing that the spots themselves. My dermatologist started me on 40mg for the first month then upped my dosage to 80mg the next and the last three months I took 120mg. I was concerned that my derm started me on a high dose as I had read high doses were dangerous. However his &quot;tried and tested&quot; method was that the higher the accutane dose, the less time needed to take the drug overall. It worked! After 3 months of the drug I was completely acne free after suffering since I was 11 ( at the time of taking I was 21). By the time my treatment ended I had no acne at all and I was lucky to never suffer from an initial breakout, or get  the occasional spot.During treatment I suffered from dry lips, which I treated with Burts Bee's lip balm and emolient cream (Cetraben) prescribed by my derm. I moisturised my skin everyday and my body skin didn't seem too dry. I do believe my vision has worsened, however it was begininig to worson before taking the drug. Apart from dry skin I suffered no major side effects. I vigorously worked out each day at the gym and at first my joints did ache a little bit more than usual, however this subsided and I didn't notice any pain by the middle of month 2.Nearly a year later I am still acne free. I would recommend this drug to anyone who has exhausted everything else first as it's a long commitment with blood tests and pregnancy tests for female patients. However form my experience I would say it was 100% worth every day.

I've been off this drug for 12 months now and have been left with thinning hair, joint pain and vision problems. I really can't believe how they can give this to people for acne when it can cause such severe and life long problems. I don't know what the future holds for me but from the research I've done things will get worse and not better. There seems to be no cure for the joint pain and nothing seems to ease it. I would advise anyone never to take this awful drug, I was only on it 2.5 months and it has ruined my life. I'm scared of what the future might hold.

I didn't notice a difference in my acne until about 2 months into the treatment.  The only side effect besides dry skin and increased sun sensitivity was insomnia.  I notice that most people don't mention this as a side effect but my insomnia was really bad and I'm still trying to get back into a regular sleeping habit (it's been almost a year since I stopped the treatment).  My acne did start to come back about 2 months after I stopped taking accutane but now I use a sulfur face wash and Ziana (topical gel) which works to keep my face breakout free.  Overall, I'm happy with the results.

On Accutane, my acne became temporarily worse, my face felt red and warm, and I had inflammation of the lips. Also, I had red lined rashes on my lower arms and legs from dry skin. That was about it for the side effects. I still get an occasional zit/pimple, but I treat it with OTC meds. I call Accutane 'the wonder drug from hell', but I made the right decision to take this drug. Even though I feel very sorry for the people who experience severe side effects, I hope this medication is never removed from the market.

It is the only thing that worked for me.  I had perfectly clear skin until now.  I am about to start my second round and am excited.  I can't wait to have clear skin again.  The only side effects I had was dry skin and lips.  Other than that....it was perfect.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Rosacea	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	13-18	4/5/2011 10:07:56 PM	I was on accutane for a little less than six months. I was a little skeptical about being on it but I was sick of acne and wanted it gone! I am so glad I chose to be on it because it has help extremely. I have been off of it for seven months and not a single pimple! I did have side effects. My skin got so dry. I would have nose bleeds once a week and I had dry patches on my arms. Going on the iPledge was a pain though! If you have bad acne, I would highly suggest taking accutane. It has changed my life for the better so far. 
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	4/2/2011 9:14:34 PM	I went on Accutane three different times to treat severe acne and found it was the only thing that worked for me. No real side effects were suffered from it. Although I wish it had worked perfectly the first time, I would have no problem recommending this drug.

The Accutane helped my acne significantly, but I still get cystic acne.  I still use topicals, and have been recommended to go on Anitbiotics again.  But most disappointing, is that I have experienced many of the side affects, some of them not even &quot;formally reported&quot; to the FDA.  One, which is well know, Ulcerative Colitis, but others, such as joint pain, depression (which there aren't enough reports to verify), and the list goes on.  Please people, if you are suffering from what you believe is connected, and especially if you were seen for these conditions AFTER taking Accutane, ones that weren't present beforehand, REPORT them to the FDA.  (there is a link at the bottom of this page!!)  It will help all of us that are suffering and unheard.  Like one man stated, this drug was created to treat CANCER, not acne.  If I had known that as a teenager (but old enough to sign away my life), I would not have put it in my body.

The dry lips and skin, and sun sensitivity was difficult to deal with during treatment.  Fortunately my treatment was during late winter and spring so I wasn't in the sun.  Results have been very good. It cleared up my acne problems almost completely for the past 16 years.  I still get an occasional small pimple, but nothing compared to the size, frequency, and quantity I used to get.  I used Accutane when I was 31 years old and I am now 47.  I do worry about the long term effects of a drug like this and hope there aren't any.  I have not had any health concerns that I can pin on Accutane.

My face was completly clear for about a year then i started breaking out again.but thanks god it was not as severe as before, i went to my dermatologist and he put me on a low dose accutane( 3 pills of 20mg per week).i'm glad that it's working and the side effects are not as severe as last time..:)) just dry lips, skin and flushing...
Other	coolchik3, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	19-24	2/17/2011 2:56:32 AM	very great drug. If you are fed up with your acne and feel you have tried everything...this will make your skin the way you have always dreamed. I took it for the five months didnt see any improvement until the last week then all of a sudden my face was clearing than it had ever been. Side effects were really dry skin, cracked lips, and occasional nose bleeds. Also th IPLEDGE routine got annoying but overall definitely worth it.
Other	bepeery, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	13-18	1/11/2011 5:52:31 PM	I had many side effects while taking accutane ranging from; back pain, chest pain, inflamed joints, dry eyes, dry nose, chapped lips,and sun sensitivity.  however if i had to go back, i would definitely take accutane again. It cleared up my persistant acne that had been untreatable by almost all other acne medicines, in about eight months. Overall i was very pleased and happy with how my skin turned out.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	19-24	1/4/2011 3:33:18 PM	I had extremely painful cystic acne growing up. It was so bad that it hurt to wash my face, and I often could not sleep on one side because it hurt so bad to have the pressure on my face. Accutane completely cleared up my skin, but with side effects so bothersome that I wonder if I did the right thing. I could handle the extremely dry lips and skin and my leg muscles feeling like they were going to tear every time I stood up, but the mental and emotional side effects are completely different. It made me depressed, incredibly emotional, and I feel that my entire personality has changed. My personality has not gone back to normal since I stopped taking Accutane two years ago, and it bothers me every single day. Think long and before taking this medication, because although it's easy to say &quot;that will never happen to me,&quot; that's exactly what I kept telling myself and now it's too late.

I have very oily skin, and previous treatments didn't seem to work very well. It was a pain in the butt to have to do the iPLEDGE thing, but it was worth it. The only problem I experienced was with the lower back pain. At some points it was so bad I couldn't stand up, which happened often. Although, I only experienced this AFTER lifting something or carrying something heavy.

It is a very stong medicine. I've had hair shedding since the beginning. I've had better luck with ProActive than I ever did on this drug. I'd suggest, if you have a light case of acne please try the ProActive first.

It cleared up his acne completely but it left him with terrible joint pain for the last 4 years. He was a stand out athlete but had to give up football because the joint pain was unbearable. You should know that this drug is used to treat cancer and has horrible side effects. Please be very careful about using it.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	13-18	11/3/2010 10:42:20 PM	I'm on my 4th month, and I haven't had a zit yet! I used to have terrible acne, and I tried everything. It is a pain in the butt to have to get your blood drawn and get a pregnancy test, but I guess it's worth it. There are a lot of bad side effects, but again, I guess it's worth it. I've had the worst terrible dry lips and skin ever. I can't wait to be back in my normal skin.

I've tried everything that there was but none of it worked! I would often cry myself to sleep because of my acne. I skipped football games, parties and fake sick. My doctor put me on accutane 3 months ago. I started having dry lips, skin, minor nose bleeds and joint pain. But honestly, it was all worth it. I haven't had one zit in over a month and it has cleared everything up for me. I couldn't be happier and I would recommend accutane to anyone who is fed up with their acne!
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	11/1/2010 5:15:21 PM	Prescribed by dermatologist to treat Hidradenitis Suppurativa.  He guaranteed that this was the only treatment that would succesfully cause remission. Against my better judgement after doing some research into this medication, I took it.  I was miserable with dry skin, hands and cracked lips that lasted over a year after going off the med.  6 months after completing the treatment, I had a heart attack at 33 years old.  No prior heart problems ever.  In less than 11 months, my HS was back worse than before.  Dermatologist became angry when I asked him about the meds being the cause of my heart problems and took it as a personal attack on his medical training. Needless to say I got rid of the lousy doctor.  Now my HS is untreated because I am afraid the same ignorance of my condition may occur.  I would not recommend that this poison be given to anyone ever.

It is not an easy drug to take due to side affects and blood tests. The FDA also put a lot of restrictions on the drug so its harder to get prescribed. It took the drug 7 months to clear my face of acne and in the past two months i have had one small zit.

I had severe acne since 5th grade that ruined my life.  I endured constant self-consciousness made worse by the constant teasing.  After 9 years of trying everything (tetracyline, Retina-A, antibiotics) I had given up.  On the night I was planning my suicide (note was written, pills were purchased), i walked past my brother's room in the basement and saw his accutane pamphlet he had just got that day.  I decided to hold off on the suicide until I could try this medicine.  My doctor wouldn't give it to girls (because of pregnancy issues, even though I felt so gross i wouldn't dream of sex with anyone in my state).  so i waited for freshmen year of college and got a new doctor who put me on.  5 months later, for the first time in 9 years, i had clear skin!!!  side effects were totally bearable - all you need is moisturizer and blistex and you are all set.  I followed all the instructions - didn't get pregnant, took with food, took at the right time, avoided vitamin A, didn't drink alcohol ever, got all the blood tests.  I get so angry at the people who scare people out of the drug or file lawsuits.  something tells me these people didn't follow the instructions correctly, or are very rare cases or are attributing symptoms erroneously to the drug (and the girls that have babies on the drug have no one to blame but themselves - there is a pregnant woman with an x through it on every pill!).  My worst worst fear is that the drug won't be available for my kids (note: i wouldn't be married or even have kids without Accutane).  After my skin cleared up, i had a life for the first time in 9 years.  I dated, i made friends, i could actually speak without being totally self-conscious. i could finally wear tank tops and go swimming in a bathing suit without the trauma of hiding my back-acne.  If you have severe cystic acne, i say deifinitely take it!!  You will never regret it.

It was a hard year taking the medication. The medication for me made it worse before it got better. The side effects for me included: chap lips, dry eyes, and dry skin to the point of being raw. Its been 3 years since I've taken it and I RARELY get even a zit. I have a little scarring but no other health issues. I would take it again if I had to...
Other	nashrunner, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/30/2010 2:26:14 PM	I have taken Accutane 4 times previously, 3 times in my younger life for acne, once again more recently for very resistant rosacea and currently for a condition called Grover's rash (which really has very little known treatment). I am about 2 weeks in on my current run. Every time previously the medication has worked with minimal side effect other than the expected. It does seem as I have become older, my skin is more dry and less resistant, so the effect of it seems a little more intense. It's much easier to manage in warm weather than in winter when skin seems to be dryer anyway. I am happy to be on Accutane again. It's always been successful for me in the past but I must be careful of the sun.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/14/2010 8:44:45 PM	I am a 35 year old female diagnosed with severe nodular cystic acne at age 17. I have controlled my acne, for the most part, with antibiotics when flaring, cyst injections, chemical peels, and a variety of prescribed topicals. I have a history of flaring every 3 years and thought it would be beneficial to try accutane. After taking two doses, I had to stop due to severe migraine with severe naseau, and extreme eye pressure. Needless to say, I was advised to stop and I am very grateful that I am not blind. 
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	13-18	7/3/2010 12:04:03 AM	SUMMARY:Effectiveness: IT WORKS! but for severe acne you may need to go back on in the future.Ease of use: If youre a guy it's easy. Women need to take monthly blood tests and must go through a long process to get the medication.******************************I took accutane when I was thirteen years old. I had severe acne since I was extremely young (about 8 or 9) and absolutely nothing worked. Accutane definitely changed my life. It made me so much more confident and it is definitely worth it to go on. However, the process is difficult if you are a woman. You have to take a blood test every month (to check for pregnancy and cholesterol) and within 24 hours of the test you must go online and take a test about sex and pregnancy before you can finally pick up your next perscription.the side effects are also not fun. Your skin gets extremely dry (my lips would crack and bleed) and you are more easily sunburned.I was extremely satisfied with the results. my face looked . . . pretty much flawless (if i do say so myself). However my acne was so severe that I may have to go back on in the future. It has come back a little bit and I am currently on tetracycline and Retin-A which seems to be working so far.

I had multiple surgeries including a complete colectomy (removal of entire large intestine/colon).  The symptoms of Ulcerative Colitis (severe cramping, passing blood, inability to control bowels, etc.) were not worth clearing up acne.  And living with no colon for the rest of my life isn't very easy either.  PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS DRUG!

After a few months my skin was very clear, but slowly a few have come back after a couple of years now. The med was a pain in the sense that i'd have to get my blood drawn once a month and have lots of doctor checkups. While on the medicine I had extremely dry skin. My lips were always cracked, which was painful. After getting off the medicine I haven't had any problem with the effects some people feel afterwards. Overall I was satisfied with taking Acutane. I am no longer embarrassed by my skin.  :)
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	6/9/2010 1:09:44 PM	HIS IS A WONDER DRUG.  I had cystic acne from about age 10 to age 35 when it became available in the mid-1980s.  It totally cleared my skin and helped me physically and emotionally.  It has been many years since I took Accutane, and my skin is totally clear and it helped the quality in terms of reducing scarring, pores and general appearance.  People actually compliment my skin, which, for those of us who suffered so much is amazing.  The first time someone complimented me (who didn't know me before treatment), I looked behind me to see who they were talking to and there was no one there.  This drug is well worth all the precautions.  I felt fine while taking it because my skin cleared within a short period of time.  My son and nephew also had great results.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	19-24	6/1/2010 9:32:06 AM	I am 22, female, and have had acne since I was 12.  I was on so many topicals and antibiotics through those ten years and nothing ever helped even slightly.  In November I was put on Accutane 30mg and gradually increased each month until my full dose of 60mg this past April.  I did not see any improvements in my skin until I was bumped up to this 60mg.  My advice is to BE PATIENT!! My derm said people usually don't see results until they are on their goal dose (different depending on your weight).  Throughout my course I experienced severe dry lips, dry skin, a rash on my forearms, joint pain (only in the first 2 months), and dry nose with nosebleeds.  These are small side effects for what I am getting.  Unfortunately I had to cut my course short by 2 months because I was dropped by my parent's insurance company due to reaching the age limit for dependents.  Even with 2 months lost, my skin is so smooth, I break out occasionally but it is nothing compared to what I used to get.  I'm still waiting for red marks to go away, my derm said that can take up to a year.  The only thing I didn't like about this drug is all the blood tests.  I'm scared of needles, but not only that, it's an inconvenience.

I paray there is clear skin in my sons' future and that a 2nd round of accutane wont be needed. We can put a man on the moon, but we can't find a real cure for a skin problem? c'mon people!

I had been battling severe acne for years with no end in sight for the weekly trips to the dermotologist. I took accutane and my skin cleared up. That was over 10 years ago and I rarley break out, but if I do it's from foods I'm eating.People from high school almost don't recognize me because my skin is clear.It is a miracle drug!

I started taking Accutane 40 mg, 1 pill, every morning with breakfast about a month and a half ago, and it is working great! My skin already is smoother, softer, and less acne covered. But I am still left with the scars from my Jr. High years. For the first week or so of treatment hell yes it was awful! My skin was red, and dry all over, and peeling. My lips were also chapped and peeling and painful! :( . BUT this, as I was informed, is a sign that it is working!! I was also super sensitive to the sun (wicked sunburn), had random bruises, and had God awful hives for awhile from an allergy to the medication all over my arms!! Now I have been having random nose bleeds, MUST BUY NOSE SPRAY!  My body had random aches and pains, but it was not SO bad that I can't go to work or whatever. I have to go in for blood tests monthly as well, to make sure my liver and what not are still functioning the way they should be and for toxic's in my blood or whatever. But thus far I have seen nothing but good come from this treatment. I am just putting up with my reactions to this drug until my acne is gone, which are now alot better then they were at the start of the treatment... Each person is different, DO NOT expect it to work &quot;miracles&quot; after one month, I'm almost at my two month mark and my face is still not perfect, but I see improvments each day I continue the treatment. And THAT is why I am doing this. For the people who complain of flaking, red, and sore skin I suggest a hydration cream from your doctor or dermatologist for your face! NO vitamin A in it! The pills have enough of that.. I also suggest getting a toner for your skin as well, I got some from a skin care specialist as well as facials to make sure everything is going smoothly. I also take these Omega pills (AKA: fish pills) as well, 3 each day. My skin care specialist said eating fish will help the process but I HATE IT so pills are my option! :) . I hope my post helps someone out there

I had terrible breakouts and did try topical creams and antibiotics much to no avail.  Since using Claravis I haven't had one single blemish of any kind.  I highly recommend it.  Yes the side effects are irritating but overall completely worth it!  I was at the point that I wanted to walk around with a paper bag over my head.  My dermatologist was great -- he explained everything up front including all of the potential severe side effects.  I still chose to take Claravis and would do it again if I had to!  Hearing about the Ulcerative Colitis and Chrohn's Disease incidents are scary and I feel really bad that they have to go through all of the issues -- I'm a RN and know that it is a tough road.  But no medication is safe -- you just have to decide what's more important to YOU.  
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	5/2/2010 9:58:06 PM	I took accutane when I was 17 and have since developed ulcerative colitis (symptoms began at the end of the 5 months I was on it).  I have had multiple surgeries which included a colectomy (removal of entire large intestine/rectum) and now have an ostomy which I received at the age of 23.  I totally attribute it to taking accutane and my face continues to break out now.

After emergency surgery I vowed to speak out against this medication.  GLAD PEOPLE ARE CATCHING ON...The price of getting clear skin should not endanger your life

I have severe nodular acne on my back and it just will not go away. I have 2 more months of treatment and I hope it works.  I really want to get off this medicine.  The only side effect I have experienced is loss of appetite.  I have otherwise tolerated it well. And by the way, my face looks great!

I spent over ten years trying every acne product available, visiting dermatologists, taking antibiotics and nothing seemed to work. Finally, after doing laser treatments which did not work, I was put on Accutane for four months.  I only had dry lips! I have been acne free for almost a year and it is wonderful.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne		5	3	5			3/24/2010 12:37:32 AM	I took accutane when I was 13, and aside from the dry lips and skin, I think that this was a miracle drug.  Now I am 22 and pretty much acne free. I only get a couple pipmles when I'm getting my period. I would recomend this to anyone with had to get rid of acne.

I was on accutane for one month and it cleared my face and stopped the over production of oil on my face and in my hair which was amazing. I could wake up in the morning and not look like i haven't showered in 5 days. I had to stop because I developed IBS-C from the medication. Now I have acne and IBS-C which isn't fun at all. I do not regret trying accutane because acne was ruining my life and that month of being oil free was amazing. If you plan on trying this drug it's either hit or miss. I hope others have better luck with it.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne		5	3	5			3/11/2010 7:41:07 PM	I took 3-month course of Accutane 27 years ago for cystic acne. It was the only thing that stopped my acne. I did not have any side effects other than dry skin and lips. The acne did come back years later but never as severe, so I didn't take another course.

After years of self-esteem-crippling back and chest acne, my doctor finally put me on it. This was about 10 years ago and I am still relatively acne free. However, the side effects were monstrous. Dry, cracked lips; 'lizard skin' on the back of my hands,  finger and toe nail infections, joint and back pain, permanent loss of night vision, and dry, fragile skin. Side effects went away after treatment. Overall it was worth it, but young people should be aware of what they could be doing to their bodies.

As a male, it was easy to take and the results were amazing.Fast forward to the present, if I could ever re-do one thing in my life, I would NEVER take the accutane given that chance.As I'm aging, winter months are particularly hard on my skin now.  Staying moisturized takes on war-like dimensions.In addition, due to the constant dryness of my skin, I'm susceptible to skin infections vis-a-vis cracking of the skin.  For the last 7 years, I've been battling recurrent community associated MRSA.  I'm convinced that had I not gone and complete the round of Accutane, I would not be suffering from MRSA like I am today.That said, it's nice to see that Accutane is no longer available.  Way to go, FDA!!

My self esteem was in the dumps and I secluded myself from the world hiding for months. I was severly depressed and i love to thank isotretonion for giving me back my life and my confidence. I was not able to step out of my home to take my children to the park. People wouldn't glance, just stare at my deformality on my face. It broke my heart and the nodular cystic acne I had was horrendous and very painful. My kids would try to kiss me and it hurt so bad physically and emotionally not being able to recieve their joyous little pecks. I thank God for this medication. I heard the results could be temporary but i pray not. For now i am so alleviated of my condition and couldn't enjoy life more. I never really thought of how important it was how people look on the outside but now i reconsider. I dont judge people by its cover but it can surely shatter a person ego. I'm so blessed now.

After suffering from acne for 13 years I finally decided to go on Accutane. My acne was incredibly painful and I also suffered from skin infections in my outer ear. I tried Pro Active, over the counter medication, oral antibiotics and topical antibiotic treatments with no progress. My skin, lips and scalp instantly dried up and were very irritated. Developed eczema for the first time in my life. After a couple of weeks I began to have severe pain in my joints when I got out of bed in the morning. Dr. then lowered my dosage. My acne became significantly worse while on the medication. During the 4th month of treatment I began to have a headache that lasted for 2 weeks with no response to Tylenol or Advil. At that point my doctor took me off the medication. About 6 months after I began the treatment my acne completely disappeared. I have now been acne free for over a year and the ear infections have stopped. This medication was horrible on my body but I'm so glad I was able to stick it out and take it.

If other treatments are not working, this one will do the job. It has serious side effects that need to be monitored, but it was worth the effort to have clear skin. 
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	clearnow, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	2/1/2010 10:49:00 AM	I started accutane due to the deep painful nodules that I would get (adult onset acne).  These spots would not heal, and would set off my glands requiring antibiotics.  Once referred to a dermatologist, none of the specialized antibiotics we tried worked.  I have been on accutane for almost 5 months now with about 2.5 left to go.  I usually take 1 40mg pill a day, with 2 months of 60mgs a day.I experienced every side effect known to man:  Dry scalp/eyes/nose (also blowing out blood each time I blow my nose), dry lips, ears flushing bright red, the accutane hand rash, elbow pain, back pain, rib pain, and joint/muscle pain, oh and my personal favorite:  rectal bleeding.  In most cases, these side effects would come on strong and almost cause me to stop the medicine, but then they would fade away.  I still have the dry eyes/lips/scalp, and also the joint pain (I walk like an old lady sometimes!)I have remained on accutane and I am glad that I have worked through it so far.  I do not have any outbreaks AT ALL, not even during PMS.    I wake up each morning and look in the mirror to see unbroken skin (except for my scars!)  Nothing on my face hurts.  Nothing breaks open and bleeds when I wash and dry my face.  I never worry that people are talking to me but looking at my zits.  It is WONDERFUL!  I hope I can make it through the last few months and I am definitely counting down.I recommend this drug with caution.  Be aware that there are lots of side effects and some of them can be very disruptive.  I take my glucosamine for my joints, and even take more than normal while I am on accutane.  I take biotin at night to help prevent hair loss, and I use aquaphor all the time.  I carry a small tube in my pocket for my lips, and at night I smear it inside my nose, on my hands, and on my lips.  Drink water water water!  I cant stress the importance of water enough!  Eat prunes and KEEP YOUR PRIMARY CARE DR IN THE LOOP!!  Overall I recommend, but buckle up for the ride.

This is a great medicine for masking the problem for an extended amount of time, but it's not a cure all especially if it's in your genes.

Yes my side effects were the typical ones. Dry skin dry nose dry lips, eyes. But nothing I couldn't live with. My triglycerides did double when my dose was raised but my dermatologist cut it back down. Yes the blood draws can be annoying but it's to keep you safe. I was on an antidepressant before hand so I didn't get the depression side effect. I was reading some of the other reviews with their  side effects and I don't understand how someone would stay on a medication that they  have severe side effects. I mean you know your own body and yes dealing with acne is a horrible experience I know that first hand. But geez swelling feet and hives? Stomache pain? This is a very powerful drug and only you know your body. Not your doctor. So I recommend to people that take this drug, is to listen to your body. If something doesn't feel right, it is not right! Depression is a major concern with this medication. At the first symptom either go off the medication or take an antidepressant. Everyone is well aware of the side effects. There is so much information out there for your benefit. I don't believe that people should put this medication down just because it didn't work for them or that they had severe side effects from it. Not all medications work for everyone. You have to go into it with an open mind and well educated. You also have to listen to your body. I am pleased with this medication.

The Accutane didn't fade my acne scars so I still had to use a topical retinoid. Four years later, I'm back at square 1.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	4	Female		12/20/2009 2:52:38 PM	I took this drug twice. It is a very dangerous drug to some people, so I would recommend talking indepth with your doctor about it. My skin did improve markedly. I still get some pimples, but they are much smaller and easier to control. Also my acne seems to be linked to my period. The hardest part about taking it the second time was all of the hoops one had to jump through in order to start the drug. It took me three months to get all the paperwork and tests aligned and then the silly pharmacist I went to messed up the process and I had to start all over. My side-effects were more severe the second time around, perhaps because I was on a higher dose. I had terribly dry, cracked lips, nosebleeds and very dry skin. I feel the drug is very effective, but invest in a six month supply of lip balm and skin lotion if you take it.

But last July when I was on my 4th and last month of Accutane I ended up in the E.R. for rectal bleeding and SEVERE pain. When the doctors did the CT scan they told me after 8 hours there that I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis. UC is extremely painful and something that you have for the rest of your life. I would not recommend for anyone to take Accutane. Even if you think it would be worth it, it's not, believe me. My face was completely healed while on Accutane and stayed clear for the next 2-3 months. But now it's back to how it was before. This drug is not worth it.

But after the first week, I became VERY ill. I experienced headaches, dizziness, insomnia, heart palpiltations, tremors in my right hand, diarrhea, black stools and burning with urination. I told my doctor and he said to stop immediately. Some people are very sensitive to this drug!

I had bad acne from 8th grade until my junior year in high school. I started Acutane when I was a sophmore. Overall I ended up taking it 3 times. YOU SHOULD TAKE ANTIDEPRESENTS WHILE USING ACUTANE! The first time I took it I did not need any counter drugs. The second time, it took 1 week and let's just say I was crying like a baby. My dermatologist had me go to a doctor to be perscribed antidepresents. Which actually was nice because they made me feel good and normal again. I still have pimples every once and a while but it's because I touch my face too much. Here's a little hint Don't touch your face, that's what causes a lot of pimples to spread. It's hard and embarassing but that's what you need to do. It was a very expsenive drug definately but COMPLETELY Worth it! I highly advise this drug as long as you understand the consequences of taking any drug.Advice: Don't touch your face (spreads pimples quickly)Stay out of sun to avoid easy sunburnInvest in a good lip balm/chapstickUse lotion for dry skinTake every pill you are supposed to.Understand that you could have severe depression. Don't feel bad if you need to take antidepressents....it's apart of the side effects.
Other	wcmom3, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/9/2009 9:40:16 AM	At 35 yrs old my skin was still not as clear as it could be. Now my acne was no where near as bad as some that take this medication but it worked. Honestly I did not look at the side effects before I took the medication, I looked at the outcome. Immediately severe dry, cracked lips...the corners of of my mouth would crack and bleed. Nose bleeds within the first month of use, they stopped though pretty quickly only after I would put vasaline inside my nose. Then came the extremely dry skin. One month after use I thought it would be ok to get my eyebrows waxed since I was on it only a short period of time...wrong, it ripped my skin completely off and scabbed up. I would get cuts and if my arms rubbed against the desk I would get small sore like irratation on my skin. Moisturizer will be your best friend, always everyday, all the time. Chapstick, never leave home without it. My eyes feel very dry and irritated, makes me feel tired. Definitely stay out of the sun, if I forgot to put on lotion or was outside for a short period of time, I would burn. No psychiatric side effects I can say.  Recently I had began to have neck and joint pain at the point to where I woke up in the morning it would hurt to walk. I would get leg cramps. I am in my 6 month of use and hopefully final dose. So my tradeoff, dry cracked lips, dry skin, joint &amp; muscle pain, dry irritated eyes, was tought to handle but well worth it, my skin looks awesome now and I feel so much better being out and around people, not worried that they are noticing my skin before they know me. I can say though the muscle pain is not worth it and if that had continued I would have stopped taking the medication. For the outcome achieved it was well worth the side effects. It's not an easy journey to take....good luck!

Side effects I had were just dry skin/lips, and then my feet would flush and turn red whenever I was on them for a while (went away after I stopped taking it), but everything was worth the result of my exceedingly clear skin. Now, I get complimented for having such &quot;naturally beautiful skin.&quot; Little do they know that I have accutane to thank for it!
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	12/2/2009 7:54:37 AM	I am 30 yrs old now and took Accutane in my early teens to help with very oily skin and slight acne problems. I was taken off of it after the rumors started running about the problems it was causing thus leading it to be reviewed by the FDA. The past few years I have been diagnosed with Osteopenia (a step before Osteoperosis) - I'm 30!! and my upper arms and upper back get very red and hot to the touch whenever I'm upset or hot. After doing my research on Accutane I believe it has contributed to these issues. I have also been diagnosed with Rosacea. Granted, that is a hereditary problem but I believe it has contributed to the flushing of my skin.Overall Accutane helped and I too experienced dry mouth, lips and sensitivity to the sun. But 15 yrs or so later, it wasn't worth what I'm putting up with now.

By May (fifth month into taking medication) my acne was completely gone, and I am very happy with the results. The only side effects I noticed were dry lips/face and some dehydration, but these are highly outweighed by the benefits of accutane. I highly recommend this drug to anyone with trouble with acne.

Accutane has changed my life, I havent had not one zit or blackhead since I finished taking the medication a little over 4 months ago. The only side effects I had (but were all worth it) were Dry lips (chapstick), dry nose with nosebleeds (vasoline), and dry skin (used lots of lotion) other than my acne got worse on the medication before it got better. I wish I would have done it alot sooner than I did! I would recommend this medication to anyone who suffers from acne!

After taking the medicine for just five and a half months, I have absolutely NO acne. It is fantastic. The only thing I didn't like about the treatment was that I had to get blood drawn monthly for a pregnancy test and to test the triglyceride level in my blood, and this was only a setback because I have a great fear of needles.

The acne is completely gone and the scarring is minimal! We were considering laser procedure for the scarring, but the dermatologist encouraged us to wait on making that decision for a few months and we are glad we did. The only problems he has had are dry, cracked lips, dry skin and eyes, and dry mouth. The skin and lips were treated with a good moisturizer. The dry eyes were treated by the optometrist that I work for. The major problem has been the dry mouth which resulted in the enamel loss of his teeth. We are now in the process of getting veneers for him and they are VERY expensive! His self esteem has improved so much. The girls touch his skin and tell him it is beautiful! He is now exploring the modeling field. Acutane has been a life saver for him.

At first I had terrible mood swings and was unbearable to be around since I was so mean. Now, at 4+ months into it, my hair is falling out in clumps. I have also had severe muscle and joint pain throughout treatment. I have yet to decide if the side effects are worth the progress. I still break out constantly and now it takes even longer for them to heal. I am dissapointed thus far.

Devestated, I turned to my doctor who put me on Accutane and it worked miracles! I did have the normal side affects- extremely dry lips, skin, intollerance to contact lenses. As well as urinary tract and yeast infections. But nothing severe or that would keep me from taking it. Now, 10 years later I am back on it (having kids really messes up your skin!) I have been on it for almost a month with no unusual problems. I alrealdy notice a difference and for me, it's worth the dry skin and peelings lips to know that in 6 months, my skin will once again be clear.

Just as I was getting rid of one giant cyst another would take its place along with smaller whiteheads all around my chin.  I, like so many others, have spent tens of thousands on anything and everything to get rid of the problem to no avail.  I am on Claravis 30mg x 2/day.  I immediatly noticed the drying on the minor whiteheads, but it took until the 3rd month for the cysts to not return.  I am on my last month of treatment and have had minimal side affects - dry lips, nose, some joint pain at begining, lower back pain, weight gain and some lack of concentration. Other than that, I would recommend this drug - to women only.  Men seem to have an adverse effect and should be monitored for depression as from what I have read seems to affect the most.  With that said, I finally have clear skin after 20+ years and only wish I had taken it before I gave myself scars. 
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	13-18	11/7/2009 9:58:21 PM	I am told that this drug has beeen recalled but have heard that dermatologists are still offering the generic or similar medication. Please, do not take this medication, find another treatment for ancne!I took Accutane for 5 months with great results. Since then (for the past five months) I have been experiencing extreme joint pain all over and as a result I have not wanted to go out and do the stuff I used to. It took about four months before I went to see a Rhemetologist, he and a chiropractor have confirmed that it is a side effect, or rather a negative reaction to the Accutane. They both have seen this before in patients who have been on Accutane and medications like it. No body told me that this might happen and it is not on any side effect/reaction list. I am relieved to finally know what is the cause of all my pain and I want to get the word out. I am very glad to see that it has been recalled but also have heard that people can still get the generic, which is what I was taking. I STRONGLY discourage the taking of this medication. Though the results were great and my skin is clear, it is not worth the daily pain and many pills I have to take. Not to mention the medical bills my family is now facing.

I suffered from the side effects terribly, depression and eating disorders but unfortunately I did not realize it was a side effect until I was off the drug. In retrospect I have no idea how I made it through the back spams- they would actually immobilize me for up to a minute. I was suicidal, skeletal, with scars on both my arms but my acne was mostly gone. Of course after only a few months it returned in full. Please stay away from this drug! It ruined my teenage years. Not worth the vanity. 
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	snickers233, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	55-64	11/4/2009 7:08:18 PM	I began treatment in July of my 50th year, by August I was having swollen feet, shortness of breath, and loss of bowel control accompanied with weakness in even walking up the stairs. Ultimately discovering at the age of 50 that I now had Graves disease; thyroid disorder/disease. The dermatologist did not accept that I was having trouble on the drug but when he saw my swollen feet that I couldn't get my shoes on, he reduced the pills from 3 per day to 1 per day. It was too late and ultimately I had to stop taking it but not before it had thrown my thyroid into distress. The thyroid condition was not diagnosed until April of the next year. My own physician did not recognize it. But Graves' disease really ruins your face, your eyes and ultimately the quality of your life. I was pretty before but my face is sort of scary now. All my dermatologist had worried about was whether or not I'd become pregnant or not. There is no question to me that this extremely powerful drug should never be used by people with history of thyroid disease and that Accutane caused my problem. I had to have my eye muscles cut (levator muscle) to get my lids to shut and my thyroid removed.  I got acne again later. Secondly both my daughter and son used Accutane when they were in high school. My daughter said it was killing her. Her knees had terrific pain. Although both of their faces cleared up, it came back a while later and they both had to go on it again. They both have slight acne even now as young adults. There should be far greater warnings about this medication.

But from the beginning, he had severe lower back pain and body aches.  A month into the treatment, he developed mood swings, a severe rash (hives), chest pain with palpitations, stomach pain, severe headaches.  It progressed to his lips swelling and throat swelling so he was admitted into the hospital for two days for treatment.  He's been off of it for about six weeks now, but he's still having severe lower back, hip, knee and ankle pain and depression.  I would not recommend this drug to anyone for any reason.  Try and find other forms of treatment for acne.

At the time, it seemed like a great idea. It cleared up his acne, he looked great, and he had that boost in confidence all teen boys need.  While these were all great changes, they were short lived.  My brother fell into a deep depression.  He was full of sadness, had a loss of social interaction, hallucinations, a loss of motivation and severe changes in the appetite of a young teen boy.  My brother could not make it school and could hardly ever make it out of bed for an entire semester.  Every test in the book was ran rule out any illnesses or cancer, and now his condition is attributed to accutane.  Now that we know what has caused my brother to become a completely different person who may never become a productive person in our society, I want to make sure others seriously consider the risks of this dangerous drugs.  It is hard to cope with the fact that such a dangerous acne pill that shouldn't be on the market has mutilated the life of my brother and taken him away from me.  It is hard to watch my Mom and Dad have so much hope for their son, but sadly realize there really isn't any.  I miss my brother...don't lose your love one to accutane!

It wasn&#180;t as sever as it could have been,, but it remained resistant to all the other types of treatment ( acid, antibiotics, 1000 other types of creams). Although it has cleared up all my skin ( and even gotten rid of all my blackheads), i found it somewhat difficult to use and not fully satisfied. Yes, my skin is perfect now, and perfectly dry too. i used to have very oily skin and now it&#180;s somewhat dry, but the problem are my mouth and nose which bother me a lot. Plus all the psychological problems i had - depression, laziness, lack of concentration. I stared taking the medication exactly the month that i had finals for college, which didn&#180;t go so well. My dermatologist did not inform me that that might a side effect. 1 month of treatment left, i just hope the after damage is no big enough to make me regret having taken it.

I had been to several different dermatologists and tried every topical and oral treatment imaginable. Then we started Accutane. My skin became crystal clear. There were drawbacks though. The iPledge was aggrivating, I had severely dried lips, some hair loss, and the monthly blood tests. Despite this issues, I would reccomend this medication.

I used it when I began developing cystic acne.  I was in college and needed to have my blood tested monthly during the use of the drug.  It cured the acne within about 2 months.  It kept any and all acne away for many years.  The main complaint I had regarding dryness was my hair.  I also recall having some issues with bowel movements.  It dried everything.  However, it was all worth it.  It gave me back my confidence.  I would go on it again in a heartbeat.

But the side effects werent exactly a walk in the park. Very dry, peely skin, severly chapped lips, red eyes, back pain and pale/easily burned skin. But a few things that deffinatly halped were Cere-ve lotion, medicated chapstick and ultra-sheer sunblock. Oh, and take the 'full glass of water' thing very seriously- my doctor didn't really explain this till i was nearing my last dose, but it helps alot. I can't explain how great it was going into highschool acne-free, or the confidence boost. So worth it.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	19-24	9/16/2009 12:22:59 AM	The Accutane started working very quickly and if i continued on it, I'm sure it would have done its job. But the side effects made me discontinue it.  I went on it for 3 weeks and noticed my penis was losing sensation so i stopped for a week. I decided it was probably in my head so i went on again after the week break and the side effects got much worse so i ultimately stopped taking it after another additional week.  The side effects made the head of my penis numb and caused difficulty sustaining an erection which caused MAJOR depression.  The side effects took about 3 or 4 months to completely subside after i went off the drug but it pretty much ruined my senior year of high school and i had to go through therapy and go on antidepressants.  Instead of the Accutane I'm taking Nicotinamide which is basically a vitamin supplement that has completely prevented me from getting a single cyst since starting it. It doesn't help with other kinds of acne though so i still get clogged pores and pimples, just not the big cysts.  Also it is pretty expensive and takes 6 weeks to fully start working, but otherwise it has prevented me from getting cysts which i used to frequently get.I am not against Accutane because i understand my side effects were 1 in a million (literally i went to a doctor and they said there were recorded cases like mine but so few that its not even listed as a side effect which is why my dermatologist denies it was the accutane).  However just take caution when on it and be aware that there are probably alot of side effects that are not even listed in the warnings.  For example my urologist said that loss of libido is a side effect but it is not listed.  But at the same time the side effects are most likely going to be temporary but i'm more than satisfied with the nicotinamide and not getting the wicked side effects.
Other	mom, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	13-18	9/15/2009 3:43:28 PM	Both of my sons have used Accutane with great success.  The oldest has been off of it for 6 years and still no acne.  The worst part was the dry lips and skin, but Aquaphor works great for that.  My youngest has had his hands to start and peel.  I just told him to put Aquaphor on them and this seems to help.  If you use Accutane just watch for changes mentally.  Report any changes.

I took the full 6-month treatment and I am thrilled with the results. I used to have deep, persistent acne, but now my skin is totally clear, and has been for the past 9 months since finishing treatment. My only regret is that I didn't take it years ago!

At first, within the first month, my skin was glowing and clearing up. Only after the first month did I realize how crucial it would be to carry moisturizing eye drops and chapstick with me at all times. This would be my only recommendation, in addition to drinking water. Other than that the effects are so nice and have improved the way that I view my skin. I don't even touch my face and notice one single pimple flaw ever. Highly recommendable if one is able to be responsible with taking care of their eyes and lips when they are dry.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/29/2009 8:35:39 PM	I am almost 30 years old and have been dealing with severe acne since I was 14. After trying everything and I do mean everything, I went on Clarvis. By the 2nd month, my skin was alot drier in a good way. It was always so oily that I would have to redo my makeup all the time. And now I only do it once a day with mineral makeup. I almost completed my medication and the only side effect I have had is dry skin. And all I do is use a loofa in the shower then use lotion and chapstick. Because I have waited so long to get the right treatment I will need a dermabrasion to get rid of the scars. And as for the getting blood draws and doctor appts, it's really for the patients benefit because it is a strong drug. I feel better knowing I'm being carefully monitored. I would encourage anyone who has tried the creams, gels, antibiotics, etc to no avail, to talk to your dermatologist about accutane. It truely has helped me and my self esteem. It's so terrible to go through life with gross skin. And being judged because it's the first thing people see. I have 2 daughters and if they ever have the skin that I have, I will be allowing them to go on accutane. I will never allow them to go through life dealing with what I had to deal with.

My skin was never so clear.  The only side effect I had was dry lips.  It was nothing a little Carmex couldn't heal.  I think it's a shame they took this drug off the market.  A lot of people will continue to be plagued with difficult acne because of it.  
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	Julia, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/9/2009 3:28:00 PM	I'm in my 40's now but have taken two rounds of this drug. Once in my 20's, then again in my 30's. I had what my dr. called a severe onset of adult cystic acne and very oily skin. The accutane got rid of both almost immediately. There's no way to cover up cystic acne and there's also no other way to cure it unless you use accutane. Cystic acne is NOT a result of just not keeping your face clean enough. In fact, in my case it was brought on by stress. Taking other medications or  using special soaps or creams are a COMPLETE waste of time and money. Go straight to the accutane or your acne will  only worsen. Yes, you'll have dry mouth, eyes, &amp; nose. SO WHAT!!?! Drink water, use eye drops, and get some saline spray for your nose. I wouldn't think twice about taking this.

I had severe cystic acne on my chin only. I had a lump there for 4 months is past winter. Only for my derm to try to lance it many times and nothing to come out. This drug has gotten rid of the cystic acne and also small everyday acne. The only thing I don't like about it is having to drink a bottle of water with every pill. But I guess that is minor considering to what you get when you are through.  I have felt a tiny bit irritable but nothing I cannot deal with and learn to control. I cannot wait to see the results when I am through in October.

The side effects scared us so we decided to pass. His acne only got worse the older he got and at age 19 decided to go on it. He was on the generic brand for 2 months due to insurance, it worked a little but not enough to stay so he switched to brand name. Was on that 4 months and it has cleared up dramtically. He had acne all over his back and chest and that cleared totally before his face. He was super oily so he didn't dry too much. He was very disappointed to find out he could be on it only 6 months. He has been off nearly 2 months and has just a couple here and there but for the most part he's clear. He does have some oil coming back and he is not happy about that. We go back to derm soon and he wants to see if he can go on generic brand (since brand is no longer available) and see if that will knock out the excess oil once and for all. He's had no major side effects and highly recommends this. Had we done this when he was younger then he would not have any scars. But he had to get to this place that this was or could be the only thing that would and did work. We tried every maker of acne (topicals) out there even prescription topicals and until he got rid of the excess oil from within he would still have horrible acne. No one should suffer from that. We are extremely happy and thankful that he has gotten this far!

I could not get out of bed, eat, shower and was aggressive.  I had to drop out of college.  I was a straight A student. I am now on medication for the depression and am doing fine.  I will be returning to college this fall.  You will have a clear face, but will go through hell in the process.  I am so glad they took this drug off the market so no one will have to suffer what I went through.
Hair Follicle Inflammation due to Gram-Negative Bacteria	25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5		25-34	8/5/2009 7:03:30 PM	I was prescribed this for acne, mostly due to ingrown hairs from shaving, but normal acne as well. I took two pills twice a day I think, it was the highest dosage you can take. Did it for six months, results lasted for about 3 years. It's not really meant to be a permanent change in your body, so I dont know why people complain about breaking out 5 years later...Yeah, there are side effects. Those side effects go away though if drink water ALL the time, brush your teeth, eat food when you take it, basically what the instructions say. Those people that complain about dry lips, nausea or stomach problems apparently didn't follow them verbatim. Instructions for medications are provided for YOUR safety and benefit. Don't blame the drug.Now, as for the psychological problems. I dont think I had any issues. If you realize you do though, STOP! Like I said, read the instructions and the packet YOU SIGNED. In very few instances, I think bone problems and something else were the bad physical side effects. Have you ever read the back of Tylenol? Just like accutane, this stuff can destroy your liver. Do you eat lots of candy? Sugar can make you gain weight and become obese. Side effects include heart disease and DEATH. Stop pointing out side effects that are YOUR fault. As far as I'm concerned, this was a miracle drug. If necessary, I have no qualms about taking it again.I suggest aquafor to use with your dry lips. Feels like water in the form of gel.

On the other hand, because of Accutane I suffer from sever dry mouth, chapped lips, dry eyes and dry nose. I sunburn really easily as well. My mom was on Accutane about 4 years ago and has had a wonderful outcome. Shes never had a pimple since. She also suffered the same side effects as I am, along with sever nose bleeds.

I was closer to commiting suicide BEFORE I took accutane, because my face looked so bad. I am so thankful that I took accutane and any time I have seen people in public that had the same symptoms I had. I tell them about accutane. If used properly, and correctly just as any drug, it is a WONDERFUL DRUG! Yes, your face and mouth will be dry, but I experienced no other side effects. EVERYONE around noticed a difference within 3 weeks and I feel so blessed that I got to take this medication. I am 36 now and I took the medication at 22 years of age for about 10 mos. I hope this can help others as it did myself.

I have taken Accutane twice. The last time being 5 years ago. Nothing. I STILL have horrible acne and fear that there in no hope in sight. While on Accutane for the second, I became very depressed (not suicidal), but was thoroughly hopeless, unmotivated, and extremely sad. The constant blood test were a hassle and frustrating as well. I did not have a good experience, especially knowing that the drug works so well for so many other people.

I have had super-dry eyes ever since I took Accutane about 10 years ago, and I can't even wear contacts anymore. I would NOT TAKE IT again. Especially teens - find another solution! You don't want to have to deal wiht permanent eye damage!!

I have used every topical and antibiotic acne medication that you can name. Over the years, acne has caused me alot of self esteem issues, so I was overjoyed to find out about accutane. I started my course of treatment in February of this year @ 20mg and my last doctor's visit was yesterday. I'm so happy to report that I have only 6 days of pills left (120 mg) and I'll be done!!!  Aside from the dry lips and sensitivity to sun, takin this medication was well worth it. This is a wonder drug!!  It has changed my life!!!  I remain hopeful that my new,clear skin will last and that I will not require another round of treatment.  Fingers crossed!!!!  LOL

It was the most frustrating thing to go through, but the results are worth it. My skin is so clear now and I have almost no oily skin anymore. Stick with it, it may take longer than most average people.

She was advised &quot;brand necessary&quot; by her skin physician. So today, in the conspicuous absence of national medical tort reform, Astra-Zenica after years in the tort crosshairs made the logical decision to end production. Today she would not even be able to access this med.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	19-24	7/17/2009 2:54:30 PM	I was very nervous to take this medication. All of the warnings of side effects and the monthly check ups. Despite the pain of monthly visits and online quizzes, it was TOTALLY WORTH IT!! I took the generic brand 3 times a day for 6 months. It was extremely effective, and I haven't had any major break outs ever since. I might get a pimple or two every now and then, but I can handle one or two compared to what it was before. Definitely exhaust all other options, but if topical doesn't work-this is the best oral to go with.

My skin immediately cleared up and still remains clear without ANY break outs!! Although three months after I discontinued the use of the drug I became seriously ill and taking ACcutane was the cause of my illness. So users be informed, this drug works well, but can have serious and permanent symptoms. I's still trying to recover from the sickness over a year later.

I had results within the first and second month.. then it just keeps getting better and better. The only issue that i have is very dry lips and my face gets sunburns very easily.. and thats not fun. But if you can get over the dry lips, i highly recommend this drug! It gave me alot of confindence back..
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	smiling498, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	6/25/2009 3:12:37 PM	I'm 24 and have had terrible acne for 10 years.  I just finished my 6th month of accutane treatment and the results are worth all the hassle.  My dosage was only 40mg once a day.  My acne didn't clear up immediately, it took 2 or 3 months until I started to see results.  My skin is now the clearest it's been since I was a kid and my confidence is back.  The monthly doctor's appts and ipledge program were inconvient, but tolerable.  I was very scared about going on accutane, but my dry skin was manageable with lots of lotion (cetaphil) and lots of chapstick.  My lips would completely peel almost daily for 3-4 months, so always keep chapstick with you.  I switched makeup to a tinted moisturizer and used concealer on the dark spots.  I used a moisturizing body wash and put lotion on my entire body every single day, otherwise it was very dry.  I also made sure to drink lots and lots of water day and night to keep myself (and attempt to keep my skin) hydrated.  Deppression does run in my family and I didn't notice any changes or serious mood swings while on the medicine. But definately be aware of yourself and let you family know to keep an eye on your personality for any such changes.  This treatment is not for everyone and I tried everything out there before being put on it.  I discussed the medication thoroughly with my dermatologist before starting treatment.  Also, you will burn much faster if you stay out in the sun.  Either avoid the sun during the summer months or use high spf sunscreen and reapply often.  That worked for me.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	sensitive, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	6/25/2009 3:05:06 PM	I had three courses of Accutane about 10-15yrs ago.  The first course was very effective and it really cleared my skin. However, after a while acne came back and I was put on two additional courses.  During the third course, I felt very sick and I couldn't quite finish the treatment.  After I stopped, I noticed unknown rash on my face and arms.  More importantly, my hair was getting thinner and falling off.  I had a lot of hair to begin with, so it didn't make me to go bald, but it did a lot of damage to my apprearance.  I got hair transplant on the front of my head, and I deeply believe; although some doctors might say it has nothing to do with accutane, my hair loss was due to accutane.  If I can go back I think I would've stopped at one course of accutane and use topical treatments afterwards.

It seemed to work at first but by the 6th month I still had alot of acne and the side effects where starting to outweigh the results. In the end, still had moderate acne, currently pursuing another form of treatment. Keeping in mind that I may have been to young to take Accutane.

But about four years after ending this medication I became very sick. I went to the doctor's and they always told me that I had GERD. But after switching Doctor's 5 times I found one who cared. She immediately checked my liver enzymes when she heard that I had taken this medication. We soon found out that many of two of my liver enzymes were elevated and I was diagnosed with a fatty liver. Be careful when taking this medication. Keep good contact with your doctor, and get blood tests regularly.

The side effects include dry lips (use aquaphor) and I did experience some joint pain, but it wasn't anything unbearable, and 1 mo. after finishing the medication I feel and look Great.  I've been off the medicine for 3 mos. now and my face is still very clear.  The only issue is the whole iPledge process (only women)Must complete test questions before getting prescription filled.  It's a very expensive process, every mo. have to go to the Dr. to get the prescription (NO REFILL), but well worth it.  I wish I would have learned of this drug earlier; before spending hundreds of dollars on OTC products and ProActiv.    Good luck to anyone considering taking this drug, it is NOT for everyone, but nothing is.  I wanted to share my experience in hopes it will help someone make the decision whether or not to use this product.

I tried accutane after trying everything under the sun and this medicine has truly changed my life.  I thought I always had to tan to look pretty, but now I'm pale and my skin is flawless.  It even corrected some of the scars.  It's a tough process as it gave me dry cracked lips, peeling skin and even rashes on my arms and legs, but right now i'm about to get off of it and there's not a single blemish on my entire face.  If you've tried everything and you can't remember the last time you felt beautiful &amp; confident, try accutane, it's worth the painful process, seriously!!  I was blessed with this drug!!!

Regular blood tests and many contra-indications make this tough to stick with.  I had to stop after 5 months because my triglycerides went through the roof.  It does work however.  You had better have very good insurance because the cost of treatment is between $400-$500 per month.

Accutane is the drug for you. I suffered from moderate/sever acne and Accutane was awesome! It was hell while I was on it, you get very dry skin and lips, and if you're a woman you have to get blood work done and take an on-line test once a month. It's alot of work but it is totally worth it. After being on Accutane for 7 months, my skin is the clearest it's ever been. I never get one single pimple! EVER! I would not recomend Accutane for sexually active women, because it's very dangerous for unborn children.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	1	5	Female	25-34	6/2/2009 7:31:41 PM	I tried umpteen different types of prescription medications for my acne for 10 years before finally being prescribed Sotret, another form of isotretinoin.  I ended up taking a course for over 7 months, during which my eczema flared up horribly and I had severely chapped lips and dry nostrils.  Nevertheless, it worked amazingly and I have remained blemish free for months now.  For those taking isotretinoin, I recommend Dr. Dan's lip balm which has cortisone in it.  Also, be aware that there are several different forms of isotretinoin of varying effectiveness.  Make sure to be prescribed one of the effective forms, Accutane, Sotret and Claravis.

Although it was effective in treating acne, I just found out that my blephoritis and severe dry eyes I developed after taking accutane was from the drug. I was looking into lasik surgery and can't get it due to the accutane. And, do not get Lasik surgery if you took accutane. Long lasting damage to my eyes I never even knew about. Be careful!

Today, I have 80- 90% fewer lesions compared to a month ago when I looked like I had severe chicken pox. I had dry skin from Day 5-8, until I found a good moisturizer.  My body also ached severely during that same 3-day period, possibly from favism.  Now, I feel better than ever.  BEFORE accutane, I was depressed with frequent nosebleeds, dry-runny eyes, ear infections, etc. but NOT DURING. My abnormal skin-health problems may be due to G6PD enzyme deficiency (favism), an inherited blood trait in 400 million people. It can provide immunity against malaria, but produces severe anemia and rashes to tetracycline, beans, synthetic vitamins, tonic water, falafel, etc.--things that should clear the skin. I've read about accutane working on red blood cell oxidative stress, a problem in G6PD sufferers. This may explain my speedy results.   NO DOCTOR HAS EVER MENTIONED G6PD TO ME, NOR DO THEY PICK UP ON ITS SYMPTOMS IN RELATION TO ALLERGIES AND ACNE. I HAD TO ASK MY DOCTOR FOR THE BLOOD TEST, WHO LOOKED IT UP IN 3 BOOKS, AND ON THE INTERNET. I WAS BORN WITH THIS, BUT JUST FOUND OUT LAST WEEK!  10-20% OF BLACK MEN HAVE IT.For me, malarone works better than accutane.  This is a malaria prophylaxis I took when I lived in the tropics.  It's safe, but expensive ($2-5 a pill).  When it runs out, I break out again-- likely from the triggers I mentioned.  For years, strangers lectured me on my diet, but now I know that vitamins, soya, beans, preservatives, antibiotics, etc. destroy my red blood cells. I lived by the rumors of veganism, only to find myself anemically inflamed. Oddly enough, chocolate and red meat are great for my skin and blood.   I think many of us long-term, severe acne sufferers have simple, diagnosable enzyme deficiencies. Most doctors are ignorant of this. Thank God for hematology!

I have a rare skin disease that is hereditary from my biological father. I tryed creams,ointmens,etc for almost 10 years and it helped some but 2 years ago it go so painful that I couldnt bare the pain any more. I knew about accutane a long time before I started to use it but was concerned with the side effects. It was the best decision I made and would not change it for any thing. It has made a tramendous difference in my life. The only thing I would suggest if you are wanting to try this drug. Make sure you go over all the facts and are willing to go through all of the process.

I had really bad skin and had tried everything including pro-activ that did nothing. It has been over 2 years now and i am going on my 2nd cycle of accutane. However, my acne is less severe than the 1st time around. I am hoping that this is the last time i have to use it. The main side effect that i had to deal with is major dry/chapped lips that hurt.

It completely cleared up my skin, and I had severe whiteheads, blackheads, and some cysts with scarring on my cheeks and back. I am in my 3rd month of treatment. I'm having nosebleeds and the chapped lips are ridiculous. But the main side effect is horrible irritability because I have bipolar disorder also. And the ipledge pregnancy prevention system is such a hassle I have considered stopping the drug but I want clear skin so bad I keep telling myself it's almost over and hopefully I won't have to endure another 5 month cycle. And after 22 years of battling severe acne, doing every possible med available (sometimes 4 meds at once), I'm apparently willing to do anything.   
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	4/21/2009 4:44:24 PM	It has been just about 1 year since I have completed the Accutane regimin. I do get occasional breakouts but it's nothing compared to my acne pre-treatment, and admittedly, I don't take the best care of my skin (sometimes falling alseep with makeup on, etc.). I do find that I have to use a moisturizer every day, or my skin feels dry and tight, but daily moisturizing with SPF is also a precaution for wrinkles later in life, so I have no qualms with that. I also find that the breakouts I do still get tend to last longer and even once they're gone, they leave a little discoloration for a while. Despite all this, I am 100% happy that I went through with the regimin and wish I had done it years ago when I first became aware of Accutane. I urge anyone who has given up hope with other treatments to discuss Accutane with their dermatologist and to do it sooner rather than later!

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	t75kab1, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/6/2009 8:26:38 PM	I had severe nodular acne in my teen years, and I am a woman.  It was devastating.  I tried everything, nothing worked.  Believe it or not, I did get married.  After our second son was born, I had a tubal so I could not get pregnant (one of the severe effects of Accutane,) and started Accutane.  It was a miracle for me!  I have had 3 treatment with Accutane, and my biggest side effect has been night blindness, which I have to this day.  However, this is a small price to pay for having truly clear skin.  I never thought my skin could be this clear.  I love it!

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	3/22/2009 7:19:02 PM	I took Accutane when it first came out and I was 13.  I have horrible, huge purple acne over most of my face.  I started Accutane and be the end of treatment my skin was clear.  I still had minor breakouts, but never the painful ugly cysts.  About 5 years ago at age 34 the cysts returned.  They were not nearly as bad as in the past, but very painful.  I did the antibiotic route with limited results.  I started my second course of Accutane 3 weeks ago.  At age 39, the side effects of serverly dry skin, nosebleeds, dry eyes have come on much more quickly than at age 13.  I have notice clearing of my skin already, but the side effects are not worth it for me at this time.  If I were much youger and single I would deal with it and continue.  But, as a mom of a very young child who loves to be outside all day, it's just not worth it to me right now.
Other	Buny71, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	3/15/2009 2:49:22 PM	I was prescribed this medication at age 25 for severely oily skin and occasionally painful breakouts.  After one 5 month tx, my skin was perfect!  I'm now 38 years old and my skin is still perfect!  The dryness went away after taking the course and so did the other side effects, such as heel pain, joint pain, dry mouth/lips/skin, and other minor problems.  Well worth the risk to me!
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	3/10/2009 3:14:11 PM	Accutane worked wonders for my skin. I battled acne from the age of 13, tried every topical and antibiotic out there, and didn't find relief until accutane at age 25. After the treatment, my skin looked amazing and friends and coworkers even commented on how clear my skin was not knowing what I had done. What my doctors didn't mention is that for women, you must remain on a prescribed topical treatment during your course of accutane and forever thereafter until menopause because of our hormones and sebum production. If you don't adequately keep your pores clean after completing accutane, your problems will come back. Unfortunately, I wasn't put on any sort of plan other than using Neutrogena face wash and my acne returned at age 27, now 28. I am taking the generic Sotret this time around and hope it works as well as accutane because it is significantly less expensive. This time, I will stay on prescribed topicals throughout and after treatment and would advise any other women to do the same so that you don't have to repeat the process. As you know, ipledge does not make it easy for women to get treatment, and in fact, is an unfortunate deterrent in my opinion. One last tip - Aquaphor is the best ointment I found for dryness. You can use it on your lips, skin, and even inside your nose to prevent nosebleeds. A thick coating left on over a night or two heals skin like a charm. And I always keep some in my purse to reapply during the day.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	19-24	2/25/2009 11:15:19 AM	I have been on this drug for three months and so far have been satisfied with the results. I heard all the horror stories going into it, and must admit I was a bit nervous, but I was sick of living with pre-teen skin at 20-years-old. The worse part has been the hassle of getting blood tests every month. My acne is not completely gone, but it is greatly improved. I'm looking forward to this summer and being able to wear a bathing suit and not feel self-conscious about the acne on my back, arms, and shoulders. As far as side effects go, I've have dry lips and chapped hands and dry patches on my arms and back. My nose peels sometimes. My nose and gums bleed at times as well. Over all, the results have been well worth the minor side-effects.

Each treatment session has seen a dramatic improvement in my skin and I am hoping that this will be my last.  I have found that as a long-term side effect, I have very delecate skin (where I will scratch or lose chunks of skin very easily) and I am sensitive to Vitamin A on a regular basis, like in daily vitamins.  I found a multivitamin called B to Zinc (www.BtoZinc.com) that does not contain Vitamin A and I am wondering if anyone else has noticed these same side effects.Lila

At 33 years old, dealing with acne since I was pre-teen, I never had any relief.  I had been through several doctors and several creams.  All the creams just made my skin dry, flaky, and irritated.  Finally, last year, I decided to go to a new doctor.  Accutane was brought up for the first time.  Despite the red-tape you have to go through to get the drug (monthly labs, monthly visits, and the IPledge Program, it was SO worth it. My skin is completely clear, and I am finally happy with my skin.  I encourage people to try it if they have already tried all the creams and have had no success.  It was a dream come true for me.

I'm now 28 and my skin looks good with very minimal breakouts from time to time.  That being said I did experience a multitude of side effects.  I had the severe dry skin.  I remember feeling like I was pasting the skin of my forearms on with contant moisturizing.  I would coat my face with vaseline before bed.  I had very dry lips and nosebleeds.  The worst part though is that looking back I'm becoming more and more convinced that it contributed heavily to me developing deppression.  I cried a lot but I was able to hide it mostly.  I remember one night in particular that I was crying in the bathroom while having a severe nosebleed.  My moods were up and down constantly.  After high school I just thought that maybe I had a really bad bout of teenager problems but now I'm not so sure.  I started drinking pretty heavily in high school but I was very skilled at hiding it from my parents.  I continued to drink heavily in college.  It wasn't until a few years ago in grad school that a doctor recognized my depression.  Since then I've been on a couple of anti-depressants.  I have felt a huge improvement but I still struggle some.  My alcohol use has finally decreased to an occasional social drink or two.  This medication obviously affects people differently.  Be careful if you decide to take it.  Surround yourself with people who know the possible side effects to help you recognize them.  I have still achieved a lot in my life including soon finishing a PhD but the depression really knocked me down in different periods of my life.  I'm still to this day trying to sort out my emotions and mood problems.  I am now thankful that I didn't reach the point of suicide in high school.  Use caution!

I am now 30 years old. I have tried it all and was told by my Dermatologist Accutane was the way to go. I was very skeptical in trying this drug, but I thought &quot;I'm young, healthy and done having children, let's try it.&quot; It worked very well for the first month, but when I first had my liver function tests drawn, they were high, so high in fact, I was taken off and referred to a Gastroenterologist. It has been 9 months now and my liver enzymes remain elevated and now I'm having to have a liver biopsy. This drug may have caused me to have very serious health problems. Please think long and hard before trying this medication. It could cause lifelong hardships!!!

Other	Lauren1276, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	1/15/2009 1:16:58 AM	I've been on Accutane for just over five months with only a few weeks left. I've loved the results so far, although for females the blood tests are a hassle (but necessary). The results have been amazing, but I've recently started experiencing intense mood swings. Someone who posted a while back seemed to think that people who reported mood swings were imagining them, but they're for real - they're listed as a side effect in the literature, after all. Be careful while you're on it. Like many others who have posted, I also feel the results are amazing.. but for others there can be a huge price to pay. Aside from the mood swings (the only side effect that has really concerned me thus far), the other ones I've experienced include the dry patches on the arms (my dermatologist prescribed a cream for it), dry nose, chapped lips back pain and joint/muscle pain/stiffness. Use with caution and may you have great results.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	1/14/2009 4:17:01 PM	I suffered from acne all my life.  I tried EVERYTHING.  My dermatologist covered all of the side effects with me multiple times.  I read through the binder to make sure I knew what to expect.  I had side effects - dry skin, tiredness, very minor hair loss, sun sensitivity.  It was all worth it.  I finished my treatment three months ago and I am still blemish free.  I wish I would have tried this stuff years ago.  I think each person reacts differently but my experience has been great.  I would recommend this to any of my friends.  A couple of my friends before me had taken and they are equally happy with their results.If you're looking at this option, don't let the scary comments fool you - talk to your doctor to see what they think.  If they don't cover all the side effects with you, I'd find a new DR.  If you follow the instructions, are completely honest with your DR, and do what you're told, I think this is a great product!

But then developed severe joint and muscle pain.  Awaiting blood test results to see if had muscle cell death-I think.  Also can't wear her contacts due to severe dry eyes (eye doc's orders).  We went into this with our eyes open to possible side effects.  It was making her face drier and better -the blemishes were just red marks.  She had tried other treatments for 2-3 years with no results.  She did not have cystic acne just moderate acne and she looked beautiful to me but I hated to see her feel bad.  But I am concerned now about side effects.

My dermatologist did not give me any warnings, he merely switched me from minocycline to accutane after testing my blood. The IPledge system should be abolished and this toxic drug should be removed by the FDA. As a patient with pre-existing Sjogrin's Disease, this was the worst thing to ever happen to me. Please do not go on this nightmare trip unless you feel good skin is better than long term health. I now suffer from increased joint pain,fatigue, hair loss and almost constant nausea. If something seems to good to be true and is hailed as a &quot;miracle&quot;; look very closely at it. I only hope this saves others the suffering I've been put through.

It is the ONLY thing that works for those of us who have had bad acne for a long time that doesn't ago away after we've tried virtually every cream and antibiotic. It has changed my life forever, bringing happiness and confidence that will last a lifetime. The five to six months I was on it wasn't very enjoyable though. I had really chapped lips all the time no matter how much chapped stick I used, also my skin would be incredibly dry, especially after showering. Finally, drinking alcohol while on accutane usually results in bad experiences, such as getting drunk very very easily and getting sick quite easily also. Nevertheless, the results are incredible and in the end it's absolutely worth it because it will change your life forever like it did to me.

I took Accutane in highschool for severe acne. It was the first thing to EVER work. Side effects were harsh, bloody nose just about everyday, cracked and bleeding lips, and jaundiced eyes. All side effects went away after the completion of the medicine. It was well worth the temporary discomfort. The results were truly amazing, and have lasted to this day (I am now 33). I would not hesitate to give this to my daughter if she is unfortunate enough to suffer from sever acne.

It was really bad acne on my back and neck and I am happy to have taken it.I also have had 2 perfectly healthy children years later. I have drier skin than I expected and could mention depression/anxiety but it runs in my family- can't really blame it on this experience. Always had bad eyesight and it didn't get worse after this med. Now 44 years old and no diabetes or suicidal thoughts...seems as if people react to this med very individually with males more prone to suicidal thoughts than females. Overall, this med gave me back my confidence and no worries about skin breakouts ever since and that has been worth it.Just read everything about the drug and interactions and side effects and be ready to recognize them as from the drug possibly if and when you see them. Drink tons of water and eat fish and nuts for natural oils to help yourself and stay out of the sun while on this-I was VERY sensitive during treatment. Good luck and just be a smart, well-informed, careful patient.

Accutane has been a miracle drug for me. My acne has prevented me from doing alot of things due to being very self-conscious about my skin. I am in my third month of treatment and I love the results. I still get an occasional pimple on my back especially during &quot;that time of month&quot; but other than that I love the results. Before Accutane, my skin would look like an oil slick by noon, now it stays dry all day long and my makeup stays where I put it (no more creased eye shadow or make up rubs on my clothes or phone). The only side effects I have had is dry lips and nose. I have also had some problem with joint pain which I have been told will subside once I finish treatment. I feel the results are well worth putting up with the side effects I have experienced.

The side effects are difficult. I was broke out for a month only, I always had clear skin before that. My doctor put me on this medication. But, I really wander if I needed it. My skin cleared up before I actually started the medication. The side effects are hard. Mine seem to be mainly the fatigue. I never had it before now all I wanna do is sleep. The dry skin and lips like everyone. But, I dont know if I should stay on it. My skin wasnt that bad, and I dont want any long term problems from it...when I probably didnt need the med to begin with. Anywaya. prepare yourself for side effects that suck.

I just have a few questions that i hope some of you could answer for me...if you had a lot of redness prior to accutane, did it help get rid of all redness and breakouts? i am in college...will it affect my studying (mentally---i am skeptical of the mental effects linked to this drug, because my derm told me that the number of depression cases and suicides linked to this drug are the same as minocycline)...and can you consume alcohol while on this drug? and if you use a lot of chap stick, lotion and moisturizers...is the dry skin and chapped lips manageable?? were most of you able to do the same things you would do if you were not taking accutane?sorry for all the questions, i am just contemplating my decision and i want to have a full view before i decide

After the first month, I had the classic dry, chapped lips.  My nose also became dried out.  At the end of my second month, I started getting dry, white patches all over my arms.  A week or two into my fourth month I began crying constantly over nothing all the time.  I'm normally a really happy person and this was very out of character for me.  I felt depressed and sad constantly.  I became more aggressive than usual and more likely to argue with others.  The emotional mood swings and constant sadness caused my doctor to take me off the mediction at the end of my fourth month.  I've stopped taking Accutane for almost two weeks now.  My skin is still very dry, but my lips are less chapped and my nose is returning back to normal.  I'm still feeling sad most of the time and crying constantly, but it's only because Accutane stays in your system for another month after you stop taking it.  My dermatologist is confident that I'll return to normal after two or three more weeks.Most importantly though, my face, shoulders, back, and chest are clearer than ever.  It did wonders for my skin and was truely a miracle drug.

Since taking accutane he has become a differnt person.  He has been in a deep depression and not himself at all.  He is very aggressive and set off very easy.  We have to closely monitior his because of his mood swings and rage.  He constanly relates he is not himself and he is very emotional.  I would suggest to really weight out the cost of puttin a teen on this high powered drug.  I just want my bubble outgoing son back like before he started taken this stuff

My only bad experiences with this drug is the difficulty of getting it because you must get blood work and meet with your dermatologist every month in order to get your next prescription.  This was very difficult as I went to college half way through the treatment.  I somehow made it through and now my skin is amazing.

It does come with a price though: chapped lips, dry skin, sporadic bouts of depression, and some back pain(and i'm only 17!). If it's your last option, i'd say take it.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	11/13/2008 1:20:27 PM	I am 48 years old and this is my 3rd course of accutane.  I took it for cystic acne on my face about 23 years ago.  I was acne free for about 10 years.  The nodules returned to my face but there were less of them.  I went back on accutane and was acne free for another 8 years.  When nodules started appearing on my chest, I went to a dermatologist who told me I was too old to take it again (48).  Another doc put me on it and after two months, I am down to just one cyst.  I always recommend buying lip balm and keeping it in your pocket and applying it 5-6 times a day before you see signs of dry lips.  The process to get it refilled is a bit of a pain, but if it keeps it on the market, that's ok.  This is truly a wonder drug.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	11/2/2008 1:40:53 AM	I have been taking Accutane for about two months now and the difference has been amazing.  I had been on various prescription medications for acne for about 10 years.  It always controlled the acne, but Accutane is making it go away.  I can deal with chapped lips and dry skin for that!

Although it can all be taken care of with good moisturizers and lotions.  
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	Thankful, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/28/2008 9:33:33 AM	I have only been on this medicine for 3 weeks and the change in my skin is very evident. I had tried everything before this medicine and nothing worked. The only negative thing i have to say is the dry lips is hard to deal with and i go through chapstick like crazy, but other than that i have had no problem with it. I would recommend this medicine to anyone who has tried to get rid of their acne but hasnt had success. Im finally getting back to the skin i used to have.

I tried every otc and perscription gel and nothing worked. This did.I only had one of the side effects.It was the hair loss.It was very minimum. Not enough to notice,just enough to clog the drain.The blood test every month got old after a while but it was worth it.The last month I was on it my triglicerydes did elevate very little but a fish oil everyday for a month brought it back to normal. My family was very supportive of me taking this medication. It cleared up my skin and im extremely greatful that my dermatologist recomended this.

I have tried so many over the counter meds including precriptions from my doctor (topical and orally)Nothing worked:( So, I asked him if he could put me on Accutane, because I have a friend who took it and it worked wonders! Well, he gave it a go(50mg)daily for 5 months; I just finished my last dose of Accutane a month ago and I feel and look absoultely beautiful! It was rough the first 3 months with the dry skin, lips etc.,(for dry skin use Keri Lotion-original ONLY)I highly recommend(for lips use Aquaphor ointment),but overall it was well worth it. Right now I don't have not one pimple on my face. It only took 3 months before I saw real results,( skin cleared just in time for my wedding in July) so hang in there guys!!... My skin is finally flawless and my husband can't take his eyes off of me.THANK YOU ACCUTANE!!

I discovered that I have to avoid ( no more )dairy products such as milk,cheese,butter no more eating pizza, sugar, candy...no more drink Coke,Pepsi...Most people did not know about it. Otherwise, acne is coming back. I eat healthy food and drink water or orange juice now. My face is 100% clear without acne. I love pizza but I can not eat it any more.

I dont have health care, so I had to order Accutane online from India.(maybe not a good idea???) This time around im taking 30mg a day for about 2 months... Hopefully this will clear my skin again..

I would reccomend this to anyone with a severe situation although i am somewhat diasappointed that the problem has slightly returned.
Other	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	10/10/2008 4:29:34 PM	I myself am not a user of this medication, but a friend of mine was. He was a 16 year old high school junior. I say &quot;was&quot; because he is no longer with us; during his accutane treatment he committed suicide. His death was completely unexpected and all of those closest to him have a hard time coming to terms with this tragedy because he was such a carefree, freindly person. He was even a charismatic christian. This medicine no doubt caused intense mood swings, and the worst side effect of all-suicide. There is always an alternative to accutane. Before you take this medicine, remember that losing your acne is not worth losing your life.

I wish I had started Accutane much earlier because I would have saved thousands of dollars in other treatments and doctor visits.  Accutane is a miracle.  The only side effect I suffered was severely dry lips.  My dermatologist prescribed me a moisterizing lip balm and after that my one side effect was gone.  Accutane was absolutely amazing.

I was on Sotret (generic Accutane) for 6 months - 4 months at the highest dose (120 mg) for my weight (started at 40 mg).  The side effects were very uncomfortable and if I had not seen results and been determined to see the treatment through, I would have stopped taking it at 3 months.  Severe, bleeding, dry lips (used Cetaphil Mosturizing Cream on them - only thing that helped) - lower back pain - constipation - extremely thin skin that tore at the slightest abbrasion which eventually led to a bacterial skin infection - the inside of my nose was dry, cracked and bleeding (used topical steroid cream which helped) - very dry eyes (this came and went)If you take this drug, make sure you drink plenty of water.  Even if you're not thirsty - drink more water.  I am very happy with the results.  For the first time since I was 11 (now 27) I have clear skin.I recommend this drug to anyone with acne who is willing to take it as prescribed and willing to take extra good care of themselves while on this drug.  It is very powerful and has the ability to do real damage if not taken and monitored properly.The iPledge program, however 'good' it may be, is really a joke and only put in place to make the government feel better about itself.  Luckily, I have really good insurance.  My total treatment cost $45 per month ($10 drugs and $35 dr).  For the six month treatment my insurance paid $3,622.48 (only for the Sotret - not Dr. appts).  My insurance paid $2,572.69 for the doctor appts and lab work (and I saw a Derm PA - NOT Dr).Insurance total: $6,195.17 My total: $270.00Grand Total: $6,465.17 No way could I have done this without insurance...

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female		9/14/2008 10:44:21 AM	After 25 years of taking every antibiotic on the market to treat moderate acne I finally agreed to take Accutane.  The first month I was precribed Prednezone because Accutane caused such a severe increase of my acne. Avoid the use of a steroids on top of Accutane if you can as they both have pretty nasty side effects.  Four months later my skin is beautiful - the best ever.  However, the side effects are really rough.  Joint pain, rash, dry lips, dry eyes, dry everything, tiredness, and sensitivity to sun. I hope my acne is gone forever as I probably won't do this again.

I do not recomend this drug for people that want it for a vanity use like having acne. Unless the case is extremely severe, then yes. I suffered severe depression, and damage to my heart from this drug. Please consult carefully before its usage!

The first time I was on 60mg/2xday. It worked wonders for my acne, and my only bothersome side effect was dry skin. My second time though, I had very bad side effects (such as blurred vision, thinning hair, and mood changes). I went down from 60mg to 25mg, but even the dosage change didn't help my side effects. I was taken off the medication. The medication works great, and it's worth the effort to  go through the monthly process of having blood work done (and for females to make sure you are not pregnant), and keep current with the Ipledge program. 
Other	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	19-24	8/29/2008 2:53:21 AM	I took the medication, Accutane, when I was 16. The results were amazing. I had severe acne and nothing worked to clear it up. I had a 6 month treatment. They tested my liver each month in case of certain possible side effects. The drug is very effective. However I experienced severe chapped lips, to the point they would often bleed. Also, not aware of ALL the possible side effects until 4 years after the treatment I may have suffered possible psychological side effects. I would become severely irrational at times. I had bouts of depression, anger, and was very close to committing suicide mid-treatment. These I attributed to normal teenage angst, However I have not experienced these pre or post-treatment. I caution anyone considering taking the medication. Please request a list of ANY and ALL possible side effects. Talk with your primary care physician and your dermatologist. Do not make the decision lightly. I am 22 now and have perfect skin, but I'm not sure at what cost.

I did not have SEVERE acne but just really a cluster of pimples on both sides of my face. I've tried EVERY single type of acne pill medications and none had ever worked. After using Accutane for only 3 weeks i could tell my face was clearing up. All i did was wash my face with an acne removing cleanser morning and night and take the pill, THAT'S IT. Now my face has NOTHING at all on it! It looks perfect!I STRONGLY RECOMMEND ACCUTANE TO ANYONE WHO HAS PERVIOUSLY TRIED PRESCRIBED MEDICATION THAT HAS NOT WORKED!

She had very few side effects, only dry lips.  Thank you to her dermatologist!Her skin is perfectly clear!!!
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	25-34	8/13/2008 11:35:31 PM	This is a follow up to the review I wrote back July 14.  I've now started my 3rd month of treatment.  My doc has upped my dosage to 80mg.  I still haven't experienced any major (concerning) side effects.  I still have chapped lips, my face and arms are dry, I had a slight nose bleed the other day but it was because I stopped putting Vaseline in my nose before I go to bed.  Last week a rash appeared on my forearm.  My doc said this was a normal side effect (only on the arms and hands) and gave me an ointment to put on it.  Within 2 applications the rash was gone.  I'm still VERY happy with the results I've seen so far.  At the same time I look forward to completing the program, because I want clean skin plus I don't like having to take medication everyday.  I still recommend Accutane to anybody that can't get rid of their acne.

I had started to lose hope until I heard of a wonderful Doctor on the radio that knew what I had when she first looked at me. My Doctor placed me on Accutane 40mg and in two weeks my skin have never looked better. I have so much confidence when I go out and where shirts with my back out or if I wear my hair in a ponytail to the back.The only thing about the medicine is the dry lips and light headaches that went away in 2 weeks and the tiredness.

I have had acne almost all of my life (my 2nd grade pics I have pimples and I am almost 30).  This has worked far better than microdermabrasion, chem peels, antibiotics, whatever.I do have the dry lips and the bloody nose.  Also, I am very, very tired.  I am hoping to maybe shorten my treatment time and plan to talk to my derm. today.I definitely would recommend this to anyone struggling with acne.  I have had only two breakouts (when I started and when my dose went up - expected) and they were NOWHERE near what breakouts used to be.I think as long as you follow your derms instructions that this is a great drug!

Literally EVERYTHING my doctor offered me before Accutane never worked. My worst side effects was the dry skin and lips (try Dr. Dan's lip balm and Cera Ve lotion! They work wonderfully!) and my night vision when driving got pretty bad. After a month off the medication, I immediately felt the difference. I had been breaking out severely for 10 years that that point and now, if I do have any acne, it's very small and goes away in 102 days. I loved my experience because it was much more permanent than using topical things! It really changed my life in a great way!

All seems to be well.  My acne has started to clear up.  So far the side effects I've had have been chapped lips (pretty much constantly), dry and pealing skin on my face, and slight nose bleeds (not to the point where blood is flowing but where if I wipe or blow my nose its blood).  There have been no mood swings or depresion that many claim to have had.  My doc just upped my dosage to 60 MG's a day so we will see how things go.  I'll post another update in a couple weeks.  So far I would recommend this medication to  others......
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	7/14/2008 8:16:05 PM	Wow reading all these reviews actually have scared me more and I have been off of this drug for about a year+.  While taking it, i had the expected dry skin, but since that time, I never really break out and if I do, it goes away in a day or two.  I have recommended it to others, calling it a &quot;miracle drug&quot;.  I never had bad skin until around age 19-20.  It was really wierd.  Getting on accutane completely solved all my problems.  The depression that some people experience is all mental, that is, it is not really a side effect of the medication.  Overall a great drug, I just hope that these people who say it only last ten years do not know what they are talking about!

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	6/27/2008 7:52:52 PM	I just finished my first month of Accutane and have found it to be very easy.  So far, the only issue I have had are dry lips.  I don't go anywhere without my blistex (which I find to work the best).  I started with 40mg per day dose and my doctor raised the dosage today to 80mg.  I did have a huge brake out just two weeks into the treatment (as predicted)and things look like they might be starting to clear up.  I am 36 year old male and have had acne since I was a teenager and have just become sick of it.  I have tried just about everything from diet, creams, lotions, extractions, antibiotics, herbs, and you name it.....I've tried it.  Right now only after one month my face has never looked better but I do still have breakouts on my chest and back.  I am looking forward to the end when I have clear skin.  So, only very dry and peeling lips.  No, other side effects.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	35-44	6/16/2008 2:47:46 PM	I have been on Accutane for 8 months - my doctor established the correct dosage after 5 months of treatment (progressed from 20 mg per day to finally 80).  I started seeing results last month and am thrilled.  Prior to Accutane, I had tried 3 different antibiotics that never fully eliminated the acne. My skin is now completely clear - I have semi-dry lips, eyes and nasal passages, but these side effects, to me, are a small price to pay.  I had joint pain when I began the medication but that disappeared after a few weeks.  I am supposed to go off Accutane next month.  I just hope the results last and I will not need a second course of treatment.  However, if a second course is necessary, I would not hesitate to go back on this medication.  
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	6/2/2008 2:55:23 AM	Well Im at the end of my Sixth Month and it looks a 100 times better i rarely get pimples now i would recommend it to just about anyone thats if they really want to get rid of your acne the only thing to get rid of now is the scarring that my ance caused don't ever pop a pimple big mistake. And as for the side affects i didn't really have any at all just one really but well i was already kinda depressed with my life and it seriously put some thoughts in my head i never want to think again but as soon as i had something better in life to look forward to i never had another problem(Just stay happy) and you'll be fine in my book probably the best thing i ever spent my money on and one more thing you don't want to have to pay for this medicine without insurance expensive as hell but to me it was worth every penny over (250) a perscription and well anyone taking it i Hope all goes as well as mine. And Goodluck Ance SUCKS and people without will never know the hardship we go through it just looks terrible. So give it A TRY you shouldn't regret it!
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	19-24	6/2/2008 1:34:40 AM	This is my 4th month of treatment on 80mg/day. I have a rash on my legs and on my arms. I feel like i am 80 years old(im only 20) because my joints are in so much pain. Also, every time I stand up, I get a dizzy sensation, which never used to happen. I always had a bit of a temper, but my family has made me aware of my newly aquired mood swings. I believe the accutane may be on the verge of working because new acne rarely develops but the old scars and old acne are not going away yet. I believe this medication works differently for everyone since I know 5 other people who were on it and had no side effects. However, the strain it has had on my body makes me feel lethargic. I am usually very active and now i do not want to do anything because of the joint pain.

Growing up I never even had a pimple. Then I had children. Don't get me wrong I love my children more than life itself. But the acne that came along with that were not pleasing. I kept telling myself it will go away but it never did. I tried everything creams, ointments, antibiotics (never would recommend that), scrubs, etc. You name it I tried it. I ended up changing dermatologists and found one that I adore. He immediately started the accutane regiment and did warn me of the side effects that can come along with it. All in all I love the medication (being one of those people that hates to take medicine)! I have had nothing but great results! Within one month my acne was gone. I am now on my third month of treatment and wouldn't change it for anything. I have had of course the dry skin on my face, arms, and lips. I use Cetaphil cleansing bar to wash my face and CeraVe to moisturize. I also use Aquaphor for my dry lips. I was really worried after reading all of the reviews on here but the side effects I suffered from other treatments were way worse. Accutane has allowed me to have beautiful skin once again!!!

I was freshman in highschool.. I was absolutely miserable taking this medication, although now I do have flawless skin, I would reccomend this to anyone. My face used to be covered in acne, and after my accutane usage, I only get about 1 or 2 pimples each year. I'm glad I did it, even though it was hard! :)

I had tried everything imaginable to solve my acne problem. I was so ashamed of my face that I would literally try to &quot;scrub&quot; my skin off! I only used it for 6mts b/c my acne went away immediately and has been that way even now. But now after reading all of the side effects others have gone through, it may have been a mistake for me. I am only 27 and almost completely bald in the center of my head, I have constant infections, and I am almost afraid to go to the Dr again for fear that he'll find something more serious wrong with me. If you are thinking of using this drug...PLEASE way your options.
Other	erinolive, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	4/10/2008 9:28:35 AM	Growing up, I had various stages of acne that I was treated for with other drugs. When I was in my early 20's, I developed much more severe acne and I went on accutane. I really didn't have any horrible side effects that I recall, just the typical..dry skin, lips, etc. I maintained really nice skin until recently (I'm 31). I read in someone else's post that her doctor said the effects of accutane only lasts about 10 years as hers came back as well. My doctor didn't tell me that but it did reoccur about 10 years later. I'm doing the second cycle of accutane now but he has me on the low-dose cycle where I take the pills only 2x per week (and only 10mg per day). I don't know if this time will take with such a small dose. So far I've been on it for a week...and it seems to be clearing but that could just be from the placebo effect.

However, the severe thinning of my hair has been difficult to deal with; but given the 'miraculous' results of resolving my acne condition, I would take Accutane again and again, and deal with thinning hair as best I can. One other inconvenience has been regular lab blood tests (I believe to check my kidneys reaction to the drug).

It was not until the 4th month that I saw a change in my skin. Accutane worked for me and I did have the rashes on my hands, dry lips, dry skin, feeling sick sometimes, white spots on my arms. All this went away once I was off it just like my doctor had said. I used Cetaphil lotion and face wash and did not really analyze it or think about it too much and everything went okay. I would recommend this medicine, but please be very careful. I never drank or smoked when I used this medicine.

I started with it at the age of 13 or 14, and was on it for 6 months or so. but once i got off it, it returned. i started on accutane again when i was 16. it didnt do anything for a few months, and now im taking 120mg a day and still breaking out. my lips peel and are incredibly sore, my nose bleeds and is very painful. i have a horrible rash on my arms that is itchy, and when i scratch, it bleeds and i have hidious scabs all over my arms. my eyes are dry and i recently went to the eye doctor, who said the surface of my eyes are damaged from the accutane. i also have more serious side effects. im depressed, anxious, and have horrible mood swings. i used to be happy ALL the time. now i could care less, and would rather stay at home. im still on the accutane because i dont want acne. i've been on it for about 6 months now and i dont see the point in getting this far, and then stopping. that would leave me with my acne still, and i would have suffered all these horrible side effects for nothing? the side effects of accutane are HORRIBLE.i've had good results from my previous round of accutane, but my acne returned. i just want to take it long enough this time so this doesnt happen again.personally, i wouldnt do this again. i didnt want to do it a second time in the first place, but it was getting to the point where there were no other options. really try everything else you can before turning to accutane. the side effects are too bad.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3		25-34	3/23/2008 3:09:03 AM	I took this drug at age 16 and experience major depression and suicidal ideations (which was untreated as I didn't know it was from the meds), terrible cracked lips and hands, and my hair thinned. My skin cleared about 80% then at age 20 my acne had gradually returned to 60% clear. I went on it again with less hand problems, same lip problems...and depression back! I went off the meds early because I told my doc I was feeling really irritable and then described my symptoms it took me two years to restablize my mood! However, no-one ever thinks I EVER had acne...and I could have been a poster child for all the anti-biotic drugs and topicals from age 11-21!! On another note my sister had the same problem and went on the birthcontrol pill at age 15 and her skin cleared, so did mine completely when I went on the pill. Give that a try first then use Caution if you take this med!!

Prior to taking it, I suffered with severe cystic acne since I was 13.  For those lucky enough not to have this form of acne, it is painful and disfiguring. I am definitely a success story and cannot say enough about how great Accutane worked for me. The worst things I dealt with were dryness in my nostrils and cracking at the corners of my mouth, which frequent use of lip balm took care of, and having to be so careful of sun exposure. These side effects were minor, as far as I'm concerned. Unfortunately, my grown daughter also has this form of acne, which is why I am on this website doing research. Her doctor refused to prescribe Accutane and instead gave her birth control pills to help clear her skin. (Unfortunately, she experienced excessive bleeding, so she can't take the pill). As our acne seems to be genetic - my mother, sister and niece also have it, I think my daughter should change doctors until she finds one willing to prescribe it to her. By the way, my niece also took Accutane and had very good results as well.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/20/2008 10:24:14 AM	I took Accutane when I was 16 years old (I am now 31). Within a week, I saw MAJOR results--my forehead totally cleared within that first week! I did, however, start getting very bad headaches that same week. My parents called my dermatologist (who I am forever grateful to!) and he cut my dosage in half. The headaches stopped and my acne continued to disappear. Within a month, I would say that 75% of my acne was gone!! I did have the awful chapped lips, but like others, I just kept Carmex with me at all times. Fortunately, within a week of finishing my treatment, my lips started to return to normal--enough that other people started to notice that they weren't as chapped. I feel really bad for those people who have had bad luck in taking Accutane, and I feel so fortunate to have had such great results. My acne disappeared forever-except for the occasional pimple, and I have no other lasting side-effects.

The meds were till new when I took it at 14, now i know it is made more aware of the more harmful side affects.

I love my skin now, and did not experience many side effects; only slightly chapped lips. I get compliments on my skin all the time now. I would definetly recommed this drug, it really works.

Got painful, nodular, adult onset acne in my 30's after having had clear skin my entire life. Living in denial, I spent 4 years trying using the best, most expensive creams, lotions, and peels(including everyting sold on television) on my face and back with poor results. I had so-so results with dermatologist recommended facials and products, but for $175 per month + the cost of products it wasn't worth trying to keep up long term. As soon as I stopped treatment, it came back. I took the risk of compromised fertility and liver function for clear skin.  Dry eyes and lips suck, but I learned to love Carmex and saline drops (I keep tubes of each in my bag, at work, several in the car, etc.)! Regular blood pregnancy tests also sucked, BUT my self-esteem has way gone up.  I no longer shy away from photos and making eye contact with people. Definately weigh the pros and cons and if you are in relatively good health and under a trusted doctor's care, go for it! A bonus was that I decided that since taking accutane was also about my trying to be the &quot;best me&quot; that I would also eat better to help lessen negative side effects and I lost 10 lbs to boot!

Ruined eyesight, ruined skin, get infections easily. Had  20/10, 20/15 eyesight. 10 weeks into accutane, had 20/70 and 20/80. Skin has never recovered. Hands always dry, cracked. I live in band-aids. It destroyed my oil glands everywhere. Got Mononucleosis (Dr. said my immune system was compromised because of Accutane.) Acne came back.  See roaccutane survivors site.  
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	19-24	1/8/2008 8:21:04 PM	After years of topical drugs and creams combined with different Tetracycline regiments, a prescription antibiotic, I had had very little success and needed results. Although I was somewhat apprehensive, due to the effects of high doses of Vitamin A (Accutane) on one's liver, I made the decision with my dermatologist to begin a 5 month cycle (20mg in the morning and 40mg at night). Studies have shown that if you monitor your diet and avoid pills or foods rich in Vitamin A, there are no effects of Accutane (in moderate doses) on your liver. Besides, life is too short to live hiding behind your acne in a world of insecurity. Within three days I was experiencing the common side effect of dryness over my entire body. Religiously moisturizing and keeping ChapStick by your side, at all times, minimized the dryness and made it very manageable. A few days later and my acne had just about disappeared. Luckily my dermatologist had warned me of an inevitable flare-up to come. About four weeks in and sure enough I had one of the worst break-outs in years that lasted about an entire month. Starting my 3rd month I had the best skin of my life! My dermatologist made it clear that it was still necessary to finish the 5 month cycle to ensure I maintain the results. It has now been one month since my last dose of Accutane and my skin is beautiful and the side effects are completely gone. This drug saved my social life and my career and was well worth the minimal suffering...I hope this helps and good luck!

It started to do some work.. but it came back. I finally at the time went on the max which if I recall was triple dose.. Had severe dry lips , nose bleeds.. etc.After 25 yrs , I still have scars where the major acne was on my back and forehead.. but I do not have any bad , dry skin condition now , so to speak.. I recently found out this may have some long term mental side effects , but I don't think I am any crazier now then ever.. But maybe my wife has a different view.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	25-34	1/4/2008 8:30:13 PM	I took accutane for 6 months and it worked well, my acne was really bad and it cleared it up. At the end of 2007, i started noticing that my hair was falling out,didn't think to much of it but then i notice that it was not falling out it started to break off, so now i have patches of hair that is no longer than 4&quot; from the root and it is still breaking off.if i had to do this all over again i would try to find another way to get rid of the acne. So before you take accutane ask, read and ask somemore about the size effects before you start taking this medication.The doctors are not going to tell you about the hair breakage or loss so you would have to ask. Good Luck!!!

My skin was very dry while on the medication, but I have been off Accutane for seven years now and my lips are still severly dry.  It doesn't matter what I use, my lips crack and bleed to the point that sometimes I cannot smile very big for fear of the skin on my lips tearing and bleeding.  It is embarrasing and frustrating, which is the same feelings associated with problematic acne (not much of a trade off).  At the time I was in college and now looking back I think many of the emotional problems, i.e. depression and anxiety, I struggled with were directly linked to being on Accutane.

I had Accutane when I was 13 years old. Big cystic acne everywhere on my body. This pill was the best thing since sliced bread. So what I had to take oil baths and extra chapstick. I had it so bad I looked like a freak. Since taking Accutane, I have not had a break out or cysts in 26 years. I was very greatfull, and now I've had to put my son on it due to genetics of cystic acne. I didn't even have to think twice about my decision.

This medication permentantly dried my out skin that even though it's been ten years since my last dose of Accutane, my skin looks ten to twenty years older than my actual age. I use the most concentrated skin care creams I could find in order to keep my skin from cracking and it is still flakey and dry. Be very weary of this medication, the residual effects are far worse than the acne.

I was told to avoid Vitamin A while on Accutane so I had to stop my multivitamin.  Fortunately, I found ebA Multivitamin Supplement, which is a Vit A-free multivitamin that I was able to take.

I've been on it for 4 months now, and I'm thinking of stopping it as I'm concerned about my health while taking this potent drug.

Chap stick is my best friend!As far as nose bleeds I have none, but I am proactive and use vaseline inside my nostrils to keep things moist.As far as mood swings, I have been going through a divorce while taking this medication and while I am careful to be aware of my moods  I can tell you having my skin clear up has given me confidence I havn't felt in years.

My 4th grade teacher even sent me to the nurses office for chicken pox. How emberassing! Iam almost 24 now. I just started accutane 4 months ago. I read on here that a lot of people were really bothered by the side effects. The first month was the worst, super dry skin &amp; super dry lips. But for me having acne my whole life, I really didnt care about any of the side effects. All you need is a good moisturizer and a gentle face wash (I use redness relief from Eucerin). Ohh yeah and blistex or carmex. None of that fruity stuff. I have one more month of accutane to take. The last time I saw my skin this clear I was in the 3rd grade!!! I had it on my back, chest, shoulders, arms, and of course my face! I decided every day on what to wear by where, and how bad I was broken out. It was such a depresesing, and emberassing feeling. Bathing suit season was horrifying. I had to find tops to cover up my back. Anyways this is the best thing thats happened to me. I feel like a completely different person. More confident, and more free to live life how others do.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne		4	2	4			12/3/2007 4:19:40 PM	This drug is not for the faint of heart.  You must commit to taking the medication as prescribed and with fatty foods.  You will find that working out is easy enough, but the discomfort that follows is no fun at all.  I gained 10 lbs in the first 3 weeks on this medication.  Good Luck!

It is nasty, and I wish I never took it. The irrational thoughts that I had on it were very uncharacteristic of me as a person.  Your hair falls out - nose bleeds, birth defects... but no pimples, sounds superficial to me.

Hair loss was not mentioned by my Dr.  and I did not see it anywhere in the literature.  It's been 2 months since I completed the treatment and my hair is falling out by the handfuls.  All of the side effects were almost too hard, but I stuck with it until the end.  I hope that I don't end up bald and acne free.  Also, I had mood swings and joint pain.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Rosacea	 Male  (Patient) 	4	2	3	Male		11/15/2007 9:58:16 PM	This drug is effective at treating acne. No Question. Its amazing at acomplishing these ends. Period. That being said, Accutane is all about trade offs. You will have side effects. You well almost certainly have: extreme dry / fraglie skin, wickedly dry / cracked lips. This I can almost promise. Other side effects that I personally believe are attributable to my using Accutane: several ingrown toe nails, watery itchy eyes, mild nose bleeds, itchy scalp and hair shedding, muscle ache thus decresed athletic capability. Keep in mind that you may have to take more than one round of Accutane to reach the desired results. I took two, close together. I believe the benefits and side effects compound with each successive round.The bottom line. It works. I've been ance free for years since completing treatment (though my acne was not nearly as severe as most on Accutane). The side effects have also lasted to some extent. Many years later, I still have far more frigile / dry skin compared to before treatment. Scalp itch, hair loss, and very dry itchy eyes has continued. My advice... very carefully weigh the costs and benefits before treatment. There will be side effects, some will potentially be unpredicable and / or undocumented. Pay close attention to your body during treatment and communicate clearly with your doc about side effects / complications. Don't be blinded by the positives of clear skin, if the rest of your body is being subjected to huge stress / side effects. Keep in mind that some of these side effects may last and docs may not be able to do anything about it. Also, I've heard that Accutane is still effective, but with fewer side effects, if taken at a lower dose over a longer period of time (but same total dose over the course of the treatment). If concerned about side effects, you may want to ask your doc if this is true. Good luck!

Having to make time in a busy schedule for appointments and blood tests and having to wait for the resultscan be a hassle. Not to mention then having to make sure that the doctor's office has entered the infomation on the iPledge program website so you can fill the proscription.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	Satisfied Patient, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	19-24	11/15/2007 3:09:28 AM	I am beginning my 5th month in a 6th month regiment of Accutane and can't remember a time I had better skin. I did experience severe dry skin and cracked lips (Chapstick is your best friend) as well as painful bowel movements due to a dry anus.  Considering that this drug is essentially Vitamin A, I believe the psychological effects patients complain of (i.e. depression, anxiety, etc.) are purely manifested from paranoia, as experienced in the placebo effect.  
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/7/2007 7:52:19 PM	I'm 32. I took Accutane when I was 22 for nodular/cystic acne. The treatment worked for 10 years, which is what my doctor told me.  About 3 months ago, I started getting cystic acne again.  My skin was always beautiful before my early twenties and Accutane gave that back to me.  I had side effects that the doctor didn't mention such as:  severe nose bleeds every single morning; my lips broke out in a herpes like rash and once the rash healed, I had no pigmentation in my lips (I'm african-american); and I did have the decreased night vision.  All in all, it was worth it.  I go back to the dermatologist on Monday and plan to ask for the Accutane treatment again.  4-5 months of the side effects I had versus 10 years of beautiful skin - I can deal with it!

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	10/24/2007 10:35:41 PM	I took accutane seven years ago and it cleared up my acne 100%!  I NEVER get any acne on my back anymore and rarely get a small break out on my face.  Accutane was only slightly difficult to use due to the potential side effects - and the monthly testing that went along with it to monitor cholesterol and liver functions.  I do wonder if there are any undiscovered long-term negative effects...I cannot find anything on this site.

It all started for me as a child with my acne, and after my first dose of Accutane it went away. When i had my first child, it all came back (so much for the &quot;Beautiful glowing skin&quot; you are supposed to have when you are pregnant). I went on Accutane again, all was clear, and then 3 years later i was pregnant with my second child. Now while my children are blessings, they are doing a number on my face. So, with the 3rd time under my belt, i'm having no more kids, and i'm doing post-Accutane treatment (just in case). I think this will be it for me! Wish me luck!

It made me disoriented,i could not concentrate at all, it also had severe mental effects and also my mood was altered one second to the next. My sleep was non-existent! i actually had to drop all my classes in college for the semester.

Caused severe mood disorders and anxiety over appearance that was uncontrollable, also made all of my hair fall out at 21 years old. If you feel any of this early on I HIGHLY advise getting off of it its not worth the trouble in the end.

Here I am 4 1/2 yrs later and doing great.  Thank you God!  The side effects aren't pleasant (dry skin, chapped lips) but it's a small price to pay for being alive.
