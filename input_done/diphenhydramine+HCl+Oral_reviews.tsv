Chronic Trouble Sleeping	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	6/24/2012 7:03:50 AM	I decided to try this medicine to help me sleep. I took 2 capsules.  Eventually I started feeling very tired, but when I got into bed, my whole body started twitching.  This went on for many hours.  Even when I started to fall asleep, the muscle twitching in my legs kept me awake.  Maybe if I'd started with just 1 capsule, this would not have happened, but now I'm afraid to try it again.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	4	4	4	Female	55-64	5/26/2012 10:46:36 AM	Before starting this drug I would wake up in the middle of the night and could not get back to sleep, sometimes for hours.  Started taking one 25 mg caplet but made me too groggy in morning. Now take half a 25 mg caplet and works perfectly. If I need a restroom break in the middle of the night, I wake up just fine and then go right back to sleep.  The only problem that concerns me is that if I do not take the pill at night, I have a headache the next day - just like I get if I don't get my caffeine.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	3/2/2012 11:15:33 PM	I find that a 50mg softgel works great at preventing me from waking in the middle of the night.  I do feel a bit lethargic when I wake up, but that feeling only lasts for about 10 mins.  The overnight, sound sleep benefit far outweighs that small issue in the morning.

My anxiety level has been almost unbearable.  Someone suggested Bynedryl, so I've been taking diphenhydramine - like 20 a day - and it's helped somewhat.  Have been taking alot, several times a day.  Don't know what it's doing to my body, but my anxiety can get so bad I can barely function without it.

There should be warnings on the label not to take BOTH at the same time, as I also have allergies and have taken Benadryl too!  Thankfully, I only take 1/2 Benadryl pill during the night or I might've overdosed! Why are there not warnings? I also have borderline high BP, so know to take smaller doses of Benadryl. This should be reported and put on labels for Unisom and Benadryl.

IT WORKS! Concur about the dreams as I have enjoyed them!  Bad thing is, I started to ITCH.  I am allergic to Sulph Drugs and I think my body is reacting to this drug like it does to Sulpha.  Funny thing is, I scratch like crazy for awhile and then POOF...I am ASLEEP! Poor Hubby wakes up with me scratching and can't get back to sleep so I need to try something else.

I have been taking a 50mg gel capsule right before bed. I am also taking 600mg of ibuprofen for pain. It takes me a little less time to fall asleep and I basically don't wake up during the night. However, this is with only a maximum of 4hrs of sleep per night. I don't feel any side effects when it &quot;kicks in&quot; or the morning after. It is simply easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.

If I take 2 tablets I have a little more difficulty waking up in the morning.  I buy them at Walmart and use the generic Equate brand of Benadryl. It is cheap and effective.  I also like to put my IPOD Touch under my pillow with the speaker on and listen to a inspiring and encouraging podcasts like Joyce Meyers or Chip Ingram.  (My husband likes to listen his business podcasts with a monotone speaker.) It keeps my mind  off of my problems and I doze off.  My IPOD has a sleep timer, so my battery doesn't drain every night. I have also used a IPOD nano with speaker headphones. If I wake up in the the middle of the night, I put my podcast back on and I am able to go to back to sleep.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Karen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/6/2011 4:26:28 PM	I have been using this OTC medication every night for a couple of years due to menopause-related trouble sleeping.  Works better than HRT (which I tried and quit)to solve the problems of menopause, which may be largely due to sleep-deprivation.  I take 25 mg (low dose) and it works for me. It is also fine with my doctor, as I have reported my use to her at each check up.  For those who have reported negative side-effects, such as nightmares, I have found that different brands may do that. I like Tylenol Simply Sleep. No problems.  Have tried Nytol, Sleep-Eze and Walmart Exact brand and found that Nytol gave me crazy nightmares, Exact brand slight nightmare-ish disturbances and Sleep-Eze doesn't seem to work as well. BTW -- Vicks Nyquil gives me the best sleep, but has all those other unnecessary ingredients for sleep purposes. Advice is to try other brands if one gives you trouble, because the sleep you CAN get with the right one is a godsend!

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Nurse Monica, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/6/2011 9:50:22 PM	I have taken 3 capsules every night for the past 15 years and it always works for me.  I buy the &quot;Allergy Tablets&quot; at Costco, 400 tabs for $4, much better than Benadryl which is WAY more expensive and the SAME thing!  I take about 1-2 hours before bed, get in to bed, read a book or do a crossword puzzle, get sleepy and fall asleep.  This drug is not addictive (physically, mentally, maybe) and will never lose it potency, meaning you will never develop a tolerance to it, and need more for it to be effective as a result.  I'm an RN and every Dr. I tell about the 3 capsules before bed (even while pregnant) say it's not hurting me.  My suggestion to those who take Tylenol PM for the sleep aid part is to switch to Benadryl, it's the active ingredient in Tylenol PM that makes you sleep.  Tylenol IS very toxic to your liver and you should never take it unless you have to, especially for extended periods of time... and never take Tylenol if you are a heavy drinker :-)

I did sleep but was extremely &quot;out -of-it&quot; in the morning and had a terrible headache, as well as had a very extreme dry mouth. After drinking my usual cups of coffee, the side effects did go away. However, I question whether I will take the drug again.

I am the tyoe of person whom cannot just fall asleep by laying down and telling myself it's time to sleep. My active mind can keep me up for hours which affects my job performance if it occurs too often. Take 30-60 min before desired sleep time and after it kicks in I fall asleep quickly. Do not take more than 50mg because of CNS safety issues. I've noticed that some of these people are writing that they take 200-500mg of this stuff, please don't try to kill yourself. Taking 50mg on a regular basis will last a good healthy 6-8 hours of real drowziness for a normal person. This is for relaxation/mild decongestion, but I wouldn't recommend taking it during waking hours as you may find yourself to be a little out of it.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Christoff, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	13-18	1/22/2010 12:36:01 AM	Every so often I have real trouble sleeping and it takes me well over an hour to fall asleep and I may lie awake during the middle of the night. This affects my school life a lot as class starts at 7 and I may be awake until 1 or 2. I've only taken the OTC version of this drug a few times and I take half the recommended dosage (25mg is what I take) and it knocks me out pretty good and helps me sleep through the whole night. If taken too late at night however you will wake up very tired still and groggy perhaps for a few hours into the day. I give myself a good 10-12 hours.

I take between 4-6 of these on top of 4mg of Alprozolam(Xanax) and I still can't sleep. I've tried every Rx sleep med and always have to take 3-4 times the usual dose. Maybe it's just me.

I find I wake up more refreshed now after stopping but I do believe it helped to get my sleeping pattern on track.

I have, on three occasions, &quot;blacked out&quot; and have no memory of the hours between doing so and &quot;waking&quot; up. Since I've stopped taking this over-the-counter drug (50mg capsules) I've had no more black outs, but that might not be totally related to this sleep-aid. I take other meds and there might be a bad interaction with one of them. Still trying to figure it out......

I'm 87 years old &amp; have had numerous falls, many times when I have had several nights of about 3 hours sleep. Was given Ambien and ambienSR.  The slow release didn't work well for me and later I had strange reactions from ambien.  I then bought some diphenhydramine to use 2x/week.  I will thensleep around the clock.  Makes me feel 'dopey' but later in the day get much work done.  My doctor is not happy about my taking sleep meds, but not sleeping sometimes leaves me more prone to losing mybalance than taking sleeping pills.

But, do not be afraid to take this med because it does really help some, I would suggest talking to a doctor first though.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	5/2/2009 2:35:32 AM	My doctor reccommended Sominex for insomnia, and it has been excellent!  The only problem I've had is that, where a year ago I only needed to take half a dose (half of a 25 mg pill) I now have to take two pills for the same effect.  I also have to be sure to devote somewhere around 10-12 hours to sleep at night because if I only sleep for 7 hours and get up to go to work, I feel like I am in a fog.  I recently also found that this works for seasonal allergies.  A friend reccommended Benadryl, and I'm glad I checked the ingredients because otherwise I would have taken too much!  Too bad this is a sleep aid; Claritin doesn't compare at all to the seasonal allergy aid that this medicine gives.  Probably, part of the reason I sleep better with it is that my allergies are bothering me less.

THEY ALL CAN BE DANGEROUS &amp; ALL ARE ADDICTING! With that said, I would never suggest anyone taking anything for sleep for more than 3 days UNLESS under the CONSTANT (weekly) care of a seasoned sleep professional that KNOWS that all of these medications have the potential to become addictive and can be dangerous. I've literally been to over 100 doctors and have even worked in the medical field as a Medical Assistant and know 1st and 2nd hand that ALL these medications are not good for you. Period. Especially if you have an addictive personality, drink alcohol or use street drugs, use herbs or other medications (including other antihistamines), have depression or ANY type of anxiety disorder. I HIGHLY recommened to NEVER get hooked on this! It's a nightmare trying to discontinue! I've gone through withdrawal from numerous medications (including Doxylamine, Ambien &amp; Ambien CR, Lunesta, Xanax, Klonopin, ALL the SSRI Antidepressants, Effexor, Cymbalta, etc.) and must say this is no different than any of the meds I received from supposed professionals and colleagues. You WILL have withdrawal if you take this for possibly even as little as 3 days. Everyone's different so it's hard to say where each person's tolerance level stands. But please think about this: THESE MEDICATIONS CAN RUIN &amp; RULE YOUR LIFE. They have mine for years and now I say no more! It's not only destroying me physically, but spiritually, emotionally, mentally, sexually, socially and career-wise as I can't hold a job because of the panic and anxiety this garbage causes when trying to get off of it. It's also caused serious distress to a once &quot;picture perfect&quot; marriage. This not only has made me miserable and sick all the time but it has affected everyone around me in some way because I'm a whole different person and can't remember anything. Also the panic attacks are wreaking havoc on our entire family. SO YES THIS IS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE &amp; AWFUL!

I found these Simply Sleep pills and tried them out. They worked wonders for me. But i have been taking them almost every night for 7 months and now im starting to think they are having the oppisite effect on me.

This med works great and is not habit forming.  I am fine with 12.5 Mg (1/2 tab) but take it early (no later than 8:30 PM EST) and you should wake up fine with no hangover.  If you happen to be an allergic person there are added benfits but be sure to check with your MD for any drug interactions with other meds you are taking.  This same active ingredient is in all the &quot;PM&quot; products but they contain pain relievers as well which are not good for your liver on a daily basis.  The only side effect I can report is more enhanced dreams, this is probably due to better REM sleep since I could never really remember having dreams for the most part when I was younger.

I have switched to the generic simply sleep 25 mg and it works great although I do find myself sluggish in the afternoons.  I found this site because my concern is regular use of this product and what side effects it may have.  Simply put, I can't remain asleep without it.  My doctors say it won't hurt me. I may try and cut the mg's to 12.5 and see what happens.  Thanks.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Benedryl for Sleep, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	5	Male	45-54	6/12/2008 8:05:53 PM	This is one of the very few OTC drugs that works for off-label use. Just be careful! It takes 50-75mg for me to sleep well, but to get the Benadryl in doses larger than 25mg you need a Rx (same as lots of others, like Tagamet). It's also sometimes hard to find unless it's mixed with lethal tylenol, nsaids, etc. I have health problems that regular doses of that much Tylenol can cause liver failure and I couldn't believe how hard it was to find plain diphenhydramine, and some places like grocery stores charge up to $3 per pill in the box with the Ft.Knox card in it that is almost impossible to get in without breaking the pill, especially if you have fine motor prolems. But, to my point, this med is great for sleep, but try taking just 25-50mg of pure diphenhydramine without 500-1000mg Tylenol or some NSAID that you don't need!

I am bi-polar manic depressive and I cannot take ambien. Apparently Tylenol P.M. either. It caused tremors, difficulty with speech, hearing, thinking, walking, as if I had Parkinsons disease. I do not recommend it to anyone. There should be a precaution on the bottle when used in a medicine for whatever use about these side effects for taking it if you are manic, bi-polar or have high anxiety.
