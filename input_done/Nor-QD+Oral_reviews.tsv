Birth Control	Teddibee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	5/25/2012 4:22:19 PM	I've been on this medication since December 2011, so far I have had three periods. One light period in the third month, light spotting two weeks after that. Then on the sixth month I had a very heavy flow and cramps. I'm not sure if this is related but I have had cramping in my ovary area for the past two months for one week at a time. I agree, I dont like not knowing when my period will arrive and I broke out in acne on my face and back. My face is slowly clearIng with the help of prescription epiduo but my back is still covered in acne. Although I am having trouble remembering to take the pill lately. I may have to change to another BC method. I have not become pregnant. Also have not gained any weight.

If you have to take hormonal BC this is the lesser of all evils.  My doctor explained that this pill creates the hormone balance similar to when you are breast feeding, so you will crave more (probably eat more resulting in weight gain), and have mild acne.  This is a low dose pill so all in all the negative effects for me were minimal, especially when compared to other pills.  You are not necessarily supposed to get your period with this pill.  I get spotting and &quot;mini periods&quot; every 3-4 months or so. I never worry about getting pregnant because I carefully take it at the same time every day.  This is the best of hormonal BC I've used. (Ortho tricyclin, 3 yrs made me crazy, depo provera, 3 years caused severe migraines, aches, nuva ring 3 years which I also liked but I used it continuously so I wouldn't get a period otherwise migraines would knock me out for days).  Anyway, nor Q D seems to be the right balance for me and is relatively cheap even if you have to pay out of pocket.

In the beginning I had to switch from taking it in the morning to at night before I went to bed because of how it made me feel other than that though everything is good..

Light periods, rarely PMS, and I lost 5 pounds when I first started.  Other BC I was moody and gained weight.  This pill is great; however, you must take it the same time every day for the first year or you will get your period.

Other	dabellofdaball,  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2			1/31/2011 11:23:17 AM	My doctor is treating an ovarian cycst. First she tried low estrogen birth control I spotted constantly and at times I had multiple periods w/in a month. I also have PMDD which is sompunded by deoression. I've been on Nor-BE for three wks, I've gained weight. I may be reacting to the Lactose as I have watery stools now. I have not spotted since starting. I have had increased irritability but I have not been emmersed in negative thoughts like I had been before. I'm not taking any other medications so I'm attributing this mood improvement to Nor-BE. It's only been three wks so it's too early to tell what the long term effects will be.     
Birth Control	guest, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	1/16/2011 12:03:32 AM	I have been taking Nor-QD now for four months and well unlike a lot of women I haven't bled one day since I started taking it. It makes me worried and my doctor says that it's fine, it's what the drug will do. But I've gained weight, acne and well the worry of maybe never being able to get pregnant makes it all a but to much.
Birth Control	laracroft, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	11/28/2010 8:40:13 PM	I was prescirbed NOR QD. The first few months I was on it, my period came right one time. 5th month i was late a day. 6th month late a few more day.s 7th month, had my period 3 times in one month. 8th month was late. Not pregnant, took a lot of tests. It is effective, however I still don't trust it entirely so I use the pull out method. I just don't like that I never know when I will be getting my period. Ortho Tryclen lo is still the best one I ever had. I knew exactly what time and day I would have it. NORQD SUCKS!!!!!! I am switching as soon as I get put on my husbands insurance. THANK GOD!!!! Cuz if your anything like me, it sucks having to worry every freakin day if your pregnant are not because your dang birth control can't decide what day it wants ur period to start.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	11/2/2010 4:08:26 PM	When I started taking this i bled for 3 weeks straight, stopped for a week then started bleeding again when it was time for my normal period. I hadnt been told it would do that. My doctor also didnt tell me that when i staopped taking the pill it would cause extreme cramps, when i have never had cramps before, as well as unusually heavy periods that last longer than normal for up to 3 months after I stopped the pill. Luckily I only had the cramps the first month after i stopped taking it but they were worse than the contractions I had when i gave birth to my son with no epidural! It was enough to send me to the ER thinking something was seriously wrong. Betweeen those 2 things I am very unhappy with the pill and wont be useing it again.
Birth Control	laura, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	9/28/2010 10:35:18 PM	I hate this pill! I have been spotting ever since I started it. I was told that the spotting would stop after the first 3 months- as if that isnt long enough, it still hasnt stopped! Just 3 days after I started the pill, I started breaking out in acne like I did when I went through puberty! Its awful being a grown woman and looking like a preteen!! Im also often nauseated, and super cranky. 
Other	malt, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	5/13/2010 11:54:43 PM	I take BCP's due to ovarian cysts, but also suffer from severe daily headaches and migraines. Was on Norinyl and was happy with it, only having a period every 3 months. They changed the pill due to the headaches. Was put on this 5 months ago and was told I wouldn't have a period at all, but have had one every month. I don't feel this will help the cyst problem and my doctor doesn't seem to agree to change it again. I'm not happy with this product at all!

Birth Control	Lin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	1/23/2010 1:21:17 AM	I have been bleeding for 15 weeks STRAIGHT.  In 15 weeks since starting NOR QD. I have only not bled a total of 5 days.  It is HORRIBLE.  I went to the doctor after  6 weeks, but was told to give it a full 3 months for my body to adjust. I have not gotten pregnant, but to my husband's dismay, I'm going to have to result to barrier methods (or buy stock in TAMPAX, as I have gone through a 40 pack of super absorbency tampons for the last 15 weeks).
