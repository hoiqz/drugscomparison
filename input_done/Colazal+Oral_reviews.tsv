Ulcerated Colon	Toby66, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	45-54	6/11/2011 1:40:14 PM	I am having a hard time taking 9 pills daily.  Losing a lot of my hair, not sure if this is a side effect or not.  Have consulted MD, so far he has not heard of any one else with that problem.  Not sure if drug is helping yet as I have only been on it a short time and am not consistent with doseage.
Ulcerated Colon	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/3/2011 5:33:14 PM	I take this medicine 1 pill in the morning and two at night. This is a pretty low dose I have heard, but it works well. I have been on this for 7 years and I am 20 years old. I haven't had any flare ups, or bad side effects. The only ones are: I bruise easily, some insomnia, and maybe a bit of joint pain. I have recently in the past year had hair loss on the top of my scalp. This could be from stress too. It doesn't regulate the abdominal pail or frequent bowel movements when I get stressed, but that is something that I need to control by relaxing and not freaking out.

With in 5 days this medicine started working and I have had no side effects or flare ups. WONDERFUL!!!
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	55-64	3/31/2010 4:11:27 PM	This medicine worked for me and my inflammatory bowel disease. I wish I didn't have to take so many pills a day but other than that, I don't think I have had any ill effects from it. Kind of rare for me.

Colazal is the only drug where I have had extreme daytime somnolence and insomnia. Three pills three times are day are also difficult for me to remember. Other than those, this is a very effective drug.

Still loose stools and nausea is a concern, don't want to eat.  Other than that I know it will take time to get into my system.  I take 3 pills a day for colitis

I live a very busy life, as I am 22 and I go to college full time and I work full time. The medicine started working in less than 5 days and I felt relieved. However, too many pills to take in one day....remembering for me is very hard. If I do forget, I know it, because my stomach will act up the next day. Overall, very impressed with this medicine. Now if I could only remember to take it!

Unfortunately, I am now experiencing a flare-up that is not responding to large doses of prednisone. Time to try something new for me.

Used to take asacol. The only problem I have is I can't swallow the pills because of a bout of throat cancer. I have to open the pills and mix it with something. I still will stay with this med rather than going back to asacol.

It is also safe to take while pregant, I just had a perfect baby girl. I only get a headache every once in a while. The medicine, literally saved my life.

I liked that it went straight to the colon and not going through the blood stream like Asacol.  The price for me as dropped since they came out with a generic. I was paying $50 every 3 months and now im paying $10!  I thought the pharmacy had made a mistake, I have not seen a difference in effectiveness from Name brand to generic.

Gave me a slight sore throat.  I have good perscription drug coverage and this still was expensive.

Would take this along with cortisone enimas to get into remission. However, after latest flreup two years ago have been on 8 pills/day &amp; one enima a week.  Colonoscopy says my colon is normal - amazing.
