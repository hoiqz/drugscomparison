Weight gain, swollen feet and fatigue. Felt much better when I wasn't taking it, lost weight and good energy, but my numbers were high out of control.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Marmot1, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	8/9/2011 2:16:54 PM	This was a terrible drug and I regret allowing my Dr. to switch me from Metformin (which worked extremely well for me)to ActoplusMet 15/500.  1.)It did NOT control my blood sugar nearly as well as Metformin and my A1c number crept up gradually over the 4 years I was on it, from 5.6 to 6.9.2.) I gained over 35 pounds in spite of consistent exercise and a pretty darn good dietary regimen.3.) I began to be suspicious of the early signs of congestive heart failure and possible coronary artery disease which was confirmed by a recent stress EKG and subsequent angiogram.  These problems all took place in spite of good cholesterol numbers in the 135 - 145 range and LDL numbers below 70. I insisted my doctor take me off Actoplus and went back to plain Metformin about 7 months ago and since then have dropped almost 25 pounds. I'm also seeing huge improvements in my blood glucose readings.  I am absolutely convinced that I got off Actoplus in the nick of time to avoid needing full-blown open heart surgery (at least for now) and am attempting to deal with the CAD with aggressive heart medications, continued exercise and diet ... we'll see over the next year whether or not this works.  Unfotunately there's no way to prove one way or the other that Actoplus is the culprit with resect to the heart issues, but I'm a student of my own body and I'm thoroughly convinced it's the primary cause. The added fact that it did a terrible job controlling my blood sugar, which was the sole reason for taking it in the first place makes it a failed experiment as far as I'm concerned.  It may work for others but it was a disaster for me.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	7/8/2010 9:04:51 PM	Im a newly diagnosed diabetic and started taking Actoplus for 1 month now. This has brought my levels down. Lowest reading 77, highest reading 202. Taking 15/500 2X daily. I do exercise on treadmil at least 30 min a day and eat less than 50 carbs a meal and less than 20 carb a snack, never exceeding 200 carbs a day.  This has worked tremendously and I feel 100 times better. I also take CoQ10, Red yeast rice &amp; Omega3's for my cholesterol as well as vitamin B's.  Had to make a life style change to save it! Hoping my next A1C reading will take me off these.

I've been reading all the reviews with diarrhea issue but I haven't had any of that. The only minor complaint would be the size of the pill and some dry coughing occurs -but could be contributed by the Lisinopril I'm taking also. No weight gain but I'm trying.

Once I hit the &quot;normal&quot; range of 90 - 123, I need to sleep for at least 15 minutes. And my back hurts, just like if I have drank too much sweet tea. This morning I forgot to take the meds, and when I checked my sugar at 12:30 it was 306. I have concerns about it being therapeutic after three weeks and my sugar still running 306 after the normal(for the past couple of weeks) being around 170. I also have experienced sick to my stomach feeling late at night, to the point that I have to take something for the sickness.

In the first 6 weeks my A1C level went from 12.5 to 9.2. I do have stomach pain and loss of appetite but if I take with food it is not so bad. I have lost about 10-15 lbs. I don't eat as much food due to nausea and the sweets have been cut back alot. I also have diarrhea most days and usually its about 1 hour or less after eating. Overall if it is helping with my sugar than I don't want to change it. Before the med sugars were in 400's now they are in the normal range.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus		3	3	3			3/28/2008 3:30:12 PM	I was recently diagnosed with type 2 and have been taking Actoplus Met (15/850) twice daily for 1 1/2 months. When I was first diagnosed, my glucose levels were over 500. My levels seem to be a little too low now(lowest 52 - highest 101)... And this is while I am eating pretty much anything I want (minus high sugar foods - soda, candies, Koolaid...). I asked my doctor if this was normal and he told me he has me on this medication so I can gain more weight. My dietitian said I might be type 1...but I thought type 1 could only take insulin shots. Actoplus Met seems to work fine on my glucose levels...I think I just need a lower dosage.
