Severe Low Platelet Count in Unresponsive Chronic ITP	BruiseFree, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	9/25/2012 10:44:39 AM	ITP for 62 yrs (diagnosed age 2); all previous therapy results, if effective at all, was short-lived (splenectomy, steroids, immune globulin, transfusions). Counts ranged from 9k - 32k prior to Promacta.Taking Promacta for 3 yrs. First time in my life that I'm not covered with painful bruises &amp; petechiae! Counts stabilized @ 150k, started weaning, now down to 50mg once a week. Attempts to stop it results in severe drop (9k).Only inconvenience is working around dietary restriction. (Once a week? Please!) Once in awhile I have muscle pain the day after dose, but it's not intolerable.Cost is high, but beats alternatives (incl. Hep C therapy from blood transfusions, which is brutal). Insurance does cover for me. If cost an issue, perhaps you should contact drug company to see if help is available. If insurance is griping, remind them of the cost for hospitalizations, blood transfusions, etc. After all, Promacta is less expensive in the long run...Good luck &amp; may all with ITP be blessed! Keep up the faith &amp; good attitude - you can live with this!Side Note for Hep C sufferers: Promacta CAN help you get through course of therapy with Pegasys, I'm living proof!
Low Platelet Count and Bleeding from Immune Response	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	8/8/2012 3:37:41 PM	I have been on Promacta for a while. Although it has helped, my biggest complaint is the cost of Promacta. And I am sure that I am not alone in this. When I was at my doctor's office I shared what I was going through financially. My doctor gave me a prescription discount card. When i redeemed it at the pharmacy, I was very happy with the amount of money it saved me.

It's been my 'silver bullet' against chronic ITP. I highly recommend trying it if nothing else is working for you...of course, you should consult with your hematologist and be aware of all side effects before doing so. I have had no side effects thus far, and it's been since April 2009. (8/18/2011)

I'm getting better but the doctor doesn't think it's related to promacta.  It's clearly disclosed as a possible side effect.

Don't chew the pills. take it early in the morning and use coffee or tes to take it with it goes down easier that way
