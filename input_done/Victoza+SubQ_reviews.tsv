Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Pagraig, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	3	4	Male	55-64	7/31/2012 1:32:39 PM	Have been on Victoza for a little over 30 days. statrted with 0.6mg and went to 1.2 after using up 1st pen. have just started 3rd pen (1.2mg) and only side-effects are some vertigo and mild constipation. not certain if either are related to increased dosage, but suspect the vertigo may be as my sugar has dropped from an average of 170+ to 123 for the past 30 days. I am impressed with the quick return to more normal sugar and have labs coming up in 2 weeks so will be interested in seeing what A1C will be. also take 1mg of Glimmepride after 1st meal. I hope the vertigo will pass but will discuss with Doctor after labs.

I was nauseated and wretched, I kept having to cry, and had insomnia. There is a light at the end of the 2week tunnel!It really does curb your appetite. It does this by slowing down your stomach so you feel full on a quarter of a NY bagel. I was finally able to eat just 3 small saucer sized meals. I had always tried to cut down portion size before, but couldn't because i would get hungry. Not now! Drink plenty of water in little sips all day.I dropped to 1dose of lantus at night and totally cut out humolog fast acting insulin. Still take 2000 mgs metformin but was switched to the time released kind today. My numbers went from the 200's to 120 first thing in the morning and 135 2 hours after dinner. I've lost 15lbs now and i'm in my third week. I have added 2 pieces of fruit in between meals if i feel like it and a 1 inch piece of cake or pie with my evening tea@ 11pm.I can live with this as I keep loosing. I will write again to report my progress.

I have developed a strange red rash on my left forearm it doesn't itch, I am not sure what this is.

The shot was easy and painless. But the side effects were terrible. I had severe migrain headaches and stomach pain. I took victoza for some time and then just could not tolerate it anymore. Every person is different though. My husband takes this shot and has no problems at all. He feels better and glad that he started it. So try it and stick with it for a time and then decide if it is right for you. Each person reacts differently to medications. As Christians we thank God for Dr.s and medications. We also know that God heals miraculously when He chooses too. What is most important is that we receive salvation Romans 10:9-10. (www.intouch.org)

I tried 3-5 different kinds and none worked. Finally my doctor prescribed Victoza and the first day they dropped from 250+ average to 175! i used .6 for a week and stayed at 200. I then went up to 1.2 dose and sugars are staying in 160 range after few days! My glucose numbers also used to jump all over the place but now are stabling out. I have had queasy stomach but after about 1/2 hr or so it settles down and seems to calm as my system adjusts. I have only been on it a couple weeks.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Mad Martha, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female		5/5/2012 8:29:29 PM	Hi, I started taking this medication about a two weeks ago. It's been one of the WORST treatments I have ever been on. I was vomiting all day long and severe stomach cramps. I went off the medication last Saturday and on Tuesday I had to be taken to the emergency room. I was hospitalized for almost a week, the doctor diagnosed me with severe vertigo and am awaiting to be evaluated by an ear specialist this Monday. My doctors believe this to be a possible side effect from using Victoza. I know for sure I will never take this medication again nor will I endorse it's use. For me it's been a horrible experience.

I had severe upset stomach, severe head aches, severe indigestion, severe low BS. I also had some minor itching. I lost 11 lbs in 1 week 2 days, but that was bc I could not eat. My BS would not stablize, so I am now trying Symlin and hoping for good results. This medicine would be good if it didn't have so many unruly side effects.

I started to use this instead of Symlin, and and it works 500% better at not causing my sugar to spike after meals.  I have also been able to decrease the amount of insulin I take by about half, and I've only been on it for a little less than a month.  The problem - it's not appoved for the treatment of type 1 diabetes so my insurance won't pay for it!!!!  Once I use up the sample I got from my doc's office, I'm out of luck:(

I couldnt continue it was to expensive with my other medications.  But my glucose level went back up again and I have started taking it again, the price is now $45.00 a month, half the price on my copay, and it is working with half the dose.  I'm happy with the results so far.  But thinking of having some type of weight loss surgery.  Lap Band? ? ? ?  Have to research it some more.

It helped me alot, lost the need to eat all the time. Lost the cravings for sugar most of the time. Yes, they're side effectts too this like most drugs out there. I figured I would give myself 30 days and all negative side effects are gone. This is definately worth it, just had to rough it out for the first 2 weeks. By the way, lost  20 lbs !( with diet and gym 5x a week ).

I gradually went from .6-1.8.  I had a really tough week or so with the dizziness, headache, heaviness on my chest and TERRIBLE ITCHING!  I'm soooo delighted that others talked about the itching.  The last few days I have noticed I'm having TERRIBLE abdominal and back pain under my ribs.  I had my gallbladder out in Nov 2011, so I think it's pancreatitis.  I see the doctore this afternoon.  I do like what Victoza is doing to my numbers, both AM fasting and during the day, much, much lower.  I have almost no appetite and I have lost 10 lbs. in such a short period of time.  I also take 2000 mg Metformin at dinner.  Not sure what the DR. will say today.  Sometimes you have to wonder if the doctors want the numbers going down at the expense of the patient.

I had major problems with itching, shortness of breath, heaviness in my chest, bloating - it was strange because I am not a sick person nor do I have extreme reactions to medications.  The fact that I did to this one - who knows - but I did and that has made me reluctant to take other meds that are injectible.  Try it on for yourself - if it works great! if not watch you symptoms!!

It is easy to administer to yourself and even if you don't like needles it is better that pricking your finger (less pain).  I have been having indigestion since I have been taking this medicine.

Tried all sorts of medications and this one has been the easiest and best so far.  Concerned about the thyroid cancer, but will be vigilant.  Did not like needles, but I do it on the side of my stomach and can not even feel it, unlike the finger testing.  I have also recently lost my gall bladder and have developed a candida yeast infection which has also messed up my stomach.  I was on massive amounts of anti biotics and am not sure if victoza played a role in that or not.  Trying to get my stomach balanced.  Have lost 25 pounds, but that was as much contributed to almost dying from the gall bladder and not being able to eat for two months.  Blood sugars and A1c have been GREAT since starting this.  I also take metformin (1000mg's) twice a day.  Have had to go on and off metformin due to some of the testing and the surgeries I have had, which seems to increase numbers.  Together, victoza and metformin seem to work very, very well even without major improvements in my diet.  Dont give up on the victoza/metformin.  Try tweaking things a bit until you feel better.  Good luck!

Poking your finger is more painful by far, this is EASY. I love the small needle and it's easy to use, does not require much to inject the medicine. For the first time since I've been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, my sugar levels have dropped to normal levels and I am losing weight finally.

My sugar stays in control which it never has before. I have gastro problems with eggy burbs and then usually throw up and then everything is fine for a while.  The dosage I am taking is .6 + 4 clicks. I have tryed to go to 1.2 but the above gastro gets worse.  If I don't over eat, I don't think I would have a problem but occasionally I do.  I have reduced my other diabetic meds too.  This is great, had to buy some new cloths though.

My blood sugars are controlled for the first time in about 10 years!!  I did have quite a bit of nausea at first and definitely had &quot;eggy&quot; burps that I've read others have experienced as well.  The nausea got better once I changed my injection to the morning rather than night.  And I've noticed that if I'm disciplined about taking it at the same time each day, then the nausea doesn't seem to come.  I lost 50 lbs within the first 6 months and have stayed fairly steady since then (hoping for more :) ).

I'm constantly on-the-go, so I don't always have all the time I need for &quot;me&quot;. This medicine made my life so much simpler.As of the 29th of this month I will have been taking Victoza for 1 year. In that time, my A1C went from 10.8 to 6.6 and I've lost nearly 60 pounds. AMAZING! I had a little bit of Nausea for the first week or so, but then nothing since. Also, the nausea with Victoza was NOTHING like the nausea I experienced with Byetta. The Byetta was awful and I'd tried just about EVERY other type of medicine out there including Insulin without success.I'm SO glad my Endocrinologist prescribed Victoza...it has completely changed my life. The once daily injection is a breeze and I've never experienced a &quot;low&quot; as my blood sugar is steady all day long. I LOVE this medication and I would highly recommend it to any Type 2 Diabetic. It worked miracles for me...and it will change your life too.RLCIM@yahoo.com

The nausea was initially a problem. I only experienced vomiting once, but that was when I had eaten more than usual.This drug lowers blood sugar and initially supresses the appetite. 
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	11/20/2011 6:49:38 AM	I have been taking this drug for almost 2 years and saw a quickk drop in my daily sugar tests backed up by lowering a1c from 8 down to a steady test at 4.5 to 5. also saw a 12 % weight loss. simple to take after getting past the first shot.

Before that I was taking Byetta twice daily. With victoza I am no longer using insulin (lantus) and feeling WAY BETTER! My A1C test 3 months ago was at 8.6, and as of last week, I have an A1C of 6.5!!!  This medication has really helped to bring my blood glucose back under control and I am feeling so much better now.

I am currently on 1.2 dose with 1000 mg Metformin 2x per day. I had the nausea for about the 1st wk but that has subsided. I did have some constipation and diarrhea, but I am not sure if that is from the Metformin. I take my injection at night so if there is any nausea I would be asleep.  I would recommend taking at night if you are experiencing nausea.  I have lost over 12 pounds so far and my last A1C was 6.3. I also have been experiancing a decreased appitite.

Doctor upped it to 1.2. After a couple days had horrible side effects. Felt like throwing up all day. Terrible diarrhea. Doctor moved me back to .6. Will see how it goes. Definitely an appetite suppressant.

Admittedly, I have difficulty eating properly in the sense that I usually eat but once a day. I also use Metformin 1000 x 2 a day and my daily blood sugar levels average around 130. It's difficult for me to say whether I have any side effects specifically stemming from Victoza as I have several medical conditions for which I am prescribed other meds. Overall, Victoza has by far been the better of the injectables I've used over the past several years. Levimear = weight gain. Byetta = low blood sugar and stomach problems. On the down side, Victoza is an expensive medication as a BCBS tier 3 $40 per month copay

I was on Byetta for 5 years and started feeling really bad recently, so the Dr switched me to Victoza to see if it would help. I feel alot better but my numbers are not where I want them to be, but its only been 3 weeks. I hope this improves with time.

I've lost 10 lbs. I'm now at 130 lbs. I'm on the 1.2 dosage. My A1c taken in Aug 2011 was 5.3.In May 2011 I noticed my hair was thinning. Hair loss is not one of the side effects. However, this drug does slow down the digestive system which can interfere vitamin and mineral abortion. I started taking a daily vitamin/mineral supplement.  I also started take additional zinc (with copper include). My hair is growing back. I have little short hairs growing back.Hair loss also can happen when a person looses weith too quickly.

Only using 0.6 per day, and the appetite suppresant alone would be worth it.  I guess I'm one of the fortunate ones who have no side affects, outside of a slight nausea the first day.  So far, so good.

It took a few weeks to get to 1.8 due to nausea. My blood sugars have lowered drastically and am very happy with drug.  One of lucky ones whose insurance covers.  The only real side effect is &quot;rotten egg&quot; burps which are embarassing in public because of smell.  Any suggestions?
Other	disappointed1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	9/21/2011 11:53:22 PM	Was prescribed Victoza for pre-diabetes. Has the usual side effects of nausea, headaches, which subsided after a few weeks.  Was not sure about how this med. affected my BG levels because docter did not advise me to do so and I was not familiar with diabetic practices.  I lost about 10 lbs.  I developed new side effects, however, after a few months of use.  I had increased pulse rate, severe fatigue, greatly increased hot flashes, and a surge in my apetite.  So I took myself off of this med. and will advise doctor at next appt.  I have since gained about 5 lbs back.  One note to consider; I am on a lot of other meds for fibromyalgia and depression which may have had a bad interaction with Victoza.

I have been on victoza for 1 1/2 years.  Very good results, but, after about 6 months noticed my hair beginning to thin quite a bit.  It has continued to thin at a slower rate than at first, but would like to hear if any one else has experienced this as a possible side effect.

Dr prescribed this medication and I did worry about an injection everyday.  My blood sugars dropped from 400+ at time of diagnosis to 90-110 fasting and after meals.   VERY expensive because the company still has the patent on the medication.  Skip a few months and my insurance changed- had to start using Byetta.  The Byetta caused all sorts of side effects and I stopped taking it until I could appeal my insurance co to cover the Victoza again.  Looking forward to lower blood sugars and decreased appetite again.   Very good medication in my opinion, just sad it is so cost prohibitive to people without insurance or poor coverage plans.

My blood sugar was nearly perfect and I lost 40 lbs in 4 months.  Then.....All of the appetite suppression went away, and of course my weight started going up and up.   I have now gained back the 40 pounds plus 10 more!   I'm very disappointed.   My doctor doesn't have an explanation.I did notice that one time when I accidently double dosed myself (several hours apart) that the appetite control came back, at least for a few hours.I just don't see a lot of difference between taking two 1000mg of Glumetza, and taking the Glumetza plus the Victoza.This is all based on my personal experience.I think in August I'm going to go back on Byetta for a while.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	FormerNurse, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	45-54	6/26/2011 11:07:51 AM	I initially started taking Victoza about two months ago.  I would inject it every morning at 6:00 A.M. ant take my hypertension meds (by mouth with food) at the same time.  As I titrated the dose up to 1.8mg.'s my blood pressure began going up.  By time I reached the 1.8 mg. dose my BP had reached a really dangerous level (174/108 so I stopped taking it and my BP dropped back to it's normal(118/76) or reasonably there about.  Needless to say, my physician wasn't happy that I had discontinued the Victoza with out consulting him.  He went as far as to say &quot;the Victoza wouldn't do that&quot;(time for a new Doc.) referring to the elevated BP.  Long story short..the doc. changed my BP meds and placed me back on the Victoza...Same problem with the BP again.  Not wanting to stop the Victoza because it was really controlling my blood sugar readings and food cravings, I did some more research decided to try taking the Victoza 3 hours after my BP meds....Bingo..BP has stayed within my normal range and the Victoza is working well.  My guess is that the Victoza works so well at slowing stomach emptying that the my BP meds were probably only trickling into my system if they were being absorbed at all.  Only other problem was some constipation...that seems to have passed (sorry for the bad pun).

It just isn't working!  My blood sugar is higher than on my previous regimen.  Sadly, the side effect of weight loss hasn't happened to me, either.  I talked to the doctor, wanting to go back to the fairly effective combo I was on before, but she just said to go up to 1.8.  That was 3 days ago and my fasting blood sugar is still over 200 every morning.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	mhm1995, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Male	65-74	5/22/2011 11:27:21 AM	I've been taking two diffeent types of insulin (fast acting and a 24 hr. type that levels me out for a 24 hour period) for at least 8-10 years.  I recently found that not only had I gained weight but my insulin use increased substantially (daily fast acting up to 70 units; evening insulin up at 62 units).  I began using Victoza about 1 month ago and the results have been startling.  There was a 2 1/2 day period that other than the Victoza shot, I took NO insulin whatsoever!  While using Victoza I soon learned that any corrective fast acting insulin must be reduced dramatically or there are severe &quot;going low&quot; consequences.  No problem now with adjustments I've made (I take no more than 7 units of fast acting insulin for a full  day and I reduced my evening type dose to 42 units.)  Now when I awake in the morning, my blood sugars are between 80-133 and are relatively normal throughout the day.  A huge change for me.  I have also lost 15 lbs. and have a suppressed appetite (something that goes along with the Victoza use).  The side effect for me is nausea.  This side effect began on day 1 and continued for almost 20 hours/day for a month.  Now my nausea has been significantly reduced but my appetite remains suppressed.  This is a miracle drug!  My doctor says this drug contains a certain hormone (nomally produced by the body) that directs the pancreas to produce more insulin (the stated purpose of Victoza). Apparently, I have not been making this hormone for some time.  Now, 1 Victoza shot of 1.2 units/day is all it takes and I'm close to normal. I hope this all continues.

Started Victoza, within first 2 weeks stopped 2 other medications for diabetes.  Have had very few side effects.  Additionally have lost 30 lbs in 6 months because I feel full longer and I am not always craving food because of variance in BS.  I am glad this is working for me.

It has been working great for me, controlling my blood sugar and also my appetite.  My A1C's have been between 5.8 and 6.3.  I have had just a few occasions where my sugars dropped low.  So far this drug has worked great for me.

Will take a different route

Just can't seem to get over the nauseaus, tired feeling all the time.  Definitely has decreased my appetite.  Just wondering how much longer these side effects will be around.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	bfnaz, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	2	Female	45-54	5/5/2011 6:42:25 AM	Just started taking this a few weeks ago.  I didn't have significan side effects until I started the 1.8 dose.  Back pain, abdominal pain, horrible diarrhea, reflux and &quot;rotten egg&quot; burps - feeling very sick for two days now.  It has definitely helped my numbers... actually 89 the other day! This is down from my norm of over 200!  The shots themselves are relatively painless, but the side effects at the higher dosage are pretty miserable.  I hope they will subside soon.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/4/2011 11:26:43 AM	Been on this medication for about 4 months and it is fabulous. Blood sugars were normal within days at 1.2 dosage. Lost about 22 pounds though that has slowed down. My only issues are the cost which I currently have a 1 yr. discount card from Victoza for $25/mo. and the belching/constipation. Just uncomfortable but not horrible. I went off oral meds because of gastro issues (allergic to sulfa) and had been on Byetta (didn't work) and Symlin (unpredictable nausea) as well as lantus and novloog. Am now off novolog entirely and dosage on lantus is cut by about 1/3.

It worked great and my A1c dropped from 9.6 to 7.6 in 3 - 4 months.  However, now that I have Kaiser for insurance, they don't approve of this drug and are forcing me to take insulin.  The insulin isn't working and I'm furious that they won't put me back on Victoza unless I want to pay the full price... $700+ for 3 wks of medicine.  What can I do to get back on Victoza??? I'm despirate and my blood sugars keep running in the 320 + range.  Anyone have suggestions?  Email me at srtoy@hotmail.com

It took about a month to really &quot;kick in&quot; but when it did, I brought my BS down to the low 100's and I lost 20 lbs so far. I was able to lower my Lantus from 55 iu down to 30 iu. I have not experienced any adverse side effects!

Started on .6 and went to 1.2 within 2 weeks and now on 1.8. Great appetite suppressor. currently trying Metformin again as well to help lower BG numbers, however only able to handle 125mg 2x per day without side affects.Only problem now is constant indigestion and burping, very little acid. I think it is the Metformin and higher 1.8 dose combined, so will hang in there and see how  the next 2 months go, adding an anti indigestion med to the mix.overall very happy with experience and on the way to losing another 15lbs this three months... AND lowering BG#... we'll see.

This drug has helped me to balance out these highs and lows... I have been using it for 6 months.  lost 5 lbs at the beginning but no symptoms or problems with the drug... just a balanced sugar level.. 
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Barb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	3/28/2011 4:24:14 PM	I have lost 11 pounds in just 9 days on this drug.  That's a plus but the benefit of having no appetite makes me have to force myself to eat. The nausea, at least for me, is minimal if at all.  I started out at 0.6 for 1 week and have been on the 1.2 for 3 days now.  I think it is a great drug that minimizes stomach upset.  Was on Metformin and had constant stomach/bowel issues.   The warning about the pancreatitis for those with high tryglicerides kind of spooked me but I talked with my doctor and he said it was a minimal risk.  I read the clinical trials as well.  I would recommend this to anyone who is pre-diabetic or type 2.

At the 1.8 dosage for about 3 mos. Doing great. A1C was 6.2. Dr very pleased. Have lost 34 lbs since starting. Still helps w/appetite control, but not like at first. Even so, am definitely making better decisions on my own.

Dr. added Glucotrol, and upped the Metformin dose, and I did my best with diet and exercise, but my numbers just went up and up.  Finally went to see an endocrinologist who put me on Victoza.  Have had no noticeable side effects, and my fasting blood glucose went from 276 to 92 in a month.  A1c is down 1.5 points in that same time period.  My BG numbers are now always well within the normal range and I'm losing weight.  Don't love the injections, but it's not hard or painful, and the result is totally worth it!
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/16/2011 12:20:53 AM	I've been on BP meds, chol. meds for years, always been heavy. Had bariatric surgery 11 years ago and gained all 110 lbs back +. All joints ached. Miserable. Diagnosed w/ type II diabetes 2 years ago but did nothing about it until 3 months ago (other than Metformin). Started Victoza and it is like a lifeline for me! Minor nausea for first week but that's all. All readings have come way down, no more pain, no more swelling in legs/feet. But best news is 45 lb. weight loss. Increased from lowest to highest setting in 1 week. Not hungry, no more &quot;grazing&quot; which is my downfall normally, happy and hopeful for first time in LONG time. Only trouble is I can't afford the drug as my insurance won't cover it. Dr. has stopped giving me samples. I'm out of Victoza and now devastated. Talk about &quot;dangling the carrot!&quot; Make slightly too much for medical aid. Give me something that finally works then take it away due to outrageous costs. Victoza drug rep tried to help but my insurance wouldn't budge on it. Help!

I was having some complications with it so I stopped taking it. Well, I found a new doctor and she placed me on this medicine. It has been wonderfull! I dont eat as much, I feel full faster, and my BS level is staying down. I am not a fan of shots, but this is so easy that I can do it myself. I am starting to have some trouble with my feet hurting though. Does anyone else have this problem?

At first I had headaches, was nausas, heart burn,constipation...it took about 2 months of backing down and slowly increasing again on the dosage and taking it in the evening.... to level out. I also had flu like symptoms and was so tired all the time. I lost 13 lbs. initially in 2 weeks and put 3lbs. back on. My blood sugar levels are better than they have been in years. I am so happy with Victoza, it was worth the rough time I went thru at first. Now I have started weight Watchers to take more lbs. off. My enery level is up and I am working out or walking every day. LIFE IS GOOD! Thank you Victoza!!

My BS is actually normal now. I am still on oral meds and insulin. I have had some ill effects, like constipation, gas, bloating, nausea and headache but they seem to have disappeared now. I am now on the 1.8mg dose. I have lost a few pounds. My appetite has decreased which helps with weight and sugar control. I am keeping an eye out for serious complication(which can happen with ANY drug). I am very satisfied with Victoza

This drug is pretty much amazing. I've been on it for about two weeks and my BG levels are way down. Was averaging about 250 fasting and am now down to low 100s fasting. I've also lost about 6lbs already. The needle is so small that you barely feel it. I prefer this drug to Byetta. I am so grateful for this medication.

Initially, I had some nausea, but once I regulated the dose, it's been fine. I take it along with one tablespoon of flaxseed oil which has significantly dropped my levels and my AC1. If you want to take a natural alternative along with med, get your doc's permission first. I just wish the med was less costly, but so far worth it.

First day, I took my Vicodin for my joint pain and was sick as a dog.  Never been so sick in all my life.  Throwing up on average every 2 minutes for 2 1/2 hours straight.  Then, was fine till a week later when I took my Vicodin again.  Also sick.  I blamed it on the Victoza, but I think it's the combo.  My numbers are incredible.  Went from morning fasting of around 250 to about 140 on the .06 dose.  Am still taking metformin and glymiperide.  Am going to tritrate up to the 1.2 gently over the next week, but may have to cut the glimperide down.  Weight loss: 5 lbs. but could be due to vomiting and diarrhea.  Love this drug though.

Started on 0.6 and moved up to 1.2 two weeks later. Initial nausea has subsided. My sugar levels are way down, I am losing weight and have stopped my nightly insulin injections. Still take 2000 mg of metformin daily. After all the other drugs I have been on, this is the only one that has worked and I am quite happy with it.

No luck with oral medications.  Instant positive results with Victoza.  Initially, I had nausea, but that improved on a daily basis.  I'm not constantly hungry, so I can see weight loss in my future.  I will be increasing the dose to 1.2 mg within the next week, and remain optimistic that I can deal with any side effects that might accompany the increased dose.  Victoza has been an eye opener for me.  2 or 3 days of use showed me that being more and more restrictive in my diet was not going to help my oral meds lower my blood sugar.  I am just so happy with the results I've experienced so far with Victoza.  I feel like the hands of time have been turned back for my health!!!!

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Yvette, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	2/3/2011 7:13:11 PM	I have been on Victoza for a week and am very pleased with the results so far.  I am up to the 1.2 dosage and have lost a few pounds plus it has cut my appetite tremendously.  My sugars were in the mid 300's before starting the drug and in the last 24 hours they are in the upper 100's.  I have had a little bit of nausea but taking the drug at night seems to help.  The worst side effect I have had is burping...alot.  No acid reflux (I'm on Nexium for that) but quite a bit of burping.  Wondering if anyone else has had this problem?

I've lost 5 lbs. although I do experience hunger before meals. No major side effects except mild reflux.  Worked amazingly first 3 days, with blood sugars decreasing by about 100 points.  However, since the fourth day, numbers have been steadily rising.  Hoping the 1.2 does will stop the rise.  Has this happened to anyone else where the first few days were great but then the blood sugars began to rise?

It's been six weeks and I lost 10lbs. I am so happy with the weight lost. I started out on lowest dose, I am on max dose now. I did have nausea mostly at night and some acid reflux. It seems to be getting alot better. My glucose readings are way down. The lowest it's been in 13 years.I can't wait to go back to dr at the end of month to see what my A1C is now. Last one was 7.3.... I take Janumet 50/1000mg 2xday. Amaryl 4mg-- 1and half tab daily.Victoza 1.8mg in morning. It definitely decreased my appetite, I no longer crave sweets like I used to, which is amazing in itself.....This is a wonder drug for me, I just hope I dont end up with the thyroid cancer. My pharmacist said it is safe, that the benefits outweigh the risk and that everything has potential for serious side effects. I dont know if losing the weight has anything to do with this but I noticed my blood pressure has been really low so I decreased my benicar to see if that's what I needed... I hopefully will loose some more weight at least 20lbs and I would be so happy...... I will post my blood results when I get them next.

I did experience nausea with initial dosing, however, Dr. prescribed Phenergan to take along with the shot until the nausea subsided.  The Dr. recommended taking the shot just before bedtime along with the anti-nausea meds.  Also, do not give the initial dosages in your stomach area, this will increase the nausea effects.  My A1c went from 7 to 5.1.  I have lost about 45 lbs. and will probably no longer have to take Metformin.  I was very hesitant about taking Victoza, but glad I stuck it out with the nausea and hope to continue to lose weight.

Sometimes sligh nausea but huge appetite loss - a size down in 1 week!  Feel horrible like a zombie.  No joy.  Depression and tired beyond normal.  Not liking how this feels at all but the weight loss is fab and sugars are way down!  I'll give it until I do next dosage 1.2 for 2 weeks and going to dr. to talk about it.

Started on .6 for 1 week and bumped dose up to 1.2 one week then up to 1.8 1 week.  Have had nausea from the start and was so bad at highest dose I dropped back to 1.2 1 week with no relief.  Spoke with Dr and she told me to drop to .6 which I have been on for 5 weeks.  Still having nausea despite watching dietary intake, drinking fluids, etc.  Fasting BS have been between 85-110 and after meals highest was 115.  However I can't stand the nausea and have experienced dizzyiness, weakness and constant leg and foot aches and pains (not sure what this is all about as I have done nothing to hurt my legs/feet).  Also been having itching scalp, legs , arms and body but thought it was just dry skin.  Didn't know it was a side effect until today.  I've tried giving injections with meals, without meals and at bedtime.  I wake up nauseated and experience nausea throughout the day even on lowest dose.  I don't think this drug is for me. I see my Dr monday the 20th and going to get her to stop the drug.  I am sick of being sick.

Using  Actos pills, Lantus at 45 units daily and Humalog 10  15 units 3X daily. A1C was 6.5 and gaining one pound per month.  Initial goal was to lose weight. First attempt 0.6 for one week then 1.2. Stopped because of the vomiting and hiccups.  Second attempt 0.6 for one month then 1.2. At 1.2 suffered from heartburn, ED and hiccups. Third attempt 0.6 until sugar levels begin to rise (2 Months) then went to 1.2 for two weeks. At full dose for just over a week now. No longer taking Lantus or Humalog with morning readings between 100 and 106. Spikes are below 180 two hours after meals and 100  106 before meals.  Side effects are hiccups after meals and random hiccups between meals, constipation and ED. ED medications ineffective so far.  Giving it another month to see if the ED goes away. The key was staying at a lower dose until blood sugars rose to the point of increasing insulin. Eating several small meals daily and drinking lots of water with mild exercise is a plus.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	11/26/2010 3:50:00 AM	I'm 56 yr old female.  Changed from Janumet to Januvia about 3 months ago.  Absolutely no side effects except went from constant metformin diarrhea to a little constipation, but that left when I bumped up the fiber.  No appetite unless I have physical hunger, which is good, and I'm down around 5 lbs.  Not as good BG control as I would like, but I spent about 5 of those weeks with a tooth infection and one on cortisone, which wreaked havoc with the BG.  I'm scared of the thyroid cancer possibility--to the one who's developed the cancer, what were the symptoms?  I feel for you....

One injection a day and not having to time it around a meal makes it much more appropriate for my lifestyle. So far I've had very little nausea. My appetite is significantly decreased, but not in an unpleasant way.

Started off at 0.6 for 1 week... then increased by two CLICKs each day for 5 days until I reached the goal of 1.2mg. I found that the slow titration upward decreased the side effects. I must say I've had some nausea the first week... but haven't vomited until today. Vomited several times this morning... not sure why now?? Injections in my stomach and thigh often times causes a quarter size bruise. I don't like that at all. I have found a hip injection to work the best... no pain or bruising. I hope that site is ok. It seems to be working pretty well. BSs are down a good bit but my fasting bs is higher than I would like... about 115 each morning. I hope my A1C gets back below 7 and I don't have to increase my dose up to 1.8. Constipation is my biggest side effect. I have never had that issue before. I'm taking 3 Docusate Sod 100mg per day. Its better but still an issue. So far, I like the Victoza over Metformin as the Metformin made me violently sick with nausea/vomiting/diarrhea.So overall I'm pleased... will know more later

A bit of nausea at first, long gone.  Lots of constipation, taking fiber.  It has drastically reduced my readings back to normal.  Between 5 and 6.5 in the morning and absolutely no highs anymore.  I am on an insulin pump and have had to reduce my total amount of insulin from approx 85u a day to 50u or so.  I have lost 14lbs and my appetite is greatly reduced.  My endocrinologist said we will wait another month and then increase to 1.8, it should help even more for the weigh lost.This drug is unbelievable, I only wish I had found it before. I cannot take Metformin as it makes me seriously sick.

Endless nausea, some vomiting and diarreah all the first week. Probably lost weight because I feel like Im going to be sick all the time. Blood sugars just as high as always, I feel like my Zoloft is no longer effective and am basically miserable on this. Will give it another week or two but if no improvements, forget it!

Not as low as I would like but something is better than nothing. I also take Metformin 1000 twice a day and Glipizide 2x daily as well. I have found that if I have a piece of toast or something else small on my stomach when I first take the injection, there is no nausea and vomiting. I have definately lowered my intake of food which is the major goal, and my numbers lower as well. I have not had any of the other side effects mentioned here, so I count myself lucky. Hope this helps!!!

Increased it after 4 days and on the 6th day I had a violent episode of vomiting and severe nausea however since then everything is good.  I have lost about 5 pds so I'm loving the appetite suppresant, levels are lower and I hoping they get better.  NO other side effects and I'm loving it!!!!!

I have had sinus stuffiness, doesn't go away.  Nausea was short lived no problems, does help some with appetite, but not tremendously.  So much easier to remember one shot a day, I take in the morning or early afternoon.  I do have constipation issues since starting, and severe dry skin since upping my dosage of this medication.  My morning blood sugars are definitely better, nothing else had helped morning sugar readings.  Overall, this medication has been a good thing for me.

Has taken all of the water off of my legs, which use to be so bad.  I can touch my shin bones now.  However I don't like the nausea but am hoping that it will subside.  I am taking the beginning dose of .6. Having slight headache but is manageable. Loss of appetite is great, but no one likes to eat to much when they are nauseated. First time with injections and is incredibly easy and painless with no bruising.  Am hoping that the weight starts to shed. I am so glad that my copay is only $20.  
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	DUMPLINS, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	55-64	10/24/2010 12:52:30 PM	Have been on Victoza over 3 mos. now.  I have nausea, vomiting, constipation and diarhea.  I thought that by changing the time I take my Victoza, 1.2, to the afternoon and my other dia., blood pressure, synthroid, etc. meds in the morning that the nausea might stop.  It hasn't.  I cannot stand the morning nausea feeling anymore. occasionally this is accompanied by vomiting/dry heaves of thick clear foamy liquid.  Victoza has decreased my appetite. I do not know how much if any weight loss yet.  It has lowered by morning sugars to the 90's.  I would like to continue to take it for its appetite depressant and lower blood sugars but I cannot stand the nausea ruining days out of my life.  I have changed the timing of the medication, which seemed to help for a while, but I am still getting the nausea.  I do crave sweets more though.  I would only hope that there is a solution to my problem because I do want to continue this medication for its sugar lowering and weight loss effects but will not be able to do so with this nausea.  I have also recently had an allergic reaction requiring the immediate use of benedryl.  Don't know for sure if reaction was to the VICTOZA.  I am going to contact my dr. to stop this med. unless there is some other way to get around the nausea.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	CAT, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	9/30/2010 2:02:00 PM	This has been a good experience for me.  I've used Victoza 2 months and lost over 15lbs, immediately.  I started at .6 then moved up to 1.2 on the Victoza Pen.  Walmart Pharmacy has a very good prescription program to help with the cost of the needles and Pen.  My readings are between 85 and 90 before and after eating. Was nauseated but never threw up.

I was leary about giving myself a shot, but Victoza is very easy to use and you can hardly feel the needle.  For those concerned about the cost, my Doctor said that there are certain pharmacies that have a pilot program with Victoza where your co-pay is covered for a year. I have noticed that I feel full much fast than before and am not hungry as much as before.  I have had acid reflux and a minor headache but nothing unmanageable.  
Other	diane, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/29/2010 3:28:10 AM	I am a morbidly obese patient, that has PCOS, insulin resistance, and I am not a diabetic.  However, the insulin resistance part of the PCOS is making it nearly impossible to loose weight, no matter how little I eat.I am on Victoza for 3 full weeks now, along with a prescription of Metformin, and I have lost about 11 pounds the first 3 weeks.  I have not had ANY nausea or gas issues that people complain about, and I am at max dose 1.8 once a day.  My appetite is drastically less, my cravings are completely reduced, and it takes less food to feel full with.So far, I could not be happier with this new medication.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/22/2010 2:04:18 PM	I been taking Victoza since the end of July 2010.  This is a miracle drug for me.  Typically my blood sugars have average 85 to 100 since taking it, and I've lost about 10 lbs so far.  The appetite has definitely change; I have to remember to eat and no longer crave sweets/carbs.  In the early weeks, the vomiting was hard to deal with, but that has eased some what.  I take it (1.2mg Victoza) along side 1000mg of Glucaphage daily, but have to ensure at least 4 hours between the Victoza and a Glucaphage dose or the vomiting returns. All in all, I'm very happy with this medication.  Yeah for 'V'...
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Lawrence, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/20/2010 2:05:47 PM	I began using Victoza 4 months ago..I have experienced so side effects and my HA1C has gone down significantly (from 7.0 to 6.1). What I like best is the fact that you only use one shot a day so it is much easier to use.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	spacecowboy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	9/19/2010 8:51:59 PM	Overall goal is weight loss and reduce or eliminate insulin thru weight loss, exercise and diet.  Started this drug for third time with Actos. First time with Humalog (on a sliding scale before meals) and Lantus at bedtime, (dose cut in half as needed until zero is needed) at 1.2 does experienced violent hiccups and vomiting along with constipation. Lost 10 pounds and sugars were never over 120. Root cause was Meals to large and not drinking enough water. Second attempt experienced ED at 1.8. Third attempt, first week, 0.6; sugars no higher than 125, have not taken any Lantus or Humalog. Lost 4 pounds.  mild heart burn and occasional hiccups.  Will move up click by click until ED occurs then back off until ED goes away. Third time Pros; weigh loss, not hungry and lower sugars. Cons; not thirsty, cant judge sugar low levels by feel, not thirsty at all, very small and more frequent meals or violent hiccups/nausea will result, generally feel different, mild heart burn, occasional hiccups when I consume near the food limit. Happy with drug if I can lose weigh without the major side effects.

I have lost around 10 pds, my blood sugars are always great now. I am still taking glucophage also.  This drug has been a miracle for me. I would recommend it. I have had no bad side effects that I read from others. Doc says A1C is great!

No significant weight loss. Some bruising at the injection site. I have experienced a slight nausea that I would attribute to Victoza. I inject in the abdomen, it's not fun. Drug needs to be oral.

I am off of it now and feel better and bowels are in check.  But I like the no craving sweets and loss of weight, slowly.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	pangur, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/3/2010 9:49:55 AM	Replaced insulin with  Victoza, and in three weeks have ramped up from 0.6 to 1.8 mg/day.  Blood sugar is well controlled, usually between 90 and 110 in the morning, and during the day staying within 20 points of the morning reading--much better than with the once-a-day insulin.  Also in those three weeks I've lost 8 pounds.  Minor nausea (though no vomiting) has kept my appetite down.  Have been experimenting with much smaller meals, which has usually helped.  I am very tired, though--is this a side effect of the drug or the disease?  Very satisfied with the drug.

Told my Dr. about the vomiting; she wanted me to stay on it. So I started over with using the lower, middle and higher doses on a weekly basis.  Still I could not tolerate the violent vomiting and rotten eggs burping tastem and 'losing' 2 days of my life every time I got sick. I lost only 10 pounds. My numbers did not come down, especially the fasting. My Dr. does not know I quit taking it; she will not be happy with me but that's a chance I have to take. Went back to Metformin and Glimepiride. #s are better if I watch the carbs; if I don't, they go through the roof. It would appear I'm on my way to insulin.

I find that the acid reflux is very annoying but I really need the weight loss.  I am lossing weight although I have not checked the scales.  My clothes are not as snug and people are noticing so I know it is working in that area.  I am still concerned about the stomach issues and may need to adjust the dose.

I also broke out in Hives all over my body at one point when first taking this drug. I had a UTI and a yeast infection that developed on my leg and croch area that could not really be explained.

My biggest issue is that since I started 2 weeks ago, I have had 4 lows, and always feel sick.  My normal after meal number is usually around 110 (2 hours after meal).  if I check again in 1 more hour, it is usually in the low 80's.  Hoping a tweak of my lantus helps out.

With insulin my morning numbers were higher than doctor wanted. I have lost 4 lbs, have slight constipation and some acid. I also have less appetite. However, ALL syptoms are more tolerable than the daytime lows I was experiencing with insulin! To me after a 3 weeks and at the .6 dosage it is a miracle drug! I hope the good news continues!!!!

No appetite, so I lost weight. Now,fourth month on the drug and my appetite is back, my numbers are back up,no more nausea, and weight is returning.  I think it loses its effect on the body.  I am on the maximum dose.  Symlin had the same history with me and I could not tolerate byetta at the maximum dose.  Unfortunately, I am still constipated.  The cost is excessive.  I doubt I will stay on it after the next Dr. visit.

Will continue to take Metformin 1000gm am and pm and Lantus if bgl rise.  Current fasting bgl after fasting were 118 if they rise will take Lantus no more Victoza for now.  Not worth the illness that takes at lease 48 hrs to recover.  Will f/u with dr next week.

Much easier to do 1 shot in morning not related to meals. Very hapy with it.

My numbers are great, but I feel sick all the time.     Dr appt at end of the month and I hope to switch doses or medicine.   
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	6/3/2010 6:17:47 PM	I started out great.  Sugar numberes came down, not hungry, insulin reduced.  After two months, my appetite is back, and my numbers are climbing.  I am getting back to where I was with three shots of insulin a day, but victoza is way more expensive.  I wonder if you can develop an immunity from this drug after a while?????
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	KACO1456, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/29/2010 5:16:54 AM	Started this med less than a wk ago.. Bgl were bouncing all around in the 100s..139 in a.m. and up to 188 in p.m. Also have gastroparesis. Dr. rec'd to try this along with metformin. I like the steadier readings. Don't have nausea or diarrhea side effects from this but have it from the gastroparesis. HOWEVER, I have already developed acid reflux in the 5 days I have been injecting. Don't like this effect and hoping it will go away once I get used to this new drug. Otherwise, I am extremely pleased with results.

Started at .06 dose and to increase to 1.2 dosage 2nd wk. By mid 3rd wk, I was having acid reflux and nausea so returned to lower dosage.  Lost 4 lbs. Saw MD end of 4 wks; instructed to stay on low dosage for 2wks and increase it to l.2 again.  Acid reflex returned minus nausea.  Appears I cant tolerate higher dosage.  I was taken off Januvia and placed on Victoza due to spikes in sugar level 4 hrs after meals eventhough 2hrs cks were within range.  May have to stay at low dosage or return to Januvia.  Appt at end of month.
