Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	2	Female	19-24	7/24/2012 10:35:14 AM	I was taking this because I got a Upper Respiratory Infection. I believe it might have cleared up the URI but I am not positive. The first few doses made me really dizzy and feel sick. I had some diarrhea but it was not to worry about. I was on day 3 of 5, and all a sudden my leg a red spot that felt like it was on fire nonstop. Then the next day my stomach hived out and had white spots. 2 Benedryl later and no improvement.

If you take a probiotic, you won't have an upset stomach. This medication will cause a headache.
Other	deannie_girl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	7/12/2012 12:52:01 AM	I was given Keflex for an abcess almost a year ago. I had problems from the beginning. I felt drained of energy, all I wanted to do was sleep, my thoughts were foggy, had headaches, my joints felt like they were on fire, and my stomach was constantly in knots. Before I knew it, I ended up with a bladder infection, pain in my lower pelvic region and eventually the pain spread to my abdominals. This was only in four days of use. I instantly stopped taking it. My digestive system has NEVER been the same ever since I took it! I'm a hot mess...DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION!! It's way to dangerous.

It also made me lose my appetite, just a small banana could make me go from starving to about-to-bust-full. although it gives me chills, it makes my face burning hot with a fever. i absolutely HATE taking this medicine and cannot wait until my 30 pills run out.

X rays revealed I have athhritis in my hips but I had absolutely no symptoms before taking this drug.

Strep Throat	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	2/21/2012 7:22:04 AM	I suffered from strep throat for the first time in my life as an adult.  I came home from work on Friday afternoon, and 45 minutes later I went to go lie down for a nap.  I've noticed that my throat was somewhat scratchy and began coughing some.  I didn't think anything of it.  The little coughing subsided.  Later on that night I felt worse.  I thought I just had a bad cold or something.  Saturday morning was much worse.  I had fever, chills, body aches, sore throat.  At one point, my fever climbed to 104.  On Sunday, I went to urgent care and was prescribed Keflex (Cephalexin) because I had strep throat.  I must take 3 500 mg capsules each day for 10 days.  No side effects thus far and today is Tuesday.  I thought I just had the flu.  Boy, I thought wrong! I was always told that the flu is viral and must run it's course. Otherwise, I would have gone in on Saturday.

Dentist prescribed Keflex,and within two days infection and pain lessened. Took the whole course and was back to 100% normal after that week. Had absolutely no side effects at all. I found it to be much more effective than Amoxicillin or Penicillin for my dental issues. It must agree with my body chemistry and works very well.  Have used it several times since,with equally good results. Completely satisfied.

This wasn't severe, but just uncomfortable at times. After completion of the regimen, this side effect dissipated within a day or two.

Apart from the odd yeast infection I haven't had any particular problems and the med has been very effective.BUTMy 68 year old father was recently prescribed keflex for a suspected kidney infection and his reaction was vastly different. Approx 2 hrs after taking a capsule he experienced nausea (no vomiting), confusion, distress, delirium and anxiety, lasting about 8 hours. He has had to stop the meds and is now receiving an alternative cephalosporin intravenously - with no negative side effects as far as we can tell.I guess we're all different.

Went to ER but by the time he saw the dr. (3hrs later)symptoms subsided. 3rd time his tounge swelled, nearly closing off his wind pipe within 5 mins of taking Keflex. Rushed to ER (4blks away)where they got him on IV's immediately. Still took an hr. to stabalize him. He had no known allergy to penicillin. This drug is dangerous &amp; almost cost him his life.

Other	tissigirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	6/23/2011 2:33:35 PM	Please keep in mind that ANY antibiotic, not just Keflex, can cause thrush, vaginal yeast infection, intestinal issues such as diarrhea, or a severe allergic reaction, especially in higher doses! Each person is different, and where 1 antibiotic may not effect someone it may cause a severe reaction in someone else.  All antibiotics are pretty much equal in this aspect!  Probiotics beforehand or during can help alleviate some of the issues such as yeast infections.I have been on a low dose of Keflex for several years for moderate cystic acne.  Although i'm not thrilled about having to be on an antibiotic long term, this in combination with Retin-A is the only thing that will take care of it.  I have had no side effects from it.  I have fair skin, so i'm unable to tell if it has made me more sensitive to the sun.  I agree, it does have a bad smell and taste.  But it is normally not an issue unless the pill lingers in your mouth for some reason.

But nothing that I have read about this med or the reviews states anything about Yeast Infection. So I dont know if he got this med. because he's a diabetic?

In early 2008, i started having episodes that started with red hot skin on left arm, dizziness, fever, and more. It happened every 3 months, as each time it got worse and spread further. Doctors put me on Kelflex. In 2009 &amp; 2010, landed in hospital. Diagnosis was Group G Strep. I was put on Keflex 1000mg 2x day for 2 weeks, and cut down to 2 a day, and after 30 days it was 1x per day. Was told to stay on it for 6 months. I did. When I went off, these episodes started coming back again in about 3 months. I did experience side effects of tiredness, sometimes shortness of breath, agitation, swelling of feet, etc. I don't like taking pills period, and especially antibiotics. In 2010, I had 3 episodes each 4-6 wks after the previous one.I was given Keflex for 10 days. I got tired and concerned about the recurrences so quickly, so I went to the lymphodema clinic as my concern is cancer returning. I was told, basically, that since so many nodes had been removed, I constantly run the risk of this returning, and eventually it WILL cause lymphodema. The only way to keep this gone is to take Kelflex daily. 500 mg. I am concerned about the long term effects of antibiotics. Thankfully, this has not caused female itching. BUT, I have wounds on my fingers (mostly index and thumbs) that are lesions, and sore, and bleed. I am thinking the keflex. Not sure what to do. I have tried everything doctor and over the counter. The doctor at the lympdema clinic gave me an ointment with silver in it, as he says eczema (as he diagnosed it) builds an immunity to many of the ointments used for eczema and psorasis. Well, his isn't working on my index and thumbs either. I really think it is the Keflex, and I think I am going to cut back on the keflex. Any ideas? No one seems to have an answer. My fingers really hurt. So, it seems I have a choice: sore fingers or lympodema. Hum.

The keflex was preventative in my case.  I took with it acidophilus and a small amount of food.  I had some stomach issues for 2 days but they cleared up. They did make me groggy and gave me a headache when I took my midday dose. However I was okay in the morning.  The sulphur in the drug smelled awful and I had some after taste. Anyone with 1/2 a brain in their head knows that any antiobiotic is going to have gastric side effects of some kind.  Only an idiot wouldn't have the brains to take them without a probiotic and modify their diet while they are on the course of treatment.  I was on them for a full five days.  I took the keflex as prescribed, stayed out of the sun and slept when I needed to.  There is no sign of infection and I am feeling as well as can be expected uunder the circumstances.  I hope that I never have to take them again but if they are prescribed I will not complain.  Now...ask me about Cipro and I will tell a different story.

I have a nerve injury and RSD/CRPS.  No infections each time so I guess its working well.  500 mg every 6 hrs.  The bad part is that I get a horrible dose of THRUSH after about 4 days.  I just don't understand why the specialist doesn't give you a preventative THRUSH medication when they prescribe this.  I'm very ill and they last think I need is another problem bring on a sore throat and tongue, nausea, choking, and flat out disgusting THRUSH.  My PCP said we should do a HIV test the next time I'm in his office.  I thought are you kidding me?  I do know it is a symptom of HIV but scare me to death over an empowering side effect listed.  That is it!  No more Keflex.

Skin Infection	Saxydude, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	19-24	1/26/2010 12:11:40 AM	I was prescribed a relatively short (7 day) course of Keflex for a minor skin infection. The antibiotics seem to have done the trick with the infection, unfortunately I experienced many of the side effects that others have been plagued with: nausea, slight confusion/haze, sore throat, and moderate cramping (a new one for me). I don't normally require antibiotics, so perhaps my body was shocked by their sudden presence. Still, none of the side effects were unbearable (no headaches, thank God!) and the medication worked promptly. However, if I had to take Keflex for any longer than a week I would've likely asked my physician to switch me to a different antibiotic due to the cramping.

This is typical for antibiotics, in my experience.  My solution is to eat yogurt (any flavor) to conquer the diarrhea; and use plain yogurt both externally and as a vaginal suppository to counteract the itching/burning symptoms. Using apple cider vinegar douche is a good assist in reducing these unpleasant symptoms, but does best if followed up with the yogurt application.

Strep Throat	pearandplum, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	10/22/2009 3:31:07 PM	I have gotten strep throat every year for most of my life (i'm 23, in decent shape, and a petite person 5'1&quot;). My usual doctor gives me z-pack which i have always tolerated well. I could not see him, and went to the on call doctor. She perscribed this, 500mg a day 4x a day. This medication was horrible, though it killed the strep and made my lymph node go down, around day 4 I was fine. EXCEPT, I was itchy, nauseous, had dirreaha and was developing an itchy rash around my anus and on my vuvla. Not quite a vaginal yeast infection but yeast non the less. I also had yeast sores on the sides of my mouth that were very painful. (I think part of the reason I got the rash was because I was on my period for part of the treatment and was wearing a thick pad, blocking mositure from escaping.)I stopped taking the keflex and told my dr about my symptoms. They changed me to z-pack, which i never took (I had had some 10,000mg of antibiotics by this time, a z pack is like 1250 for the whole course, I figured it was dead) They gave me diflucan? for the yeast. It did nothing but make me more nauseous and more loose stools. basically terrible. I did online research and started taking pro-biotics to replace the bacteria, eating no refined sugar, eating yogurt (plain), drinking 48oz of water a day, green tea, pomagrant juice, as well as going comando under dresses/loose sweatpants. I also used some vagisil initially, but stopped that after a few days. I also used some diluted tea tree oil, which kinda stung, but overall helped the rash. Its now day five of pro-biotics and feeling much better, rash is faded to light pink in only around my anus, and the vuvlitits is gone. (make sure to clean under your clit for yeast ladies!) Overall, the natural cure worked for me, I've had vulvitis very mildy before, as well as the sores on my mouth, but the rash was really scary. The probiotics are very easy to take, I am using &quot;culturelle&quot; brand. I would recommend to those needing to heal themself

It was necessary to take an antibiotic to get rid of the infection in my tooth, take down the swelling and pain in my jawbone, and as per dentists advice , was necessary for many reasons so that the condition would not get worse. I was in much pain and did not feel good at all,which was a period of 3 or 4 days.I noticed as soon as I had taken the first tablet that it started to act on relieving the pain,swelling and jawbone trouble. I am very happy and grateful with the remarkable results that the keflex has given me. As for the side effects, they were few, being indigestion, some constipation, all until I had adjusted to the medication. I had been lucky, and hope that anyone needing to take an antibiotic for any reason has good luck too, and no health problems with it.

I have mixed connective tissue disease with Systemic Lupus being part of that. I do have Mitral Valve Prolapse. I've had no problems with it at all. I've been taking it for days now. I don't care for the smell though. I take so many other medications that taste bad, I didn't notice anything there. I take all 11 pills at once. Plenty of those taste bad. I've had Cipro a few times &amp; it seemed to be losing its effectiveness, so he put me on this. My throat hasn't gotten  much better, but it is definitely not worse. I get a sore throat &amp; usually strep &amp; laryngitis or pharyngitis every time I get sick. They tend to get pretty bad. But we caught this one at the beginning.

The medication appeared to help the infection with a quick response time but it was at the cost of her enduring a severely upset stomache and complaints similar to that of acid reflux. Eventhough it was extremely effective, I don't think I will allow my child to be prescribed this medication again. Her stomach upset seems to be lingering eventhough she has been off the medication for a couple of days.

As soon as I stopped taking it,within a month the lesions reoccured. Hopefully,I get another prescription. I did have sickness while taking it,but after 3 days my body adjusted. I had some loss of appetite, minor headaches. However,making my hands stop itching,and clearing up my genitals far outweighed the nausea.
