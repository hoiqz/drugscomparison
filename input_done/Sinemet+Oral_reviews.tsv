While in hospital, doctor prescribed Sinemet, in generic form, 3X a day.  Works quickly to ease discomfort, but not as quickly as the potassium and 2 aspirin.  Different manufacturers of the same medication give me different result times, but all eventually give relief.

Parkinson's Disease	BT, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	3	3	3	Male	55-64	3/29/2012 11:47:21 PM	My best friend (57 years) was diagnosed withParkinsons at age 47, 15 years ago. He has taken sinimet for at least ten of those years.His daily use of pills is 20 to 30 despite having the brain stimulation surgery. Major side effects of the medicine at this level include frequent loss of balance resulting in hard falls, and for his wife and close friends, as well as my friend is frequent periods that he is incoherent , similar to a very intoxicated person.He also in the past six years has developed a significant desire for sex and to gamble.Are these side affects caused by the drug or are they symptoms of Parkinsons? Isthe amount of pills he takes normal?Is his incoherence and falling consistent withan early onset, 15 year patient.Any suggestions to lessen or eliminate theseside effects?Thanks,BT

Sinemet has been a Godsend.  I always say I would give up air before I would give this up.  Dystonia is similar to Parkinsons, but not as degenerative.  Without the Sinemet, I can't really even function.  I can't walk without falling; my legs just don't get the message from my brain to move.  I was really surprised to see it used for RLS as the side effect for me after years of use has been the dyskinisia (sp), it makes my legs jerky.  I take amantadine to counter this.   
Parkinson's Disease	rs, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	2/11/2010 7:26:04 PM	Sinemet has effectively treated multiple Parkinson's Disease symptoms shortly after I first started taking the drug with few side effects. I also have benefited from reduced depression. Sinemet has allowed me to improve daily activities and manage depression.
Parkinson Symptoms	Triple A, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	3	3	Male	65-74	2/7/2010 10:40:34 PM	Patient has Lewy Body Dementia with attendant Parkinson Symptoms. Was hospitalized 8 weeks ago when she bacame very rigid and unable to communicate. Neurologist prescribed Sinamet 25/100 four times per day, which greatly mitigated symptoms within 24 hours. One week into Sinamet use, dosage was doubled. Reaction to new dosage was terrible nausea, palsy, agitation, high pitched voice and very sweaty palms and forehead, within 2 hours of taking meds. Symptoms usually subsided within 1-2 hours of sleep. Neurologist again altered meds after two weeks by cutting back to 25/100 four times per day, with 50/200ER dosage in between, twice per day. This mitigated symptoms some but the main difference has been the frequency of spells has been reduced by about 50%. Patient is also on Azilect .5mg, as well as Namenda, the Exelon patch and provigil for Lewy Body Dementia. Patient is tolerating nausea and other symptoms for the moment.

Take one tab of 25/100 just before bedtime (along with 25mg Amitryptaline).  RLS symptoms greatly reduced allowing sleep thru the night.  Now and then I must take a 2nd dose an hour or so later.  Before this drug I was a mess.  I only hope my results don't diminish over time as is predicted.

Be very careful when switching from a dopamine agonist to this drug.  It took 4 months to find a solution to the narcolepsy problem and I had to add midodrene to combat orthostatic hypotension for a couple of months.  I went from barely functional on dopamine agonists to almost a total invalid initially on sinemet for four months.  You must avoid large amounts of food particularly meat for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour, after you take the drug and two hours before or your symptoms will come back in full force which is not fun.  It is well worth switching.  I am basically normal now when the medication is working after 8 years of fairly severe symptoms.  I also don't take any sinemet during the night.  Last CR is at 7:30pm and first is at 7:30 am in the morning.  I take .5 mg of azilect at night and 1/4 tablet of lowest dose clonazapam to stop acting out dreams.  
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	10/21/2007 2:39:25 PM	I have used this med for RLS about a year now. I began with a low dose at night which helped for some time however at about 9 months of use it began to wain in it's effectiveness. Just recently had dose increased and using a CR dose twice a day. Seems to help with occational breakthrough when I am close to my next dose. Overall satisfied and easy drug to tolerate.
