Overactive Thyroid Gland	Kitty, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	3/1/2012 12:42:30 AM	Been taking medication PTU for a week tomorrow morning, so not sure if it is working yet. I take 3 pills a day. I have agreed...yes a bitter lingering taste after taking meds. I have been experiencing some headaches.. Thinking I have to eat with the PTU.. If not the headaches get worse. I will continue meds... Until I do blood test in 3 weeks to see if it's helping the TSH. Is there any recommendations .. I will keep updating as I take meds.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	dardykay, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	9/13/2011 3:17:48 AM	About 3 months after starting this medication, I had  bllodwork done by my family dr  for  my epilepsy, and he discovered my blood  was &quot;out of whack&quot;.  He referred me to the blood  and cancer center, where after 18 tubes of blood  and 2 visits, it was discovered that the propylthiouracil was destroying my blood cells.  During this time, I  also developed a  blistery rash on my hands,  and my regular family dr  referred me to a deratologist, who performed a biopsy, and told me it was because of the thyroid med i was on.  Also, the skin on bottom of both my feet started peeling off...I could actually peel off 3 layers of skin at a time.  I went to my podiatrist (no referral here, i went on my own)  and   was asked  what meds i had been taking, and when i told him propylthiouracil, his exact words were &quot;OH my God&quot;  That is causing  your skin to peel off.  Also, I read  the article where the prescribing dr is to monitor the patient for  any problems...when i told him about the rash, he just said it will go away.  He NEVER did  any bloodwork or anything...good thing my family dr  does  the bloodwork every 6 months for my phenobarbital level because of my epilepsy.  My family dr, when he   heard from the blood and cancer center, called me and said..STOP taking that thyroid medicine.   He wrote  an order for the thyroid dr to perform  a thyroid procedure, but when i  gave  the order to the thyroid dr, on my next visit, he  said Nope...not gonna do that.  Quack  did not monitor me, or  do anything but take my money.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	Molly's Mom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	8/9/2011 9:44:28 PM	Here's my story: I just gave birth to my 1st baby in December 2010. My doctor suggested I go and see an endocrinologist doctor. After my 3rd(6months from February 2011) visit they finally took my blood and saw that something might be up. The reason for the long wait was because I was/am still nursing. They finally gave me the PTU prescription. I am a little nervous to take because I am still nursing my 7 1/2 month old baby. Anyone else taking this medication and nursing? Or did you have to stop because of the side affects? I would love some feedback on this. Thanks!

It seemed to help me feel better, do not like the bitter taste, get it down as quickly as possible. I take 50mg QD, and am under the care of an Endocrinologist. I was on Synthroid for years for underactive thyroid, but has large nodules that are causing overactive so have been placed on this medication to straighten the levels out. Hope I do not have to remain on this medication indefinetely,but the only other option is removal of my thryroid gland.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	Skittler, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	4/25/2011 4:02:28 PM	I was diagnosed with severe hyperthyroidism with swollen glands. My heart rate was constantly 140-150bpm and now Im looking at 78-88bpm. THRILLED. I am taking the maximum dose 1,200mg a day (6 -50mg tablets 4x a day) It is hard for me to remember to take it four times a day. But Hyperthyroid comes with memory problems sometimes. :) The medication is slowly working. I keep getting blood drawn and it's still not down enough... Next option is surgery, so I am really hoping this maximum dose (went from 900- 1200mg) will knock it down a couple more steps.

I did not have to have my thyroid removed or kill it by taken medicine.  I highly recommend this drug for Hyperthyoidism (Graves Disease).
Overactive Thyroid Gland	snefru,  Male  (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male		10/10/2010 3:09:27 PM	Was diagnosed 5 years ago with Graves, was losing weight, night sweats, loss of sleep, tremors and terrible aching legs. Dr. put me on PTU, and within 6 weeks I noticed marked improvements in my symptoms. The PTU has  given me few side-effects after 5 years, but food is just not very interesting to me anymore. I just eat because everyone else does, or it is the appropriate time to eat, never eating alot at any one time. I have hit a plateau on my weight though, and it is well short (15-18#) of my normal, healthy weight. I still have some slight tremors in my index fingers from time to time, but nothing like the full-on tremors I was having at the onset of the Graves. I still have episodes of complete exhaustion after about 5 hours of work, but at least I can work now. The major problem I have now is intolerance to heat. Being in the direct sunlight, when it's hot, like 90-95F, is extremely hard to do, and I avoid it at all cost. I don't know if it's a symptom of the Graves, or a side-effect from the PTU. I suspect it's the Graves. I do have mild joint pain from time to time, but I suspect that's the Graves too. I will continue to take the PTU as long as the blood tests show no liver problems. This drug has been moderately effective for me. I'm certainly better than I was.

Overactive Thyroid Gland	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	9/14/2010 10:19:13 AM	Started taking this 5 days ago in he hospital after my thyroid levels got out of control. Symptoms still present with 800mg/d and other problems are starting to arise or get worse since starting this med - such as very large, baseball sized hives on my lower body - difficulty sleeping / staying asleep - extreme fatigue - So far, I'm not impressed with this drug whatsoever.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	simone, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	35-44	9/4/2010 12:26:38 AM	My doctor tells me this medication is working but I am not sure. Before being dignoised with hyperthyroism I didn't even know anything I was wrong. I was tired and sometimes very itchy but I fell like I still have those problems and even worse I am hot all the time for now reason. I find hard to remember to take 8 pills a day unless I take them all at once. They taste horrible and I feel as if my appetite has increase since taking this medicine. Somedays I feel like I can deal with all the other side effects if I could just get rid of the headach. I have noticed when I take them everything is bright for about 30 min seems strange but my doc says he has never heard that complaint. Just wondering if anyone else has had this problem.

I kept gagging and vomiting.  I melted chocolate chips, dipped the pills in them and put them in the fridge.  They go down perfectly and the bitterness is gone, still get a bit of the bitter taste in my mouth but nothing like before.  My Dr thought it was a great idea, said the chocolate would melt right away and the pill would still be effective.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	Fletcher44, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	3	Female	45-54	5/24/2010 9:49:05 AM	The PTU is working for Graves symptoms but I am having swollen eye lids and now swelling in my knees and ankles and weight gain. I was on 3 pills 3 times a day and becoming hypo. It was reduced to 2 pills 3 times a day. I think the swelling is from still too much medication. Just called Dr. again.

It takes a while to kick in, but overall it worked for me and I am hoping to go in remission again. Lately have a bit of upset stomach and am petrified of liver failure but Methimazole didn't work for me and other alternatives such as radioactive ablation or surgery just seem too drastic. Currently I am better but TSH is still low so my doc wants me to continue on PTU 200 mg a day, I would love to lower my dosage. It takes time...Hope this review helps.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	boomobile, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	4/23/2010 4:15:13 AM	When I was 14 I was the 9th person ever to be diagnosed with drug-induced hepatitis within the US.For those of you who refuse to take this drug - I understand I am one of the 1 in 100 to have a severe allergic reaction to it - my liver shut down, and I got a nasty rash. I was hospitalized and got off the drug, but this presented another problem. No way to treat my hyperthyroidism. Long story short, my thyroid was removed completely, and now I take T4 replacement hormone for the rest of my life. It's much better than migraines, vomiting, shakiness, pounding heart, weight loss (unhealthy), super sensitive reflexes, and over all jitters.

Overactive Thyroid Gland	Will, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male	35-44	2/28/2010 4:53:31 PM	Ok heres my story, I've know since 16yoa I have had graves disease/ Hyperthyroid. I had no way to treat my condition for some time. I visited a Dr at 23yoa who related that I in fact had a hyperthyroid. At first the Dr prescribed propanolol, which made me feel aweful, so I stopped taking the medication. For years I've dealt with pounding heart beat, heart beat skipping, shaking hands, the appearance of nervousness, headaches I would ignore. Additionally I had more energy than anyone around me, but this is not a good feature. As of this date, Feb 2010, I recently experienced what I can only assume was a heart flutter in my upper atrial portion of my heart. It felt as if I had a hamster in my chest. I decided to lie down, and even at rest the fluttering continued. (15) minutes later, with still no relief, I drove to a 24 medical center where they immediately nearly slammed me on a bed and was injecting me with medication, and crap. the fluttering stopped after a short time, and the staff transported me to a telemetry heart floor. (Note: I was the youngest person on this floor of the hospital, what an uneasy feeling). According to the cardiologist, the flutter may have been the result of not taking care of my thyroid issue. (Suggestion to all who read this), take the thyroid med no matter how it makes you feel, and discuss with your Dr any systom or side effects you experience. The biggest pain in Forida is finding an endocrinologist who will actually see you for more than one visit. Back on topic, I am takig this medication identified as Propylthiouracil (50)mg tablets. I have been taking the meds 2xday/ x1 every 6 hours. The actual dosage x2 3xday. This sounds like a lot to me, and I don't want to have liver damage down the road. I have noticed improvement. Hand shaking is minimal and no pounding heart be as yet. Duration of medication consumption x1 mth. Support always appreciated, ty for reading. Will (w_leffew@hotmail.com). 
Overactive Thyroid Gland	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/17/2010 7:18:03 PM	I have periodically been on and off this drug since 2002.  My Grave's Disease is completely controlled by it and I gradually go off the meds as Grave's goes into remission.  The only effect I have from this drug is that it works COMPLETELY, and effectively!  To deal with the taste I put it way in the back of my throat and must be sure to swallow it with the first gulp of water - then there is NO bad after taste.  If that is the only problem that you have with the drug, then be very happy that a drug can completely elimiate all of the bad parts of Grave's with such a trivial side effect!

It has controlled my hyperthyroidism completely.  No more unexplained weight loss (darn it!), rapid heartbeat, trembling hands and horrible diarrhea.  I take 5 pills a day, (2 in morning, 3 at night).  Never noticed any bitter aftertaste, but now that I think about it, I do chew more gum now than I used to...  Also, just today I read something about there being an FDA warning about liver damage as a result of using PTU.  I definitely need to check into this.

Although, I am still suffering some of the symptoms they have decreased substantially.  The pills do leave a bitter taste in your mouth but, only if they touch your tongue.  For this I recommend covering the pill completely in a spoonful of applesauce or yogurt and then swallowing as soon as it hits your mouth.  By doing so I am no longer experiencing the bitterness at all.

Overactive Thyroid Gland	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	45-54	5/18/2009 5:05:09 PM	Just started on this drug to treat hyperactive thyroid. Don't find that there is a problem with a bad taste yet. I had tachycardia and hot flashes and sore joints before taking this drug. Since being on the drug I haven't had the tachycardia and sore joints. However, I have had problems with a scratchy irritation in my throat, which causes me to cough more. Drinking fluids or using lozenges does not help much. Hoping that with a few more months of treatment I will see this symptom go away also. I also noticed that I am tired more and seem to require more sleep than before. 
Overactive Thyroid Gland	sms_jan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	4/14/2009 12:35:03 AM	I have been through HELL. I have aortic stenosis, my Dr. prescribed this med, my heart nearly flew out of my chest. He kept upping my blood pressure meds.  The only way that I found out that this med was NOT to be taken by heart patients was through this website. Honestly, I am sure that I was dying, I was well on my way to a major heart attack. The surgeon that was to take out the thyroid said &quot;No Way&quot;, &quot;the shape that your heart is in now, I can not put you to sleep.&quot;  I know the awful taste that was spoken about on this site, it was terrible, it kept comming back. I was also very jittery and restless, anxious. This may sound gross, for that I do apologize, but my urine made me ill, the smell was sickening.  I quit the med cold turkey when I read the info.  I will report it to FDA site, I will also call the number listed, as the paper that I received when I first got this medication filled said NOTHING, NOTHING at all about killing you if you have heart trouble. Beware if you are taking this medication, make sure that your heart does not have any, ANY type of problem, including a murmur, no matter how slight. Honestly, I cannot caution you enough; this medication has really hurt me.

The drug has worked very well for me.  I take a very low dose now 1 50mg pill a day, this was after the first three months of twice a day 4 50 mg pills.  The taste was awfully bitter; then I did lose the ability to taste most bitter things.  I do not wish to still be on any med.  Waiting to have a more permanent solution like surgery or radiological drug.  Due to an additional issue with an over-active Parathyroid gland that has not shown up in scans to pinpoint surgery; still waiting to treat both with surgery at the same time. 
Overactive Thyroid Gland	Moe, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	3/15/2009 2:05:18 AM	I started out on Tapazole and I was sick everyday, allday.  I had to stop the meds when I went on vacation. My Dr changed it to PTU and I feel 100% better.  No side effects. I can deal with the bitter taste for 5 min afterwards.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	Taylor1564, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	25-34	3/4/2009 2:43:58 PM	I have had a full day's experience with the med so far.  Last night I had a slight headache and my left knee was sore, but since then I've had no side effects.  I noticed that after I walked up and down the stairs today I could actually breathe! I was diagnosed with Grave's Disease yesterday and my doctor put me on 100mg three time/day of the Propylthiouracil.  So far I'm impressed.

I'm very nervous that I may experience joint/muscle pain- of all the side effects that seems the worst to me.  I have had an undiagnosed hyperactive thyroid for over 4 years, so I have experiences severe upset stomachs, extreme shortness of breath and a heart rate of over 200. With the horrible symptoms I've already had I'm hoping the side effects of the medication will be worth it.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	bonnie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	2/28/2009 10:51:26 PM	my arm and legs hurt so bad I can barely walk, or lift anything. I am so tired, and I feel like shit. I am going off this medicine and will deal with heart palpations.I felt better before I took this medicine. I never had joint pain. now I do. My heart was acting up, and I am allergic to iodine! I am going to find a new doctor right away, someone needs to find out why so many women have thyroid problems. I was better off the medicine. 
Overactive Thyroid Gland	MonaLisa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	2/27/2009 1:29:18 PM	I had very little problem with this drug.My Dr increases or decreased as needed. She tripled my dosage then, I ran a temperature every night with fever and chills. I began to have bruising on my ear lobes and face, lupus like symptoms. I could not go outside for more than 15 mins because my heart fluttering and I could not breath in the heat.  All these were side affects my Specialist denied, I finally got medical attention when my PCP saw that I could not raise myself off the table with wanting to throw up.  There are 3 degrees of side affects...I had all of them in one extreme or another, I also have Primary Biliary Cirrhosis.  I was hospitalized for 4 days.  My thyroid was at toxic levels!  Surgery with complete thyroidectomy leaving the parathyroid. Eighteen months later I finally feel good-minus the anxiety and depression.  Read your pharmacy hand outs, check Web MD and if your specialist denies your side affect could be related to PTU...get another Doctor!  And if you can't take PTU, you can't take any of the anti thyroid drugs cause they all have about the same side affects.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	3	Female	25-34	2/24/2009 5:24:05 PM	I switched from Tapazole to PTU when I found out I was pregnant and the bitterness after the pill made me more sick than just being pregnant! I tried everything to get rid of the horrible aftertaste that would linger from 5 minutes to 1 hour after taking the pill (4 times a day! Ouch!).After many tries, I found that taking the pill with chocolate milk helped me out at the beginning, but chewing a strong mint gum helped me out even more.  As soon as, or before, the bitter taste started to rise in my throat, I would pop a piece of gum and it did a great job of masking and hiding the bitterness.  Sometimes it would take a second piece of gum about 30 minutes later.  The hardest thing for me was trying to space out 4 pills a day and remembering to do it! Especially when I dreaded it.

I believe I was over medicated and that is why i have hyperthyroidism now. Anyway, this medication tastes very nasty. It leaves a horrible taste in my mouth despite what and how much i eat and drink with it. It's disgusting. It has also made me very nauseaus and I've been vommiting.

THE TASTE IS HORRIBLE, DRINK WARM WATER OR MILK HELPS THE TASTE. THE ANXIETY IS STILL BAD AND MY BODY HURTS BAD. I RAN OUT OF MEDICINE LAST MONTH AND WITHIN 24 HOURS I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO CRAZY, THE SWEATING AND SEVERE BODY HEAT ALONG WITH TREMBLING ANXIETY. ONCE I GOT MY REFILL FEELING A BIT BETTER.

I too get a bitter taste after taking, however, unlike some of you, my appetite seems to have increased!  Any suggestions?
Overactive Thyroid Gland	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/27/2008 4:24:06 AM	PTU took about 4 weeks or more for me to show results in the bloodwork, but many of my symptoms got better more quickly than that (feeling extremely hot, itchy/allergy feeling on my skin, high metabolism).The taste is bad but hasn't made me sick.  My dosage started at 1.5 pills twice a day, and is now 1 pill twice a day.  The taste is not so prevalent now that I don't have to cut the pills.  This taste can last for hours in your mouth...I have noticed this kind of twinge-y reaction in my muscles, like I will reach for something not heavy (like a book) and feel like I just strained a muscle.

At first it was a dificult transition. With a bitter taste and it would make me feel sick to my stomache. The nausea would make me lose my appetite and I would feel overwhelmingly tired. I'v been taking it for a year now and my levels have improved and my Doc has tapered down my dose to once a day. I just hope that I can go into remision soon.

Im not at all happy with it. The taste is unbearable,not to mention the diarrhea, extreme weakness and tiredness, and the headaches. I also have stomache cramps and loss of appetite, which needless to say is not good during pregnancy. Would recommend taking care of thyroid, if possible, before pregnancy. If anything just to avoid this medication.

Overactive Thyroid Gland	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	10/15/2008 7:39:39 PM	I have been taking this medication for two weeks now and I have not really seen any change in my condition.  My doc told me it would take a while to notice the change so I am trying to be patient.  However, I seem to be developing a bad rash all over my calves and shins and am having some seriously bad joint pain in my knees and hips.  I am working on deciding for thyriod surgery or iodine treatment.  I will do one or the other since I have no children yet and want my body to be safe for when I do get pregnant.  Oh, and my suggestion for the taste is, if you can handle it, take the pills with milk.  I put a big drink of milk in my mouth first, then drop the pill in and swallow all.  I then basically chug a whole glass of milk.  It seems to help a little and is good for the ole bones too! Good luck everyone! :)
Overactive Thyroid Gland	Mom-on-Meds, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	10/9/2008 3:01:22 AM	I've read all the reviews posted and for me, I discovered that the fatigue, weakness and inability to sleep was not the medication but my condition.  It does take a while to take effect.  I started out taking in 2x's per day but my blood tests weren't evening out which my endo. recommended I take it 3x's per day.  My hair and nails started to grow back strong which let me know it was working.  I also took the propranolol to help with my heart rate.  My only problem was I was breast feeding my child and the doctor recommended I stop.  He was not very sympathic to the fact I had a child and thought I could just cut my baby off cold turkey.  I would find myself not taking it when I was around her but I'd take the meds at work.  I also noticed when I didn't take it for say a week and tried to start it again, I'd have a reaction with my skin.
Overactive Thyroid Gland in Newborn	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	10/8/2008 5:09:04 PM	I had the radioactive iodine treatment after being diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. After the iodine treatment, my hyperthyroidism was still above average. Around two months after the iodine treatment I became pregnant, and had to continue treatment with PTU. I was afraid of how PTU would affect my child. Because I still had grave's disease my child was born with neonatal hyperthyroidism. I would suggest complete treatment of hyperthyroidism before plans to conceive especially if you do not want your child to go through as much treatment as you've experienced. Since giving birth recently I have tried researching Neonatal Hyperthyroidism, unfortunately there isn't enough information available about the condition. In response to the bitter taste of the medication, I suggest taking it with Cranberry juice.

It has proven to lower my levels back down into the normal range, however I have had serious nausea with this medicine.  I have actually been extremely sick to my stomach and this medication, which I only take one time a day.  Another con to this medicine is that I cannot sleep more than two hours a night.  Nor, do I have an appitite.  As opposed to having the surgery, I am trying to lower my dosage with the pill by taking only half.  Because my levels were so good after four weeks of the medication, I can handle the 'side effects' well enough to continue the pill.

I have an appt. with Doc. to discuss this. If you have these symptoms you should also discuss with your Doc.

My G.p prescribed propranolol 80mg mr capules t allieviate some of the unplesant shaking and anxiety. These worked well for me and I continued to take at same time as antithyroid medication roughly every eight hours, I stopped shaking and was able to go out without feeling too anxious, now another medical person requests that all three capules are taken in one go at night, I don't understand why.

While on this drug I experienced stomach pain.  Years later, I began to experience muscle and joint pain, tingling, and weakness first in my legs then arms.  Also numbness on the right side of my face. I gradually became numb in most of my left foot and areas of my right foot and legs.  After 13 years of medical tests and specialists, my doctor says it is Peripheral Neuropathy but has not found a definite cause.  I am beginning to suspect the 6 years of being on Propylthiouracil might be the cause.  Any help researching this would be welcome. 
Overactive Thyroid Gland	june, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	45-54	4/1/2008 2:28:59 PM	I recently had my thyroid out due to nodules on my thyroid discovered by my gyn not my endo dr. I was on PTU for 9 yrs. My surgeon said my thyroid hardened due to autoimmune symtoms relating to taking PTU. Such as Lupus side effect. Now I am being treated for hypoparathyroidism (I take 4500mg of calcium a day @ the clock) and still recovering from surgery.  My thyroid was imbedded in neck muscles making it difficult in swallowing, talking, and turning my head. I wish now that I knew more about PTU and other options.  My surgeon also told me that PTU is a form of chemotherpy...shocking.
