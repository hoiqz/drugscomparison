I've had to take it because I broke my back from L1-L4 and have had serious muscle issues since. This medication is effective, can make you sleepy at first but it does pass. This medication can be addictive, but that does go along with other medications as well. People will continue to abuse all sorts of medications, and those are the people who make life harder on the others who really need these types of meds.

I have been taking Soma for about 2 years and it really makes a difference. I spent 40 yrs in pain. I take the smallest dose that I can as I don't want to be sedated. As for side effects, the chronic pain made me moody, Soma helps my moods.

I've had severe,chronic pain-5+yrs &amp; several serious medical problems with no hope for cure. I've had signifigant relief with Soma, but at the expense of my family's sanity at times. My husband &amp; kids have threatened to leave me if I don't get my sometimes misuse of this med under control. I've taken Methadone,Morphine,Oxycontin...now Opana,Actiq(fentanyl)suckers, Lyrica &amp; more. I;ve been under control with all, but Soma will sneak up on you quick. By the time you feel anything you're well on your way to trouble. Along with other meds it can make a difference(+ &amp; -)&amp; insomnia can make Somas attractive. Just remember they don't call it a Soma Coma for no reason. With Soma...Less really is more.

It causes parkinsons like tremors, a stupor, seizures, drug seeking behavior, which is in itself familial destructive , i would suggest taking a 5 mg valium before taking even one of these. I know someone that has taken over 15 of these at a time continuously and walked around in a idiotic stupor for 24 hours driving and everything . This drug should be banned completely.

Muscle Spasm		4	5	3			8/19/2008 1:43:59 PM	I'm writing this due to the fact my husband was addicted to this drug from 1977 until he passed away in 1992.  The druggists would refill the prescription over and over without anything from the doctor.  Everytime we moved (4 times) he had it transferred to the that drug store and they would continue to refill w/no questions asked.  I've always suspected he took an overdose because he would take 3 -4 at a time. He lived in constant pain from 3 back surgeries. We didn't have an autopsy so I will never know.  Since he had high blood pressure we were told he had a heart attack.  He was found on the kitchen floor.  I've always had my doubts.  He also had terrible headaches over the years.

It doesn't take away all the pain but makes me more comfortable.  I just started taking Lyrica as well so now I do notice the Soma makes me a little sleepy but it passes.

The withdrawals are serious and could result in what I 've experinced as a seizure! I have had alot of trouble with severe bruising, migraines, nausea, fast heartbeat an a vulva condition called vulvadynia. Also,  I tremor like I have parkinsons disease(a result with the tremors is with or w/o medication.)  May go w./o sleeping for two days at a time when don't have it..which results in sleep dementia and all that entails.I was not warned or told of long time useage so BEWARE!!
