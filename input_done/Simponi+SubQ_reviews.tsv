Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	Heather, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	9/14/2012 4:16:14 AM	I have been on methotrexate pills and injections, enbrel, humira, remicade, and a couple of others I don't even remember the names of. I was 14 when I was diagnosed, and didn't get any results until I was 17 and was put on Remicade, which worked wonders, but I developed a very bad allergy to it, so   my doctor put me on Simponi. It works very well for the first 2 and a half to three weeks of use, but the last week or so it wears off and I have pain and stiffness again. I will say that in between stopping Remicade and starting Simponi, I had severe psoriatic athritis in more than 20 joints and couldn't walk, now, I am almost a normal college student! I'll also add, however, that I have chronic MRSA infections, which didn't occur until I went on this medication. Taken care of by my derm, to be honest it is worth it to be able to walk!
Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	kristi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	8/14/2012 9:13:36 AM	I love that I only have to inject once every four weeks, because I hate injections.  And the duration of the injection is only a couple seconds.  It doesn't sting much during the injection.  I haven't had any injection site reactions (I did with Enbrel).  However, the effectiveness of this drug is not as impreesive as Enbrel was.  I have Psoriatic Athritis and Psoriasis.  The arthritic pain is still there, although not as bad as without the medicine, and I've had a couple flare-ups, which I never had on Enbrel.  The Psoriasis is mostly gone, but there are some persistant spots.  I wish this drug was stronger, or perhaps was done every two or three weeks.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	roxiebum3, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	55-64	6/8/2012 6:25:13 PM	I have had RA for 3 years now. My doctor and I have probably tried about everything including methotrexate,leflunomide,meloicam, indomethacin, sulfasalazin. Also Humaria, Embrel and now Simponi nothing is helping me with the swelling, hurting all the time. Never stops. Any body got any suggestion.

Was on remicade for 7 years with morphine short term and extended relief. Much better control with change to simponi and hydromorphone immediate release and extended   release. 80-90% improvement in daily life. 
Other	erickson12, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	35-44	2/9/2012 2:01:01 PM	I've tried many other types of injection-based arthritis treatments with little help.  I've been on this for 4 months and had almost immediate help in almost eliminating the pain.  However, it only helps for about 2 1/2 weeks, and I can only get the injection every 4 weeks, so I'm still looking for solutions to extend the benefit, but after a this short trial period I am very happy with the results.  I have had no side effects related to this medication either, which is great for me, because anything that causes drowsiness really hits me hard, so my choices are limited.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Lcover, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	1/25/2012 10:58:27 PM	I have been on Simponi for one year and it has been working well. I tend to be a little achy in the last week before the next injection.  It seems to have helped the osteoarthritis in my thumbs as well. It took about 6 months before I really noticed a difference. I haven't had any noticeable side effects at this time. I switched from the auto injector pen to the syringe.  With the syringe I know that I am getting the correct dosage. I sometimes wondered if I was with the auto injector. Methotrexate unfortunately gave me a lung infection &amp; Enbrel had me feeling horrible. So far I have been pleased with Simponi. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	65-74	1/15/2012 10:22:04 AM	This drug works well for me,I have mild RA,I no longer experience swelling in morning &amp; find that my hands work better.  On the last week before I inject I do experience some small difficulties just to let me know that I have RA.  Overall I am well.

I really hate to take the pain killers like vicodin ES and the muscle relaxers , I have kids and i need to be alert and simponi gives me  great relief without the HIGH.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	java7, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	8/29/2011 9:31:12 PM	Been on everything on the books for RA for past 14yrs and Simponi has worked fairly well until recently. Have gone from 3 1/2 wks relief to just about a week and a half at most &amp; back to adding Celebrex x2day. Never had any lumps in armpit as on reader posts but massive welt from time to time at injection site.

I was diagnose with ankylosis Spondilitis, Dec 2001 after a year of search by my wonderfull Dr. that did not give up on me. I worked till my retirement this year. I started on Simponi this February with no side effect, but it took 3 treatment before it made effect. I was on Viox, Celebrex, Naprelan ect. After I was on Remicade for 24 perfusions 1 every 6 weeks till a rejection and bad allergy in Nov 2010. Remicade was great as a pain control for the time my body accepted it. Simponi is great but it is hard to get the autoinjection, only the injection has been available for the last 6 months.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Selinak, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	8/9/2011 5:27:44 PM	I was diagnosed w/RA back in '94. I was on Humira which was virtually ineffective for me. My MD put me on Methotrexate and Simponi and I've been taking it for the last 4 mos. I do feel much better but the other day I just noticed a large lump under my armpit which was not there before and I am nervous about it. I'm waiting for my doctor to see me. Has anyone noticed anything like this?

Rheumatoid Arthritis	alee.martin, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	6/24/2011 8:57:55 PM	I was changed to Simponi from Humaira 3 months ago. I am also still on Methotrexate. It is very likely to soon to make a judgement but I am not seeing any relief. Fortunately I am not having any adverse effects. I know there is no miracle. I could just use some relief....
Other	 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	5	1			6/18/2011 3:45:42 PM	I have been taking Simponi for about 6 months for AS and have not had any improvement.  I have to take 600 mg of Ibuprophin and Tramadal at least 3-4 times a day for the pain. 
Other	megan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/12/2011 8:07:32 PM	I was dx with Ankylosing Spondolyitis about 3 yrs ago and have been thru all other meds.  Recently my pharmacy was unable to get the simponi, so I have been 2 months w/o for the first time since I started it 1 year ago.  I certainly notice a difference!  The only thing is that my husband says that I am a &quot;different person&quot; personality wise now than when I am on it.  Has anyone else noticed an emotional/personality changes while taking it?  I also seem to have more problems keeping on task and paying attention to details while I am not on it.  Am I just crazy?  It's such a difference that he asked me not go back on it and seek out something else.

Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	ktinker, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	2/20/2011 12:51:34 PM	I took my first injection of Simponi two weeks ago.  Within 30 seconds of the injection I had tingling of my tongue and rapid heart rate.  The tingling spread to my lips and face.  I had brief episodes of dizziness. My blood pressure increased. Our roads were iced over, so I spoke with the doctor who told me to monitor my blood pressure.  It would come in waves.  After about four hours I stabilized.  I have had brief episodes of dizziness over the past two weeks (5 seconds or so at a time).  Friday my blood pressure again increased from my normal rate of 125/69 to 189/90, I felt short of breath, nauseated and my face was flushed. My BP would stabilize and spike.  I went to the ER, was administered aspirin and something for nausea. My tests were all normal.  They released me when my BP became normal for several hours. Saturday night I had one episode of spiking BP.  Other than this issue the Simponi is working well.  It's so confusing.  Simponi is the only new medication I have taken in the past six months.  I was diagnosed 15  years ago and have been on Humira, Enbrel, and placquenil (with no side-effects). I am currently on methotrexate and Simponi. Has anyone had this experience with Simponi? 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Pattyr, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	12/21/2010 6:40:06 AM	I have taken this drug for 3 months and have itching on my back only and have developed white colored (2) lesions looking like basal cell and seeing my Dermatologist this week for both items.  
Rheumatoid Arthritis	DACC, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	45-54	11/19/2010 1:43:38 PM	Here is an update, I still feel fine yet thumb joint hurts a little and wrist. My doc and a ER doc (long story) agree that Simponi raise my BP to stage 2 level. The ER could bearly bring it down. This happens with a drug induce BP. High blood pressure is one of the symptoms, that is low on the list for side effects. It almost killed me. I was 25 points away from having a stroke. I had slight high BP before Simponi, but that was because I was on a steroid at the time and my Rummy did not wait for me to get off it first. So if you have high BP, I would think about the risk big time. I am now 2 weeks off drug and my BP is slowly coming down. How much did my BP go up? More then 50 points in a least 5 days. Rummy office 150/ 90 and 5 days later 210/112.My rummy wants me to take another drug for BP so I can take Simponi. YA Right. Take a drug to take a drug. Good Luck to those who are thinking about Simponi.

For me the Simponi is WONDERFUL!!! It starts working within 2 days and lasts almost the full month instead of 3 weeks like the other drugs did. My range of motion is greater and I have less pain unless I over-do (which in itself a miracle that hasn't happened in a LONG time - imagine - me, over-doing it! I usually can't even DO it - let alone &quot;over-do&quot; it!)

I have had RA for over 15 yrs and the only drug I have done is Humira for 1 1/2. It wane out. I got my first shot from my doc for free to see what might happen. The only complaint is it rose my blood pressure way up and that caused headaches. Now the weird part is I not going to get another shot due to these reasons. Yet it has been a month and I still feel great. I think it might have sent me into a remission or something. Wil tell after 2 more weeks. Try to post an updat then.

I started simponi on 10/28/10. I had 5 really great days,then it stopped. Now I am really frustrated. I will continue for another couple of months  but have little hope that this will work for any length of time. Given the cost benefit ratio not sure it is worth it. Wish it were as I am near the end of my rope. 62 and trying to work but it is not easy.

I am taking plaquenil and sulfasalzine. I have tried Humera and Enbrel. I just had my second dose of Simponi and have noticed a huge difference. I am feeling so much better. I still have difficult days, but the good days are increasing. I urge you to talk to your Doc about this wonder drug.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Brian L, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	7/28/2010 6:22:03 PM	I have been on Simponi for 3 months now and have been mostly pain free from the first day I took it.  I had had so much pain in my shoulders that I could not sleep even with even with all the narcotics I tried.  I have slept very well since the day I started Simponi.  My wrists, hands, and knees are also greatly improved.  I have gone from 150 Tylenol 3's a month to 30.  The only reaction I have had is slightly raised blood pressure.  So far every injection has lasted the full month, as advertised.  I still can not work but Simponi has given my day to day life back to me, pain free.  Some mornings I have a little stiffness in my shoulders and hands, but that is usually gone in an hour or so.  I also take 20mg Arava every other day and 75mg SR Diclofenac and 400mg Plaquenil daily.  It is unbelievable how such a small dose of medication can make such a huge difference!!  I am absolutely thrilled with the way  it has worked for me.

Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/21/2010 11:29:30 AM	I am a 41 yr old who has suffered 12 yrs with severe PA (psoriatic arthritis). Simponi has been the only drug so far that has truly helped my symptoms.  I do not have flare-ups anymore after one year on the shots. I am suppose to be taking it in conjunction with methotrexate to keep my psoriasis in check; however, I feel so badly after taking the methotrexate that I discontinued it.  Therefore, I still have trouble with my psoriasis but the arthritis is so much better.  I feel like I gained a new life back!  I teach school so I am on my feet all day.  I had a much better school year this past year.  I feel the gains outweigh the risks as I have struggled with constant flare-ups.

Found out via daughter I also have anlylosing spondilitis (AS-am HLA-B27 Pos) which my doc things has been active for 30 years.  Went on Simoponi April 5, 2009.  After 2 months I could wear my wedding band again.  I have a much lower incidence of rheumatoid fatigue (down from several days a week to one or 2 days during 2-3 weeks.)  Still flare occasionally, but a methylprednisone dose pack usually is enough extra to settle the joint back down.  To me this drug is a big improvement..I only hope it keeps working as well. I was close to the wheelchair when we caught all this.  Because of the drugs--the many many drugs--and proper gym work, I have done a breast cancer walk, and last weekend certified as an open water scuba diver.  Better living thru chemistry!

I am very pleased with the pain relief I have received by using this medication.  However, usually about three days after injection, I develop several large red areas that look somewhat like hives, except they are very sensitive to touch and cause me to have to take other medications to relieve the itching.  During this time I also am very sick to my stomach.  I don't throw up, I just feel bad.  I am symptom free for only aboout 10 days out of the month, but I am very happy with the pain relief.

I am 46 years old and have had Rheumatoid Arthritis for 36 of those years.  I have been on alot of different medications during that time.  Including Enbrel, Remicade and Orencia.  None of them have worked like Simponi has for me.  I gave myself my first injection and felt almost immediate relief.  I couldn't believe it!  I am really excited about Simponi!!
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Beeper, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/2/2009 10:57:38 PM	I have been on Simponi since July 09 (now Dec. 09), in conjunction with Methotrexate.  Prior to July 09, just doing the grocery store was really difficult.  My feet in particular have been quite affected by the RA.  However, now I can do everything I was able to before all of this started (in the spring of 2008).  No problems with the Simponi injections, no reaction issues - just relief from the dreadful joint pain in my feet, knees, shoulders, and neck.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Nancyexpressinc, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/21/2009 2:08:45 PM	I have only had one shot, but within 24 hrs I had no more pain. On a scale of 1-10, with one being the least, I was @ a 5 all the time. I am hoping to reduce other medications that I was already taking, since I am on Simponi. I start reducing Prednisone with my 2nd shot. I am so pleased and I pray that I can get off all other medication.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	lizhemsm, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	45-54	9/10/2009 10:11:05 AM	The first month I got a yeast infection after 4 days, month 2 I got another yeast infection then I started itching and burning all over my body. If I scratched a spot it welted up but then went away if I stopped scratching that area. 12 days into the 2nd shot and I am still itching all over my body and welting up. I am living on benadril and pretty miserable. My skin is very sensitive and hurts if I put any pressure on my skin it burns and hurts. My hands are the worst, even washing them makes them burn because you use a towel to dry them.
