COPD with Chronic Bronchitis	Beki, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	65-74	9/29/2012 9:53:03 PM	I had to stop taking this drug because my hips and legs hurt so bad that I couldn't sleep at night.  As long as I was moving Or walking i was ok, but when I sat down or laid down I hurt really bad.  I was taking Vicodin for the pain so I could take the dilaresp for my lungs.  Not good.

I have decided the side affects are worth it so I would have very few flare ups. I take an ativan to help me feel somewhat better after taking the daliresp, it makes me feel  better. Atleast I can breathe now without laboring. Good Luck To everyone taking this drug, I hope it works for you.
COPD with Chronic Bronchitis	pat emory, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	55-64	9/10/2012 6:10:30 AM	Since I have been taking this drug, 1 month, I have noticed the last week, my insomnia is very bad. My breathing was better in the early stages of the drug, but so far the last week, it hasn't helped hardly at all with my shortness of breath. It might be because the drug makes me very nervous, therefor limiting my air flow. Another thing I have noticed is its like my body feels like its going numb or something, like the air isn't reaching my legs and arms. Kinda of like when the attacks come.  I will call my doctor today, because I think this is why my body feels so weird and I have shortness of breath worse than when I started the drug. For the people it helps, I'm very glad for you, and hopefully one day another drug, without the side affects will come out!

At first I experienced extreme diarreha and nausea and vomiting.Also muscle cramps from the loss of potassium. It has now been thirty days and the diarrreaha has subsided but the nausea remains with every dose with loss of appetite. Breathing has been a lot easier though not needing to use the rescue meds as often now.

COPD with Chronic Bronchitis	Treso, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	8/6/2012 11:22:28 AM	I took this drug for four days before I noticed any changes other than insomnia (big time)and headache (big time). Then, on the fifth dose I noticed I was having thoughts on how best to leave this world. I started having diarrhea and the worst was the low back pain and sciatica like symptoms down the back of both legs. The pain was only alleviated with ice packs. No amountaspirin, ibuprofen or Tylenol could touch it. I did notice after the fifth day that I was breathing quite a bit better and not having as many bronchospasms. I decided to try alternating the dose one day on, one day off. No help with adverse side effects. I skipped three days in between doses; also with no help. I don't think I can stand to take this med due to the back pain, headache, depressive thoughts and diarrhea. I wonder if a person took it for a couple of months would the bad side effects go away?Thanks for listening.

I am on full time o2 and still having shortness of breath issues. I also have some loss of appetite issues which is ok since I need to lose weight. I have swelling in my ankles and I wonder if this drug is causing that.

I am, however, experiencing some short-term dizziness after standing up.  Otherwise, it seems to help the flare-ups.
COPD with Chronic Bronchitis	wigleyb36, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		6/15/2012 4:32:06 PM	I have been taking Daliresp about a year now.  It has helped me immensely.  Before I began Daliresp I could hardly move without being Short of breath.  My FEV1 was at 27%.  I visited my lung doctor this week and my FEV1 is now 48% and I am very rarely short of breath.  I feel like a new man.  I did lose 20lbs but the weight loss slowly ceased and now is stable.  I needed to get rid of a few pounds anyway.   I would recommend Daliresp to anyone with COPD.

COPD with Chronic Bronchitis	LLS, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	65-74	5/18/2012 11:57:52 AM	Have taken for about 3 months.  IT WORKS!  I had been having flare ups every couple of weeks - just finish one round of prednizone and anti-biotics and a week later would have to start again.  Have not had a flare up with Dalisrep.  BUT - I have had to stop taking.  Felt nauseous  all the time.  No appitite.  Lost 16 pounds since first of March. Absolutely miserable.  Called my doctor yesterday and he told me to stop.  I hope something can be done to tone down the side effects because it certainly does what it says in the treatment of COPD.

Both times when I take Daliresp 250 mg or 500mg both meds would not allow me to sleep at all.  It was like someone had propped my eyes open.  Also had leg cramps, extreme tiredness, made me very nervous and anxious.  My system just won't tolerate this med.  When checking with mfg I found out there is a lot of side effects and mine was nominal compared to the complete list.

Before taking Daliresp I could barely walk 20 steps without having to stop, I now can double that. Recovery time of catching my breath is cut in half and my doctor can actually hear air moving in my lungs when before it was very deminished. I have been on this for 4 months with no problems.

I lost my appetite and consequently my blood pressure decreased and I felt faint and light headed. I do not know if these side effects would lessen over time, because my doctor told be to stop taking Daliresp after 10 days. This did not help my breathing as others have claimed. 
Other	Denise Parsons, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/22/2011 7:26:21 AM	This drug is an adjunctive medication to my daily medication therapy for severe COPD. I feel it has been very instrumental in decreasing the audible wheezing and  increasing my lung fuction as well as my activity level. Yes, I have noticed occas. tremors and dizziness but the rescue inhalers contribute to these side effects as well. It is difficult to distinguish which causes what. The benefit of Daliresp outweighs the side effects. The one thing I have noted but unable to contribute to Daliresp is the muscle cramping. I have developed intermittent severe cramping in my lower extremities. The other thing I would suggest is LOWER THE COST OF THE DRUG. Two hundred dollars a month is a high cost to pay for any medication, even the Canadian pharmacy charges $225. Thank God that my pulmanologist has given me samples on occasion. I would recommend the medication to anyone who deals with COPD.

I was dx'ed 4/2011 and have taken since may.

I have also had decreases appetite, headaches, and sinusitis.  Glad this is the last week I have to take it.  We'll have to come up with another treatment if the difficulty breathing every time I go outside comes back.
