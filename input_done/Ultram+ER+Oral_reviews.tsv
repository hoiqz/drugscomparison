It got to be too much for me to take that many pills..so we switched to Ultram er 300 mg a day. It is a miracle drug for me. It doesn't make me feel 'high' like other pain meds do. I can function, feel normal and be pain free. Still having pain during night, but for the most part this with my Lyrica has worked wonders. Highly recommend trying this if you need.

The only side effects I've had are difficulty in urination and sleepiness, but those are manageable.  I like it because it doesn't make me feel &quot;weird&quot; like most painkillers do.  It also seems to work better if taken with 1 regular strength tylenol.

Neuropathic Pain	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	55-64	12/8/2009 6:17:57 PM	This is a great drug to use to get off of narcotic pain killers once the pain has begun to subside.  I found 200 mg needed for any real impact and I take another 200 late in the pm to help with night activities.  There is some itching but not bad.  Regarding stomach, it depends what you eat.   If you eat rich or gasey foods it does not work but basic fiber and fruit etc tend to make things tolerable.  Experiment with diet.  I have found that the effect wears off with time BUT there is still an impact and much fewer side effects than with narcotic pain killers etc.  A good drug overall.  Start with 50 going to 100 a week later and 200 a week after than and you will not notice the side effects.  At lease for me.  Good luck to all.

This med killed the pain so I could function and could sleep thru the night while I healed.  My only complaint was after 30 days on it, an abrupt stop to the medication when I finished the prescription did result in withdrawal symptoms:  chills, sweats, and slight tremors that lasted for about 4 days.  Not horrible, but noticeable.  People should be weaned off it.

Also, an added benefit for me is that it took my lowered my appetite, especially for sweets. I have dropped a dress size.

Chronic Pain	meredith, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/20/2009 10:35:25 PM	Several months ago I fell and fractured a pelvic bone - Pubic Ramus  - 5 cm fx. Anyone familiar with this fx knows it is very painful. After 2 1/2 months my x-rays showed considerable healing and new bone growth. I was informed by my ortho that the muscles would eventually lose the edema and inflamation. Facing returning to work as a busy pharmcacy tech, knowing that I could not continue taking Norco - I asked my PCP for a drug I could take and still function. I must be able to think! He recommended Ultram ER - the first few days I really didn't notice that much relief - by the 4th day I felt 10 years younger, could move and walk freely and the pain in my side was gone. It was a miracle! I ran out of the sample on the weekend and by Monday am - i could hardly move. I have experienced a great relief from hip/side pain - also the stiffness in my hands/feet has improved. I have experienced no side effects. Having taken several different pain relievers as well as muscle relaxants, I would highly recommend Ultram ER. I have now taken the 200 mg dose, once daily for one month and it has greatly improved my quality of life, movement, work and mental attitude. When you suffer dibilitating pain for a long period, you &quot;wait&quot; for it to come back as the medication wears off. I no longer have that dread, the Ultram ER seems to relieve it on a steady basis. No, I am not always pain free or uphoric - I just feel normal - I still have some pain - but nothing I can't tolerate. I am 61 years old and work fulltime - I take care of a 2 story split/level home - so their are stairs everywhere. I can now go up them again at a quick pace without the banister ( I was pulling myself up before). I am so thankful to be painfree and not &quot;drugged&quot;.

I had very limited range of motion in my shoulder and could not lift anything over 5 pounds.  With bursitis and arthritis also aggravating the shoulder, I was ready for surgery. I went to an Orthopedic doctor and was put on Utram ER 200mg once a day.  I have been on it for a month now, even though I am on Lexapro, and the Utram ER has worked incredibly well.  I now have to be careful now not to injure my shoulder further, because I can move it so freely now without pain that I am using the arm in ways that I haven't been able to in years.  My shoulder lets me know within hours of a missed dose because the pain starts returning and the strength is limited.

In particular, my hip kept me from doing just everyday things around the house.  At last my doctor put me on Vicodin.  Of course, I couldn't stay on Vicodin so she started me on Ultram ER, 50 mg.  About a week or so of taking this medication, I was able to walk and do most all the tasks I need and want to do.  I highly recommend this, I have no side effects from these pills.

That helped a lot, but I still had residual pain in my legs and feet.My doctor switched me from oxycodone to Ultram ER and the difference was IMMEDIATE. I had been taking oxycodone for so long that it wasn't very effective, but once I switched to Ultram, ALL of my neurologic pain has vanished.No itching, no nausea, no other side effects. This medicine has literally gotten my life back to normal overnight.

I have taken 200 MG for two days and the pain is gone.  I don't like the side effects of nausea and itching.  The itching is tolerable, but I have asked for something else as the nausea is unbearable.  Does the nausea stop after the medicine has been in your system.

Neuropathic Pain	charlotte, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	3/5/2009 3:36:04 PM	ULTRAM ER 300MG WITHDRAWALI have a large paracentral and foraminal disk extrusion at C6-7 level also shallow central disk protrusion from C2-C5 with narrowing.  I have had pain for the last 8 yrs so severe at times have discussed with Dr Barth Green at UOM the possibility of surgery.  He claims he will not open my neck unless I am in so much pain that I cannot tolerate it.  I appreciate his conservative approach.  After speaking with several post-ops with same cervical extrusions for 15 cases 1 success 14 nightmares.  Pain was relieved but now other issues.  I have tried everything from physical therapy, trigger point injections to enough pain killers and muscle relaxers to kill a horse and never seemed to get any relief.  After seeing my neurologist due to migraine that lasted 9 weeks he suggested Ultram ER.  I had taken Ultram back in the day and it did nothing for the pain and made me sick.  It was the last step before surgery.  I am on 300mg a day and I have had absolutely NO pain or like I call them the electric shocks that run down the right side of my body and send me into orbit and make me look like Elaine from Seinfeld dancing.  The only issue is the withdrawal.  I did not pick up a prescription for a couple days after my prior one ran out and the withdrawal was the WORST!  I was sweating but had goose bumps the size of golf balls and was freezing to death, nose running, anxiety, shakes, skin crawling and NO sleep.  I did some research online and found they have documented the withdrawal is comparable to a morphine withdrawal (I have a new found respect for drug addicts).  This is something you must taper off of.  I am scared to death to stay on this any longer even with the benefit of NO pain.  The withdrawal is not something I ever want to experience again.  I am now finding that if I do not take the dosage by the same time each day I start the withdrawal symptoms (not as severe as not taking for several days).  I dont know if I am just very sensitive

Chronic Pain	Tenbootsy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	2/5/2009 1:59:21 AM	I took the first pill and felt some relief.  I took the second pill and was fine for the first 12 hours.  I then was flushed, shaking, disoriented and lightheaded to the point of nearly passing out.  Called 911 and my blood pressure was 161/110 (I'm usually 110/70).  I now have splitting headache and still feel &quot;weird&quot;.  I would not take this again.
Chronic Pain	Lenora, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/15/2009 10:46:27 AM	The first day I took Ultram ER, I took it late at night before going to bed. It took my pain completely away, but the next day I felt sleepy. So the skipped a day, and started taking it around 8:00 p.m. and I felt no sleepiness the next day. I was just pain free. I cal lit my miracle drug. An added benefit for me is that it took my lowered my appetite, especially for sweets.

Chronic Pain	kane420x, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	25-34	1/1/2009 10:39:42 PM	I started taking ultram er 200 mg for back and hip pain. Taking it at night makes me feel loopy and tired the next day. better off taken it first thing in the morning. have also experienced lack of sexual desire and abilty to ejaculate. once i stop taken it everything goes back to working order. had no withdrawl symptons at all. do not recommend breaking tablet open as it effects you way to fast. also i get aggetated alot fast than normal and smaller things start bothering me. noises seem alot louder than what they are and my ears make a funny humming noise. almost pain free after 3rd but cant wait to being able to stop using this drug!!!
Chronic Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/30/2008 7:22:08 PM	I have been on everything under the sun. you name it I have tried it for CRPS, Ultram ER is one of the best with little side effects, I take 300mg (the max)each night before I go to bed and feel GREAT in the morning, I live without Narcotics because of it. I have tried Ultram and Tramadol and found them to be less effective then the extended release. There are going to be side effects with any meds that you take, I would rather small side effects than debilitating pain and live a happy life.
Chronic Pain	Angie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	35-44	12/25/2008 11:21:40 AM	I take this medication for adhesions from multiple surgeries (15) and chronic kidney stones.  I made the mistake of splitting a 200 mg pill (on the advice of an ER doc).  It released the medication too quickly and the next morning I had what felt like severe flu symptoms (shaking, sweating, chills, vomiting, etc) This medication has helped my chronic pain so that I am able to lead a much more normal life.  My only complaint would be that it makes me lathargic the next morning and if I am just an hour late on my dosage I get the shakes and feel the flu like symptoms.  After suffering for 10 years, I have found a very effective pain killer.

Tramadol was too much but Ultram ER has been helpful for me. Takes some getting used to but better than harder drugs for me.  Been on it for 2+ years at only 200mg a day each morning.  Take it with food and consistently and don't miss a dosage to avoid side effects.

I was in the hospital for 3 days,Whle there I experienced multiple events of irregular heart beats(never before). All test indicated no permanent damage, but now I suffer  from high blood pressure(never before),&amp; I live with the concerned of the elevated risk of another stroke. This drug should not be allowed to be given to anyone.
Neuropathic Pain	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	25-34	10/30/2008 8:56:13 AM	Was prescribed 300mg dose for sciatica.  Took one dose two days ago at 6pm.  Pain was totally gone within an hour.  Six hours later, neausea, vomiting, dizziness, stiff muscles, drowsy, weak, exhausted.  Haven't taken another dose.  Will call Dr. to see if a lesser dose would be appropriate.  Major concern here is that I'm about 90lbs and was given max dose to start.  With the severe side effects I'd suggest talking with your Dr. to be sure you're starting on a low enough dose to avoid the side effects.  I don't understand why anyone would be given the max dosage to start.  It's much easier to increase dosage if needed than to deal with horrible side effects to start with.  There is no way I can handle the side effects long enough for my body to get used to this dose.  If you've been given this medication and have severe side effects, check with your Dr about the dosage.

I have pain in my hips and the muscles going down to the knee.  This is the worst medicine I have ever taken.  I took one pill at 10pm and the next day I felt dizzy, nausea, flu symptoms, itchy.  I was like this the next day, all day.  It makes you very tired and sleepy, but doesn't do a thing for the pain.  The side effects are so bad, I would never take this again.
Chronic Pain	jcar323, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	35-44	9/11/2008 11:59:38 AM	I suffer from multiple disc hernitations as well as spinal stenosis and complete loss of lumbar curve. I was taking Norco 10/325 and Skelaxin t try and relieve my pain. I began taking WAY too many Norco's over the course of a day (10-12). My doctor just switched me to Ultram ER 300mg, Oxycodone 5/325 and Skelaxin 800mg. I was wondering if anyone else is taking this combination and if so what kind of side effects are you experiencing?

Chronic Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	8/4/2008 3:05:35 PM	I have been taking this drug for about 2 years. At first I started out with 200mg. It was horrible. It knocked me out, made me feel weird and I was throwing up every few days. I thought I would get adjusted to it, but I did not. The only good thing is it worked on the pain. I was put on something else. Later my Dr. moved, new Dr put me back on Ultram (Tramadol) on a lower dose. 50 mg. I was reluctant but tried it. It worked so well. It really takes care of the pain and I do not have the side effects. The only problem now is if I take it late in the day it interrupts my sleep at night. Its hard to fall asleep and stay asleep. If I miss a dose, I will get a really bad headache. If I'm religious about taking it regulary, it works really well. I will continue to take the 50mg.

Chronic Pain	ket, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	35-44	6/4/2008 10:24:17 PM	I have had lower back and leg pain for past 15 years. Don't know what is causing pain as of yet. I live in pain daily either from back or my legs. I am now seeing someone to try and figure out what exactly is causing this, meanwhile the doctor gave me this to try, as I have been taking hydrocodone for pain, but that didn't take care of it all the way. Ultram ER, I took it yesterday at about 8pm, felt fine, slept fine, but this morning!, wow! absolutley pain free, not even a twinge of pain. BUT I have thrown up, and it is now 9pm the following day and I have been spaced out all day, feel like I have been dizzy all day, do not like the feeling, so don't think I will take it again, unless I can get a lowere dose, as mine was 200mg sample.  Love the relief it gave, but not the messed up feeling.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	5/30/2008 12:57:46 AM	I got hit by a car and my knee and lower back got injured.  I have a pinched siatic nerve and two bulging disks in my lower back.  And now my knee has heeled.  I quit the meds and went through withdrawl from them, and didn't know what I was experiencing. I felt as if I was missing something, for almost two weeks.  There weren't any side effects, but I learned that I could go longer than 24 hours at times without taking another pill if I was late, it really didn't matter.  It didn't completly take away the pain but it made it bearable.  I couldn't take hydrocodone, because it messed with my blood pressure too much and the darvocets made me sleep all the time.  On this I didn't feel tired, or anything that any of these people that had side effects experienced.
Chronic Pain	wee1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	5/29/2008 2:06:56 PM	Doctor put me on 200mg about a week ago to help with chronic pain from headaches caused by a bludging disc in my neck and oestoarthritis. I take 200mg of Celebrex to help with the arthritis and the Ultram is for the actual headaches.Formerly I was taking regular tramadol dosed at 100mg every 6 hours as needed. My doctor chose to put me on Ultram ER at 200mg in hopes that it would help manage my headaces better by lasting longer in my system.So far its been okay. Like any drug it needs to be taken at the first sign of pain however, that it not as easy as it sounds. I've found if I'm in a lot of pain 7-8+ it seems to work better if I take it with Arthritis Strenght Tylenol and 10mg Flexerial. The combination really helps alleviate the pain to the point where it is manageable.  
Chronic Pain	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	19-24	5/25/2008 7:39:07 PM	I am only taking 50 mg, but it is every 6 hours.  I am having no side effects so far, I believe this is due to the fact that it is a low dose.  It was prescribed to me for back pain.  The pain is not completely gone, but definitely reduced.  Overall, I think it is a good medication.

Other		4	5	3			5/7/2008 1:35:02 AM	Was given sample of Ultram ER from doc &amp; an increase in strength of vicodin...doc wanted me to try both (at different times) to see which worked best for my pain. I tried Ultram ER the 1st time today...initially I thought it worked better than stronger vicodin, but it knocked me out.  1 dose at 200 mg...I slept all day, felt &quot;weird&quot; &amp; I itch like crazy...the itching is driving me crazy.  Was glad for the sleep it induced, for sleep isn't easy to come by when you have severe pain, &amp; it did alleviate my pain, but I don't think I like being so out of it &amp; weak feeling...utterly weak &amp; itching like mad....STILL.  Luckily my doc gave me a free sample of this &amp; I didn't have to waste my money on this.  I guess in an emergency pain situation, like I was in, I'd probably take it again if nothing else helped my pain, but now I can't sleep due to this horrific itching.  Yes, it also killed my appetite &amp; made me fuzzy-headed...unable to think...but this itching, whoa, this is unreal!  How long until it gets out of my system?  Yikes!  I'm itching all over, like I have chicken pox or a gazillion mosquito bites all over!  This drug has made me nauseated, too.  Nah, maybe I won't take it again.

It's not particularly good for acute pain, but it works very well for chronic pain management. I can actually work and perform at a high level while taking Ultram. Can't do that while taking the heavy narcotics. I just switched to the Ultram ER. I'll know more about it's effectiveness in a week or so.

I also had to get adjusted to the medication. It does make you loopy and sleepy. Maybe even nauseated. But this does go away. The pain has significantly decreased but not totally gone.

I took the first pill and it didn't seem to help.

I am very displeased with my doctor, this drug. I wonder if any real clinical trials were done on this medication!
Chronic Pain	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	13-18	3/19/2008 8:00:39 PM	I take 200mg of Ultram ER every morning for chronic knee and back pain. Unfortanetly, it only takes about 75% of my knee pain away and my back still hurts. It definitly reduced the severity of my pain, but when I don't take it, my pains get worse. When I first started taking Ultram, I got very itchy and felt like I was catching the flu (nausa, head spins, chills, etc.). I stopped taking the pills for about two days and I no longer felt sick but was in alot of pain, so I decided to try the medication again. The sick feeling came again with itches but finaly went away after about 4 days of taking the pill every morning.

Within 3 days my pain was almost non existent.  This medicine has been a miracle for me in the sense of tremendously helping my pain.  However since on Ultram ER I always feel short of breathe and my blood pressure and heart rate have increased. I'm not sure if it is from this medicine or not though.  I have now tried several times to get off this medicine  to see if it's causing my other symptoms and just missing one dose my pain starts to return and I notice that I'm shaky and just don't feel well overall so I'm not sure how I'll be able to get past the withdrawal symptoms.

While it relieved the pain a bit, the side effects were horrendous. I was dizzy, nauseated, had dry mouth, slept fitfully for over 24 hours, was shaky and somewhat disoriented and agitated for the first 24 hours. Symptoms lessened somewhat the next 24 hours, and am close to normal some 72 hours later. Living with the pain -as bad as it is - is better than living with these side effects

My doctor suggested Utram ER at night.  I am amazed.  I sleep at night, wake up without the need to take a pain pill, and can go almost all day with only needing to take one hydrocodone.  This drug has been a miracle for me.  I am on my second month of using it.

However, I was pleased that it did not have any strong side effects for me.  I usually find myself dizzy and sick the whole time I am on these types of medications, this worked much better for me.

Chronic Pain	mason, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	45-54	12/2/2007 8:47:39 PM	This drug has been prescribed to me for chronic pain due to a disc removal and fusion in 2001.  Since, I have experienced a great loss of sexual desire and thought, loss of erection.  I have however been able to return to work as a mason, and work six days a week.  I also take Norco with this drug.  When I stop taking Ultram er 200 for a few days I can acheieve an erection....

I took narcotics everyday either for headache, leg pain or back pain.  Some months I have cut my narcotic use by 75%.  Stormy months my narcotic use is still down.  It also helps me sleep at night.  I use to wake up after about 3 hours of sleep and walk the floors until my narcotic would take effect.  Now I sleep through the night and seldom need other help.  My husband also takes this drug and if he skips a couple of days he can hardly move.  Like I said I call it my wonder drug.

I also have bi-lateral stenosis, and my orthopedic gave me vicodin, until my primary Dr. told her he didn't want me to have it, now she won't give it to me either....I continue to suffer, and loose much needed sleep

Side effects are: dizzy, lightheaded, throwing up and loss of appetite.

Lyrica has worked very well the only problem I have is I tremble and shake sometimes and my mouth is always dry to the point of my lips are dry including my vagina area. I don't know if its so bad that I have to stop taking the medicine and it makes me feel druged up but other than that it works very well, I also take amitriptyline,lyrica, metoclopramide, furosemide, nexium,potassium, coumadin, aspirin, multi vitamin omega369, b-complex and b12, lutein, vitamin e and noni juice. If there is anything you can suggest to me I would greatly appreciate it thank you.
