Birth Control	mis, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	9/4/2012 2:56:08 AM	I've been using micronor for two years now and throughout that time period, i have experienced periods of time where i'll have my period for three weeks at a time sometimes. micronor is easy to take and hasnt decreased my sex drive at all. i dont get acne either but i cant deal with the incredibly irregular menstruation. prior to this pill, i was always regular with my period last 5-7 days max. now i cant guarantee anything and so i plan on switching. i really dont recommend this pill if it can be avoided.

Do not do it. Find another method that suits you best. I was on Orthocyclen and I never had issues with it. I think I'll be switching back asap.

For the first three, I had lighter but very irregular periods, rangeing from 25 to 50 days.  The last year, I have been having very frequent, painful, and heavy periods, sometimes bleeding 3 of 4 weeks.  I have just switched and hope the new pill is better.  I also hope it doesn't decrease my sex drive like micronor did.
Other	tipptipp85, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	19-24	12/13/2011 9:50:47 PM	Went to the E.R. because I was bleeding since October 24, 2011 until December 2, 2011. The E.R. didn't give me anything so I had to wait until my Ob/gyn visit to get something to stop bleeding.The ob/gyn gave me a 10 day supply of Medroxyprogesterone that worked 2 days after taking it. I was extremely happy with the results especially not bleeding. after taking all ten of the pills I experienced bleeding again when I statred taking the Micronor. I was outraged went from having little comfort from bleeding to bleeding all over again my sex life I terrible because of this. I suggest to any one please do not take Micronor because it really doesn't work at all that's my opinion of this .Try something else especially if you're sexually active your love life will be seriously interuppted if you take Micronor.

Birth Control	Hiswife, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	10/30/2011 7:24:18 PM	I have been taking this b/c for 3 months. And my husband and I have been enjoying our intimate lives. However, I have been experiencing severe acne (which i've never had) and breakthrough bleeding. That's the biggest downfall.
Birth Control	 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		2/7/2011 1:27:06 PM	I have used Micronor (28) since 1998 and it's GREAT! No periods, or any other side effects.
Birth Control	BPsLady, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	11/15/2010 5:32:16 PM	I started taking Nora-BE in September, and it has been a God send for me.  I used to have periods that were so heavy I would use 2 large bags of pads, tampons were a waste of money. Now my periods are manageable, I do get minor cramps which I never did before, but no ovulation pain, and a lighter period, I will deal with the cramps.  My only problem with them is I have break through bleeding.  I take the pill every morning at 830am thanks to my cell phone alarm.  I have also noticed when he gets a little rough with me, I bleed where I never did before..does anyone else have that problem?
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	7/20/2010 11:11:31 PM	I haven't had much trouble taking it, an alarm works great! I have been off by a few hrs. a couple times in the past 1 1/2 yrs of using it- I never use condoms and haven't gotten pregnant (Not that I would recommend that). I have however gained about 20 lbs and haven't been able to loose it as easily as before I was on the pill. I still get a monthly period but it is regular and very rarely is there spotting.
Birth Control	Jen, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/28/2010 2:42:27 PM	I've been taking this pill for almost a year now, and so far I'm pretty satisfied with it. My periods have stopped completely and I've never experienced and spotting. There have been several times that I forgot to take the pill (I always use condoms as well though) and I don't think I ever take my pill at the same time everyday. I recently started getting a bit of acne though (I've never had skin problems in my life), I'm not too sure if this is related to the pill or something else in my diet though. Before I began taking this pill I was using Depo-Provera (the shot), and I've found the pill to be just as easy and great to use, very little to no side-effects. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	3/4/2010 2:05:06 AM	First off I took this pill everyday at the same exact time. I even bought an alarm for it. SO my problems were not due to not taking the pill incorrectly.Within two days of my first pill I was extremely moody, had severe migraines, gained 15lbs (so bloated with water my fingers were swollen), had extreme acne (have never suffered bad skin before), lost hair and lost my sex drive completely.After one week I had extremely heavy bleeding that lasted three more weeks until my doctor stopped me from taking it because I was anemic. I immediately returned to normal after stopping, I was placed back on orthotricyclen lo and am doing wonderful.I would NEVER take this again, and would never ever recommend taking this to anyone. I wish I would had read the many similar and horrible reviews of this around the web (search for it and look elsewhere for a fuller spectrum of reviews) My life was h@ll for a straight month... 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	12/27/2009 5:12:10 PM	Took this drug for a full year while breastfeeding. No break-through bleeding, and no changes to milk supply. My periods were a bit irregular but that may have been due to the breastfeeding. I set my cell phone alarm and was only late taking the pill once (used condoms that week). 
Birth Control	momof2, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	10/4/2009 9:08:00 AM	I found it very easy to take this at the same time every day when brushing my teeth. I am taking this because I am breastfeeding and planned to switch when the baby was weaned. However I discovered that I am pregnant. I am shocked because I never missed a pill or fell out of the three hour window. 
Birth Control	buxgirl05, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/19/2009 9:03:45 PM	I have been taking this medicine for over 2 years.  I still have a monthly period, which is slightly disturbing reading the information, meaning that I am still ovulating, but no pregnancy.  I set my cell phone alarm for a certain time each day, which is easy for me to remember and I always have my phone with me.  Overall, I find this medicine convenient and without the unwanted migraines that the combo pills caused.
Birth Control	Whizzy901, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	13-18	6/15/2009 11:27:42 PM	I switched to this form of birht control after horrible side effects from the patch. My doctor wanted me on this because it didnt have estrogen in it and i have family history of ovarian cancer. But i have found this hard to take everyday at the exact same time. However as of yet i have not gotten pregnant while taking it(a major plus). I get migraines if i dont take it on time but i have only experienced break through bleeding twice. I have only had one period while taking it. My doctor warned me that the periods would be irregular and then stop all together. I haven't had any side effects except the migraines if i dont take it on time. I did find that if you have problems with nausea from taking it if you take it at night the nausea doesnt happen as much or as severe.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	35-44	4/17/2009 2:07:00 PM	It prevented pregnancy but I had break through bleeding at least every other week.  I took the medication at the same time every day and did not miss a day.  Not worth it for me to continue taking this med.
Birth Control	Jordan, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	35-44	1/18/2009 9:53:23 PM	If you miss a pill bleeding starts.  My period started 2 weeks early when I started these pills.  I hope this is not an indication of problems to come.
Birth Control	STOCK UP ON PADS, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	1/6/2009 12:39:24 PM	this drug is easy to use but I'm NOT SATISFIED with it.  STOCK UP ON THE PADS!!  I take this drug around the same time everydayI have not gotten pregnant from this drug(thats a Plus).  but the periods are regular each week I have them.  The doctor said this is normal to have xtra bleeding.  I have periods atleast every 2wks. this last time there was only a week break.   This drug is NOT for me. I don't know about you,  What is a NORMAL period?
Other	diamond, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	4/21/2008 7:40:51 PM	I have used this pill for a year and had a period every single month!  I have endometriosis and this was supposed to help alleviate the bleeding and pain...didn't work for me.  I spot for at least 7-8 days before the flow of my period begins then I have a heavy period for about 3 days then I spot for another 5 days or so afterwards.  All while my ovaries and everything else continue to hurt, severe gas and indigestion.  About to start Lo-ovral 28 today and take them continuously.  Hopefully, if I'm not fortunate enough to have my period stop, hopefully it won't last 2 weeks!
Birth Control	Regina, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	2/6/2008 11:48:28 PM	I have had no periods and no side effects.  The one challenge is remembering to take it at exactly the same time everyday.
