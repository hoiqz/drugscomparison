High Blood Pressure	Helen, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	65-74	8/8/2010 3:58:15 PM	wether or not this medication is the one making me perspire perfusely is a question not even the doctors can answer.  Can this medication cause me to perspire as bad as I do.  Could it be the combinatin of other medications I am taking?  For instance, furosemide, baby aspirin 81 mg, simvastatin, gly-metformin, diovan?  I perspire perfusely that I have to have a towel around my neck and a bandana around my head for about 4-5 hours during the day.  Thisis annoying because I cannot leave my home to do things I have to do for those first 4 hours.  There must be something that can be eliminated.  I do have Diabetes, HBP and a thickening of the heart wall due to the number of years I have had HBP.  Presently I am 59 years old, partially active. ( walk 1 mile every other day) weighing in at 220 lbs. (I'm trying to lose about 70 more lbs. )  Not only do I perspire a lot, I have loose bowels, urinate a lot during those 4-5 hours.  I'm at my wits end due to this condition.  HELP!

Other	MommaMackie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	6/27/2010 1:02:22 PM	Was prescribed Metoprolol Hydrochlorothiazide Oral  for migraine headache control and high blood pressure (stress related).  Used for a VERY long time, but discovered that my dosage was causing hair loss.  Cut dosage in half and hair loss has slowed to something close to normal.  Doctor changed me to a 24 hour slow release version Toprol XL and I'm pleased with the results so far.  (I had hoped that I could go off of any bp med after stress situation was addressed, but found that migraines returned if I missed more than three days. 
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/7/2010 8:33:04 AM	My mail in pharmacy changed my generic for lopressor and I need to see if the drug contains the same ingredients and looks like it is supposed to.
High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	4/25/2010 9:57:03 PM	This med worked great for me while i was on it.  I had lost weight, changed my diet and had been taking hydrochlorothiazide alone, which was not completely effective.  This combonation brought down my bp and also my heart rate.  Very helpful.  The worst thing about this drug is the time it takes to get used to it.  When I first started it, i had a lot of instances of dizziness, lightheadedness and fatigue.  But after about 2 weeks, that improved.  Overall, i was very happy with it.  I am off it now, as my allergist did not like me taking it with my asthma and severe allergies.  overall though, i would recommend it, if you don't have those issues.

It is only $4 a month and worked better than Tenormin. No side effects at all. In the begining I was tired but that passed after a couple weeks. I am very satisfied.
Other	Debbie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	10/19/2008 6:30:52 AM	I was prescribed Hydrochlorothiazide for swelling in my legs. To this extent it has been great, took about two weeks for me to start seeing a difference. However, I am feeling extremely sad, depressed since taking this, which is completely out of character for me.
