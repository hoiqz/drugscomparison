Other	CJ, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/1/2012 8:26:07 PM	I have taken Nicomide on and off for over 10 years now, I don't really even understand how it works but it does! I find if I stop taking my 2 tablets a day I get a couple cystic pimples, a few smaller ones, and my pores clog more easily in general. The second best part of the medication is the fact that I have never experienced any adverse side-effects. My pharmacist is great and keeps it stocked just for my brother and I as I have read that some people had a hard time finding a pharmacy that carries it. My co-pay is also very inexpensive so I don't think I'll ever stop taking this if I can. My dermatologist first prescribed Aldactone for me but I did not see a difference in my skin and I believe only women can take it. So, Nicomide has been perfect for my (and my brothers) now, very mild acne. If you have bad acne I would definitely suggest taking a cycle of Accutane and using the Nicomide afterward to keep up your results if you get them. One cycle of Accutane kept my skin completely clear for about 5 years. Once it did wear off though, my acne did not come back anywhere near as bad as it was before. My brother has continually taken Nicomide after Accutane and his skin is better than mine has ever been and his acne was much worse, so it certainly depends on the person.

I'm going to increase my dosage to 3 a day. My insurance does cover my prescription. I get my through mail order and it's only $20 for a 90day supply.

I have always been prone to them but this medication made them worse. I eventually got a severe case of stomatitis (sores all over my mouth and tongue). I stopped the nicomide so hopefully I won't get as many canker sores. It's too bad because the Nicomide helped my acne.

I tried everything before using nicomide. I take it twice daily. My insurance pays for nicomide but brand name only.
Other	happy camper, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	11/5/2009 10:27:21 PM	I have taken Nicotinamide for about 3 years to treat acne, which I began having at midlife after I stopped taking birth control pills for an extended period of time.  This medication worked wonders for me, and completely cleared up my problem.  The only negative I would add is that pharmacies NEVER have had this medication when I had to refill it.  They always have to order it, so my satisfaction of the availability of the drug is not rated as high as its effectiveness.  That said, it is well worth taking to clear up acne, in my opinion.

The first year when I was taking it as prescribed (once a day) it cleared up ALL of my exceptionally bad painful pustules, and kept them away.  I recently stopped taking it, and the horrible buggers came back.  I will be taking them as precribed once again.  It works great.
Other	JS, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/24/2008 11:35:40 AM	After coming off of birth control my skin began to break out with cystic acne. I tried everything except Accutane. Being that Accutane was not an option, as I am trying to get pregnant, my dermatologist prescribed Nicomide. This medication is a miracle! My skin is almost clear( a few red marks), I feel healthier and my nails are stronger. I strongly recommend Nicomide for acne and to boost your immune system.  
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	3/4/2008 10:17:23 AM	I used to take Nicomide when I started getting acne in my late-20's. It worked really well, even on non-facial acne. I stopped taking it about 2 years ago and the acne crept back in. I just filled my script and I'm crossing my fingers. Here's the link to the $40 rebate: http://www.dusapharma.com/assets/files/Rebate%20P DFS/rebate%20v.%203.pdfI only put 3 for satisfaction only because I want to see if it works again. Good luck!
Other	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	1/15/2008 8:52:12 PM	I am skeptical but I am going to try this medication.  I was on accutane for 5 months last year and it IS the only miracle drug for acne!  I was completely clear for a year until recent stressfull situation caused me to break out around my jawline. Hopefully this will work...for those who have tried everything, try accutane.  It does work. My severe acne is no longer severe, but mild.  The side effects were dry lips, dry skin for the first 3 months, then the last two months I was fine.  It wasn't unbearable and I would go through it again if I had to.

Lack in Minerals	Rachel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/7/2008 9:23:14 PM	This medication is great. My doctor said it would take a month or two to see results, but I saw an improvement in a week.  I use it less than is perscribed now that my skin has completely cleared up.  I removed dairy from my diet 3 years ago and still got breakouts and this medicine cleared that right up.  I still can't have dairy though or I break out for a month with big deep pimples that are painful and embarassing even while taking this medicine. So I use soy products (milk and cheese) and use this medicine and have the best skin.  I am 29, but had acne for the past 8 years. I can't explain how happy I am with this. Also I wanted to mention, this only costs me $35 a month and the company that makes it reimburses me the $35 after I send them proof that I bought it.  Ask you doctor about that.  They just send you a rebate form every 8 or so weeks for you to send back to them with each refill.  They will only reimburse up to $40, so i get this for FREE after my insurance and the rebate. You can't beat that.

I was so amazed!  Everyone should try this.... only thing is its not covered by insurance and its almost 100 bucks a month!

I dont see any differance but my Dermo says it will help along with antibiotics so i've been takig it.  I've been taking stuff for my acne for at least 10 years.  Hopefully it will help.

It has worked better than any antibiotic I have ever taken. I am amazed it is not a mainstream treatment for acne, especially with so much concern about overuse of antibiotics.
