Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	Terry, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	55-64	5/15/2012 8:00:34 PM	My GP doc raved about Forteo so I took it for 5 months.  At 4-5 months, I started having lower back pain.  When I had to go to the ER for severe back pain w/&quot;sciatica,&quot; at 5 months on Forteo, I stopped the drug.  Still have the pain off and on.  Might be caused by Forteo?  My ortho doc said to stop it.  My lumbar xray showed disc malformed &amp; pressing on disc.  No conclusion but too coincidental for MY comfort?    
Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	5/2/2012 7:30:29 PM	I used Forteo for two years with very little improvement. Blood tests indicated Celiac disease.  Dr. likes Forteo but suspects ingredients may contain gluten.  Does the drug contain gluten?  Sides affects were extreme nausea and loss of appetite, and frequent bowl movements.  When I stopped Forteo and followed a gluten-free diet all side affects disappeared.

So far, I have had a few bent needles which the pharmacy replaced. Also, I have been getting red spots on my legs and headaches, and sinus probles.  I don't know if this is the forteo or the enbrel I'm on too.  Has anyone else had this type of reaction?

Waited a week and tried it again (doc had requested) and by the 3rd day the same symptoms appeared, stopped and felt great within 36 hrs.  Now I am afraid to try Prolia.

Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	Kayla, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	9/17/2011 9:16:07 PM	After 3 months the side effects were unbelievable,joint pain, stomach pain, hair loss, anxiety increase, hunger increase,dizzy spells, mood swings, throat felt full or swelled at times--I decided to stop Forteo myself, The Docter didn't approve, of course, but as I said to her, she should try it herself, and maybe it would change her mind about perscribing it. I now take an awsome, Holistic approach, and feel I can take control with the proper Calcium,Mag,and D combination---healthy eating, exercising,bone building herbal teas, and many other supplements. I recommend a visit with a certified Nutritionist/Herbalist so you can take control of your bone regrowth-instead of Forteo decreasing your daily quality of life---Good Luck to all of you---And may God bless you with healthy bones!!!

ER visits were a waste of time and doctor accused wife of &quot;acting out&quot;  Wife was admitted to a senior care center and placed on Zyprexa and Forteo injections were stopped.  This cured the problem.  Forteo should be taken off of the market before it drives someone insane.

It has helped with a lot of pain, but it may be causing other pains I haven't had before.  My legs hurt more and my low back.  I have gained a few pounds and seem to be hungry a lot.  This has just started the last six weeks or so.  I am real curious if anyone else has felt it increased their appetite.  I will have a bone density again next month.  I have also been able to get off a 75 mg. pain patch I had been on for a few years.

I stopped taking for 2 months due to extreme fatigue, muscle/joint pain, difficulty concentrating/fogginess.  My doctor thinks I may have been overdosing (5'2&quot; 110lb) with the full dose and she then rigged the pen so that I can draw out only a small amount (little less than half) so that I do not experience the extreme side effects.  Due for a Bone Density test next month and hopeful for good results.  I am extremely pleased that I have a doctor who understands and is willing to work with me.
Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	gbsn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	3	Female	55-64	6/9/2011 2:14:48 AM	Actual Reason for Taking This Treatment: Developed osteoporosis prior to menopause, it's &quot;all in the family&quot;.Length of Treatment: 3 mos, no repeat bone density yet.  Pre-Treatment 24-hour urine study showed rapid bone loss, age 61.Pre-Treatment thyroid profile was normal.Skin dryness has increased since I began treatment with Forteo.  Forteo seems to cause increased urination even when I cut back on fluid intake - diuretic effect with me?  Long-term plan must include bisphosphamate or other once the 18-24 months of Forteo is completed.  It bothers me wondering, what next?  Fosamax that previously caused esophageal pain/oral ulcers?  Must have f/u plan to not lose benefit of Forteo which has not been explained to be by Bone Mineral &amp; Metabolism clinic doctor.  One can always hope for new better drugs.  
Osteoporosis caused by Glucocorticoid Drugs	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	45-54	5/18/2011 1:03:33 PM	I am 52 yrs old and have had 5 compression fractures since January 2010. I have had Reclast 1 dose in April 2010 then had another fracture in March 2011. Was put on Forteo Sub-Q to see if there could be any improvement. Within a week or so of Forteo treatment I had increased joint pain &amp; was not able to sleep thru the night. I thought maybe this is just an initial reaction &amp; it would level out &amp; improve with time. Was I ever wrong. I have taken Forteo Sub-Q daily for about 6 weeks now &amp; cannot take the pain or sleepless nights any more. I have decided with my Dr., to Stop Forteo &amp; to try something else. The pain has gotten out of control &amp; not sleeping is very draining. I would not advise anyone to continue this med if their pain increased as mine has. Be sure to inform your Dr. ASAP. Don't suffer.

Beginning with the first injection I experienced headache, queasy stomach and fatigue. These symptoms lasted all day, I felt exhausted,  sluggish, hard to work  I do not believe my Dr. listens to me, stating &quot;I've never taken a patient off Forteo.&quot;  However, she suggested that I stop the drug for a few weeks to see how I feel.  After skipping  one dose I feel like myself again - no headache, no fatigue, clear headed, able to eat.  After taking both Actonal and Foxomax, Forteo was my last option.  Now I don't know where to turn.

Red welt at injection site stayed most of the day, but not painful.  After 3 months developed very painful lump in my armpit.  Dr took me off.  Tried it again 2 months later and the lump came right back.  Dr refused to believe the lump was caused by Forteo....what do they know anyway unless they try it themselves.

Osteoporosis caused by Glucocorticoid Drugs	Emma Clare, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	10/14/2010 11:33:55 PM	Started the Forteo injections December 09. Although the injections were easy to administer,within two weeks the side effects were overwhelming, fatigue,severe pain in joints,muscle weakness,swollen face,difficulty swallowing,food would not digest, increased blood pressure, memory loss, nausea, chronic diarrhea, severe headaches,pain in top of head, weepy, disoriented,loss of appetite, flu like symptoms. After one month I was taken off the medication by the Endocrologist. The severe joint pain subsided after a few weeks along with most of the other symptoms,although the digestive issues and chronic diarrhea continued. After a 12 pound weight loss I was referred to a Gasteroenterologist. I was diagnosed with gastroparesis. The gastroenterologist has suggested that drugs that are used to treat bone loss have contributed to digestive issues. I had no digestive issues before starting the Forteo. I have also experienced extreme hair loss and issue with my thyroid gland. I have experienced issues with my heart also and a recent stress test came back abnormal.I think this drug should be taken off the market. The long term side effects I continue to experience from this medication 11 months later far outweigh any positive affects on my bone loss. I still do not know the long term affect on my thyroid function and heart issues.

I too, have experienced weight gain and severe muscle cramping in my calves at night.  So much so, that I was prescribed Bacloven for relief.  The worst side effect however, was severe cracking of the skin on both my hands and feet.  I am discontinuing Forteo to see if my symptoms improve AND most importantly for the financial burden taking this medication has caused me.  No help from the Forteo-Connect, as I make more than $1600 a month.  Are you kidding me?  At $1000 a month out of pocket expense since I am in the Medicare donut hole, that leaves me a whopping $600 a month to live on!

My doctor tested my calcium levels, D, and other blood tests, with no conclusion. Ive only been on Forteo for a month, have noticed severe pain in old injuries (my knee, shoulder, wrist) which healed up fin in the past, but are intense now. I have a feeling that Forteo is just a bandaid covering a underlying problem. I also tested my Testosterone levels and they are normal and slightly high. Checked my thyroid in the past year or so. Any advice or theorys would be great.
Osteoporosis caused by Glucocorticoid Drugs	Joyce34, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female		9/17/2010 11:33:59 AM	I am a 75 year old female, and I started on Forteo May 26, 2010, and nine days later had chest pains which took me to the ER. They found nothing. A week or so later I had Atrial fibrillation, for which I was put on warfarin, and high blood pressure which I now take medication. Several days later had terrible chest pains and shortness of breath, and found I had pericardial effusion for which I was hospitalized and had to have the fluid drained off. I was put on Digoxin for heart rhythm, and developed a toxic reaction to that, and ended up in ICU. Soon after that I developed a pleural effusion and hospitalized again. By then I had been off of the Forteo for 4 weeks, and things started looking better, but have had to take prednisone for several weeks, and also colchicine for the pericarditis. No one will admit it was the Forteo, but I will not be taking it again.

While recouperating from the first surgery the other hip developed a stress fx and was also repaired.  I am not post-menopausal.  After much testing and a bone biopsy it was determined I had low turnover osteoporosis and Forteo therapy was started.

My sister was also recently diagnosed with low turnover osteoporosis and is now on Forteo too.  She has not had any side effects.

I tried Fosamax, Boniva and Actonel but got ulcerations in stomach and esophagus so dr. put me on this.   I hope it's working.  It's been very easy to use.   The only side effect I have seen is a week ankle but not sure if the drug has caused that.

I went from osteporosis in my 1st bone density test to osteopenia with my last bone density test.  My results showed improvement in all areas including my neck which I had to have surgery on by a neuro-surgeon on section C5-C-6 to repair damage to my spinal cord and had severe compression on my spinal cord in my neck.  I did not have any side affects from this RX.  The only thing I could not do was give myself the injections due to my fear of needles.  My husband gave them to me and I am 5'4&quot; and weigh approx. 120ish pounds so had the injections in my upper thigh as I have very little fatty areas.It is also very expensive but our insurance company covered it all except of the co-payment that went from $15 to $25 a month.  This RX was aobut $700 or more per month.

I am not really qualified to rate effectiveness as I have not had a scan since starting. I am experiencing change in heart rate and anxiety levels. Heart beat seems to be irregular according to my monitor. I started experiencing this after taking for about 2 weeks.  Don't know if this is related to drug or something I will ask my Dr. on the next visit.  Just wanted to know if anyone else has had this same experience.

I'm told I shopuld be on it for 2 years.  Of concern to me is the dry cough that I now have.  Is this SERIOUS side affect, or just bothersome?  Previously I used Fosamax for many, many years with no improvement for my osteoporsis.  Us the dry cough enough of a reason to discontinue Forteo?  Please advise.

She was taking the medication for 1 week and took a turn for the worse.  She could barely talk, she couldn't walk, her legs would just give out on her and she couldn't comprehend what we were saying to her.  We took her off the medication and the symptoms have gone away.  She is now walking and can hold a conversation.  We have talked to a few other people that had the same types of problems.  I WOULD NOT GIVE TO ANYONE THAT HAS DEMENTIA OR ALZHEIMER.

I have had weight gain and bloating with bouts of diarrhea or constapation. My dry skin is even drier and the texture even where I don't inject seems to have changed, not quite a rash but similar.  The last two weeks I have had pain in the top of my head. I am stopping forteo, but will continue with calcium and vitamin D.  I hope to feel better soon.

Other	freespirit, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	1/26/2010 2:23:56 AM	I was on Forteo for 2 yrs. and 3 months.  I never experienced any side affects and since I only weigh about 125 pounds with very little fat my husband gave me the injections daily in my upper thigh area (only area with some extra fat).  My last bone density test showed Osteopenia instead of the Osteoporosis which I did have.  I was very pleased with the results and stayed on the medication over the 2 yrs. but not without some fears since there had been no studies for using it over 2 yrs, and is only recommended for 2 years.  I also had surgery on my spinal cord in my neck where I had some severe damage to section C5-C6 in my neck.  I did have quite a bit of improvement in my neck also after being on this medication for a little over 2 years.  I was considering staying on it for 3 yrs. but after talking to the company that made the drug, they did not recommend it.  But I had none of the side affects some had.  My only problem was I could not give myself the injection due to my fear of needles.  I was very impressed and pleased with the results I got from Forteo.  I am glad my Dr. prescibed it and our insurance covered it as it is such an expensive RX (approx. $600 a month) we would mot have been able to afford it.  After reading the article on Web MD it is the only one approved by the FDA that really does rebuild bones.  It did for me!!

My bone density scan showed a 29% increase in my hip, so it was a big improvement. The shot was easy to give and the only side effects I noticed was some weight gain and my calcium level went to 11.4. My doctor said this is normal while on the medicine.  She also recommends I go on Reclast to have continued results.  That makes me a little nervous...but I don't think I have an option.

This is considered too short a time to even measure any progress.  What I would like to share with readers is some side effects I believe associated with the drug.  One is insomnia, and the other is the tendency to become excessively fearful or anxious at times.  These side effects (or what I believe to be, with good reason,)have been moderate so far, and I am continuing with the drug.

Have experiened joint/muscle pain; however, Drs don't believe the pain is due to Forteo?  They want me to start taking Reclast--have read the reviews and they flat out scare me.

(this is all the FDA has approved it for) The side effects I suffered were minor. They included constipation, minor joint pain-especially in my hip, muscle crampness in the calves of my legs and redness at the injection site.  I have truly been blessed.  I glad to be off of it.  My bone density increased a few points but nothing signiicant as I thought.  I was sceptical due to the fact that it had caused bone cancer in lab test on rats and that was due to the higher doses they were given. I wasn't thrilled at having to give myself a shot everyday, but I'm not afraid of needles and it's quick and painless.  I did'nt research this drug as well as I should have, but I recommend others to do more because not everyone's body accept a drug the same way.  We are all different in other ways aren't we?  So our bodies may react differently to the same drug or supplement.  Do your research and decide for yourself, not your doctor, what's best for you.  God Bless You in making the right decision.

I am on it 11 mos. For those of you experiencing bone &amp; muscle pain the first 3-5 mos. are the worst. It does get better, my blood work is fine, my calcium levels &amp; vit. D levels are fine - will have another BD test in Oct. and hopefully my levels will raise. It is just unfortunate for some of us that fall into that donut hole, (I am also paying $827.00 a mo.)that something can't be done about the cost of this drug for the 2 years we have to be on it.
Other	Inspire82, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	4	2	Female		8/20/2009 11:46:11 PM	my grandma of 82 years old took the medicine via daily injection onto her abdomen, as directed by the doctor.she has only been on this course for 17 days but she is complaining of no strength, legs and arms ache, fatigueshe cannot stand straight and her knees are bent when she tries to stand, indicating no strength.she wasnt like this before starting on FORTEO though. she could still stand straight and walk abit with the aid of a walking frame.but it is because she has serious osteoporisis, her bones are very weak, and it is collasping onto her spinal cord, making her very uncomfortable and cannot sit straight without feeling any pain.hence our specialist doctor recommended this medicine to her.I am worried that her 'no strength, arms legs aching symptoms' are causing her condition to worsen,are her bones gaining mass, even though she is experiencing all these other bad symptoms?would appreciate it i could discuss this with someone who knows more?As i am thinking of stopping to give her this medication because she seems to do doing worse than before starting on FORTEO..thanks...from a worried grandson

No real side effects from the drug except weight gain especially around mid section and marks from needles.  Some of the injections seem to hurt more and cause some bruising.

It seems to &quot;roam&quot; my body from time to time. There is now also extreme fatigue and loss of energy overall.  At first ,I thought it might be depression [which I have treated for successfully for years],but it feels more like a &quot;slow-to-go away&quot; flu.  Have not talked to Doc yet.  Will give it a few weeks more to see if it abates.  My knees seem to be the primary target most days.

I have been taking Forteo for 3 months now and have really not experienced any side effects and the shot is easy to give myself. The only problem I have noticed is that my hair seems to be falling out more than before I took this drug. I have a lot of hair, so it's not noticeable. I truly think this drug is helping me because my back and hip pain is now gone. I don't know if it is because my bones started growing back or PT that I go to 2 times per week over the last 6 months. Either way, I think the drug has been helpful.

I was taking Actonel for 5 years and suddenly my scores from my dexascan dropped so drastically that the doctor expected me to be breaking bones as I walked. I have 3 grandchildren so far and want quality of life as I get older so I decided to take Forteo shots. I want to dance at my oldest granddaughters wedding in the years to come, not be pushed in a wheelchair. I've only been using Forteo for 3 weeks so I don't know how effective it is. It is much easier to use than I thought it would be. The ony side effects Ihave had so far are bruising at the injection site twice. Also, in th epat week the injection site has become red and very slightly raised. It doesn;t hurt...just looks strange.

Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	Cynthia, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	55-64	2/17/2009 2:25:38 PM	I am 56 years old and experieced menopause produced by hysterectomy at age 30. I found out that I have osteoporosis and have been taking Forteo for almost 5 months now. No symptoms until the beginning of the 3rd month, when muscle and bone pain began occuring in the lower leg, ankle, feet, thighs, and all along the arm, from shoulder down. I am extremely fatigued all the time and feel like I have the flu. Could Forteo be causing this? I don't think there is enough information about side effects out there for us, and at this point I think I'd rather have another broken foot than continue to take a medication that costs me in excess of $800 per month and makes me feel so badly (at least I'm beginning to think it's associated)! Just curious to know if anyone else feels the same. Have you experienced these symptoms - have you discussed them with your doctor and what has the doctor recommended or said? Thanks for sharing ladies!

However, every year my bone density test revealed worse results.  My doctor recomended Forteo.  I put if off for one year being fearful of bone cancer.  She kept insisting and I used it for 6-1/2 months.  I had no side effects, but when I had a blood test,  the levels of alkaline phosphatase were very elevated.  I immediately stopped using this drug.  I just went to my doctor for a bone density test and there was some improvement and after 6 months the alkaline phostase had decreased substantially, but the combined number was still out-of-range and the levels in the bone was at the top of the expected range.  She wants me to go back on Forteo, but I am very reluctant to do so.  I am more willing to wait for the new drug from Amgen (Denosumab), since I have not had a fracture since I was a little girl.

I took it for 16 days.  Developed SEVERE nausea, indigestion, fatigue, chest pain.  No antacid would help.  After stopping the injections, began to improve in two or three days.  Back to normal self now.  Dr. will not believe drug was cause, but I know my body.  Would not recommend that anyone take it.

I've been on it for9 months now, &amp; am now growing really concerned. I am having muscle spasm, &amp; have been living with a head  &amp; neck pain forthe past month now. I go to sleep with the pain, wake up with it, &amp; go through my days with it, and am now having slight jaw pain.The pain goes from a scale of #2 to a #7 then back to #2 or 3 Everyday.My doctor doesn't seem to think it's associated at all with the medicine and just tell me to take yet another prescription for pain. (HELLO..more drugs?I've thankfully have not had any fractures, but am growing extremely concerned with all the talks of Tumors, Cancer, Jaw problems toname a few. I am considering stopping the use of this medicine. Is there a support group out there for us in Fla? I am a Husband, a Father of 3 children ages 7, 9, &amp; 15 and am thinking if I stop &amp; break a bone, I live to see my kids another day. If I get Cancer of the bone my kids would lose their father quite rapidly, &amp; don't know if can risk that. If there anyone out there that may be interested in chatting on line in regards to this dilema or has some information that feels can be useful to memy email is MUNOZCARLOS26@GMAIL.COMThank You.

Doctor told me up front that it would be a 2 year treatment procedure.  Have administered the daily shot for 14 months now. I have fallen a couple of times since (hard falls too) with no brakes!  I know that it is helping me!  Even though I don't like giving myself shots, I hate broke bones worse!  Thanks.

Other	otilla, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/1/2008 9:02:06 PM	Used for 1 year for hypothyroidism. Had to stop because insurance said using for wrong reason.I think it was a money thing! But I took 16 calcium pills a day. When I was on Forteo 3 a day. I really felt good. So now I am back to 16 pills a day and don't feel good most of the time. I wish it was o.k'd . One doctor told me about the cancer in the bones, but what difference does it make, I take hormone replacement and it causes cancer too, but it's o.k. So if my life is better and it can be used for multi dieases, like a lot of medicines. I still think when they come up with a generic for it, then it want be a problem. It's a money thing! Thank you

Had surgury on my neck in March 2008. My beginning experience with Forteo was good, however the last two months I have had bad bouts with the my bowels and lack of appetite. My stomach hurts all the time and I'm not hungry. My bone pain has increased and I now am having problems with pain in my jaw. This bone pain in so severe that it effects my abilitiy to walk. I however did have the bone pain prior to the use of Forteo. Some days my bone pain is worse than others. My doctors give me no explanation for this pain. I have recently stopped taking the Forteo and the bouts with my bowels has disappeared. I am still waiting for the doctor to get back with me as to what I should do now. I also have been taking multi vitamins, calcium w/D 1200 mgs. a day and was told by my doc to also take vitamin D-400 with D3 once a day for my Osteo. All together I'm not to sure as to weather I wan't to continue this medicine or just take a break from it for a month or two. Then try again. Prior to taking Forteo, I was on Boniva. I have had no bone scans done since the use of Forteo. I can only hope that when I go back into the doctors he will help me find out what is causing me to have such severe pain in my legs,hips and feet.Also the jaw pain concerns me. I guesss I worry about possible cancer or pagets disease. Hopefully everthing comes out ok. Best of luck to all of you who are on Forteo.

I had been treated for premature osteoporosis with hormones and Fosamax for 10 years.  I have been using Forteo injections for the past three months.  I am hopeful that it will help my density plus avoid future fractures.  I am concerned because I am finding that I feel tired and nauseous most of the time and I am suspicious that my shoulder pain is increasing from the injections. I am not certain of any of this and am very confused.  Has anyone else felt sick and tired and a bit down as a side effect of the injections?  My doctor says she doesn't think it is the drug but I skipped one day and felt so much better.  I have started injecting at night now and hope that helps.

She also suffered from chronic renal disease.  I have been researching Forteo because my mother developed a malignant tumor that wrapped around L4 and L5.  By the time it was diagnosed, it was stage 4 and she recently passed away from it.  I have read that she should not have taken it because of her renal failure.  I am wondering if she should have been monitored more closely for this malignant growth.  I am not convinced it is a safe drug.  I would like to continue to research this and ascertain that this drug is safe.

Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	4/5/2008 5:16:06 AM	I was taking Forteo injections for 2 years, maximum. After bone density tests the results no change in low bone mass bone mass, same as before injections, but no more fracturing during injections. I got muscle spasms in calfs, and loss of hair! My hair is still not healthy and got very thin, from Forteo. I'm on Fosomax now and just read that not only at risk for jaw loss but now thigh bone fracturing.  I'm worried putting Forteo in my body with reports of cancer occuring, and now these reports about Fosomax. Bottom line is I hope we don't hear more cases of cancer caused by using Forteo.

I don't have a parathyroid. It worked great. I went from 17 calcium pills a day to 3. But my insurance changed and said I was taking it for the wrong reason, so I had to go back on my large dose of pills. It has been a struggle. I wish they would o.k. it for parathyroid conditions too,because it worked and my life was alot better for at least a year. I know it would help someone else who has surgery to live a better life.I don't have osteoporosis yet but since I am good candidate it will happen soon enough. But if this drug was ok'ed then I might not have as bad of time with it. If only?
