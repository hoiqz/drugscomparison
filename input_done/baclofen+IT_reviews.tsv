Muscle Spasms caused by a Spinal Disease	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	5/23/2011 4:18:35 PM	I have recently diagnosed cervical spinal stenosis &amp; cervical dystonia from stenosis -Worst issue is the head jerk (cervical dystonia) and pain/stiffness - I've only been on baclofin for 3 days and I can already feel the difference. I am far more relaxed and do not have debilitating neck/back pain to the same extent.  The cervical dystonia has slowed significantly in the last few days &amp; I have hopes that it will cease altogether once I have been on the medication for a while.  For me Baclofen has been maybe not a life saver, but probably a job saver.

Subsequent to corrective surgery, beg3an oral baclofen to assist in walking as well as reduction in evening sleep-depriving spasms.  Trial direct spinal injection was very successful and lead to implant of pump.  Recent adjustment to specifically target evening hours has been great.  Does seem to be some downside interaction between the Baclofen and anti-depressants though.

Have pump about 8 years with no problems.  Had to get new one after 5 years because of battery life.

I have more energy, better movement, and i feel better than I have in 10 years.  the refill procedure was easy and took about 3-5 minutes.  If anyone is having trouble making up their mind about the pump and the baclofen IT, it is worth it!  the surgery for the implant is easy and was a one night stay in the hospital.
Muscle Spasms due to a Brain Disease	7-12 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Caregiver) 	5	4	5	Female	7-12	5/12/2009 7:05:33 PM	My 12 year old daughter just had her second pump installed, due to battery life. She has spastic dyplegia cerebral palsy.  This drug has made such an amazing difference in her life.  It controls her spasticity and has made walking with assitance possible.  The new pump is much smaller and will need to be filled less often.  I can't imagine our life without it : )
Muscle Spasms caused by a Spinal Disease	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	7/24/2008 1:46:44 PM	I am a T6 complete para due to a MVA. This drug has done wonders for my spasms. Before having the pump, I could not take enough oral baclofen to even somewhat control the spasms. I had them so bad I knocked a hole in the wall with my head. Some warnings I would give if considering a pump implant: may have problems with spinal fluid leakage when catheter delivering medicine is inserted into spinal column, very little room for flexibility on refill date, and as pump gets older and you get close to refill date and your medicine volume is low you may start having problems with the pump delivering the right amount of medicine. The withdrawal symptoms of this medicine are horrible (itching, stinging, and burning of your skin and of course return of spasms) so do not miss a refill or let your volumes get low as the pump gets older, and if you have to get off of the medicine, allow plenty of time for your volumes to be gradually decreased instead of just going cold turkey.
Muscle Spasms caused by a Spinal Disease	Richie, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	11/8/2007 2:25:01 AM	T-6 para from a MC accident.  On 4 different oral anti spasticity meds prior to the pump.  Those made me drowsey and unfunctional.  With the pump I get meds directly into my spinal cord and dose is lower.  I have now been able to stand and walk with a walker approx 35 ft. and gettting better.  We are still slowly increasing the dose to find the right mix for me.  I love it and highly recommend it for SCI  patients.
