Migraine Prevention	Happygma, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	8/19/2012 10:40:52 AM	My doctor suggested Botox for my chronic migraines.  I have had 3 ablations (burning of the nerves) previously and he said that he wanted to try this because it was less invasive.  It has been 3 weeks since the injections and I began getting very weak and just plain sick.  I had to go to the hospital last Tuesday.  I cannot open my mouth more than 1 1/2&quot;, I can barely lift more than 2#, I am extremely weak, my lympth nodes are swollen and I can not bend over to even brush my teeth because it feels as if my head were a bowling ball.  I cannot venture off the couch for more than a few minutes at a time.

I have sever pain in the neck area for six weeks.  The pain reduced in severity after 3 weeks.  Migraines were eliminated for 3 months.  Since this paralyzes the muscles I could not hold up my head when leaning forward.  This was drastic when using a low sink or leaning over to pick something up off the ground.  I have had success with nerve blocks which are also painful but for a period of days not weeks.

I have never been sick like this before. Don't know for sure if it is coincidence or side effect.

I am having a completely different reaction though. Not very pleasant... Very bad headache, pain and stiffness but I know that the benefits outweight the side effects. Time will tell how effective this bout will be.

I cannot link it to anything else.  I only hope and pray this does not continue much longer.  The sleep deprivation is making it very difficult for me to do my job.  I am a teacher!
Deep Lines Between Eyebrows	moomin,  Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female		9/26/2010 1:35:04 PM	It took me 6 years of getting Botox to realize that every time within 12 hours, I experienced sudden and severe insomnia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and a rapid slide into depression. I have always been very even keel, not terribly moody, and sleep like a champ, so the difference is drastic and obvious, and certainly not psychological. Suspecting the connection, I began to keep &quot;mood charts&quot; over the last 2 years, documenting what happened to me after having Botox. The link is absolute and very clear -- it's the Botox that is causing the problems. If you search message boards, MANY other people have experienced exactly the same thing. Doctors and Clinicians deny such &quot;side effects&quot; are common, even real, and yet they are being widely reported all over the internet. The problem is, because we do not expect such a response to Botox, we do not directly connect the reaction. It has quite devastated my life -- leading to a misdiagnosis from a Psychiatrist, and eventually taking 5 dangerous mind-altering medications to &quot;treat&quot; the misdiagnosis. Of course, my &quot;mental illness&quot; strangely went away every time the Botox wore off, but try explaining that to a Psychiatrist! Once I realized what was really going on, I weaned myself successfully off all medications working with a Naturopathic Doctor, and a Nutritional Psychiatrist (yes, they exist!) -- and of course I stopped having Botox.I think it will be years before the true effects of Botox become apparent. I wonder if there is any link between the drastic increase in RXs for sleeping pills, anti-anxiety meds and antidepressants in the last 10 years -- and the advent of Botox during the same period. It's hard to know -- because these side effects are not disclosed by the manufacturer of Botox -- so Doctors don't know to expect or look for them. They automatically dismiss them as probably psychological, when clearly they are not. I think the key problem is people probably don't realize Botox is doing this to them.

It looked relaxed not frozen there was no bruising and it lasts. I thing that it is the perfect way to maintain a youthful appearance. 
Deep Lines Between Eyebrows	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	45-54	11/30/2009 9:40:28 AM	On my 7th day after treatment I awoke in the middle of the night feeling extremely &quot;wired&quot;.  This was followed by 3 weeks of insomnia and anxiety. The worst though, was the constant twitching in my extremities. This all lasted 3 months until the botox wore off.  However, 8 months later I still occasionally experience the strange muscle twitching.  Off course the doctor said this was NOT due to Botox. Right.. I'm 50 years old and have never before or since had this experience and you're trying to tell me it's not the Botox.  The ironic and tragic punishment for voluntarily injecting a neurotoxin into my body is knowing how fabulous the cosmetic results were and seeing my face slide back into looking constantly angry. I guess it's a choice between my vanity or my sanity.
Twisting Neck Spasms	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	9/14/2009 11:41:21 PM	I have nerve damage in my neck. I have had 2 treatments sofar for this, the first one did nothing. the 2nd one has been hell to me. I got a headache about 1 hour after the treatment and that night i couldn't turn my neck to the right. I am going on 4 weeks since the last shot in my neck and am having such severe pain that i can't work. I am not sure if the dr hit a muscle or nerve he shouldn't have or if it was a real bad batch of botox. But i am going to a lawyer. I can't move my neck and now it hurts to bend my head down at all. I do physical labor at my job and I can't do my job. the pain is so intense that I would rather give birth over and over again. At least that pain eventually stops.

Within 24 hours I started to have some of the worst flu-like symptoms I have ever had (including headache, malaise,fever, neck pain, nausea and anorexia). These flu-like symptoms started to lessen about day 4-5 but I still have some. Then at day 5 I started to develop dry eyes, blurred vision and double vision when driving at night. I did a search (unfortunately) after having the injection and found many others have suffered these same side effects. Please do your home work BEFORE getting this for cosmetic purposes. Looking good for 3-6 months is not worth it if have to go through all of this!

The brochure that was given to me said that eyelid drooping is very rare but is considered a sideeffect.

You will experience severe dry eyes. This drug is known to help reduce sweating so it doesn't surprise me that it will affect your tears.

However, this last treatment has left me with a drooping eyelid on one side.  It is horrible and embarrassing.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	35-44	10/9/2008 9:49:16 AM	I have gained 15 pounds out of the blue. No diet changes, no other medications.  I believe botox injections are to blame for weight gain.   If it blocks acetylcholine, maybe this could cause weight gain. I have no other idea why sudden and drastic increase in weight... baffled.
