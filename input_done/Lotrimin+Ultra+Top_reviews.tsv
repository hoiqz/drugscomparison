Did recommended application for 2 weeks. Used all of two 12g tubes of Lotrimin Ultra. Expensive but worth it as symptoms disappeared; and got bonus of reduced toenail fungus. No side effects.

Not only was it inconvenient, but it was expensive. The only thing that resulted from my use was a worse infection.

But switched to the Ultra with butenafine hydrochloride after the fungus remained to spread. The ultra worked really well. I am still using and my skin is clearing. I have never seen such a bad case of ring worm before.

I have tried Bleach, Vineager Anti-Baterial Soap, regularly changing socks and shoes. My feet still sweat, no the odor is of the cream (and not much easier to breathe). Well see in a few days if the treatment works.
