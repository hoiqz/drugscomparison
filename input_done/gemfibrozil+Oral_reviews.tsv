On the morning of Sept 2, 2012, I took the two medications together. Approximately 2 hrs.later I started to flush and sweat profusely,and suffered from severe pain and burning in the upper abdomen and was rushed to the hospital.  I spent 4 days in the hospital with diarrhea, and diagnosed with panchreatitis. No warning was given to me about the interaction between these two drugs. I asked my pharmacist afterward if there had been any bad reactions to the combination of these two drugs and he told me they could have deadly results if taken together.

But once I was unemployed and could no longer afford health insurance - Vytorin cost me over $100/month. Due to cost I stopped using Vytorin. On the internet I found out Vytorin would provide it prescription free for financially challenged people but my doctor would not sign the paperwork. I found a new doctor who first gave me a free months supply vytorin. He then researched and determined Gemfibrozil would also solve high Tryglyceride.  Gemfibrozil is only $17 for a 90 day supply (A savings of $283 over 3 months). I usually take the pill just before eating my breakfast and dinner as I don't recall (or have time) to take the pill 30 minutes prior to eating. My new doctor says it is a great success as it reduced my tryglicerides from over 800 to 82. I also take daily a multi vitamin and two 1000 mg omega-3 fish oil soft gels. I have been taking the pill for more than 6 months. There has been a loss in sex drive but prior to reading the other comments I would blame said loss from the stress and depression of being underemployed or unemployed for almost 2 years.

They have since dropped by half, but are still too high. My Dr. thinks its genetic because I don't meet the other risk factors. The only complaint is that I have gained 10 lbs. in the last year and that's with trying to exercise more and eat better! My weight usually doesn't change a bit so I wonder if its a side effect.

I have been on Gemfiborzil for about 5-6 yrs. No real noticed side effects because I blame them on the simvastatin that I take with it.  Memory loss, loss of sex drive, hoarseness, coughing, stuffy nose, sleep problems and aching &amp; itching feet &amp; calves at  night.  Also itchy scrotum.  I have also experienced the numbness and tingly feeling in my hands at times.  Maybe this is causing some of these problems.

High Amount of Triglyceride in the Blood	GaGa, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	65-74	12/8/2008 10:37:30 PM	I,m going to try to take this med a bit longer to see if the dizziness goes away because its supposed to be effective. I get terribly dizzy for about 3 hours after taking each pill, so instead of taking it 1/2 hr before meals, I'm starting to take the morning pill before dawn when I get up to go to the bathroom, then take the evening pill when I go to bed. Since pill instructions say &quot;.... 1/2 hr before eating or as ordered by Dr....&quot; I'm assuming the pills are still effective even if I don't take them 1/2 hr before meals. I don't eat on a regular schedule anyway.

This only happened one other time with Wellbuten.  I don't like this as I feel like I might have the flu or something when I really don't.  I wake up in the mornings feeling fine, no fever or chills.  I noticed that this drug can cause fevers so I'm going to ask for a med change.  Using this medication for about 6 months or so.

I take Omacor and all the other meds make me ill.  Statins are the worst.  My liver has started with cirrhosis, I do not nor have I drunk,smoke, drugs or other things such as these.  Figure it is genetic.  All my problems started once my gallbladder was incised.  I am fighting diabetes, pancreatitis, stomach (not IBS) disorder by adjusting my diet only.  I have always been an athlete.  Do you have any suggestions?  I am going to try gemfibrozil, is it at all related to statins or statin type drugs.  If so I shall have muscle problems.  I cannot take Niacin, I tried the prescription but it is to much for my liver and stomach.  My triglycerides jumped up 100 pts. to 388 when my total cholesterol, LDL are near normal and my HDL went up to 50.  I don't get it. Janice
