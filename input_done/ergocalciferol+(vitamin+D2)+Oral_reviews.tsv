Vitamin D Deficiency	Angela, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	8/9/2012 1:16:47 PM	I was prescribed by my doctor because a deficiency en Vitamin D (only 20 ng/mL). It gave me pain in my knees and ankles that I never had before. It gave me pain in my right shoulder like the pain I had 4 years ago when I had a calcified right shoulder (and had to get cortizone to break it). It make me dizzy and I also had more urine than usual.I will not take this pill anymore. I did a research with Dr. Joseph Mercola and I should take Vitamin D3 and not D2.

Vitamin D Deficiency	Maggie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	2/15/2012 11:17:47 AM	This is my 3rd week on Vit D Ergo 50,000 units. The very first week my overall joint pain was almost gone. Especially my leg pain at night. Energy level is up. I have a feeling of &quot;getting better&quot;. I live in Washington state where sunshine is hard to come by in the winter months. I wish my doctor had put me on this a long time ago. I have had no side effects, so far.
Vitamin D Deficiency	VickieD, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	3/3/2011 9:56:51 AM	diarea, vomiting, completely lathargic, incompasitative condition after 12 hours of taking 50,000mg D2 Rx. Not alot they can do but to wait it out. Make sure you start slow and build up versus the other way around. The Max you can buy OTC is 2500mg, why can a dr presc 50,000 mg???
Vitamin D Deficiency	nljackson, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	8/25/2010 7:19:35 AM	Took 50,000 IUs due to low vitamin D blood levels.  Within 5 hours of taking the medication severe nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps.  Felt like the stomach flu but no fever.  Lasted for 48 hours until D started getting out of my system.  Called my doc, will now try an OTC dose instead and build up slowly. She said nausea and diarrhea very common when starting D.  Wish she had told me before I took it.

Vitamin D Deficiency	ladymc, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	2/28/2010 2:29:06 AM	Today is my first day of taking this medication at 50,000 dose once a week (12 weeks worth unless I get refills). I was wondering why I felt tired all the time and had such a low level of energy (more than usual anyway). I live with muscle pain daily due to fibromyalgia, but my pain level was getting sharper and less bearable. I never thought about a vitamin D deficiency, but it makes a lot of sense. I wear sunscreen like crazy because I don't want anymore age spots on my face and I work graveyard. Needless to say, I do not absorb a whole lot of sunlight! I can't wait for winter to be over. So glad my doctor put me on this medication and that I only have to take it once a week.. I have a hard time keeping up with all my meds. I wish all my meds were once a week! Anyhow, I will check in later after I've given the meds some time to work. 
Vitamin D Deficiency	ICanHasBroccoli, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	12/28/2009 2:06:43 AM	My drs and I kept trying to solve my severe low energy and all over muscle pains.  These were constant, over and above upo and down anemia, and pain killers/exercises for stenosis and related lower back disease.  Also different from the sedative effect of my anti-depressant.  Tested ok on thyroid.  Tested for Vitamin D and forget exact number, but I was severely low.  Have been on 50k units of ergocalciferol once a week for 8 weeks (have 4 pills to go over 8 more weeks.  Zero side effects.  Energy increase is moderate but noticeable, especially taking less than 2 hours now to &quot;wake up&quot; in AM and ability go without naps. Do not feel exhausted 24/7.   The decrease in overall body aches is fantastic. Except for the muscles around my spine and arthritic lower back, the deep, all-overmuscle aches and bed time leg aches are GONE.  I no longer spend each day saying I feel like I fell down a flight of stairs.  My endocrinologist said Vit D deficiency is epidemic and way misdoagnosed in women.  The mega-dose worked for me.  I am very grateful- and it cost less than a dollar for my Rx.

Vitamin D Deficiency	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	9/3/2009 10:14:31 PM	Vitamin D level initially at 28. Was placed on 50000UNT, 1 capsule each week for 8 weeks. Took another blood test after week 9. Vitamin D level decreased to 27. My doctor has requested I redo the treatment and check again, but given what I am reading on the Internet, I wonder if I am a subject in a test rather than being given Vitamin D3, which seems to be more effective. Would like govt to require medical professionals to inform patients if they are being included in any medical study. So far, not at all happy with this course of action.

So glad that I discovered that NIH does not approve taking.
