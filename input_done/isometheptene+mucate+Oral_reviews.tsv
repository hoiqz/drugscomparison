It was given to me at the hospital after I went to the ER; by then I had had a headache for 15 days. My PCP wrote me a prescription after I was discharged. It works quickly and effectively for me with no side effects.
Migraine Headache	Matty, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	3	Male	45-54	9/24/2009 7:21:09 PM	I was prescripbed this medication for Migrane Headaches and for some strange reason, it seems to help. Of all the medications I have taken that are anything helpful, it causes a buzz. But this one doesn't and it seems to be somewhat effective and I mean that in a good way. It was fast acting but didn't give me a buzz and I can concentrate and think clearly, which to me is odd, but it's helpful, very helpful, I would recatend it....

I thought I'd tried everything on the market (&amp; when I say everything, I mean 17 different medications over the course of 5 years!). My doctor came across this RX and decided to give it a shot and I'm glad she did! This medicine has completely relieved me of my symptoms! Since I've started taking it I get maybe 1 a month as apposed to the usual 5-ish a week. I'm very confident in this medicine!!!

Migraine Headache	Dark Legacy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	5/24/2008 6:50:10 AM	Taking this drug only worked on my minor headaches, but as for my migranes it didn't even ease it up.  Though taking into consideration that this is just the begining, and there may be something else causing my migranes.  If that is the case then of course this medication wont work.  Only time will tell, and one other thing that has to be taken into consideration is that not all medication reacts the same way with everyone.  It may be different from person to person.  So if the doctor gives it to you then try it.  I still take it for my minor headaches.  They work wonders on stopping them instantly.
