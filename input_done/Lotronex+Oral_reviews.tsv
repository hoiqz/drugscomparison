Dr. increased dose to 1 mg 2x day, and it worked for almost a year.  Then it stopped working.  He said that sometimes your body gets used to it and it stops working.  Got fed up, went to a new dr. and he put me on something else.  We'll see......Lotronex was great for a while, then it stopped and it's very, very frustrating.  Just trying to have a life again.

Diarrhea Predominant Irritable Colon	jc, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5		25-34	3/16/2011 11:22:27 PM	I had horrible diarrhea issues that kept me at home on many occasions. I started to get panic attacks b/c I feared that my problem was going to attack on a date, at work, or while I was out with friends. I had stopped eating meals in public to try to slow down my digestive tract. I had tried so many diets and medications. I was even taking xanax for my panic attacks. Lotronex is the first thing that works and it works very well!!!

Diarrhea Predominant Irritable Colon	Kimberly, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/3/2010 11:22:28 AM	I take 1mg tablets twice daily for years and still have diarrhea about twice a week. I have had diarrhea every day of my life since 16 years old and twice a week is great for me.  They said it will take years for my body to stop being overactive in that area.  The drug needs to be made in Generic, the cost of $1400.00 in Iowa is outrageous but to someone that has lived in fear their entire life it is worth it.  Love the drug, not the price.  The other bad part of this drug is the required Rx sticker.  This doesn't allow us to have the Rx called into the pharmacy.

Doc upped my dosage to 1mg twice daily..now it's working like a charm!  So, my fear is, how long before my body gets used to this dosage and I'm right back to where I was before?  How many more times can they up the dosage?  I'm still trying to stay optimistic and enjoy how I'm feeling now!  For the time being, I have my life back!   
Diarrhea Predominant Irritable Colon	Runner, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/27/2010 11:02:47 AM	I started having digestive problems after my gall bladder was removed several years ago, but nothing I couldn't handle.  Then about a year ago I started having uncontrolled diarrhea. Sometimes I couldn't even make it to a bathroom, which was awful! I had never had that problem before. The doctor did the breath test and found bacteria in my upper intestines, after which he put me on medication for 10 days.  That helped for 30 days and then it was back to the same problem. I then had all the tests, blood, colonoscopy, endoscopy. All negative.  My diarrhea was ruining my life and I couldn't eat for fear of going to the bathroom or having an accident. He finally put me on Lotronex and it has helped a great deal.  I only take one pill 0.5mg in the morning and it helps all day. If I forget to take it one day, the next day I have diarrhea again. So I don't want to be without this drug...ever.  I have noticed some days that I have a little constipation, but I still have a BM and it certainly beats the alternative of running to the bathroom 5-6 times a day with diarrhea.  Hopefully, they keep making this drug or come up with a cure for IBD.

This is a drug that has worked for me. One problem, blue cross blue shield will not pay for the drug because it is a grender durg (females only) what a joke!!!! It is very expenvive $600.00 per month. The company will not help or even discount the drug(what a shame). If you need this med. please try it, it changed my life for the better1000%. I myself was in the test study for this drug. We were all one step above nothing. If anyone has a sugesstion to obtain this drug for a cheaper rate please put in your rewiew. Thank You and good luck.

I've had a bad 4-5 weeks. It started out fantastic, now.....not so much. I'm having the same symptoms as before I started the drug. At this point, I'm feeling like nothing will help me.

I am so pleased. The only side effect I am having is excessive sweating..my BP has been up..but I dont' think the med is causing it. I will check with dr in a few weeks. 
Diarrhea Predominant Irritable Colon	Sunshine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/15/2010 4:46:04 PM	I have tried everything until finally after 5years I was in tears and told my doctor my irritable bowel syndrome was interfering in my life. I had already told my husband to go on with his life.  I felt like I needed to be confined to my home at the age of 42.  It caused some depression because I am a very active person and felt like I needed a portable potty with me at all times. Well since I have been taking lotronex I have had no side effects and I am living Life to the fullest.  I went online and got the number for the drug co and they sent me discount cards so the medication for a 60 month supply only cost me a $15 copay. I take 1 0.5mg twice a day. I only take the evening one if I am going to be out somewhere were I might get alittle squeezy. It is WONDERFUL!  I was alittle nervous at the beginning to start it because of the side effects and waiver I had to sign but I am glad God is with me on this one!  it's the best.  You can also call the company and get them to send you a card for a 2 week trial at no cost.  You just need a RX from your dr for #30 and take it to the pharmacy with the card. Now the other discount cards you can use each card 6 times for refills.  GOOD LUCK!  Thank God for Lotronex!

Diarrhea Predominant Irritable Colon	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/8/2010 11:58:58 AM	I used this medication for about one year and it was wonderful.My doctor stopped it and had me using a something I had to mix with water that acted like immodium,and put me on bentyl.I think I will ask to go back on this because it was very helpful,especially during severe flare ups.

Doc FINALLY put me on Lotronex.  Granted, it's only been about a week and a half, but oh my!  I'm already 1000% better.  Had some stomach cramping within the first two days of starting the drug, but now that seems to have disappeared.  I love this drug! Being cautiously optimistic though!!

It has helped with my IBS a decent amount. When my life is relatively stress-free I may go six weeks without an episode of diarrhea, but when I'm more stressed I tend to have an episode every few days. It would be nice if it would work ALL the time--especially in times of high stress--but getting diarrhea once every 2-3 days is still better than 10 times a day.

More cramps, more diarrhea, more embarrasment. I started the .5 mg dose (twice a day) about a year ago.  Although I have developed some tolerance to Lotronex, I have to say it is a LIFE CHANGING medication.  I have regained QUALITY OF LIFE.  I have NO SIDE EFFECTS. Only benefits.  I can't imagine ever going back to how I was. 
Diarrhea Predominant Irritable Colon	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	6/15/2009 3:30:38 PM	I was diagnosed at the age of 16 with IBS and for years after that I went through almost every medication they could give me and finally after 4 years they perscribed lotronex and it has honestly been the first to make a significant difference. I cannot say that I am cured but I went from 4 diarrhea movements a day to 1 regular movement. I do have some of the side effects like constipation (which was something I had experienced in years) but all in all I consider this medicine a win. I am not pleased with the cost and cannot wait till there is a generic version. I cannot afford this stuff on a college student's income.

None of it worked. My episodes had gotten so bad that I was eating Pepto, Gas-X and Imodium like they were candy.  Now with Lotronex I feel much better and I am now able to go out wherever and whenever I want.  While I have had a few minor episodes its nothing compared to what things were like prior to Lotronex.

I was one of the women who begged to have it return to the market.  I continue to use the max amount most days 1 mg twice daily on occasion i will take only daily.  I adjust the doseage according to my bowel movements and have control of my life without the severe nausea, abdominal pain, and cramping that always went along with my diarrhea.  on ocassion when I have eaten too much fresh vegetables and fruit I still have to take imodium, but I can enjoy the foods that I like now.  The cost for a months supply is $800.00 and over.  I would not be able to pay for it without my insurance paying for the lions share of it.  But I have a life that does not depend on how close the bathroom is.

Diarrhea Predominant Irritable Colon	Kathy-Illinois, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/8/2009 12:29:26 PM	I've read the reviews regarding this drug, Lotronex.  I too, have suffered with IBS/D for several years &amp; for the past 5 years have been taking 1 mg p/day.  While I am most grateful for having my life back (working, shopping, socializing, etc.), I have experienced an increase in the cost of the medication for the past 13 months.  I live in IL &amp; now pay $545.00 per month for 30 pills (Initially, cost was $180.00).  I do know that Glaxco-Smith Kline SOLD this drug to Prometheus Laboratories, San Diego, CA approximately 1/08.  Whether it is new marking stratgies by Prometheus to off-set their cost of purchasing/manufacturing this drug, I feel $545.00 per month is completely UNREASONABLE both to the patient as well as my medical insurance coverage.  While I am fortunate, at the moment, to have a prescription plan which pays for 85% of the cost, this claim, per month is calculated toward my overall lifetime maximum for my major medical coverage. I feel that there is a such a small percentage of patients that fit the criteria in need of this medication we have no option, currently, other than to pay this EXCESSIVE price.  I look forward to the day when there will be a GENERIC form of this drug (as far as I know there is none).  I will be discussing this issue with my GI doctor in the very near future.  I wish everyone with this disorder continued days without our every thought being...&quot;WHERE IS THE BATHROOM&quot;. 
Diarrhea Predominant Irritable Colon	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/4/2009 10:49:59 PM	I have suffered with IBS for over 25 years.  Now I am taking Lotronex once a day and I feel that I can do almost anything that I could not do before I started to take this medication.  I was not able to go out to eat with my husband, visit with friends or even travel.  I now feel well enough to be able to enjoy the things I was missing in my life. I am even back at school to get my BS in Health Studies.
Diarrhea Predominant Irritable Colon	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/19/2009 7:35:50 PM	This medication needs &quot;carefull&quot; management by pts themselves. I was perscribed 0.5mg and told after a week, I could up the dose to 10mg.  I take 1/4 to 1/2 of 0.5mg daily and it's a wonder drug. My IBS in 30yrs has never been so controled.

I am aware that there are some risks that come with this drug, but I am not willing at this time to give them up. Recently I have been diagnosed with colon ulcers, but my doctor assured me that it is not from taking Lotronex. I have researched it and I will continue with the drug. I have my life back again....

I teach middle schoolers, and before this drug I was looking for another career. I take the max dose, 2 1mg tabs per day, and still have some urgency, some loose stools, but no more accidents, leakage or explosive diarrhea. I wish a higher dose was available to me, but as long as this dosage keeps working like this, I'll be happy.

I am wondering if any of you taking Lotronex is having a problem with gas. My body acts as if  it's job is to make gas all day. The condition is severe.

I was constantly seeking out bathroom locations and an embarassing situation in a cab ride just about made me hand in my resignation.  This drug has without a doubt saved my life and I have no fear of traveling or meeting clients for meals.  I don't take it every day, only when I recognize the symptoms of IBS and I immediately take a pill.   Just knowing that the episode will pass I am immediately relaxed and ready to carry on with my day.  I thank God that my physician put me on this miracle drug.  He gave me back my life.

I have severe diarrhea. This pill makes me normal. Imodium was good for me, but it did not form the stool. This pill forms the stool. I have been on this medication for several years now. I hope it never stops working for me.

I was unable to participate in activities because I never knew when a bout may occur.  They were severe and occurred often.  Since taking the medication i am able to enjoy life again and I feel great too.  I know that the medication has it's risk but in my situation the benefits have far outweighed the risk and I am not even taking the full minimal dose of the medication!
