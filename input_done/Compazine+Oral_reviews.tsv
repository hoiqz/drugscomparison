Works better than Phenergan and also helps my severe anxiety almost better than Klonopin, a benzo which I have been on for 15 years = killing 2 birds w/one stone. First dose made me  a little dizzy, but that is more tolerable than feeling like I am going to puke 24/7.

Almost lost my mind on this one. Had to receive 2 shots of Benadryl just to settle down enough to sleep through the affects. It's already the following day and my eyes are still blood shot red and I find it very difficult to sit still. Best advice: stay clear away from this one.

Nausea and Vomiting	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	2	1	1	Female	25-34	5/9/2011 3:21:15 AM	I was given this through an IV in the ER....I went for help with a migraine and nausea. Within five minutes I knew something was wrong. I went from a somewhat normal, calm mood to feeling almost psychotic. It's hard to describe but everything felt wrong and bad and I wanted to crawl out of my skin. I couldnt stop moving, I started pulling my hair...it was the worst feeling I've EVER had in my entire life. They gave me benadryl which reversed everything. The best part was the $1100 bill I got stuck with for having this nightmare injected into my veins. This drug needs to be eradicated completely!!

Nausea and Vomiting	PomMom, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	10/21/2010 3:56:50 PM	I was sick with the flu my freshman year of college. I had a note on my file at my doctor's office that I was allergic to Phenergen, but for some reason my doctor prescribed me Compazine for my nausea. I had no idea they were related. The 3rd day I took it, I had to open at a tiny retail store I worked at by myself that morning. I blacked out for THIRTY minutes and when I awoke my eyes were rolling, my tongue and jaw locked up, and I couldn't speak. I ended up in the ER and they tried to claim I was suffering from TMJ and tried to say I would sleep it off. Finally a doctor came in and realized I was having a textbook Dystonic drug reaction due to Compazine. I now wear a medical bracelet for my allergy to Compazine, Regalin, and Phenergen. I use Zofran now, and I have never had an adverse reaction to it at all. Please don't try Phenergen, Regalin, or Compazine. I have several other friends and family members who had similar reactions!

The IV was strange I felt like my heart was racing and I couldn't breath but they gave me something else and I relaxed. I did fill the scrip and took one pill at home. It was awful I felt totally out of control, like I couldn't move or speak! I'll never take it again. I take Zofran and it works great with no side effects or sometimes Phenegren but that make me sleepy.

Nausea and Vomiting	shannon, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	4/10/2010 4:21:05 AM	i am a 32 year old female nurse, who was given compazine iv in the er for nausea and vomiting.  the medication made me feel like i was going crazy.  i wanted to remove my iv and walk right out of the er, but i didn't.  i had never experienced that feeling before.  my heart was racing, and i didn't feel like i could wait another minute.  i even told the doctor how i felt, and he told me it was normal.  i rocked back and forth on the bed, then paced around in the room.  finally, i disconnected my own iv.  my head was pounding, i thought i would go insane.  i wish i would have called my nurse back to tell her how i was feeling.  now that i am home and was able to do some research, i found out that this is a common side effect of compazine.  i don't understand why doctors are prescribing it more commonly than phenergan, which worked perfectly fine for me.  i am adding this to my allergy list.  i would rather retch for days than feel like i'm going to go completely bonkers again.  i will never recommend this medication to anyone.  beware.

Dr gave a prescription  for the oral type but I will never take it again!! I don't think it should be on the market. Also, the migraine that I was in the ER to have treated is still lingering.

After taking the drug for a couple days, I began to have seizure like symptoms, jerking muscles in by face, arms, and upper body.  My throat muscles were contracting etc. very, very scarey.  My father came home and found me lying in the floor. I knew something wasn't right but it was as if I couldn't do anything about it and had no control over my body.  He took me to the ER and they gave me several shots of Benadryl. I will never take this drug again. As I said before--very scarey--:(

Over the next 6 days I am experiencing overheating, tremors, convulsions, severe insomnia, diarhea and nausea. It shows no signs of letting up anytime soon even though I'm taking benedryl as a recommended antidote. This drug should be illegal.

Other	SaavyBear, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	13-18	9/21/2009 6:47:17 PM	I had had a horrible migraine and went into the er to get tretment. they gave me the compzine to help treat it. I was on it the first day and noticed my jaw not wanting to go where it normally goes. That night it started clenching and spasming horribly. I thought it was just an anxiety attack. The next day I continued taking the medication, but the jaw problem persisted. That night my tounge kept going to the back of my throat cutting off my airway, so my mother took to the the er. The doctor listed off some medicines I might have taken and compozine was one of them. He immediatly knew I was having a distonic reation and gave me Benadryl IV. It worked within minutes. Upon leaving the hospital I was prescribed an anti-distonia medicine to take for the next 2 days. So far it is helping. I read the other comments and was scared to learn the distonia could have caused permeinant damage. I never want to go through this experience again.

I was prescribed this medication for nausea early on in my first pregnancy (about 9-12 weeks along). Before the day was over, I began feeling unsettled and anxious. The dystonic reaction quickly followed along with seizures. I couldn't keep my tongue in my mouth or my jaw closed. My eyes were rolling around in my head. My husband was at work and unreachable (we were stationed on an Air Force base in NC), so I called the MPs. They came to my house and drove me to the base ER. It was a good hour before the ER doc and my OB could figure out what was wrong. None of them had ever seen my reaction. I spent a few days in the hospital, my daughter was later born just fine. A few months after that, it happened to another pregnant woman on our base. This time, my OB knew exactly what was wrong with her.

Stopped vomiting right away.  Terrible side effects.  Total loss of tongue control and other facial muscles.  Quite scary; thought I was having a stroke or something.  Trip to the ER fixed it - I think they gave me Benadryl.

Nausea and Vomiting	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	1/30/2009 3:22:57 AM	Although this medication was easy to use and stopped the nausea completely I was fully unprepared for the rare, and extremely frightening side effect I experienced. I had taken the medication with no problem for a bit when out of the blue my muscles started to contract in a bizarre twisting motion until I was horrifyingly paralyzed in what's known as a dystonic reaction.  As if this were not enough, in the ambulance I discovered I could no longer move my eyes, close my mouth or keep my tongue from protuding.  When I arrived at the hospital these effects did not wear off until I was given 4 IV injections.  I have never been through anything like this and since have become almost neurotically scared of any new medications.(NOTE: most patient drug literature fails to mention this side effect)
Nausea and Vomiting	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	1/29/2009 1:25:00 AM	When I was a sophmore in high school I was given Compazine to combat the nausea from my bronchitis.  I started the drug on Monday and felt fine.  On Tuesday morning I took the drug and went to school. I started to break out in the cold sweats and just feeling fuzzy in the head. By second period I was losing control of all the muscles in my upper body.  I remember my neck was twitching so hard and all I could focus on was a clock behind me.  I was rushed to the emergency room and given benadryl via a shot in the tush. The nurse was telling me how common it is to see people coming in with distonic reactions. Honestly, I would rather vomit all day long than ever take this drug again. 
Schizophrenia	relief, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/27/2009 9:27:02 PM	I was about 20yrs old and was given this for nausea and continuous vomiting. Like everyone else said i got this strange feeling in my head. I felt like my whole body was convulsing and jittery. My eyesight was faded and I litterally felt like I was have some sort of seizure but I could remember everything. I was given a mega dose of Benadryl which knocked me out for two days and vowed to never, ever take Compazine again. I always make sure that is the first thing I tell a doctor.

I had no side affects at all, and will have it ready and waiting after my next treatment.

I was told then that if I ever took compazine or any other meds with 'zine' in the name that I would more than likely experience worse effects.

One evening I was with my family and I had taken the med the night prior and I started having a distonic reaction, it was like I was seizing. My muscles would tighten up and contract and my extremities would uncontrollably twitch, which resulted in an ambulance trip. The hospital that I went to couldn't put their finger on the cause. They actually gave my IV compazine for my migraine and benadryl to cease the reaction. Then two days later it happened again at work. I started feeling funny, luckly I work in a hospital, so I walked down to the ER and started with the dystonic reactiion again. ALSO, I have pancreatitis from the compazine, which is another side effect from the lovely drug. Come to find out compazine rectally is off the market and has been for a year now, so why not orally and IV? And it was not my first time taking the med and I said, I had taken it several times in the past for N/V.
Nausea and Vomiting	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Male	25-34	11/15/2008 3:18:39 PM	I was giving this med for nausea. I took it evry night for a month and had violent shakings for 10 to 15 minutes. I have been off the pill for a week and still get shaking spells during the night. The side effects of this drug are worse than my illness. I will never take it again. I think this drug needs to be reviewed.

Nausea and Vomiting	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	19-24	10/23/2008 11:37:25 AM	I was 18 years old when I was perscribed this drug.  I was taking it to prevent nausea and vomiting.About a week after I began using compazine, I started experiencing blurry vision and extreme jitteriness.  I had this happen to me a couple times in one day, each episode lasting no more than 1 hour.  I decided to lay down and try to sleep it off.  Before I could get relaxed, my neck began experiencing painful and involuntary muscle spasms.  My head and neck would bend as far backwards, forwards, or sideways as it possibly could.  I visited the ER and was given an IV of Benadry &amp; within 5 minutes I passed out.  The Compazine was giving me a dystonic reaction.  I believe I had this reaction because I was taking the medication too often.  Compazine is an effective drug (I did not experience any nausea), but should only be used when symptoms arise.

It hits when ever I am in a car over three hours or flying. I was perscribed this drug and within ten to fifteen minutes it stopped the sickness. I have taken it for many years now and it is still the only medication that works for me to control motion sickness. No side affects and I have taken up to three 10 MG tablets per day. 
Nausea and Vomiting	Josh, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	13-18	9/20/2008 2:37:18 AM	I took Compazine for a few days, woke up the next morning and felt really strange. I couldn't get comfortable anywhere. After a little while I finally went back to sleep. A few hours later I woke up again I started to feel extremely depressed. More than I've ever been in my entire life. Then my jaw started to lock up, my eyes began rolling up into my head and all the muscles in my back and neck were freezing up. I knew that something was really wrong but couldn't do anything about it. It all happened very quickly. The only thing I could do was to shake it off for a second. Luckily, my aunt showed up and found me standing in the doorway trying to go for help with my back arched, eyes rolled back and jaw locked. She carried me to the couch and called for help. A few minutes later, EMS came and knew exactly what was happening. They called it a dystonic reaction. They made a quick phone call and then gave me a shot, 1,000mg of Benadryl. Everything stopped immediately. After a trip to the hospital to double check my condition, I went home and past out. From all the Benadryl they gave me. A few hours later, it happened again. A friend drove me back to the hospital and I got another shot of Benadryl. Went back home and finally got some sleep. The next morning my entire body was so sore I could barley move. It was the scariest and one of the most painful ordeals I've ever been though. I seriously think this drug should be recalled. I do know it is prescribed for other conditions but in my book, no sickness is worth this risk.
Nausea and Vomiting	LoveBonnie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/17/2008 2:33:03 AM	I have been on medication that has caused me to vimit and afterward to be severly nausuated to the point of sweating and dizzy. This medication stopped me within 15 minutes of ingesting it. 1 pill worked wonders for me and I was feeling so much better in 15 minutes.
Nausea and Vomiting	momto4girls, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	7/3/2008 3:46:29 PM	I am almost 35 years old and after looking up another drug I decided to look up Compazine and see if other people had similar experiences while taking this medication. I was prescribed this medication while I had the flu when I was about 18 years old. I was out of town and went to the local hospital (and either wasn't told of side effects or didn't read the papers...) but I had a 3 hour drive ahead of me. I was about 30 minutes from home and things were going on with my head\face. I couldn't lower my tongue from the roof of my mouth and my eyes seemed to be fixed on looking up. It was one of the scariest days of my life. I realized I needed to get off the freeway and call for help. I thankfully (after praying alot) made it to a gas station and managed to find a quarter for the pay phone. Imagine only being able to look up and try to navigate around somewhere you hav never been. My parents came to get me and my dad drove my truck home. After I got home my throat started tightening up and it was awful. I slept off the reaction and will NEVER take it again. It's not worth the risk. 
Nausea and Vomiting	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	5/31/2008 10:49:13 PM	Was going ok for almost 2 days on this pill.  Then suddenly my tongue and mouth started swelling up, my face and jaws started spasming, and then tightening up where I couldn't move my mouth.  The pain was horrendous.  Thankfully we had an immediate care center nearby, and luckily for us, the Dr there knew that Compazine has these types of side effects.  Within 10 minutes of getting there, they had an IV in and pushed a shot of Benadryl into it.  About 2 minutes later all symptoms were subsiding. Ten minutes later and all was back to normal.  The onset of these symptoms was very sudden, and like I said, almost 2 days after I started taking it.  Be careful, if you get prescribed this med.  The Dr that helped me said that if you dont get treatment for it soon enough, or if the reaction is strong enough, that the facial disfiguration that comes with this can be permanent.  That was one of the scariest days of my life.
Severe Nausea and Vomiting that has Lasted a Long Time	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	19-24	5/31/2008 7:07:42 PM	I was given this medication to stop a severe flu, and I would have rather had the severe flu after taking just one pill. My body completly had muscle spasms and my tongue swelled and my jaw locked...causing several of my teeth to chip. It was the WORSE day of my life. I would NEVER suggest this drug. I went to the ER and all they can is give you allergy pills and wait it out.

Nausea and Vomiting	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	5/18/2008 8:52:17 PM	i agree with the first person who commented i had a terrible reaction. one of the scariest things i have experienced. i was perscribed this med when i had a sinus infection and was vomiting. a couple of days later my mom took me to the er because i was dehydrated and getting worse. when admitted and hooked up to the iv i began to tense up and lost control of everything, by eyes, my jaw was clenching, my head was tiltng and rolling back. this was terrible, and to top things off i knew what was going on, but could do nothing about it. i would rather have a seizure and not know what the hell happened than feel like i am going nuts and cant control it. they gave me bend. and i calmed down. this is crazy i am not the only one! i am now working in the hospital and am a nursing student, so i am anxious to find out what the cause is!
Other		1	1	1			4/27/2008 2:28:17 AM	I got sent to ER with a major migraine. They gave me compazine and sent me home. The next day, maybe 12 hours later my legs started to tense up, like I couldn't relax them. Then my jaw started to clench. It got worse and worse, I almost bit my finger trying to take an Ibuprofen to relax everything. By the time I ended up in ER again my whole body was contorted. I couldn't control anything; not the muscles, not the direction my head facing/tilting, not the arch of my back... nothing. Apparently that was a &quot;text-book&quot; reaction. Pretty scary. Hope this helps someone out.

It works great for me very quickly with NO side effects! I have even used it before when I have had the flu and it helped greatly with the nausea.
