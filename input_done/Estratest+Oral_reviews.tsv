Now 62 taking half tablet everyday. Not sure when I need to stop. It is a great drug for woman without ovaries and uterus. 
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	8/24/2011 8:44:24 AM	My Dr gave me this to help increase my libido. I'm almost 57 and had to have a complete hysterectomy when I was 29. I took Premarin for years and came off of it when all the bad reports started coming out about it. Initially this med helped however in the last week I have developed a vaginal discharge, extremely itchy and it has a smell to it. Told my husband that we couldn't do anything, I don't want him to get it if it is a yeast infection. Haven't had a problem like this in literally years!! Also I have become extremely moody, almost angry at everything. That is not me!! Have also developed sinus problems that I do not normally have and some acne on my chin. Have become very tired feeling in the last couple of weeks, no energy at all. Really disappointed in this med!! I will be coming off this medication and trying to find something natural to take.

Other	1success, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/31/2011 9:06:52 AM	I started taking Estratest approximately 10 years ago for SLE( Systemic Lupus), after reading that it could promote remission(in some instances) of the disease. After about three months, I did in fact go into remission. Now, ten years later, the disease has returned with a vengeance. I have shown some improvement on Plaqunil, but not enough to experience any quality of life. Again, I will request Estratest or its generic from my gyn and hope for the same results.

I am 25 years old and had a total hysterectomy in 2008. After trying other drugs, this one was the most effective. However, I have gained about 20lbs of which I CANNOT GET RID OF. I also have experienced more aggresstive behavior and just seem to have less patience than before...I react with anger in an instant and then wonder where it came from. I hate to stop taking it because it does work great for getting rid of the hot flashes, night sweats, etc. but I just don't think the side effects are worth it anymore...

I also noticed that I felt more &quot;aggressive&quot; and angry. The one thing it did for me was to relieve hot flashes very well, esp when used in combo w/Vivelle dot patch.  However, my depression/moods worsened, have had bad headaches and worst of all, gained 15 lbs in one month and was still going up so I decided to stop and try something else.

Worked great ever since the beginning,now it isn't on the market. My dr changed me to estradiol, it is almost the same. I do have the night sweats now &amp; some moodiness. I tried the vivelle dot patch for a couple of months but it didn't work at all &amp; when dr increased the patch it made me vomit uncontrollably. So, we had to go to estradiol. Wouldn't give up this med for any reason, it has helped me a lot.

After nearly 6 months, I was profoundly depressed, could not sleep, had gained weight and was miserable.  Found a generic replacement for estratest(EEMT HS), and have been on it for one month.  I have lost the weight, I'm sleeping again and am back to my normal, upbeat self.  I am blown away by how powerfully I was affected by the other drug, and how big of a change this has made in my life. I highly recommend the EEMT for those who are looking for a replacement to estratest.

You can go to www.centrixpharmaceuticals.com and get a $10 rebate coupon for this medication. It has the same exact medication as Estratest. I have been a nurse for 25 years and I study these things. Covaryx works as well as Estratest because it is the same medicine. Just a different company making it.. Trust me..

Never experienced any of the menopause systems until stopped taking it for 7 days (other doctors, nurses negative comments on use).  After only 7 days starting having severe night sweats; after 22 days husband INSISTED I &quot;get medicine now&quot;.  After 5 days was fine again. All was great until May &quot;09 found out my insurance will no longer cover this medicine and no longer available.  Starting taking Premarin and IT IS NOT as good. In just 2 weeks started having mild hot flashes, some night sweats and weird mood swings.  After 4 months I am quite miserable and very unhappy.  Guess I get to start the &quot;drug taking experiment&quot; to see what will come close to previous experience.  Why do they mess with a good thing?

Like everyone else taking this med, I was shocked when just today Medco notifies my doctor's office that Estratest HS is no longer available.  Not satisfied with second/third hand information, I called Medco and spoke with a pharmacist - who was full of information!  (1)  ESTRATEST (full strength) is still being produced by Solvay.  (2)  MOST IMPORTANT:  Now available is &quot;EEMT HS&quot; (esterified estrogens;methyltestosterone HALF STRENGTH).  This cannot yet be called a &quot;generic,&quot; but the pharmacist advised it has the identical components of ESTRATEST HS except for the coating.  This was also verfied by a Kroger pharmacist.  And, a pharmacy assistant showed me the containers of both full and half-strength - ON THE SHELF!  A Medco rep, for all the good they were today, did advise that it is covered by insurance.GOOD LUCK!!

I had a complete hysterectomy when I was 27 and I am now 42.  They put me on hormones after my hysterectomy and I gained alot of weight years ago also.  I had never been heavy at all in life even after having kids!  Almost three years ago I had a gastric bypass because of the excessive weight gain and had lost all my unwanted weight.  Now that I'm on hormones again and gaining some weight already I don't now if its worth it and it scares me to be on the hormones!!

My body has been rejecting the menapausal systems for some time now.  I was taking hormone shots prior to this medication, and nothing seems to work.  I continue to have hot flashes, mood swings, and very bad headaches.
