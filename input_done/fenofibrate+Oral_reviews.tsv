In 5 months my Triglycerides went down from 424 to 95 and my HDL went up from 30 to 45. My LDL is 110 and total cholesteorl is 181.I am so relieved that this medicine helped me as my Trigs had been high for 2 years.I still have to take this medicine per Doctors orders. Only negative is that the medicine is expensive and I have a mild upset stomach a couple times but nothing major.

I had a complete work up done and everything was pretty good except my cholestereol levels. I was put on Simvastatin, and started having excess muscle pain immediately. I already have Neuropathy, RA and Fibromyalgia so I am used to pain. This pain was too much to stand though so after several months I called my doctor and got off of the drug. A little over a month ago I had to go in for a reading and my Blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels had elevated again. The doctor put me on this Fenofibrate and it seems to be okay. I still have a little muscle pain and now I also have a little nausea, and constipation. I am not so fatigued though. I think I will try and stay on it for a while and see how it works.

My wife is made at me for not telling the doctor, but I feel better now than I have in a long time.

I started having cardiac arrythmia almost immediately which stopped when I discontinued the drug. I have had excellent results with Atkins diet before for the high Triglycerides, but had quit it as I am not that fond of much meat. I would rather eat the Atkins way than experience the arrythmia. I also have had increased muscle pain, &amp; stomach pain like &quot;hunger pangs&quot; even after eating. It might be a good drug for high tryglicerides, but being sensitive to many medications, it's simply not worth the risks for me.

It is the only fibrate my drug company covers. Initially, my cholesterol and trig's lowered to near-normal levels after 2 months of using fenofibrate. Over the past couple of years, my cholesterol and trig. levels have slowly started to rise. My Dr. was going to increase the fenofibrate to 200mg a day, but at my appointment I complained of muscle aches and pains.  He ordered a battery of tests, labs and diagnostics. Everything was normal except my CPK level was considerably high. CPK is a muscle enzyme produced by muscle trauma or breakdown.  Surgery, strenuous activity or exercise can cause an elevated CPK. Fibrates and other medications can cause it to rise as well. My Dr. suspected it was a side effect of the fenofibrate, and he had me stop treatment for 2 months. He repeated the CPK lab, and it had dropped.  So apparently it was the fenofibrate.  Right now, needing cholesterol and trig. lowering medication, He re-started me on the fenofibrate 160mg a day.  I go back for labs (CPK and lipid profile) in 8 weeks.  I am again experiencing muscle aches and pain, but I really need to be on the medication. I take anti-inflammatories four times a day to help with the discomfort. Hopefully my labs will all be good, and the discomfort passes. I really wish there was a larger selection for this class of drug.

Started with TriCor (160mg) and about 6 years ago was switched to micronized fenofibrate (134mg). In between the switch I tried Lipitor, however my Triglycerides (TG) went up and HDL went down. As long as I pay moderate attention to diet my lipids results have been really good with the micronized fenofibrate.  TG 89, TC 152, HDL 57, LDL 77 with TC:HDL Ratio of 2.67.Im not aware of any side effects and my ALT/SGPT results are fine. I do take it with dinner, however when I forget I take in later with a couple of small low fat and sugar cookies and skim milk. I have noticed a little occasional stomach irritation if I take the fenofibrate with just water. Plus, I understand the drug is absorbed much better with a meal.I have improved my diet and physical condition immensely over the past couple years and plan on asking the Doc to let me try the lower dosage (67mg) Fenofibrate. Hopefully, I will be able to maintain the good results.
