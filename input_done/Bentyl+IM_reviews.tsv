Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/9/2011 8:06:05 PM	I have ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis &amp; gallbladder issues. I have been taking Bentyl off &amp; on for about 6mos. It has saved my life! I am back in college full-time, able to run my home &amp; care for my children &amp; husband once again!The pain stops within 10 min. upon takin Bentyl. At first, it did make my chesy hurt in the right side. I panicked and went to the e.r. The actual cause was since the bentyl stops the spasms, sometimes gas builds up and moves to my chest. It also made my heart pound hard at first, but all of those side effects have subsided and I feel amazing! For the most part, I eat a soft diet like yogurt, chicken noodle soup, rice with boullian cubes and okra. However, we can pick up take out or meet for lunch at a restaurant and I can actually eat b/c I know that my bentyl with keep me from going into gut wrenching pain! I reccommend this for ANYONE who suffers gastric or digestive pain!
Irritable Colon	Review Bentyl,  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1			10/12/2010 3:47:48 PM	Because I was unable to get the medication that I had been using for the Spastic Colon, my doctor askd me to try Bentyl. After a couple days of taking the medication my vision became blurry and my eyes begin to hurt. Got off the medication and my vision cleared up. My eyes are still sensitive but the vision has been cleared up. Will never take the medication again.

I have a very sensitive bowel. Spasams, pain ets. For reasons that I nor my doctor can determine exactly, My bowel has spasms 24/7. Since I can remember I have had bowel/stomach progblems. I have taken many anti-cholinergic drugs. But only the Bentyl works for me. My bowel spasms have gotten worse as I get older. And the spasms have traveled down into both legs and feet. The pain at times has been very bad. My doctor has prescribed literally every drug on the market for me. Nothing works except the Bentyl.  For me it works.It has no doubt saved my life. I can't imagine what my life would be like were it not for Bentyl. I understand it is an old drug and very safe.  Thank God for Bentyl. It does not cure my spastic bowel but it sure does make it a whole lot better. I highly recomment this drug to people with bowel problems. I am also milk/lactose intolerant. I do not use dairy products period...I consider them my enemy.BVH Near Atlanta, Ga

It did nothing for me, except made me break out in rashes all over my body.  The doctor had to immediately give me a shot of Decadron to reverse the rashes.
