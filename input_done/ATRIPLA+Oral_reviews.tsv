HIV	squishy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	6/29/2012 11:54:13 AM	When first started taking this drug I got a head to to rash which itched like crazy. This rash lasted about a month (which i read 48% of people get on the atripla website). No crazy dreams, no hot flashes, the first 3-4 days was a little dizzy but that also went away. Only problem is it really kicked up my depression a TON but upped my effexor with a dash of abilify and that seemed to fix that. besides the depression problem, nothing else seems to happen. My VL became undetectable in 6 WEEKS and waiting on my CD4 count to come in. 
HIV	Carlos, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	5/16/2012 11:34:20 AM	Ive started Atripla on July 2011 and for the first 3 months I went through a crazy adjustment period. Extreme Dizziness mainly. The dizziness subsided when I didn't have any dairy about 2 hrs before I took the med at night.  This has worked. I did develop red sploches on my face but got LOTRISONE from my dr and it went away. I use about once or twice weekly.My levels are really great. So far my VL is undetectable and my CD4 is rising(about 300 right now).  The dreams are interesting but Im finding that I need more than 8 hours sleep and keep a simple life to avoid undue stress.  Overall I'm happy with the results.

HIV	dance_man101,  Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male		10/13/2011 11:18:18 PM	My side effects with this medication includes: BAD DREAMS, CONSTIPATION, FUZZY TONGUE, EXTRA HUNGRY, EXTRA HORNY, MOOD SWINGS... I was told that some of these are possible side effects even though its not necessarily could come from just this medication alone. I am also on other meds.  
HIV	Tim, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male	35-44	10/10/2011 10:57:46 AM	I started on Atripla upon being diagnosed HIV positive in January 2011.  It quickly lowered my viral load to undetectable and my t cells rose, however, the side effects were really difficult to deal with.  The first couple of weeks I couldn't sleep at all with very vivid dreams, felt dizzy until mid morning, and had an overall feeling that something was just not right.  I continued to take it until September 2011.  The side effects subsided a bit but I found myself mentally confused at times and developed uncontrollable muscle spasms.  At the time I was also being treated for KS.  A change in doctors prompted discussion about other meds available and I switched to Isentress/Truvada.  Immediately I felt much better.  I no longer felt that something was wrong, no dizziness, no more dreams, no confusion.  
HIV	poppasito, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	10/3/2011 2:12:37 PM	I have now been on Atripla since May of this year.  All of my counts are fantastic, but I did go through an adjustment period of about one month when I started it.  I took a Leave Of Absence from work and it was a good thing.  It was pretty difficult at first, but don't really have much for side effects any more, just occasionally get a little dizzy about 1 1/2 to 2 hours after taking it.  So I take near bed time and that is the way to go for me.

My doc started me on Atripla on July 12th. Intially the side effects were really rough. The dreams, aches, gas, sleeplessness, nausea. But now it has gotten better. They did labs on August 25th, and my cd4 is now 139 and my viral load is undetectable, so I know the medicine is working. I feel that even though have to deal with the occasional weird dream or strange warm sensation after taking Atripla, its worth it, because I feel so much better than I did before starting it.

HIV	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	7/27/2011 8:44:00 PM	I was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS on April 4, 2011, and began taking Atripla daily on April 12, 2011.  At that time, CD4 count was 17, and my viral load was 188,000.  I was most likely HIV-positive for about 6 years (+/-) before my diagnosis, but was always afraid to get tested for fear of the result.  As of July 11, 2011, after just 3 months of starting Atripla, my CD4 count is 120, and my viral load is 179.  I couldn't be more pleased with the results.  GET TESTED!!!

Started taking drugs in 1998 some side effects; anaemia, irritable bowels, high blood sugar. Eventually switched to Atripla in 2009 and all is well. Did develop high blood pressure and high cholestrol during treatment but no other effects. Both are well managed with diet and exercise. Side effects: odd dreams, fluctuating cravings, hypertension, increased serum lipid levels but still in the normal range.

Have been on Atripla for approx 3+ years. Had some great dreams at 1st but those are gone now. I believe in this drug &amp; can't wait for an even better one to come out. Good luck to all who need this medication...
HIV	35-44 Male 	3	4	2	Male	35-44	7/9/2011 12:53:44 AM	My doctor convinced me to switch to Atripila from Trizivir, which has served me well, but is an older medication and the long-term effects of AZT concerned him some.  So I gave it a try and like a lot of folks had some vivid, interesting dreams but tolerated it well for about 5 weeks until I broke out in severe hives, so now he wants me to stop taking it and go back to what I was taking.  Curious to see if anyone else has had such a delayed allergic reaction to the sustiva part of atripila.  My doc didn't seem to think it was that unusual and side side effects don't necessarily show up right away.  It just seems that I would have had an allergic reaction sooner but I guess it had to build up in my system?  I started thinking of everything I did that day, including a massage that may have triggered that kind of reaction, but I guess I'll trust my doctor and stop the medication.

HIV	BulldogNM, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/30/2011 12:04:17 PM	Diagnosed with HIV/AIDS 18 months ago with a viral load greater than 400k and a CD4 count of 2. My physcian started me on ATRIPLA immediately. The worst side effect I experienced was insomnia. Six months into treatment, I began taking the med in the AM, on an empty stomach (about an hour before breakfast), and within a few weeks began to sleep more regularly at night. Currently, my viral load is non-detect (&lt;50) and CD4 has increased to 190. I have not experienced/noticed (if any) GI discomfort, fatigue, dizziness or other side effects, and am sleeping well at night. This regimen seemingly works for me, but please inform your healthcare worker when making any changes to your regimen, even the time when you take your meds.

Of course I was and probably still am in shock as I've always been &quot;safe&quot;  I've been on Atripla for about two weeks now along with Isentress, (sp?).  Next set of labs to be done in a few weeks.  After reading the reviews, I'm very hopeful that this medication will have me feeling &quot;normal&quot; again.  That VL will be down and cd4 up.  Thus far, I've experienced the drunken feeling and the inability to sleep without sleeping pills

HIV	atripla lover, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	2/7/2011 1:35:37 AM	I was diagnosed in summer 2010 with VL of 7500 and CD at 500.  I started atripla as my first drug, which is really great pill.  Just one pill before bedtime and all my hiv care is taking care off.  First two weeks I had experienced vivid dreams, skin rashes and diarrhea, but they were going away after that initial period. Skin rash can be controlled with benadryl and diarrhea with proper food and probiotics. 30 days after my treatment, my VL was and is undetectable and CD is boosted to 750.  I feel increased energy, strength, and appetite with this drugs. Atripla is true miracle drug for us with hiv.  It is easy to take and easy to tolerate.  25 years ago, I would plan for death, but now I can look for years ahead with manageable regiment.  This drug revolutionized hiv treatment due it simplicity, no handful of pill with strange combination everyday. If this pill would be around in 1985, thousands who died from hiv would be still around.

HIV	rkmarie7, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	1/23/2011 5:30:54 AM	I started taking Sustiva/Truvada about 2003.  I was living with a man who infected me intentionally.....meaning he knew he had HIV.  I would have stayed by his side, just like my husband who died in 1994.  My husband was a heavy partier and refused to take meds.  He died of complications of AIDS....Lymphoma.  And the nurses and doctors back then were heartless.  Thank God times have changed and some people realize you cannot &quot;catch&quot; it by a hug or a kiss.  Yet most people are still very judgemental.  I am a mother....of a beautiful almost 17 year old girl who has known I've had this disease since day 1.  She and I are very close and she, thank God, is very healthy.  She worries about me yet doesn't show it because she has gotten &quot;thick skin&quot; from this experience.When I first took Sustiva and Truvada,  (which is now Atripla) it took a major toll on me for about 6 months or so.  I was a friggin nutcase.  I had a really bad temper and just felt like a different person.  It was sad.  But after about a year, my numbers went up a lot.  When I was first diagnosed, I was borderline AIDS....260 CD4 (T Cell) and 70,000 (Now I can't think of the word...ugh!)  But almost 8 years later my CD4 is over 1,000 and I am undetectable!!!   The only thing is now, because I have taken it for so long, I am getting weird side effects like short tempered and very extremely depressed.  I take 80mg Prozac daily and that seems to help a little but sometimes I get so depressed nothing helps.  However that couold be due to the fact that my life in general is not a happy one.  I have too much stress and I married a non HIV man almost 2 years ago (thinking no one else would have me) and he has made my life much worse...he is as cold as they get...so I will be filing for divorce soon.  Hopefully that will make a difference in my depression.  My daughter is awesome and funny but I think she is scared to lose her Mommy.  If you know what I'm going through e-mail me at rkmarie7@gmail.com. TTYS!
HIV	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	25-34	1/14/2011 11:25:06 PM	I have been taking the drug for about 2 weeks now.  I had vivid/unusual dreams the first night but then they went away.  The only thing I am struggling with is this insomnia that is making me very short tempered and irritable.  I find drinking herbal teas helps me get to sleep but not to stay asleep.  I have been taking sleeping pills with a glass of bear to help me sleep at night, otherwise I would be yelling at people all the time.

Twenty years ago they would have cornered us all in the Doctors offices and told us to get our affairs in order.The one-a-day is perfect and I hope everyone's drug can someday be a one-a-day.The first few weeks I had the dreams, was so groggy, and OMG the dizziness!  But I stuck with it, and am now through all of that.  Every once in a while if I eat something high in fat or sugars side effects will reappear.  Just keep an empty stomach, take it at the EXACT same time every night...EVERY night.  I missed about three doses last quarter and got bumped up out of undetectable and freaked out, now...my VL is 1.68/ML, NOT a typo.  CD4's are at 784, which are down, however I expect those to be better on the next labs.

HIV	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	10/28/2010 11:09:54 PM	My fiance and I both started this med around 6 months ago. I started out with a cd4 count of 240 and a vl of 80,000. my fiance started with a cd4 count of 73 and a vl of 200,000+. I started a week before him, and I thought that hell was near for a week straight!!!!!!!! Couldn't eat, work, or move out of bed for that matter. When he started his the next week he did not get out of bed for almost two weeks, But after the third week things progressively got better for the both of us. We now have vl that are undetectable, and my cd4 count is 590 and his is 270!!!!!!!!! We both still have some nausea in the mornings, and i continue to have vivid dreams. Overall I am happy with this med because it is easy to take, but wish the nausea would go away completely so that we can enjoy our 18 month old more!

HIV	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	10/27/2010 2:59:20 PM	I have been taking this medication for about two years. The only problem I seem to be having currently is neurological. I cannot walk and have been on the wheelchair for about one and a half years. I am not attributung  my lack of mobility to Atripla but the doctors haven't been able to attribute to anything either. I am wondering if anybody has ever faced a similar situation and I would welcome your experience.
HIV	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	10/22/2010 2:43:56 PM	I have been taking Atripla for almost four years and have found it to be very effective . My cd4 counts fluctuate, yet my viral load has stayed right at 48, so I know the medication is working. I also like that I only have to take one pill versus several. The cost is pricey, I have been fortunate in getting help with that, otherwise I could not afford it. I'm grateful basically to still be here and still fairly well.
HIV	HIV nATL, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	10/21/2010 6:27:13 PM	First off, thank you to all who previously submitted reviews as this is helpful information in terms of what to expect beginning a new drug regimen.  When I first began taking Atripla, it was a trip!  I was dizzy and downright disoriented, couldnt sleep and just in general felt out of control.  These are not good feelings to have especially during the day so I recommend taking it at night just before bedtime as prescribed.  I had (and still do) weird dreams too.  I find that taking &#189; an Ambien helps me sleep well but not too late, say after 9pm.  Ive got a slow metabolism and it takes about 2 hours for everything to kick in.  Now onto the good stuff, Atripla is on the other hand awesome!  Not so much or at all at first but I just got my results from using it a little over a month and I must admit I am astonished by the effects.  My viral load has decreased from approximately 13,000 to 50!  There has been a 6% increase in my CD4 count.  All this from one pill once a day within 30 days is simply unheard of; I am grateful for the results.  I encourage anyone whos considering trying this medicine to do so; the benefits far out weight the side effects, which subside over time.  Lastly, I am happy to report that either Im getting used to the side effects previously mentioned or they are beginning to subside and arent the issues they once were.  Thank God for this medicine.  Thank Bristol-Myers Squibb/Gilead for this medicine.  Hope this helps.

The side affects were weird but i got use to them and they eventually went away.(hot flash after medicine took affect, very dizzy when waking up until mid am. a bit of discomfort with loose stools.  But the sd effects began to level out over a period of a month or two.  I still had a little stomach irritation and more gas feelings but over the counter anti-acid helped that.  My body got use to the meds and I found taking it at night at a descent hr with a small meal was helpful.  Then I lost my job couldnt afford the meds and stop taking them for almost 2yrs straight.  my numbers were out of control but i felt fine.  got back on it have been on it for like 6 months and im back in the undetectable status and my viral load is exactly where it is suppose to be and getting better every month.  I feel great.  the only side affect im dealing with now is some itching that just strated and a little rash on my back and arms but nothing serious.  Im sure it will go away with time as it did before.  I love the drug. It has done wonders for me and I actually sleep well on it. Dream a lot but I always did.  I just pray before i go to sleep for God to protect my dreams from being bad.  other than that my life is normal and my sex drive never has changed it is still high and never had issues as far as that is concerned and taking this med.  I think the med is awesome.!!!

The next day I felt as usual and drove my car to solve errands. Jesus I was dizzy, nauseated, and high for the next 4 days. And yes you read right. I love sugar, and every time I would drink or eat something with sugar on it I would get so dizzy I had to lie down. By the second week I took it on a full stomach and the symptoms appeared to lessen to tolerable levels. Now that I am not dizzy during the day anymore, I have a bit of trouble sleeping. Every single sound awakes me and feel very weak. I have never taken any meds and this is my first pill. My viral load is 11,000 and cd4 is 760. I feel like I am in another body.. cant work out anymore. Sex drive went out the window. I am glad the dizziness went away now I have to figure out how to feel the way I did before taking this pill. I never dream, and havent had any dreams whatsoever while on this pill. It makes me mad not to be in control of my body but cant complain... at least now I am able to eat and today I started running again!  The pharmacist told me that people who take this pill test positive for pot and that has me very concerned as I dont do drugs....
HIV	BamaTim, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/26/2010 7:29:59 PM	I was diagnosed 13 yrs. ago and have been on a hand full of meds. Started Atripla 2.5 yrs ago and numbers have stayed the same, GREAT! Recently have started having tingling/electrical impulses that radiate from head into torso. Sensations that make me think I have vertigo. Also take Paxil. Have you ever gone without your antidepressant meds for a couple days? that's what I feel like but haven't missed Paxil dosage. VERY STRANGE FEELING! Doc's don't seem to be allarmed when I tell them what I am feeling.
HIV	amosturf, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/14/2010 10:07:13 AM	Diagnose with full blown AIDS Sept. 08. walked into an ER with a CD4 of 12 and a viral load of 1.5 million (not a typo). Almost dead. Today, CD4 is 630 and VL is undetectable. Thank God for Atripla. It is a long process but I'm still alive. My only complaint is lack of energy and major depression.

HIV	deanchicago, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	7/30/2010 9:48:20 PM	When diagnosed my viral load was over 400,000 and my cd count had dropped to 34.  7 weeks later my cd count is up to 394.  There are some side affects, especially when starting Atripla but they tend to go away after a week or two.  Always take your meds.  Atripla has done amazing things for me.  I hope the same is true for you.

HIV	Jeff , 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	6/11/2010 2:36:01 AM	Got HIV when my t cells hit 350 and viral load was 200,000 atripla was prescribed. After 2 years to 2 1/2 over 1000 t cell count no viral load. It took a bit to get used to. I'm bi polar so i felt like I was in outer space many times and punch drunk especially with some food in my stomach. Give it 6 months it should work (hopefully) wonderfully for you. All the bugs go away.Remember remove stress from your life if you can. Good luck and health to all.

HIV	trigger85, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	6/3/2010 3:49:15 AM	I was diagnosed w/ HIV on April 13, 2010. My cd4 was 17 and vl at 137,000. I have been on Atripla for a week now. This medicine is doing great so far. I feel so much better than I did a couple of weeks ago. The only side effects I had was dizziness the first couple of days but that is gone. I am still having issues with sleeping but I have always been a late owl so I dont know if its the drug or not. My dreams have always been weird so I dont think I can blame Atripla. I'm a little worried since my side effects are hardly there so i'm hoping its working. I've been thinking that i should be having a lot of problems for it to work but i'm not. And I am feeling better. I will have more blood work done on June 14th. hopefully in July, I will start seeing good results. This is all new to me but I am hopeful. I havent told anyone about my diaginoses bc i'm scared. but i hope it will all work out. 
HIV	HHW10, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/27/2010 6:00:17 AM	Well I went to the doc for what i thought was Atripla rash. Turned out to be a mild case of Shingles. Itchy? Achey? yes. Is this bad news? No. I am experienceing no side effects from Atripla which I am so thankful for. The regimen is so easy and the original drunkeness is gone. I actually stayed up for hours after taking my bedtime dose watching Casablanca and felt wonderful. 
HIV	HHW10, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	5/23/2010 3:39:57 PM	I was recently diagnosed in the hospital with PCP. Just knew i was out of here, CD4-8 VL sky high. Started taking Atripla about two weeks later.  I have taken it at night on an empty stomache as required and i immediately go to sleep.  The dreams are vivid but pleasent so i don't mind. Its been 5 weeks now and i feel great health wise.  I also take astrgulus root, High potency liquid multi-vitamin and probiotics. My appetite came back after the first week of taking it and I have gained weight and still climbing. Unfortunately the 4th week of taking Atripla came with Hives on buttocks and one leg. Not to severe but very itchy. I have been using benadryl, Hydorcortizone and pure Aloe Vera plant that is helping. I see the doc tomorrow to take a look at the rash and get more blood work done. I feel fantastic besides the rash. I really like Atripla and hope the doc chooses to treat thru the rash and doesn't take me off.  I would much rather stay consistant and besides the rash is a side effect that goes away. I will post again will new blood work results.

I have a terrible time sleeping and I have dizzy spells until mid morning. It is hard on my stomach but I have ulcers too. I found that its better for me to have a very small helping of yogurt with the pill right at bed time.
HIV	txhollygolightly, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	3/13/2010 2:42:10 PM	This has brought my pill intake down from up to 5 pills a day down to one.  The only real side affect that is immediate, is the &quot;drunk&quot; felling I get 30-60 minutes after taking it, which is avoided by taking it before bedtime.  I have had to stop taking it after 6 months, and then again after a year, as one of the medicines, Sustiva, causes neurological side affects (dizziness &amp; tingling).  After a short respit off the med, I am able to start again, with what seems to be a longer period of tolerance each time.
HIV	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	3/1/2010 7:23:17 PM	I was hoping this med would be a good match for me.  The once-a-day regime was a big positive.  For the first couple days I was slightly disoriented but it was very managable by taking the pill before bed.  However, on the 11th day of treatment I developed a serious rash which required an emergency room visit.  My Dr. has removed me from the drug.
HIV	gedlondon, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4		35-44	2/19/2010 10:24:23 AM	I came onto this thread because I was concerned after taking this treatment for 18 months now, why I was still having on/off dizzy periods. I know now that I am not alone.I workout 6 times per week and aerobics 4 times per week and eat lots of small meals daily. Therefore it is difficult to take on an empty stomach and therefore I have the dizzy spells usually at night-I take my tablet after the gym.My Consultant told me that eating after taking this medication may improve absorption into the blood stream and now with an undetectable value &lt;20 (my hospital can measure below 40mm) from over 100k and a t cell that's climbing, given the overall lifestyle I am able to enjoy, I would say the benefits far outweigh the side effects.

VL undetectable within 8 weeks cd4 increased by 150%.  Before starting this med I felt great, but my #'s were lousy.  Now my #'s are great and I feel lousy.  The sideaffcts are itching a warm sensation all over my body, loose stools nausa, intergestion, VIVID dreams, fatigue. hopefully these will go away soon, If they dont what options do I have???  Start a new med tht will have side effects or no meds an die.

Pisses me off. Crazy dreams,drunk feeling,high,dizzy,major stomach discomfort.However-supposedly does amazing in lowering vload &amp; raising t-cells. I guess we can't have it all. We're lucky they have have something for us. We seem to 4get there are 80,000 names on the quilt.

I can't speak for everyone, but I have taken this for 2 years now, and the ONLY side effects I had was a headache, and that only lasted the first 2 weeks after starting treatment. My CD-4 count is almost 700 and my viral load is undetectable. I feel like my old self again. This may not be a cure, but it's the next best thing.

HIV	mjones8597, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	1	Male	35-44	12/24/2009 10:23:47 PM	I have had many problems over the last 6 months of taking this medication.  Drunk feeling in the beginning, which has gotten better, but still have the effect if I do not get a full 8 hours of sleep which is tough while taking this medication.I have now started to have very severe headaches, but on the few occasions where I have missed a dose, the next day I have no headaches and feel great.The drug always makes me feel tired and exhausted and still have allot of dizzy spells.  I am not sure the side effects are worth any benefit that I am getting from the drug.  Granted my VL is 000 and my cd4 has come up slightly, the quality of life sucks.
HIV	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	12/20/2009 3:45:04 AM	Before Starting Atripla, CD4-118, viral load several hundred thousand.  After 13 weeks, CD4-661, viral load undetectable.  Had common side effects for only about 3 days.  Take it as directed on an empty stomach and don't miss taking it.  I can't speak for others, but I certainly have no problem taking a single pill on an empty stomach on a daily basis that will keep me alive.  I workout daily as I always have (weight training and cardio for about 20 min to an hour).  In my experience, most people who have issues with effectiveness of the drug are recreational drug users or simply don't take it as directed.  This is your life - eat decent, exercise, try to get enough rest, and more than likely you'll do great with this drug.  Use drugs like meth, skip doses, or live a sloppy life in general and I can guarantee you'll have problems with your health and with Atripla or any other HIV medication.

Just a feeling of lightheadedness and some vivid dreams.  22 months after starting Atripla, I have no side effects, and the viral load results are amazing.  Hopefully, your body will adjust quite well to this med, as mine has.
HIV	Destiny, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/30/2009 4:08:24 AM	I'm a healthy single mom of 3rd grader and I was recently told by my doc. that it's time to start the meds. My vload is 6000 and cd4 is 333; diagnosed in 1999 and my body has handled and fought the disease well so far. Now, I have the med in my purse and really scared out of my mind of the side effects. I know the alternative in the long run, isn't pretty but who will take care of my boy if I can't drive him to school because of the side effects?? BTW, not a single soul knows around me. Help!!
HIV	niceguytmpl, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	25-34	11/27/2009 9:11:30 PM	i've been on atripla now for 2 months after switching from kaletra/truvada,i was not prepared for the side effects. About an hour after taking the first pill i felt like i had drank an entire bottle of vodka, my boyfriend had a good giggle watching me stumble and stagger about the house. the drunk feeling has gone away a little over the last 2 months on it but i still haven't been able to sleep well, actually, i haven't had a good nights sleep since starting. the dreams are amazing though, at least not having nightmares. if i can get over the dizziness and sleeplessness everything will be great. my cd4 count has gone up from 18 to 891 over the last year and my viral load has gone from 436000 to 52. yes this med works, but watch out for the side effects, if you are sensitive at all, you may want to consider something else.

Ambien puts me to sleep but I awaken in a state of panic, rapid heartbeat and fear. Sustiva, initially, did not cause problems, but I had these occasional reactions.  Atripla makes them almost a nightly occurence.

HIV	djboy09, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	25-34	10/14/2009 2:17:26 PM	I started taking Atripla in August of 2009. The side effects were severe. I could barely walk, or talk. Thinking was out of the question. The nightmares were so bad that I would wake up screaming, and not remember why. Now that is has been a couple months, the side effects of resided. The only one I notice are the dreams. I still wake myself up screaming, and cant remember why. I go get my blood work in a few weeks, then the first of November, I will see if it really is working, and what my cell count and viral load is. I was diagnosed in February 2009 and my partner also was diagnosed at that time. His cell count is still 900 where mine have dropped from 600 to 200 in a few months. Im hoping that everything will go the way I want it to go, and others have the same turnout while on this pill!
HIV	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	35-44	10/9/2009 2:11:50 PM	I've been taking Atripla for 3yrs since being diagnosed while hospitalized with PCP.  This medication quickly decreased my vL to undetectable and is helping build my CD4 count.  I always take it at bedtime, which is easy to do, but it's not always 2hrs after I eat.  At first, if I didn't go right to bed I would experience the &quot;drunken&quot; feeling that most people get, but that doesn't happen anymore.  I continue to have extremely vivid dreams which I have had the entire 3 years I've been on it.  But they're actually fun now, and i've been thinking of putting a notebook beside the bed to write them down... some would make great movies.  I do have stomach issues from time to time, but I already had IBS before HIV came along.  All in all I'm very impressed that this pill has brought me back to near perfect health.

Began Atripla in Feb. 2009 when VL was 33,000 &amp; CD4 was 284. 6 mos later, my VL at last labs was just 190, but CD4 is still only 303 (due to &quot;old&quot; immune system, according to my specialist).  Only Atripla side effect: some dizziness the first few days; none now.  Won't give Atripla a &quot;very effective&quot; rating until my CD4 numbers improve to normal level, if they ever do.
HIV	depressed53, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/3/2009 1:39:17 AM	I've just recently been diagnosed and devasted.  I noticed most reviews are by males.  Been taking this med about 3 weeks.  I take a sleeping pill with it.  I take it at 3 a.m. - as I know stomach is empty then.  I do feel &quot;high&quot; after taking it.  Vivid dreams but no nightmares - I can cope with that.  Only nauseous a couple of times.  My #'s started at VL 160,000 and CD4 200 Will test again in 2 weeks to see if any change.  My x has been diagnosed for more than 20 years and takes multiple pills daily.  I will recommend this to him.  I do sleep more - and take a nap during the day - I work nights so that's not all bad.  I will post again when I get my new #'s.  Good luck to all....

It is a year to date and the results are amazing. The only problem is that it is very expensive and I am worried if I should fail to get the necessary amount of money to get it

HIV	horsepilltaker, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/5/2009 3:49:23 PM	I have been living with HIV for @ 20 years.  When I first starting meds I took over 20 pills aday.  With this med I take it at night (1 pill)and it is easy to take.  I have had no side effects since being on this med now for over 3 years.  I am undectible and my viral load remains good.  I see the doctor now every 6 months since I am doing so well.  I truly am grateful to my care team and all of their research and desire to help all of us.  I will continue as scheduled with this med until either it stops working or I have to change due to long term side effects.   
HIV	jbee, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	35-44	6/29/2009 9:39:23 AM	I started taking atripla on Dec of 2007, first hiv medication taken.  Within a 6 month period i became undetectable, although my cd4 counts climbed rather slowly, from 40 to 450 in a year.  I take mine with meals, because i eat late and sleep afterwords, not sure if this is effecting my slowly cd4 counts from the prior readers.  But i will admit, i enjoy the dreams...Thank you for creating such a wonderful drug to maintain my hiv status..

HIV	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	5/30/2009 9:25:10 PM	Atripla has given me my life back!  I had a rapidly decreasing t-cell count and a rising viral load. After only 6 months on Atripla, my t-cells are now above 600 and my viral load is undetectable.  I have never felt better; my energy level is back, I don't get colds or coughs anymore, and I feel 100% better.  The side-effects were mild, and in my case they went away completely after about 2 weeks.  I take the pill as I am going to bed each night.

HIV	PozinVegas, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	5/17/2009 3:19:29 PM	I am the one who reads and never contributes so I hope this is helpful to someone.  I was diagnosed with a Tcell of 11 with a viral load of 1 1/2 million in Nov. 2008, now after being on Atripla at night and Dapsone in the morning my count on 5/2009 is Tcell 214, viral load undetectible.  Yes there are weird dreams but I direct my dreams as I go to sleep and usually get through the night without much problem.  Sleeping is an issue but I will say I drink lots of water and eat better so I have gained my weight back (6ft 171) This is a great hiv med and I wish everyone well.  We will get through this and I feel we can look forward to a cure in 5 years or less so hang in there.HIV positive in Las Vegas
HIV	spukie, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	5/6/2009 4:03:32 AM	It has been almost a month now since I have started taking the medication.  I do have the dreams and seem to get very hot shortly after taking it, I don't really get the drunk feeling anymore as long as I take the med on an empty stomach.  I am beggining to suffer with dry skin in the face, I am wondering if the medication is causing this.
HIV	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male	55-64	5/4/2009 11:49:42 PM	I have been on Atripla for almost 6 months.  The dreams subsided for awhile, but now are back along with a daily headache, tinnitus and fatigue.  I wake up at night and the tinnitus (ringing in your head) is almost unbearable. I am also experiencing fatigue that is caused because I no longer can get a good nights sleep.  I am also experiencing some other side effects such as sinus congestion. My VL was 19000 and now is non detectable and my CD4 was up to 500 (after starting at 335).  My Doctor agrees that it is time to get off this as my quality of life is now non-existent with the side effects.  I start next week on intelence and truvada.  Hopefully this will get me back to a functional level.

Sucked but at least I'll always remember the date I found out. Blood work in today with CD4 2, vl 309000.

Also bouyed by the results many received and looking forward to my next appt in a month.

HIV	 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	3			4/10/2009 11:23:18 AM	Been on Atripla for just over a month so numbers haven't come back yet.  However, am still experiencing vivid dreams and nausea/drunken feeling if taken with food.  Same experiences for my partner but he's dealing with insomnia.  Was on Sustiva/Truvada mix for a month prior to Atripla with similar side effects.
HIV	WIDan, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	4/9/2009 4:20:20 PM	This was the first medication I began taking and it was precautionary as my CD4 was already high.  My vl is undetectable and after 2 years my CD4 remains close to 1000. Initially, the only side effect were the sporadic vivid dreams (which were benign)but as I progressed with treatment they became more infrequent. My health is exceptional with no side effects. The ease of a single pill-per-day allows me to take it at night with my fluctuating work schedules before I go to bed. No problems sleeping or waking up.  Compared to other medications that friends have taken and the absolute horror stories of various cocktails and combinations, this is an exceptional medication. 
HIV	dtlam, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	35-44	3/26/2009 8:11:03 PM	Excellent HIV medication. I have been on ATRIPLA for 2 years now. my viral load is undetectable and my CD 4 count is 582. I dont have any vivid dreams or any side effects from taking this medication. I take my pill at bedtime.
HIV	todd0267, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	3/25/2009 12:06:21 PM	It has worked for me, but it seemed to take 4 months before it started lowering my viral load, which was and still is a concern to me.  I have had lots of scapular pain since I started taking the medication, but I am not sure if it is related.  I am very complient with taking my medication, the dreams have not been bad, but sometimes I have sleepless nights and this causes great tiredness fro the next couple of days.I would love to hear from a representative of the company to discuss this medication, and also tell my story to their sales representative.  
HIV	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	45-54	3/3/2009 12:01:38 PM	Using Atripla kept my virus level undetectable - HOWEVER, it is not worth the effect it has on your digestive system,  More importantly the effects on your mind.  I was told the strange dreams this caused would lessen (they don't).  Other drugs to combat the anziety and help sleep were added to lessen these awful side effects.  And then of course more drugs to lessen the next set of side effects.  My opinion is this drug has too many risks to be of benefit.  I am feeling much better after slowly stopping this treatment.
HIV	Polar Bear1, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	2/26/2009 9:14:42 AM	I think it is a very good thing for people to take,, it works woundered for me
HIV	mrfitandhealthy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	2/15/2009 1:32:12 AM	I have been on this drug for a good two years now - my viral load is undetectable and my CD4 count is 2180. The onlt side effect i get is nausea in the morning after taking it at night - i no longer get warm from the medication and the weird dreams have gone. I also take other medications for cholesterol and high blood pressure with no adverse side effects. This the is best meedication i have taken for my condition and have never had none of teh other sied effects listed. I could not be happier.

HIV	TERRY D., 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	45-54	12/6/2008 1:31:11 AM	I HAVE BEEN POZ SINCE 1981, THIS NEW DRUG IS MY THIRD ROUND OF COCKTAILS. I AM VERY HOPEFUL AT THE PRESENT TIME... CAN NOT TELL YOU ANY NUMBERS YET. HOWEVER, IT MUST BE DOING SOME TO MY BODY BECAUSE I AM FEELING A CHAGE IN MY BODY.. ie.. LOSING SLEEP, ANGRY OUT-BURSTS, LOSE OF WEIGH, DRY SKIN AND SO LOCALIZED BODY ACHES.. I TOO TAKE IT AT BED-TIME AND MAY CONSIDER CHANGING THE TIME BECAUSE OF THE VERY BAD LOSE OF SLEEP. i AM ALSO ENCOURAGED BY ALL OF THE OTHER REVIEWS THAT I HAVE READ AND PLAN TO RIDE THIS TREATMENT OUT. REMEMBER, I AM AN OLD HAND IN TAKING MEDICATIONS....  THIS ONE PILL I TAKE IS A LOT BETTER THAN TAKING THE 30+ PILLS I USE TO TAKE ON A DAILY BASIS. I WILL HAVE BLOODS TAKEN LATE FEB. AND WILL ADVISEYOU ON MY PROGRESS..  BE WELL ALL......   TERRY D.

HIV	tdw, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	11/15/2008 12:31:50 AM	The first couple of days I felt a little dizzy at work, but went away quickly.  I did experience strange dreams. (when I WAS able to sleep) The biggest side effect for me was the sleeplessness.  At first I was taking the medication right before bed.  I would lay and toss &amp; turn all night long.  I believe the lack of sleep caused the other listed  side effects such as irritability, angry behavior, drowsiness, trouble concentrating, etc.  After the first week of horrible sleep, I started taking the medication in the mornings.  I no longer have the strange dreams, and I'm sleeping like normal.   
HIV	Alan, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	11/12/2008 5:47:18 PM	I have seen my viral load drop to being undetectable, and my CD4 is continuing to climb. Only comment would be to ensure it isn't taken with a fatty meal, this has lead to some 'dizziness', otherwise I have had no side effects.
HIV	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	10/26/2008 3:01:11 AM	I have been on this medication for 18 months I had a very low count to start and my Doctor put me on Atripla as a prcaution.

HIV	crookedmouth, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	19-24	9/27/2008 3:54:20 AM	Been taking it for about 6 weeks now, i experianced several side effects, the first night i took it i couldnt leave the house until 3pm the next day cause i felt too drunk to drive, but after that the drunken feeling was only there right after taking it, and early in the morning.  I also experianced some depression for a couple weeks.  Very vivid dreams made my sleep quite restless and found it hard to wake up in the morning for work.  But after the first initial three weeks most of these side effects have disappeared, i still get an occasional weird dream (but i have always had weird dreams.  Oh yeah, it makes you feel gassy for a while too.  As far as my numbers CD4 count and viral load, i havnt found out how they are yet, although just 3 months after my ex started taking it he was undetectable.

After six months, there was a dramatic change. Now, I'm undetectable. No side effects and I also gained my weight back.
HIV	 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		4/19/2008 7:27:46 PM	I was a study participant, this is my second review, forgot to tell you I take the pill at 5:00 in the afternoon after work on empty stomach  but I drink a gatorade with it, sugars in the Gatorade act as buffer, then I get my workout at 24 hour fitness for 2 hours, then I am starving and I eat dinner. This way no diziness or nausea. I don't like taking pill at bedtime because then the pill does not metabolize and I wake up dizzy and dizzy all day.  Take the pill at a time of high metabolism on dead empty stomach with a gatorade or juice, then do not eat for at least 2 hours and I recommend exercising because it speeds up metabolism of the pill and takes your mind off of it especially in the health club around other people. Important to stay socially connected stay in normal routines as long as normal routine does not involve being a hound. No sex except with devoted partners who know and then always use comdom even if undetectable don't risk your partner. By the way, if mwe live right and give our bodies the tools to fight, I believe we can outlive the virus. If a virus can't reproduce, it cannot survive. The HIV has learned to hide a few copies that live on but I believe our bodies will learn to kill the remainig copies eventually.  Keep on giving your body the tools it needs to fight, this damn virus will die.Peace

HIV	dani_boi, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	4/2/2008 4:13:03 PM	The first few weeks were a little difficult with the constant nauseous feeling.  However, that slowly dissipated.  I started on Atripla in October and it is now April and I'm undetectable and my CD4 count is over 800.  This medication definitely works for me.

The main ones were not sleeping (or having strange dreams if I did sleep), migraine like headaches, and a constant 'drunk' or 'high' feeling.   (Ok, so maybe I can't complain too much about that last one!)   My doctor prescribed Elavil for the headaches and sleeping problems and it has been smooth sailing ever since although I do still get the feeling of being 'drunk', after 6 months it almost all but disappeared.   Viral Load remains undetectable but my T-Cells (CD4) has not improved as much as my doctor had hoped.  (Minor initial increase followed by stability and small drop.) Overall, this is probably the best regiment available since it is so easy to take and pretty much ALL the alternatives have major side effects and disadvantages.

HIV	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	35-44	3/18/2008 1:35:57 PM	First med for hiv.  Strange dreams but other than that good results
HIV	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	3/12/2008 1:44:54 AM	I like that it does not need to be refrigerated and is three drugs in one...therefore, one pill not several.
HIV	tanqueray, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	3/6/2008 12:29:33 PM	This is my first treatment for HIV since i was diagnosed 3 years ago and I have only been on it for about a month and I cant complain one bit. The only thing I have experinced is constant dream at night, not nightmares, but its basically like I am watching TV in my sleep because I have so many of them. They have gotten better and I think it was just a side effect that was takin place in the beginning. All in all, I would recommend this drug over some of the others which seem to have lots more side effects that last long term in addition to having to take more of them. Its worth the money.

HIV	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	1/8/2008 8:54:49 PM	My first HIV drug, I do not notice any side effects.  CD4/Viral perfect scores.  Not that large as people say.  Same size as a large vitamin. 3 Pills in one.

Yes I had a relapse and it effected me greatly.  After returning to my doctor for care he put me on Atripla.  I've been on it since April of this year 2007. I take it before I go to bed. I had trouble swallowing that horse pill so I began to just crush it and take it like BC powder on my tongue with some water or juice to wash it down.  At first I felt very high in the mornings and somewhat of balance.  But I gave my body a chance to adjust and from my last test this month December 2007 the virus is undetectable even with the most sensitive test being done.  So in short I am very pleased with the results and I don't experience anymore noticeable side effects.

HIV	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	11/14/2007 6:28:53 PM	I started this HIV drug on October 10th and am currently on my second refill and finding that my attitude has completely changed for the better.  My partner has seen the difference daily in my mood, and states that this has been a good thing.  My only problem has been with my stomach.  I have felt very nausiated since taking it, and have started take phenagren about an hour before taking the Atripla.  My doctor wants to ween me off of the Phenagren so I do not become dependant on it, but I am afraid of not taking due to the sever vomiting I have experienced.  Any suggestions?  They would be greatly appreciated and helpful.  Thanks ScottScottieEbright@aol.com
HIV	ckboxers1, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/29/2007 10:35:40 AM	I started this medication about 4 weeks ago (the first time ever taking HIV drugs).  The side effects were mild, and overall, not as bad as I thought.  I am starting to feel much better.
HIV	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	10/26/2007 12:11:03 AM	I am satisfied using Atripla. As i have been taking it for over a year now. The only thing negative is its a huge horse pill but as long as it is keeping me undetectable I am satisfied.
HIV	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	10/25/2007 9:08:05 PM	Very easy to use as it is only one pill a day.  This is my first use of HIV drugs, and it is doing wonders.
HIV	debralk, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/25/2007 8:14:44 PM	I am much happier taking the one pill a day and seem to have less side effects than I did when I was taking Combivir and Sustiva.It did give me odd dreams but I was used to that from the Sustiva.I still have some stomach problems in the morning, but I can't be sure if that is a result of the Atripla or other medication I take for cholesterol.All in all this is much better and easier to manage taking one pill a day.

HIV	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	9/18/2007 11:14:10 AM	I have not had any side effects with this medication and is very easy to stay on the treatment plan because it is one pill to take as opposed to multiple pills.
