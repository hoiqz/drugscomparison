My Dr. recommended this treatment, and since my hot flashes have almost completely diminished and my headaches that I have had for years has been life changing, so far this has been an effective treatment and my mood swings have improved as well..

&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs	terri, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	12/1/2008 1:08:00 PM	I have been using elestrin for 2 weeks.  I was given permission by my np to use up to 3 doses a day as my fsh was very high, and she said I had practically no estrogen in my body at all.  My symptoms included hot flashes, vaginal pain and dryness, anxiety, mood swings, etc.  The hot flashes have been minimized, and I was able to have intercourse with my husband without pain for the first time in months.  I am not sure how many of the other symptoms could be expected to lessen with estrogen treatment, but the anxiety has been much more mild also, along with the mood swings.  I do not feel well yet, and maybe I am expecting too much.  My np said the next step would be an antidepressant along with the estrogen.  I tried prozac and the side effects were horrendous (I did become suicidal, it was so bad) so I am very reluctant to try another SSRI.  I spend a lot of time praying for guidance and healing as I don't think I want to take any more medications if I can possibly help it.  I have had nausea problems and weight loss but I think that happened as consequence of the prozac not the elestrin.  I think I am suffering some amount of depression from some pretty severe stress in our family so I don't know how much I can expect to be relieved.
