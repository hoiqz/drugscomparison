Constipation Predominant Irritable Colon	naturelover, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	2/23/2012 11:39:05 AM	This is the only medication that helped me.  It was a miracle.  I'm now so miserable and it's always in my mind that I cannot have a bowel movement.  My doctor prescribed amitiza which is inordinately expensive and it does not work.  Between taking amitiza, various laxatives (miralax does not work), suppositories, enemas, etc. I'm still miserable.  I don't have heart problems and I can't see why I should suffer for people who have a heart problem.  I'm going to try to get zelnorm again overseas.

I'd sign any waiver they want me to just to feel the relief Zelnorm gave me from my IBS-C.  For 3 glorious years, constipation, bloating, tenderness, pressure, and pain were non-existent.  For the first time in 30 years, it became a non-issue, totally symptom free.  I lost 30 pounds, I could zip with no pain, no gas, no pressure; hemorrhoids, nausea, sluggishness - went away - gone AND I could enjoy sex again with no discomfort -the quality of my life increased 100%.  There's nothing out there that I haven't tried; Amitiza, herbal teas, high-higher fiber foods, fiber additives to drinks, drinking enough water to drowned myself, and participated in 2 drug trials for IBS-C - nothing has offered any relief.I WANT MY ZELNORM!!

This is the only drug that ever kept me free of obstruction, pain, and hospitalization.  I was told 4 years ago that it had been taken off the market and I have had another severe attack again, severe pain, distention , projectile vomiting.

I never once thoguht I was ever constipated, and thought the bms were normal and regular... I never thoht I had a reason to think otherwise. I never had a problem with this drug. It helped me lose weight, it gave me amazing relief.

It actually made mine almost stop bothering me. I now only take it if/when I have a flare up of the condition. The FDA made a grevious mistake making this unavailable. This is the only medicine I would recommend for IBS suffering.

My day depended on my boSwels. This is no way to live. My Dr. told me about Zelnorm when it first came out and i started to use it.  Had no medical problems taking it.  Then they went and took it off the market. So now I am back to living my life around my bowels.  I tried talking my Dr. to giving it to me, but He said that it is not indicated in women over 50.  If they put back on the market I will be the first one in line to get it.  No more severe cramps and constant bowel movement......

It changed my life.  I would go weeks without going to the bathroom and as soon as I took this medicine, it worked.  I even lost 25lbs in 2 months, just from the medicine.  Birth Control has serious side effects and I am fine with that.  Why can't they plop the side effects on the label and if you are alright with it, then take it.  Just because someone has a heart attack or a stroke while taking this medicine should not be a reason for us all to suffer.  Heart attacks can be caused by a number of reasons.  I wish they would bring it back.

I am only 31 years old and I have have had EXTREMELY bad abdominal pain for years. I rarely have a bowel movement (maybe 2X a month) and Zelnorm wasthe only thing that made me feel like a normal person again. I NEVER had ABY side affects with Zelnorm and now I it is unavailable for me to get. I have lived with this HORRIBLE condition for too long now. I just want something that is going to make me able to live a normal life, like Zelnorm did!

Before Zelnorm I had to tale a laxative 2 times a week or get violently sick and throw up for as long as 36 hours.  I took the first pill as I left the doctor.  Only 1 hour later 100% of the solids in my body were expelled.  1 1/4 hours 100% of the fluid, about a quart, on my stomach was expelled.  I took it until it was removed and even until today the fluids do not bother me but the constipation has returned!Please do something to bring something back!

I absolutely believe the reason for the FDA taking this drug off the market is for political and monetary reasons.  BRING ZELNORM BACK!!!  I have suffered with IBS-C for 13 years and this drug is the only thing that truly and consistantly worked for me.  I've been off it for 2 years and my IBS-C has worsened considerably in that time.  I told my doctor that I could get the generic form from overseas and he told me to do it and see if it works.  I've just received my first order, so here's hoping it works!

The FDA did a very poor job pulling it off the market while introducing other deadly psych drugs in the hands of the consumers. I believe there are some financial and lobbyist's reasons behind it other than  real concerns for patients' well being. I still get it from overseas, or I wouldn't be still alive. Bring Zelnorm back!!!

My symptoms of constiptation, cramping, finally being able to go, but with a lot of pain, decreased markedly when on Zelnorm.  Now that it is not available I suffer daily. Fix it and bring it back, please!

When I finally took a laxitive, I lost 2 inches from my waist and 4 pounds over night. Zelnorm was the first medication I could take without the irritation of laxatives that actually worked.   Please FDA, reconsider your decision to stop providing this vital resource to Americans.  Many other countries still sell this medication, and I don't want to move to Canada or Europe to have good health.

I tried everything my doctor prescribed, but it seemed that the more medication I took the worse my symptoms got. In the end I was never  without pain.I woke up with pain and I went to bed with pain. At that stage I have also developed depression as a result of my constant pain. Then my doctor prescribed Zelnorm. To me it was like a miracle. It changed my life completely and I couldn't believe how fantastic it worked. Ever since it was taken off the market my suffering has started all over again. I have now been in agony and pain for about the last 2 years. PLEASE, is there no way that this medication can come back onto the market and that it can then be prescribed under controlled doctor's supervision??

The only thing that worked was Zelnorm.  I was so dissapointed when thry took it off the market. The risks of not being able to have a bowel movment for over a week are so far above the risks of taking Zelnorm.  I feel that decision should be betwwn me and my Doctor.  I beg the FDA to reconsider this decision!!!

Amatezia has been Rx'd for me since but w/o the same if any effeectiveness. OTC lacxatives dhaven't helped either.

This is the only drug (and I've tried a couple) that worked miracles.  I suffered from IBS for about 15 years and this is the only drug that ever helped my health improve.  It was like night and day when I was taking it.  I would love to see another similar drug out on the market.  Sometimes I feel like I'm six months pregant (and I'm 51).

Long story short -after 3 months of starving/tests it was my gallbladder, had surgery. I believe it was onset by Zelnorm. Small print says &quot;do not take if you have gallbladder disease&quot;. I never had a problem before.

Since they took it of the market, I've had nothing but problems. I've been on maximum dosage 2x daily of the replacement drug Amitiza which has severe side effect.. Nausea, Bloating, Bowel obstructions, chest pain, hedaches, extreme pain and cramping.. I've been hospitalized with obstructions several times and the only pain relief was IV Morphine. Bring Zelnorm back!!!!
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/7/2008 4:53:59 PM	I have taken this for extreme bloating after eating. Doesn't matter if I eat mashed potatoes or salad; same bloating. I looked and felt like I was nine months pregnant. It worked in 15 minutes! Now it is off the market. Anything else that is indicated for IBS has terrible side effects like anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts. Bring back Zelnorm. Just because it didn't work for men doesn't mean it didn't work for women!

I feel very ill and irritated and feel even worst when I take laxatives or eat an increased amount of fiber because my colon is so swollen that nothing can pass until I take the zelnorm.  The pain and swelling completely go away and I am able to have a bowel movement.  The only problem is that I cannot get any licensed physician to prescribe it to me.  I only get nexium which does not help with any of my symptoms.  I am currently getting the zelnorm in Mexico.  Thank God!

This product really worked. However, the FDA has taken it off the market and now I'm not able to purchase it. I wish there was a substitute or perhaps they will bring it back. Again, I have to say this product worked and I'm not one who takes medication. As a matter of fact, Zelnorm was the first and only product I ever took for IBS.
