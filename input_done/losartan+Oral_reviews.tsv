I don't know if I could blame water retention or tossing and turning to either drug, but possibly that or just aging.

My doctor changed me from lisinipril becasue of the dry cough, but it was keeping the swelling/BP down. From day 1, this medicine started giving me headaches which increased every day for approx 5 days. I stopped it for about a week then tried it again. I also noticed that I got a rash on my stomach and this week, my feet swelled so bad they didn't look like feet anymore. I'm not taking this again and will try to see the doctor this week.

High Blood Pressure	02Corazon, 65-74 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1		65-74	6/17/2012 5:07:00 PM	I began to feel lightheaded after starting this drug and almost fell in the bathtub shower.  Then I began to get increasing muscle pains in my legs and back to the point where I had to roll out of bed and the spasms prevented me from standing upright or moving. I used acetominaphen and capsaicin to relax the muscle pain. I have been off it for 5 days but and still feeling unwell. I woke up feeling nauseated this morning and still have limited muscle pain, light headedness.  I will not continue with this drug. My s-in-law tells me my brother has lowered  blood pressure using nicotine patches, presumably prescribed by his doctor.  I am asking more about this. Has anyone heard of that?  I don't know if it was used for cessation of smoking or if it was prescribed for high BP. I have asked her to elaborate.
High Blood Pressure	Nita, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	55-64	6/13/2012 1:04:24 PM	I started taking Losartan 50 mg about 1 month ago.  After 2 weeks, my blood pressure was still a little high so my doctor increased me to 100 mg.  I am considered obese and over age 60.  I started noticing considerable shortness of breath and very low engery.  Walking to the bathroom or kitchen from my bedroom was an issue.  I am afraid to stop taking it without doctor's consent.  But I feel it did not work for me.  My energy level and shortness of breath was so low I ended up in the hospital for 3 nights.  The hospital did not find anything significant and I was tested thoroughly.  The attending doctor did not want to change my medication.  So, I still have the same symptoms.  Thankfully, I have a doctor's appointment on 6/14/2012.  I will be requesting another drug if needed.

High Blood Pressure	JOHN, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	65-74	5/5/2012 8:13:07 AM	Took Diovan 320mg; switched to Losartin 100mg.Finding it weak and ineffective.  BP rising to 140/90 from 115/60 on Diovan.  Unfortunately generic Diovan is not going to be available probably next February 2013.I think I may have to pay the cost, unless my doctor allows a higher dosage or an alternative medication.  If you are on medicare you cannot use new DIOVAN coupons.  If you are NOT, however, you can get it inexepensively.  Check-out the Novartis website.

Swelling of my abdomen, ankles, etc.  I have trouble breathing at night though I'm not sure this pill has anything to do with it. When taking the brand name Cozaar only side effect I had was some leg or foot cramping from time to time.  This Lorsatan is the worst.  Can't afford the brand name.  Will discuss this with my doctor.

I went to my internist who referred me to an ENT doctor.  They both kept giving my an inhaler, which didn't cure the cough.  I had to tell the internist I was stopping the medication and he insisted it was not the medication.  As soon as I stopped and the medicine got out of my system (about 2/3 days), I was feeling great.  I don't recommend Losartan to anyone.

Due to the cost of Cozaar my Doctor thought I should try it again, I did for 2 weeks.  I will never do that again, back on Cozaar.  The Losartan Potassium has once again given me fits Rapid Heart beat in the middle of the night, Congested, Headaches and too many other side effects to mention. I will never take that pill again.  It is not the same as the brand name Cozaar and the higher price is something I will have to pay.  Will discuss appealing this with my Doctor.

I have hardly had a sick day in my life and 18 hours after the first dose I was at quick care getting an EKG; I honestly thought that I was going to die. Last night just as miserable, could not sleep, very dry mouth, pain in back. Sometimes it feels like someone has pushed a finger into my chest and is circling my heart while at the same time twisting my stomach. If this is what it takes to be &quot;healthy&quot;...I think I'll pass.

Have been on Losartan for 4 months &amp; legs, arms &amp; back ache all the time. Dr. now gave me Avapro to try.

I've been on 5 different meds in 6 years. I don't have health insurance. Two days ago I fell asleep at the wheel while at a stop light. I've had it with the side effects of these drugs. This is the last straw. I am off these meds for good. I will let nature takes it's course.

I eat fresh ginger root (found in the produce section of your grocery store)and it seems to help.  I have a follow-up appointment in 3 weeks with my doctor to see if my blood pressure is going down and will post the results.

Hope this one works , so far the cough is gone YAY but the cost of this drug is high , I pay $80.00 a month and this is the generic . The only drug I found in the cheaper drugs is the Ace inhibitors which made me cough and lose sleep , I had to keep water by the bed to help my throat so I was up all night trying to quiet a cough . Hope this one is better .

Now I need the oxygen when ever I move around.You can bet I'm off Losartan as of today.  I'm just sorry I didn'tt check here first.

My doctor recommanded losartan, I have had my BP going up and down like a roller coaster. When my BP drops low I can't keep my eyes opened, the other day I slept for 18 hours. Having some joint and muscle aches. I am going back to my doctor and insist that he work with the insurance to get me back on Avapro.

Before I was on Amlodipine and Lisinopril which had burtal side-effect. Lasartan appears to works ok but still to soon to tell. My BP is still slightly elavated SYS(mmHg) rangs 119-150/ Dia(mmHg)85-95+ 
High Blood Pressure	KA, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	6/7/2011 9:56:06 PM	Started on Metoprolol to lower pressure to prepare for a surgery. Started at 180/111. Metoprolol really did job to lower BP quickly. Lisinopril added and Metoprolol was phased out after about a month of taking both. Lisinopril worked great(112 to 122/65 to 75) but cough forced me to stop taking it. Cough seemed to start about the time the Metoprolol was stopped  Losartin seems to work well. I do have the dry skin itch that others mention that I am noticing more recently(seems to be the only side effect I have noticed. Lisinopril seemed to lower pressure better but it might be that I have gotten to level I'm going to be at. (118 to 129/71 to 80) Still working on diet some(sometimes still too much salt)and losing some weight.(lost 25 pounds after surgery and have put about 15 of it back on. Losartin seems to keep me in pretty good control.  I will discuss the itch on next trip to Doctor.

High Blood Pressure	Orange, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		4/25/2011 9:19:23 PM	I was taking Cozaar for over 10 years to treat my blood pressure.  The drug was very effective.  My blood pressure was normal and I felt great.  Then the Pharmacies in my area said Cozaar was no longer available and I was pressured to take the generic Losartin.  After 3 weeks my lips swelled and felt tingling.  I had severe pain and swelling in my neck, back and legs.  I got red swollen welts on my legs.  My skin became dry.  I retained water and was dry inside. I was constipated and began to bleed when urinating. I want to be able to go back to the brand name Cozaar.  Losartin is not for everyone!

After taking it for 12 days and feeling funny thought I should take my blood pressure. The systolic had jumped from the 130's to 192.  Monitored for a while and contacted my doctor. He had me come in and the pressure was only at 180 when they checked. He gave me some Diovan (samples) and a new prescription.  Within a couple of hours my pressure started dropping.  This was terrible for me.  Would not recommend it just to save money.

High Blood Pressure	net47, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	3/25/2011 8:48:48 PM	 I am taking losartan potassium 25mg after dinner or around 7or8pm. I have tried many high blood pressure meds and so far this one works pretty good. I had the iching and the rash but that went away after the fist month on it. .Its been 3 months now on this med. I am dizzy in my head though. Its every 20 seconds or so and it hard to deal with. I have it all the time and even in bed if I wake up in the middle of the night. I really do not like this but with all the other blood pressure meds the side effects were way worse. I guess you have to take the good with the bad cause there is no one pill that doenst have side effects. I have headaches but that is a side effect too. So I guess every ones body is different and you will just have to decide which side effects you can deal with and which ones you cant. I am staying on this losartan potassium because the side effects are alot less then many I have tried. Hopefully my review will help some people.

Was on for 5 days and lethargic, dizzy, sick to my stomach, gassey. Also had bad pains on right side of back. I felt like I had a very bad  bladder infection. I never had such a adverse reaction to a drug like this one. Went off the 6th day and took 3 days to feel a little better. Was on Diovan and Dr. changed to Losartan . Thought it would be less expensive for me, Although I have coverge for Diovan. He figured he was saving me $$ ..back on Diovan and no problems so far. This drug is very scary. I do not recommend it at all. Hope this review helps .

Most seem minor so I suppose it's worth it as I've foind no other generic blood pressure med available. I am diabled (not due to high BP)and live on a fixed SSDI income with BCBS in place of straight medicare. Great thing about BCBS is they will cover most generics thru the gap.

High Blood Pressure	Alvaro, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	55-64	1/19/2011 8:34:58 PM	I have been happy with the results, both numbers are lower.  However, I have muscle and back pain and a few skin itches in the neck.  Bottom line, although it works for me, I am going to make a big effort and loose weight (20 pounds) to stop taking blood pressure medicine. It seems all of them have side effects (I hated the cough from Lisonipril)

I have terrible itching every day on the neck and upper chest and my face gets flushed and hot. I also take several other meds including psych meds. How the heck am I supposed to know which causes what? How do you know????

I recently started and noticed that I now have hives, lightheadedness, pain in back, muscles, blurred vision, irregular heartbeat, stomach pain.There are other symtoms.  Wow..what kind of drug is this? I understand everyone responds differently, but wow. Made the mistake of researching this after I just had taken a pill. Will call my MD on Monday.

She was first on Captopril and Enalapril which tasted better but caused breast buds to form which is a side effect for most blood pressure meds. For the most part Losartan works well.  Tastes horrible when it is compounded for a child. Works well overall. Noticed a dry hacking cough which is new for my child. Will get a second opinion. Not many small children are on this medication yet. Will keep posting.

I guess its used to protect my kidneys and lower bp. Face gets a little flush but I seem to have energy .. until about 9:00pm .. then I usually go to bed. Thanks to BCBS .. Losartan Potassium 50 mg has made a world of difference. Now I just need to figure out what I can and cannot eat. I wish there was a support group around here.

High Blood Pressure	doodle, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	11/7/2010 9:20:42 AM	I was on the generic form of Cozaaar, Losartan, for 3 1/2 months.  The side effects I suffered included blurry vision, decreased sensitivity (fingertips most notably), dry skin, hair loss, water retention (which led to increased blood pressure), tinnitus, muscular pain and a metallic taste in my mouth.  My doctor did not know why my blood pressure was up, nor why I was retaining water, and prescribed a diuretic to go with the Losartan (Cozaar).  The metallic taste in my mouth led me to search the internet at length, and I finally came across a list of reported side effects that sounded like mine.  The day I stopped taking Losartan, my back/ neck pain went away completely.  I had been in excruciating neck pain for about a month.  I had no idea it was related to my medication.  Now, one week later, the metallic taste is gone, and my vision is getting clearer each day.  My sense of touch is improving, and I no longer retain water.  My blood pressure is so much better. I no longer need the &quot;reading glasses&quot; I had been using for the past 2 months. I went back to Benicar, and I will never use Losartan (Cozaar) again as long as I live on this earth. I believe I was headed towards the rare but deadly side effect of &quot;a condition that results in the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue, leading to kidney failure.&quot;  I am so thankful for the information I found online, which is why I am posting this.  I think the internet saved my life.

I am 45 and healty with exception of HBP so maybe I need to take a chill pill...so to speak.

High Blood Pressure	ryespot53, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	65-74	9/6/2010 12:00:24 AM	Have been taking Losartan for about 3 weeks and have had severe headaches and am extremely tired and b/p has not improved.  Have been monitoring at home and am still in the 164/90 range and will be calling my GP on Tuesday after the holiday to see what to do.  Was previously on amlodipine with hydrochlorthiazide and I have had severe itching (dr says it is heat related internal hives???) that occurs after showering and I had really bad hot flashes, but at least my b/p was normal when taking it.  the itching seems to have subsided some, but the jury is out on the hot flashes.  I am concerned because I am on 100mg and it does not seem to be helping my b/p at all.  Also have developed leg pain behind my right knee, but not sure if the two are related.  Hope to get answers from Dr soon.

He said the beta blocker messes with your brain in some people, me included, plus I was having terrible shoulder pain and hip pain thinking I needed work done on my shoulders as well as a hip replacement.  I'm thinking clearer with more zest for life and my shoulders don't hurt nearly like they did.  Is Losartan an Ace inhibitor or a beta blocker?  My wife takes Lisinopril HCTZ 20/25 and cough's a lot since starting on it.  Is Lisinopril a different class drug than Losartan?  I'd like her to suggest to her Doc to try Losartin if it's the same class, please advise.  Thanks Gene

For the past 30-60 days, I too have noticed an increasing, yet off and on pins and needles feeling in mostly my hands, arms and sometimes across my back, face and legs.  It is most intense in the evening.  Tonight, when I picked up my prescription, I asked the pharmacist to change me back to Cozaar to see if there are any changes.  Either way, I will be seeing the Doctor as this feeling is difficult to ignore/tolerate.

I thought it was just me with the itching but now I see I'm not the only one.  I take the pill about an hour before bed and it seems that the itching will start shortly after taking especially my feet and hands.  I don't have a cough with this medication which is good.  I also don't believe it's doing as good a job with my blood pressure that the Cozaar did.  I have been on this medication approximately one month and get to see my doctor tomorrow to express my concerns.

I have been taking Cozaar ( Losartan ) and I started to experience intense itching that felt like hives ( although you couldn't see any welts ) and I would get this in the evening.  I had a dime size rash on my arm.  I noticed only a few reviews mentioned the itching.  Has anyone else experienced this?  You can't directly answer my question on here but please do a review so that others will know that it could be a common effect from the medicine.  I also have achy muscles from it.  Going to hear from the doctor within an hour.  Will post again soon Ann7
