I do notice that the week before the infusion is due I am very well aware that the effectiveness has worn off. I have had a reduced dosage the last two infusions due to a slightly raised liver function test. I am hopeful of having a full dosage again next time.

She has needed a very large dose (30 mg/kg) to bring her systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis under control and thus far, while the Actemra is helping her systemic symptoms, her joints remain very affected by arthritis. She has had injections of cortisone into her joints twice in an attempt to help. The only thing that truly helps her arthritis is high-dose prednisolone, which is not something we can safely keep her on.  Her rheumatologist told me this past Wednesday (Aug 22, 2012) that there are some people who get relief of systemic symptoms but no real relief of arthritis while on Actemra. Unfortunately, my daughter falls into that category.  Her doctor &amp; I will be discussing long-term treatment options next week. I don't know if she will continue with Actemra or not.  Her arthritis is extremely debilitating ~ she does not use her hands at all, cannot walk and experiences pain every day.  Actemra has helped make it possible to get her off of prednisolone without having a major flare-up, but it is not actually helping with her arthritis (just the systemic symptoms).

Rheumatoid Arthritis	pick, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male	65-74	6/15/2012 12:32:22 AM	Been taking about one year, have no side effects other than if I get a cold it seems to take longer to rid, I believe it has helped quite a bit with mobility and swelling of joints. It does not seem to help me have any pain relief so I still take morphine for pain. I have found it works better with prednisone however other patients say it does relieve pain for them. It is a pain to have to go every month and get the injection but have tried all the other injectibles and this seems to work better so will continue until something better comes along. For those of you who have said no insurance, contact the maker they have a program to furnish free in most cases. I was getting it free until I got on medicare. Now it is 4800.00 a month, no wonder the government is broke. :)

I've been on 100-45 mgs. pred for 20 months while using methotrexate and Enbrel in an effort to use less pred. In the last 7 months I have relapsed every time I have tried to taper. GCA will kill me quick and prednisone will kill me slow. Already got diabetes, cataracts, glaucoma, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, fatty liver disease, ect. from it. Actemra has to work!

I had quite a bit of GI problems for the first couple days.  I also had a severe headache that lasted about 4 days.  I need feed back/replies on emotional outburst.  I have cried more than not since my infusion and need to know if anyone else has expeirenced this or if it is caused from something else.

But, the side effects are mounting and I feel as though I  may have to stop it. Have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, low blood count, low potassium, and my skin is so thin that it just peels off. Breaks my heart because RA is better.

Tried everything from prednisone to plaque nil to methotrexate. Participated in a clinical trial for this drug and by the end of year one I literally forgot I had RA. All morning stiffness disappeared, and on occasion minor aches appeared in my hands and a shoulder now and then. This drug Was amazing. I was extended on the drug and did a lasting 5 year study. Never had one side effect. All organs are fine. But sadly now, my trial ended in June 2011 and slowly I have started feeling pain again...I have no insurance so I'm not sure what to do now.

This month it wore off a week or two early.  I am going to go to the double dose 8mg/kg now.  No side effects at all and feel much better right away.  Hoping the increased dose will make it last the full four weeks.  Was on Remicade, then Orencia before, both of those wore off and quit working at all

Rheumatoid Arthritis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	45-54	5/3/2011 11:45:21 AM	I had been on Enbrel for years with great success but alas, it wore off and I was in terrible shape.  After a tremendous battle with my insurance, my doctor got me on Actemra.  First two doses - nothing.  Then he doubled my dose.  It began to show some signs of promise.  Now after five infusions at the higher dose I can say it really is working.  I had a huge nodule in my left wrist that is gone and swellings all over are down.  I could hardly get in and out of a chair my knees were so bad and now I'm doing yoga again.  My bicept tendinitis is greatly reduced, too.  My only complaint is a tremendous headache the day after infusion, but it's a small price to pay for 4 weeks of feeling almost normal.  I've reduced Prednisone and Methotrexate, too.  I noticed some hair loss at first but it is resolving now.  No cholesterol problems for me, no rashes, etc.  Just the headache and that goes away in a day or two.Other than that, having to take time away from work for the infusion is a PAIN.  I've read on the web that they're working on self inject Actemra and that would be awesome!

I have been on it for 8 months now and have felt the best i have in a long time. I am also on methotrexate injections, they seem to work really well together. I have tried so many medicines with no success so i am very excited about this. I can tell the week before i need a treatment, but my pain is tolerable. LOVE IT!
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Jenny, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	4/13/2011 4:26:08 AM	Hello,I have severe RA and was hospitalized for a month and could not walk at all and barely use my hands. My dr started me on 8mg/kg of Actemra. I have finished 5 infusions now. It was really after the 3rd infusion that I noticed a big difference.  But still I was not happy and wanted better so my Dr put me back on MTX, a drug that has not worked out for me in the past due to nausea, but this time injections.  And we increased the Actemra to 9mg/kg... yes i know outside the recmnd range.  I have had minimal side effects. Initially my cholestrol went up bit stabilized after the 3rd infusion.  I have soreness and headache for about a day but then i'm good. However I do feel I need it again a week b4 i'm due so my dr has decided to give it to me every 3.5 weeks instead of 4 weeks.  I no longer need any painkillers and can do most things quite comfortably.  I hope it will only get better from here. Please keep in mind like all drugs the body needs time to adjust and side effects and set backs are to be expected so don't be discouraged. A positive attitude will go along way.

Week after infusion, there is nausea, headache, extreme fatigue. Gastritis and excess acidity, lower GI pain, variable IBS symptoms are tough. Preceeded by Enbrel and Humira. I take mtrx subq weekly but no nsaids. Tough commitment. Sed rate has improved but quality of life still to be determined. I wish there was another choice.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	2/15/2011 9:11:28 PM	I was getting the drug as part of the clinical trial. 8mg dose. I felt really good for the first three months; energetic and pain free. After that, I started to struggle with fatigue and, six months later, I was not any better. It also gave me substantially higher Iron levels in my blood. I am a 40 y/o woman that had a hysterectomy one year prior to starting the drug. I ended up stopping the drug when my iron levels were approaching a toxic level, and my RA was not under reasonable control.

I have failed to see any major changes in my condition, however, the week before it's due I know it's due. That being said, it must be working to some degree.
