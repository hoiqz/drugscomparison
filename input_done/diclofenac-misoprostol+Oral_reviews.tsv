I asked my rhumatologist to increase the dose--he did but now that doesn't help either,  i am afraid of the long term use of this medication .  many days I hurt over my entire body and I am stiff ALL Day LONG.

My prescription is written for two a day, but I try to get by on one a day, if I can.  This medicine does not bother my stomach as others have, which I have tried.

Other	rosered, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	55-64	10/28/2009 8:56:30 PM	Don't be surprised if it causes bloody stools. I took it for about 3 weeks and then it happened and scared the daylights out of me! I did take it with food, but ended up going back to Celebrex. Had to take omneprazole for a week after the episode with the bleeding. It was effective for osteoarthritis pain, but no different from taking Celebrex, which is easier on your stomach. Never again for me.

I've had no problems w/side effects. After trying several other NSAIDS, this one has worked best for me. In fact, stopping it before surgeries nearly cripples me w/pain.
