My mother has told me that camphophenique can be used for a lot of things, so I thought why not? It is Heaven in a bottle! It stings like crazy at first, but once that is over no more pain and it dries up the sores! Fantastic stuff!

She would always keep Campho Phenique on hand. It works for everything.  So it is very safe to use on animals.

I tried many of the home remedies and nothing really worked or gave me real relief. I then read about Campho-Phenique. I went out and purchased it immediately. True to form it burned like the dickens, but it worked. The pain was lessened and although the package said don't dandage, the location of my boil made it impossible to leave on overnight without securing it. I put a fair amount of product on a cotton ball put a large bandage on my ear just so it would hold the cotton ball in place and went to bed. The next morning a whitehead! I had this stupid thing for days and nothing brought it to a head. I am pregnant so I don't want to lance it so I will continue to put the product on it so that it will break out on its own.

I put Campho Phenique on and WOW! The pain disappeared and the rash is going away after two days!  USE THIS!  It is Wonderful for Shingles.
Burn	Lulu, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	2/11/2010 8:47:54 AM	I apply campho-phenique whenever I burn myself.  It prevents blistering and scarring and anesthetizes the area just a few seconds after it's applied.  I keep it in a cabinet next to the kitchen stove so it's handy when I need it.
Wound	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/4/2010 8:52:12 AM	I had a sore between my toes, I tried everything from hydrogen peroxide to neosporin. I applied campho-phenique with a q-tip swab and in just a few hours it was much improved.Within 24 hours, the redness is gone and the pain is gone.

Once i noticed the cold sore start to turn into a blister I started putting orajel($8) on it. That acutally stopped the pain. The next day it got a little bigger and i went back to the store and got Releev ($17) and Campho-Phenique ($5). At first I put on a little campho-phenique but stop because it is like an ointment that stinks and made the sore more obvious because it was shiny. The Releev kept the sore the same size and kept it from getting bigger, but when I went to sleep I applied a lot of Campho- Phenique and when I woke up the sore was already drying up. I was too excited. I keep putting it on and now its barely visible. Keep in mind the cold sore popped up on Fri and today (Sun) you can hardly tell. I am just mad that I spent money on Releev when the $5 Campho-Phenique did a much better job!
