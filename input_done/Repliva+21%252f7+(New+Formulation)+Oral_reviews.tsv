Anemia from Inadequate Iron	guess whoo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	10/27/2009 12:15:53 PM	I had a miscarriage and my hemogloblin was 7 when I left the hospital.  They wanted to give a blood transfusion.  I did not want one, so my doctor gave me Repliva 21/7.  Three months later, my iron level was 14!! I felt like a teenager again.  I could not take the whole pill, so I took only 1/2 of the red pill for 21 days and the whole purple pill.  It hurt my stomach, but it was worth it b/c of the dramatic increase in energy, no headaches anymore, no more dizzy spells, not being short of breath upon exertion, and feeling like a teenager was worth the stomach upsets.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	Amanda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	10/26/2008 9:08:37 PM	My iron level was a 4 and I have been on Repliva for 6 months.  I had my iron rechecked after 2 months and it had only went up to a 14.  I feel much better now and I think that it just takes a substantial amount of time to see the full benefits of the medication.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	10/4/2008 12:55:38 AM	I had gastric bypass and my iron levels were dangerously low I have been taking this medication for 2 months and I don't feel any better, I have noticed I feel depressed and am wondering it this an side effect. I will be seeing my doctor again to see if there is something that can really help me and I don't have to get a transfusion. If there is any advice out there please post a comment for all to read.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	7/8/2008 9:00:40 PM	I'm almost 7 months pregnant and have problems with my iron levels many times before. My doctor has tried me on other iron pills and this is the only one so far I have had the fewest side affects, although the ones I do have are annoying they pass quickly. I also seem to feel better than I was and I've only been on them a short while.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	6/4/2008 10:10:49 AM	Had gastric bipass and severe iron deficency.  after 5 iron infusions and 2 blood transfusions, this is the only product that has kept my numbers up and steady.  the constipation is a problem at times, however; the alternative (more iron infusions)is worse.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	Ms. Pat, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	4/25/2008 4:21:33 PM	I have tried about every iron product there is and was not able to tolerate them, I have had to have Iron Infussions and Blood Tranfussions because of my Anemia. In the four months that I have been taking the Repliva this is the first time in over ten years that I have gotten a good lab report!This is a good product, it has reallt helped me.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron		2	1	1			3/18/2008 10:12:48 PM	I am 6 months pregnant and have also had gastirc bypass. This medication has not been great for me. Besides the constipation I have had severe vomiting and stomach cramping with it. I think it is awful.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	1	1			1/31/2008 10:34:35 AM	First of all the pill is huge! I tried to take it, and it didn't raise my hemoglobins, and it made me horribly constipated.  
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	1/30/2008 7:32:31 PM	I have noticed a dramatic increase in physical energy due to my iron level rising.  My monthly cycle, however, is irregular and that makes the 'purple' absorption pill confusing.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	Renee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/22/2007 9:05:57 PM	Within 1 month of taking Repliva, I felt almost 100% better. I felt more mentally alert and energized throughout the day instead of feeling tired, fatigued, and lacking energy before I began taking it.  The condition of my skin, hair, and fingernails also improved.  My scalp isn't as dry and flaky, my hair has a healthy shine elasticity, my fingernails are not as dry and brittle.  The skin on my face and body holds more moisture and has a healthier glow.  I feel and look better all over.  I'd recommend Repliva to other women who are anemic.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		11/30/2007 8:48:53 PM	Best Iron I have ever taken and my doctor had me on tandem, then switched me to hemocyte plus, nothing worked better with no side effects than repliva 21/7 did.
