Other	75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		7/9/2012 4:41:33 PM	I have IBS and diverticulosis and wanted something easy to use and that would do away with any straining.  I take 1 or 1/2 50mg tablet upon going to bed and have done so for about 2 years.  I am 87 years old and have been hospitalized at least 2 times for diverticulitis which I do not want to reocur thence the stool softener.  If there are long term effects I would liked to know what they are.

My GP said sodium docusate could be taken daily, indefinitely...however, in spite of a very healthy diet, daily exercise, and plenty of water...after a year or more of taking it, I have developed fingernail conditions symptomatic of malnutrition (flattened, ridged, bumpy, brittle,),(frequent) severe cramps in my feet, and more.  I completely stopped taking sodium docusate last week and immediately the cramps stopped.  What a relief!  I am using a few tablespoons a day of ground flaxseed instead of sodium docusate, and it seems to work.  I hope my other symptoms go away, as well.
Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	45-54	7/5/2012 2:18:53 AM	Caused severe constipation (4+ days) and rectal bleeding. BM's were fine and timely until this drug was given to me in the hospital.Was having 3-4 movements a day until they gave me this drug as part of their normal procedures, after which it was 4 days until my next movement, which caused severe pain, bleeding. It caused hardening of the stool and slowed all abdominal motility and caused severe bloating and gas.

Other	old badger, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	5/11/2012 5:51:51 AM	In 2011 I was diagnosed with Diviticuli caused through excessive straining when passing a motion. As a stoll softener I find this drug works very well, I take 3 at night and two in the morning, every day as prescribed by my GP. I also drink half a glass of prune juice a day which I find also to be of great help. I only get pains once or twice a year as a result of this treatment.

I take 3 pills a day, drink plenty of fluids and eat lots of raw vegetables and whole grains. I have seen no relief from taking the medication. I will be talking to my doctor about something that may be more effective and offer some relief,

I have used it when needed over the years and it seems to help. However I just read about Diocytl Sodium (aka dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate and DSS) on Wikipedia.  Wikipedia's article sites that DSS is used as a pesticide.  Makes one wonder the longer term effects on humans.

It has been a help; I have been taking it for almost 2 years with magnesium. (Nobody told me until this article that it was for &quot;temporary&quot; treatment!?) A year ago I developed nerve tremors similar to Parkinsons. Perhaps too much of this chemical caused it?  I am switching back to bran again as of this writing.

Other	toohard2poop, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/22/2010 3:44:21 AM	i have to be on a strong narcotic medto help me with my neck pain with metal plates and screws. the narcotics makes it so i can not pass a bowel movement with great difficulty.i have been taking this first name brand, then generic-its cheaper. both worked equally as well. i no longer have to strain. i am regular and go everyday. if i stopthis then i will be in trouble. but it is costly if you are on a fixed income like i am. 3.90 for 30 caplets and i need 2-3 a day, so that is a 2 week supply. i think i will be on this for the rest of my life even though i eat tons of fiber, the meds gets in my way. the narcotics takes away my appetite and i have lost 50 pounds which i needed to lose anyways. but im thankful for this med. ducolax is more money, get the generic, same ingredient only cheaper. my stools are now softer but still like balls and rocks dropping in the toilet, that is how bad the narcotics makes it. i tried ex-lax and all that made me do was have uncontrolled #2 movements at night while i was sleeping which was bad, i had to wear a diaper at night to prevent any leakage! and i am only 54! too young for that
