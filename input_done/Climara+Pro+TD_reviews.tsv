When I first started the dose was too strong. I was haveing frequent irregular bleeding, headaches,heart palpitations and bloating.My doctor had me cut the patch in half and this has been great for me. I was having 15-20 sweaty hot flashes a day, INTERCOURSE WAS VERY PAINFUL,I was depressed and moody. Now I still have these symtoms but they are greatly reduced which makes them more tolerable. The side effects I have on the patch are: itchy red skin at the patch sight. periodic red itchy pumps around belly button and croch area, weight gain and bloating.

I love it! It has taken away my night sweats completely and my terrible mood swings. Have a little bit of bleeding every now and then but nothing major. I use a Tegaderm dressing over the top of the patch to make sure it stays on.  Works wonderful. So glad my doctor recommended Climara Pro!

Posts about problems with patch sticking made me worry about using this but ive has no problem and I swim often. I use Teagarden dressing over it and i swear it is invisible and I use a public group shower at the YMCA pool so this is important to me!

I am 58 and was given this patch for my continuing hot flashes.  Day 1 it stuck on my lower stomach / Day 3 came off - stuck it back on my upper thigh with medical tape as it would NOT stick / Day 5 off again as the medical tape gave up too. Will not restick and cannot get the patch off the medical tape.  Tried to just put more tape over top but patch will not adhere at all now and it was not touching my skin at all. HOW is anyone keeping it on?  I do shower EVERY day with no exceptions.  I also refuse to apply another patch for 2 days as I have to pay $35 for 4 patches now and refuse to pay more because the company has not used an adhesive that will stay attached to the skin.  ?????

Dr. put me on Effexor (off label) and it worked very well. Just started this patch for hotflashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness, low sex drive. It's staying on just fine. Hope to see the &quot;good results&quot; others have mentioned. I will use this for a while and switch back to Effexor, which was mainly for hotflashes, night sweats, insomina, and mood swings(although HARD to get off of).

Thought I could 'tough it out', but the no sleep really affective my life. I have had no break thru bleeding, no problem keeping the patch on, and am very pleased with the results. I have not slept this well in 3 years, I am back to my old self, and hot flashes were gone within 3 days. Not excited about risks, but as my doc said, 'Quality of life is important.&quot; Amen!

My Dr. prescribed this product to ease the hotflashes. The medication took care of the hotflashes but within three weeks I started bleeding which turned into a full fledged period lasting a full week.  I continued to spot after that until the fifth week of use, I ended up with a full fledged bleed again!!  Really people!!  I haven't had my period for over five years and now this again?!?!.  I don't think it's one bit funny and I have no intention of putting up with that just to calm the hotflashes.  I'll go back on a natural product that doesn't cause these insain side effects!

I am a 54-year-old woman who has been in menopause since age 51.  I have been using this for about one year now.  Hot flashes and night sweats stopped completely.  My sex drive is back, too.  I had a bit of spotting earlier on but that is very rare now.  For about four months now, I have been using three patches in three weeks and then I take a break for the fourth week with no patch on.  This has been working great for me doing it this way.  It does sometimes irritate my skin when I take it off, but I found that rubbing the area gently with lotion for how many days is needed takes care of that!

It has been a life-changer and saver for me.  My menopausal symptoms of hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, vaginal dryness, dry skin - all gone.  I did have spotting during the first few months, but was told to expect it, and it was minimal.  No side effects, just huge benefits.  No problems with applying, or keeping the patch on.  Swimming in the ocean did cause the patch to lose its adhesiveness.  I am now stressing about what product to use next - am terrified of having my symptoms return, so many serious concerns about using these types of products.  Not sure how I would have survived these past few years without the patch - it has been such a wonderful option for me.

The only side effect I've experienced is breakthrough bleeding and spotting.  I'm trying to take a break but the hotflashes, mood swings and sleep disruptions are coming back!!  Also to keep the patch on, you must place it on an area free of lotions and oils.  Side note:  it is a bit pricey!!!

Within the second week, I had no hot flashes, no insomnia and finally no mood swings! Had been on it 4 months when breast tenderness became extreme. Went off 3 months until symptoms became unbearable again. Back on it 2 months now and breasts are starting to get sore, will discuss with dr next month. No problems with patch sticking as long as I don't use creamy soaps or moisturizers and press firmly for at least 15 seconds. Lasts thru sweat and exercise if done that way.

I too, however, am having a heck of a time keeping it in place.  I play tennis and exercise quite often and the patch comes off in a few days with all the perspiration.  Hmmm...Bayer please modify it so that the adhesive is changeable with a more permanent patch.  Changing the adhesive and removing it during showers or exercise would probably be the answer.  I'll try surgical tape and tegaderm...whatever that is.

Hot flashes stopped, night sweats ended and the birds started singing and the sun started shining within a week! Even though it always left a red mark after I peeled it off I thought it was a little price to pay for regaining my life. BUT then after 10 months it began to burn and blister my skin to the point that I had to take it off. Immediately the old symptoms came back and I thought if I would just toughen up I could put in some virgin areas and it would be oK and mind over matter, but to no avail. My skin is blistered and maybe permanently scarred. I tried the CombiPatch which is an equivalent but the same thing happened immediately. I'm so depressed because I already feel this overwhelming doom feeling. I am about to start taking Activella and will see. I have called Bayer and given my story. I am praying they'll be enough women who report this sensitivity and they'll discover another product to use to adhere the patch because I'm a huge fan.

The PMS is awful - I feel like I'm 15 again.  I know the drug is working, and I know I need the estrogen, but I'm considering changing to an oral medication so I can tweak the dosages so I don't feel so awful.  Ironically, I felt great before starting the medication (except for the hot flashes).

Are you kidding me?  This is an FDA approved drug?  Way to go FDA, you failed the consumer once again.  Before I could even use the 2nd week patch I had terrible stomach pains/cramping, bloating, diarrhea and vomiting.  All the sideaffects got worse by the day.  As soon as I pulled the patch off - I was getting better within a couple of hours.  What a ridiulous expensive product that never should have been approved.

My migranes and insomnia subsided almost immediately. My mood, anxiety and vaginal dryness improved greatly. The only negative side effects are breast tenderness for the last three weeks and I had some vaginal bleeding this morning. I also had a terrible time getting the patch to stick but I found a solution. I cover the patch with a &quot;Tegaderm&quot; dressing. It's a clear, waterproof,&quot;breathable&quot;, adhesive dressing (used in the hospital to cover IV sites). You can buy them at the drug store (I went to Walgreens). Problem solved!

The glue sticks to your skin but the patch does not, therefore I've had to use cloth tape to keep it on, especially during times where I'm exercising regularly.  when the patch is on it works, but the difficulty with keeping it on has meant the dosage has been inconsistent, resulting in alot of spotting/bleeding.  I've used it for a year, but I'm now looking for something else.
