It did not remove a few old age spots BUT I didn't get any more. It is expensive but at my age worth it, no side effects noticed.I am continuing to use it daily
Fine Wrinkling of the Face	fewrinkles, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/19/2010 2:39:22 PM	I have used Renova for over 10 years when in my 50's many people stopped me to ask what I used on my skin as it would always look fresh and smooth with very little wrinkles. So to me this is a wonderful drug for wrinkles and putting collagen back. LOVE IT!

Fine Wrinkling of the Face	good skin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	1/21/2009 6:49:41 PM	I have been using this for 2 years. I have found that it is very effective for fine lines, shrinking pore size, improving texture and with excessive pigmentation. It does cause a lot of peeling and redness and irritation. It took about 6 weeks before my skin adjusted to this medication. 
Other	lillym, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	12/22/2008 1:27:40 PM	Skin doctor prescribed for redness of the face (not rosacea). Makes my skin very dry, red, bumpy and itchy. Looks worse than before. You can't use it near eyes, nose or mouth so I don't understand how it can work on fine lines and wrinkles, if these ARE the spots that have wrinkles! VERY EXPENSIVE and I think not worth it. If you read carefully the info it says that all (if any) benefits reverse to the old when stop using this cream. Also, too many side effects and dangers to the health. Just not worth it.

Fine Wrinkling of the Face	Fabulous at 50, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	2/17/2008 12:04:48 AM	I've recently started using this medication to reduce pore size and help with sun damage (pigmentation) on my face. I am am using other medications too for rocasa. I am impressed after only a few weeks. A few large pores are smaller and my fine wrinkles between my eyes appear less deeper. I plan to adjust my dosage to every other day if redness or excessive peeling begins. Very expensive!! and not covered by my insurance. Worth the cost! 50th birthday present to myself
