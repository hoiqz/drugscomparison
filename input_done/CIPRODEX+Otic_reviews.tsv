Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	8/8/2012 9:01:42 PM	My 9 year old daughter was prescribed Ciprodex and completed the 1 week dosage period with no relief from her ear pain said to be from an irritated ear canal/infection.  It was expensive and it doesn't seem to help very many people based on the reviews.  I wish I would have known that and I will not except another prescription for this medication.  Our first experience with ear drops and it failed.  Now I need to make another appointment, pay for another office visit pay for another prescription and waste a beautiful afternoon with my children while we all sit at the doctors office!

I will see a specialist right away and hopefully have my hearing repaired!

I saw another doctor despite my original doctors advice to finish the course. The new doctor said this is only used for middle ear infection, it would not have a good effect on an inner ear infection, for which you need oral antibiotics.

Outer Ear Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Bacterial Infection	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	4/28/2012 3:13:53 AM	I took this drug for 2 days. In those 2 days my ear has swollen almost completely shut. I developed extreme inflammation anterior to my ear and some inflammation and tenderness posterior to my ear lope. Went to my ENT 2 days after being prescribed, he could barely look into my ear. I was then told to stop and prescribed something else. This drug made the problem 10x worse.

Other	4Eyes, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	3/1/2012 12:31:01 AM	I saw an ear doctor today to flush out my ears which were clogged. A doctor's aide did the procedure. The next thing I knew, the doctor had given orders that I buy and use ciprodex otic although he never saw me after my ears were flushed, I had no symptoms of an ear infection and he never explained the reason for his diagnosis or possible side effects. Of course, there was the famous &quot;coupon&quot; for paying $20 instead of $144. It seems that this is another crooked partnership of doctors with pharmaceutical companies. With an office full of Medicaid/Medicare, one might even suspect that kickbacks are involved. Another disappointing encounter with American medical care - the best in the world! (if you're a doctor or drug company)

The good, no real side effects experienced and infection seems to have cleared up.  The bad, after Ciprodex treatment (3 drops x 6 days twice a day) my hearing has not improved (not any worse just has not gotten any better), this comment comes three days after stopping ear drops. My ENT Doctor thinks I could have fluid build up behind my eardrum causing my hearing not to improve.  Has ordered hearing test and follow-up in two weeks to see if my hearing has improved.  If not, wants me to think about putting hole in ear tube to drain fluid.  However, 1% to 3% chance of permanent hearing loss. Still on Ciprofloxacin for another two days.

My newest dosing with them has caused me to have a vicious earache and since I'm on an oral anti-biotic anyway, I do not see the point in using them. The pain is counterproductive and have caused me to lose a little hearing.

Have dropped from 280 to 220 and still going down feel like I am starving to death slowly. I was told to use 4 drops in ear morning and evening. symptoms started on 2nd day of use.

Seems the ear canal is so swollen no meds are getting in. Doc put in a wick.  Better by Monday, but now have aches all over body.  Little concerned about tendon problems as I cannot take Levaquin because of tendon pain.  Overall the ciprodex worked for the infection. Going to discontinue drops to see if extended time of using them is causing tendon pain.

Over priced for starters...140.00 at cvs. First use completely lost what little hearing I had left in infected ear. Since the infection was in my other ear days before thought it would make sense to use in both ears...I wish I had read reviews first! Now both ears are in total pain swollen shut, swollen glands in my neck, 95% hearing loss remains after three days of use. How can this be the number one prescribed med for ear infection?  Over marketed and richkick backs at our expense. Has this drug worked for anyone?  The only reviews that were positive were also taking antibiotics orally.

Other	Sean, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Male	25-34	5/28/2010 2:14:20 PM	Was prescribed this by a doctor for chronic itchy ear canals (likely due to irritation by overuse of q-tips). Was given 5 refills and told to go on and off as needed. I asked the doctor to go with something without an antibiotic as an infection wasn't really my problem, he disregarded this and had no concerns. Took the first prescription and had no issues, itchy ears cleared up. Slowly the itching came back so took the second round of it. Upon completion of this I experienced noticeable hearing loss and tinnitus in my left ear. Followed up with doctors and it appears this is permanent and a result of ototoxicity. Ciprodex was not as safe was was indicated and the over-prescription by the doctor likely contributed to the problem. The itchy ear canals came back after treatment anyways so in any event it would have been a poor option even if it didn't create much more serious problems.

My doctor prescrined these drops. My first reaction was to the price - very expensive! After a few days of inserting the drops, my palms and fingers started itching and I developed a rash. Read the medicine insert, which listed a rash as a possible negative side effect. The doctor was adament that no connection - that rash from the drops would be local, i.e. at or around the ear. I was almost at end of my 10-day course of drops, so continued for 3 more days. Once I stopped the drops, the rash and itching stopped. But now the skin on my hands has been peeling off. Very dry, scratchy and uncomfortable. Could this be a result of the drops? PS - My ear infection's better tho!
