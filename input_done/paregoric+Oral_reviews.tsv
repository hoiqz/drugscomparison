Finding Paregoric is increasingly difficult.I am creating an online community interested in legally finding/importing/making Paregoric in the USA. If you are interested, please become a member or leave a comment on my blog: http://paregoricadvocates.blogspot.com/ 
Diarrhea	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/1/2011 12:08:04 AM	I had been getting a prescription for this medication for the past 4 years and one prescription would last me for a year or more because i only took it when I really needed it an now that it is no longer available and I have severe stomach problems that it seems this is the only thing I've use to help my condition, now I dont know what I will do because I do not like taking a lot of other drugs for this problem and this is only one that really helped me that I could use periodically and very sparingly. Please help make it possible for people like me to get it to help because I feel when u can get a prescription filled and it lasts for a year, that is not abuse!

Diarrhea	Originalladydi, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	1/2/2011 7:28:17 AM	I have Crohn's and an ileostomy, and as a result constant diarrhea.  Paregoric was prescribed which does help most of the time.  It is no longer manufactured BUT it can be compounded at a Pharmacy.  Giant Genie is a compound pharmacy...and there are others.  In other words they make it on site.  It is more aggravating to get, but it is still available. 
Diarrhea	puddy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/27/2010 10:38:13 PM	has slowed down my diahrea and has caused it to not be of pudding consistency on a daily basis. i do not fear going anywhere most of the time now and always wearing a pad for leakage or what i think is gas/but not. iwould be lost without paregoric. i take 5ml nightly @ bedtime, theres times i could use more during the day but i try to hang near home then rather than use more drug. 
Diarrhea	Toni, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	10/24/2010 7:43:26 PM	I have had 3 colin cancer surgeries and before I was given this medicine, I tried several other remedies.  Paragoric, finally gave me a life and able to leave the house.  I was told by my pharasist, that this was not made anymore, so my doctor gave me a prescription for something else, which put me back to before I started taking Paragoric.  I don't know what to do now!

Diarrhea	FJ1200, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	1/6/2010 9:08:14 PM	I had diarrhea for 18 months continuous.  Saw a gastroenteritis(sp?) and he recommended paregoric. Worked very first time.  What a relief!  Clinical diagnosed with IBS.  With change in diet, only need paregoric 2 to 3 times a month, single dose, some times i/2 dose is enough.  I highly recommend if Dr Prescribes.  Changed my life.
Diarrhea	75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		10/12/2009 4:03:14 PM	I had severe stomach cramps and used Paregoric in drops into aglass of water...the pain was gone instantly...and so was the diarrhea. I wish it could be used carefully again ....perhaps in a diluted form to help pain in stomaches.
Diarrhea	55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5		55-64	8/4/2009 6:44:07 PM	I am a Vietnam Vet that returned to Vietnam 26 years after the war. After one week I became very ill from the food. High fever,throwing up (even water) and severe diarrhea and unbearable stomach pains. A Vietnamese friend brought some medicine that he purchased on the street. When I tasted the medicine I recognized the horrible taste and realized that this was paregoric like my grandmother gave me for stomach pains when I was a child. The paregoric stopped the pains in my stomach immediately and cured the diarrhea in about 24 hours. Too bad they took it off the street market.

Diarrhea	Denise, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/5/2009 12:17:21 AM	I have crohns disease. Over 5 years ago and after my 3rd bowel resection I was left with 3 feet of small bowel and no large bowel. Of course an ileostomy.  Paregoric is the only medicine that helped slow down the diarrhea so I can get enough nutrients from my food.  Medicare is no longer covering it because it hasn't been tested by all these new up to date tests.  Don't the years that it's been on the market count for anything.  No doctor knows what to give me that will work as well.  Smells great but tastes nasty.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/7/2009 11:51:16 PM	This is the most effective treatment for fever blisters I have ever seen.  Just 1 or 2 applications will eliminate the problem.  I use a cotton swab for application.

I take OTC medications to ease my symptoms but it doesn't always work.  Paregoric is the best medication when I have a lot of trouble and need to sleep.  I do have to be careful because of it lowering blood pressure because I already have an abnormally low BP so the day after I use the Paregoric I usually have to stay in bed.
Diarrhea	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/25/2008 10:00:32 AM	For years I was prescribed Donnagel-PG (no longer manufactured), a liquid that contained the same ingredients as Donnatal, I believe, plus paregoric (powdered opium). This was actually sold over the counter at pharmacies at the time. You didn't actually have to have a prescription, just sign a registry. This was the *very best* treatment ever for my IBS with diarrhea. I'm just sorry they took it off the market, because it was one of the most helpful medicines I ever took.
