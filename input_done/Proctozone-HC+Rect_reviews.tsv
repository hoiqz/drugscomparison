Skin Irritation Around the Anus	Redass, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	65-74	4/19/2011 3:28:37 AM	medication works well for bits of waste held in anus folds long enough to deteriorate and cause very painful irritation.  Delivery tip only 1&quot; long screws onto tube, requires holding tube and trying to insert into rectum, then trying to squeeze tube until feel cold cream in rectum.  By then I've used 1/4 tube per use, so 4 applications per tube, very messy to clean up.  Prohibitively expensive cost per application, awkward trying to squeeze cream out of tube while 1&quot; tip inserted in rectum.  Delivery system designed by someone with an Edgar Allen Poe sense of humor. Macabre!!!!
Rectal Disorder	Jan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	3/16/2011 10:42:57 AM	I went to the doctor for what I believed was my first ever hemorrhoid. It was confirmed and I was given this prescription. I used it for 4 days with no change to the one hemorrhoid. I then woke up on the 5th day to 2 more hemorrhoids! These aren't as big but they itch tremendously! This medicine is not helping at all with the reduction of the hemorrhoids or the itch. I have a call into the doctor to see if there is another medicine that will help to get rid of them!

Skin Irritation Around the Anus	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	35-44	8/5/2010 10:54:28 PM	I have reaccuring external hemeroids that started with my pregnancy 5 years ago.  They come back every now and then.  This last time have been very bad and am having a hard time getting them to go away.  I am taking Proctofoam AND this cream as well for external.  I have been using it for 6 days now.  Sometimes it will work, and keep itching and irritation down, but other times it does not.  I do not think it is strong enough...2.5%  I think what is really helping is taking 800 mg of Motrin (normal dosage amount for me...perhaps you should start with 200 mg...on tablet...then work your way up if needed).  The Motrine had done wonder in reducing the swelling.This cream tho, I think would be fine for minor discomfort but not the major ones.
