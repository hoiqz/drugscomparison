Bipolar Disorder in Remission	jane, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/17/2010 3:27:40 PM	I have been on this medication for 14 years and find it a great mood stabilizer.  I am never manic but find depression is an ongoing problem.  It also helps with chronic headaches which I used to get.  I find I have put some weight on but it was needed because I was underweight.  
Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	11/18/2008 9:02:41 AM	Sodium valproate,along with a very healthy lifestyle;(alcohol free,daily exercise,low stress,regular sleeping patterns and a nutritious diet),has allowed me to be siezure free for more than a year. I do experience drowsiness,blurred vision and confusion; or perhaps more accurately put,an inability to turn thoughts into actions as efficiently as i used to. On the whole though these side effects are easy to accept and deal with, as opposed to having grand mal siezures and suffering the head injuries that inevitably come with them. I would recommend this drug for anyone requiring it,in close consultation with a good G.P., if you are lucky enough to have one avaliable to you. best of luck and peace to all.
