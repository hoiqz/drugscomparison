Side effects for me are not listed on the pamphlet.  I - like others here - get sensitivity to heat/cold (esp when washing my hands), feeling cold and/or having a cold nose,  and when I first eat/drink after taking it my jaws ache (like when you get that ache from eating a sour candy). Zomig always stops my migraine, so the side effects are well worth it!

I too have a few side effects.  My joints seem to ache after taking it.  Although not enjoyable I will take that over the migraine.

Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/8/2009 12:46:00 PM	I am a very busy mom and daycare provider.  I can take this medication at the start of a migraine and am able to continue to work without having to medicate, then lay down in a quiet room to get relief.  It's that quick and that effective. 
Migraine Headache	Jo Ann, 55-64 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		55-64	10/4/2009 6:20:27 PM	I've been taking Zomig for about 7years for chronic migraines. The only side-effects that I experienced was a weight on my chest sometimes and and a slight dizziness. My insurance rates went up because of this med(this stuff is very expensive).  So I've tried Cafergot and have had good success.  It's much cheaper too.

I have suffered with migraines since I was 8, I'm now 56. Started taking 6 yrs. ago.  Would not trade it for anything.  Only side effect I get is a little sleepy.  So I just sit down and take a 15 min. nap and I am fine.  It not only relieves the migraine completely, but it also helps to eliminate the neck and shoulder pain I suffer from due to a work injury. No pain of anykind for at least 24 hrs. I only take 2.5 mgs, not the 5.  MIRACLE DRUG, I LOVE IT!!!

Migraine Headache	Onyx2005, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/10/2008 1:16:47 PM	I am a veteran of the recent conflict in Iraq and about 4 years ago I had a fall off of the flatbed of a truck. Ever since then I have been having terrible migraine headaches that last 2 to 3 days. So terrible that I would get violently ill and would eventually have to go to the emergency room. After 4 years and 2 doctors, I have found that this drug is truly a &quot;miracle drug&quot;. I noticed that about fifteen to thirty minutes after taking it that my migraine was gone! I really mean gone, although I experienced 2 side effects, tightening of the throat and wide-spread body aches. They only lasted about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. I feel I would rather deal with those 2 side effects than deal with just the pain of a migraine, not to mention everything else that goes along with it. The pros do out weigh the cons in my case. I would tell anyone that deals with migraines often to at least look into it.

I have been suffering from migraines for 10+ years and with this drug I get rid of my headache within 30-60 minutes of taking this pill.  The only problem I have is my prescription only allows 9 pills in one month and I usually run out before the end of the month.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	10/23/2008 8:26:30 PM	I get migrianes every few weeks and they last 2-5 days at a time.  I was taking 3-4 excederin migraine pills at a time, to get my migraine down to just a headache.  Zomig is the only drug I have been able to take to completely get rid of a migraine, right away.
Migraine Headache	yme, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/8/2008 4:29:49 AM	I was previously prescribed Imitrex which wasn't very consistent.  Sometimes I would take my maximum for the day and still no relief whatsoever.I've been taking Zomig for about three years.  It's 99% effective in relieving my migraine pain.  And like most of the other people who've posted reviews, I make sure I carry at least one at all times.  To make life easier I make sure I have some when I go on vacation and at work.  I suffer slightly from side affects but the positive strongly outweigh the negative.

My body adapts to medications quickly, so I had tried Imitrex and Maxalt among other meds, but they all stopped working after a few treatments.  The Zomig ZMT has been working wonderfully for me for a few years now and the side effects are a lot better than the pain of the migraine.  I make sure to keep one in my purse, my desk and in my travel bag...just to make sure if I need it...it's right there.

My migraines are at least 3-5 days in a row during my cycle and occasionally with weather changes or severe allergies.  I started using this drug about 4 years ago and at first I had some light chest pains, severe skin sensitivity (cold, hot or tingling). After using it for some time, I do not have any of those symptoms now and it no longer makes me sleepy to take it.  I am an RN and I can take this drug when I feel it coming on and continue to work and my migraine will be gone in 30 minutes.  Many of my friends and co-workers have started taking Zomig because they observed how well it worked for me.  
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	2/24/2008 12:54:55 AM	I must have had an allergic reaction to this medication because not only did I fall into severe depression but I was numb from my head to my waist and then when it wore off my whole body was very sore! I will never take it again.

Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	12/11/2007 5:20:00 PM	I've had good results with this medicine.  I like the ease of use, and it does a decent job of getting rid of my headache.  My only problem with it is that I definitely have had some of the side effects.  It's actually made my nausea worse, and I've had numbness and tingling from my jaw, down to my neck, chest and shoulders.  I'm actually going to request to be put back on Maxalt because of the side effects.

Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/15/2007 1:38:05 PM	This is my wonder pill.  Migraines used to keep me from my daily activities, but this pill eliminates the pain and I can still function normally.  The only side effects I have noticed are slight drowsiness, a tight feeling in my throat, and skin sensitivity.  I highly recommend this medication!  I like it much better than the nasal spray which dripped down my throat and tasted bad, and also made my nasal cavity sensitive.
