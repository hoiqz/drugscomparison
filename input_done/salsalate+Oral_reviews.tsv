Cannot and do not want to take any type of narcotic pain medicatiion.  I did use Vioxx, but had a reaction to it, so back to salsalate - it was called Monogesic when I first started taking it.  Doctor said it would be easiest on my somewhat sensitive stomach--and since 1986 it has worked.

Ibuprophen worked ok, Dr changed to this he feels is less risky. I have had significant results on 750mg 2x a day. It has made the pain tollerable and I am able to do much more than before. However, there is a lapse in between when I am hurting. I would recommend this to other meds such as prednisone, celebrex, etc... I think those have higher risk of heart attack and stroke.

Other	S from Redlands, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	55-64	2/9/2011 2:56:04 PM	Feb. 9, 2011I have Fibromyalgia and have been on 750 mg once a day (along with Prozac 10mg) for 5 years. Three weeks ago I began experiencing ringing in both ears. Since this was a new symptom I had my ears checked for wax build up and then washed. However the ringing is still present in the left ear. I am extremely in tune with my body and am in  good shape. But after reading up on the side effects on Salsalate, and the included &quot;postings&quot; from others, I feel that this medication might be the culprit. I see an ENT specialist today and will repost those results. I too have noticed that Tylenol and regualr caffeine free Asprin work just as well, however, I am concerned about the long term side affects of those over the counter pills as well. Any advice?

Pain eased and mobility increased right away.  Since then, it has continued working, but slowly and gradually.  Overall, the medication is clearly working.My biggest problem is that it is not covered by my insurance.  It has not been a big deal, as it has only been $12.00 per month.  However, when I went for my last refill, it is suddenly $48.93 for a month's worth.  Pharmacy claims that the manufacturer raised the price.I am asking my doctor for an alternate.

I kept taking the medicine trying to overcome the effects instead they increased. It did absolutely nothing for the pain that I was suffering from. This medication was a bad experience and never produced not one positive result.

Used in combination with Medical Marijuana (capsule/oral/oil) to treat muscle and joint pain it seems to work. I am never completely out of pain but experience a serious reduction in overall pain. Using MM as a topical muscle rub and taking orally before bed gets me a pretty good nights sleep. One problem......I developed a cripling abdomen pain last week and ended up in the ER. A CAT scan of internal organs showed no problems so the source of the pain had to be within the disgestive system. I stopped taking Salsalate for a few days and then started again. No serious abdominal pain yet....keeping my fingers crossed. When I went off the Salsalate for a couple of days, I went into a serious remission of overall body pain in joints, muscles and just about everywhere else. It must be helping because I am not back to tolerable pain levels. Hope this helps someone. MOMM in Grants Pass, Oregon.

Then I started on 2 per day 750 mg Salsalate and within a few weeks I was off the ENBREL ($450 per day) and off the steroids that were giving me uncontrollable type 2 diabetis after a year of steroids.  My diabetis, blood pressure, and pain are under control and I am very happy with it.  However, if I miss a pill, within hours I will be in pain again.

At least I can function more normally, dressing, eating, etc. than with anything else.  Of course, having Lupus and Fibromyalgia, also, doesn't help.  ALL being auto-immune disorders.  But Salsalate helps the most with NO side effects after a couple years, now.
