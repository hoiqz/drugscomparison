Pain	TH, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	35-44	4/16/2012 12:50:35 PM	Had a MAJOR wisdom tooth infection like i have never felt before! My wife had extra Tylenol 3 w/codeine and I figured it would subside the pain until i could take care of it. Boy was i wrong !!! I bought every over the counter medicine i could find - nothing worked! DIDNT EVEN TOUCH IT !!! I got my hands on Tramadol - knocked it out completely for about 2-3 hours but would come back. Took so much Tramadol in 24 hours i was sick to my stomach. Anyhow, regarding this drug: I wouldnt waste my time taking it. Its junk.

Pain	catone, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	1/15/2012 11:24:30 AM	Suppose to take 1 every 6 hrs for pain. It was like taking nothing at all. Tried taking 2 that worked 1 time for about 1 1/2 hrs, then tried taking 3 every 4 hrs even though it wears off after 2 hrs. Now that doesn't seem to be working either.  Not sure what the point of this drug is if you have to constantly keep upping the dose to feel some kind of relief

Pain	 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female		3/28/2009 6:00:07 AM	I've been taking this medicine for well over 3 years now.  Had several major surgeries, and was taking Hydrocodine.  But because of my diabetes, the hydrocodine was giving me a bad reaction.  So T-3 was perscribed and has done a great job for my pain.  I also have body pain (fibromyalgia) and also heel spurs with plantar fascitis, which is very painful.  T-3 do the trick.  I try not to take this on a daily basis if I don't have to, since it certainly can be additing.  But overall, it does do the trick for my chronic pain.I also suffer from occasional migraines.  Unfortunately, T-3 does nothing to alleviate my condition.  I do Imitrex for this.

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	3/12/2009 5:35:55 PM	This medication worked extremely well at first, only side effects being nausea and some sedation; however, it stopped working and actually seemed to have caused rebound headaches and pain.  I feel like I need something stronger but know that opiates are addictive, and I don't know if many doctors feel comfortable prescribing opiates so much.  Hopefully something works for me.
