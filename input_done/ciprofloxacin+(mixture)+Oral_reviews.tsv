Bacterial Urinary Tract Infection	Paper man, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	45-54	9/11/2012 9:38:41 AM	This is my 5th day on the meds, I came to this web site looking for answers to what I have been going through. I have been very sleepy, hard to stay awake at work, low energy and have had some pain in my lower back. Now that I know it is the meds, at least I have an understanding of why I feel disconnected. I am half way through my treatment and will try and stay with it until complete but for future use I will try something else.

I started treating this round of cellulitis with a 3 year old script, which the Dr. replaced with a newer script. I took the first pill in the new script before bed last night and did not sleep a wink all night. The new script is for 750mg. And the old script was for 500mg., but it seems something else must have changed to cause such dramatic sleep problems when it did not used to affect my sleep at all.

The first one stopped the frequent urination, I still had a minor burn but by the 3rd day I didn't notice any burning whatsoever.This worked better than the other antibiotics I got for my last uti.My only problem is all the restrictions; no caffine, no vitamins,  etc. Plus the time restrictions on when I could take it in comparisson to dairy products and food in general

I was very lightheaded and sleepy but could not sleep, the longest night of my life. Day two same thing only that night I had bad pains in my lower back, like kidney pain. That night minimal sleep. It is now the end of day 3 and all my joints are popping and cracking when I move, I am so tired but can't sleep, no more headache but don't want to eat. I have had some numbness in my hands and feet on and off and the kidney pain is back. This is the worst antibiotic I have ever taken. I never get any of the side effects and with this one I feel like I have them all. I think I will call the dr in the morning.

That is similar to a boil, a bacterial infection.  I had difficulty swallowing the pills-trouble sleeping and worse a dreadful taste in my mouth. After the 4th dose I became horribly nauseous and dizzy too and was taken off the drug.The labels' instructions were to take with plenty of water. Come to find out later that food should also be eaten when taking Cipro. Am not on any drugs at the present time just using warm soaks-antibacterial ointment and soap and water for the boil.

I only took 3 of these pills and ended up with a full emotional and mental break down to the point I wanted to end it all. Headache, lower leg pain, nausea, diarrehea, dizziness, could not get to sleep, mental/mood changes (understatement) anxiety, depressions, suicidal thoughts, 5 mins outside and my skin was on fire and I almost vomited. And my throat is now soar .I can't believe an antibiotic did this to me.Hope you have a better time with it.Just remember when you want to mess up your life, your job, your family... it is just the antibiotics doing this to you.The pharmacy told me to stop taking the pills ( no brainer there) and drink a lot of water.The symptoms came on all the sudden.  I was fine and then boom! Major metal melt down.It is not 16 hours later and my throat is still bothering me, but that is ok as I am getting a lot happier, back to my normal self and my leg is feeling better and my headache is all but gone.I think we as patients should look up the side effects before we agree to take the first pill.. I know I will as I never want to feel that way again.May God Bless...

Bacterial Urinary Tract Infection	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/30/2009 8:36:56 PM	I came home from the hospital after having a foley catheter, with a bladder infection and peed every hour on the hour. My Dr. called this med in for me and in 3 days it was gone! I would highly recommend this as a fast acting drug for a bladder infection and I suffered no side affects...

I drank buckets of water but no relief from the heartburn, and antacids are not to be taken with this med. The bladder infection is improving after 5 days but the upset stomach is constant and very unpleasant!

Urinary Tract Infection due to E. Coli Bacteria	Margot, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	55-64	10/17/2008 9:07:12 AM	I took the pills for 7 days and was very ill with dizziness, fatigue, and felt the e-coli was systemic or septic.  The pills soothed my stomach and helped but gave me thrush. I took Diflucan and feel better than I did, but the e-coli is still there and spreading and so is the yeast infection.  I need to be treated for both somehow now.  The hospital screwed up the test for colon leaks that could have caused this condition but found I have Diverticulosis so I must assume that is the culprit.  My body is settling somewhat on its own but I can't allow this to continue to spread and there seems to be no real method to stop it. I would not take the medication again.

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/27/2008 3:54:20 PM	I had a foot that swelled to over twice its normal size due to a bite from an unknown bug.  I had to drink tons of water with it, like doctor and the pharmists said to do, and if I could take it with food I was better off.  It made my stomach a little squirmy, but like I said the more water I drank and if I added a little food I would feel ten times better.  This medication worked perfectly for me and was the second antibiotic prescribed because the first one wasnt working.  On any antibiotic eat yogurt with it if you dont want a yeast infection because antibiotics will take away the good cultures in your system.  Eating yogurt will help this.

Other	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	2	Male	19-24	5/12/2008 4:13:48 PM	I was prescribed this med for Staff infection on the hand. I felt alot better after three days, and on day four I felt disoriented in the afternoon and the same on day five. On day five after dinner I was unable to take my dose because I started vomiting and thought I had come down with the flu but I had no fever. It is day six and I can't hold down even a glass of water but I dont feel dizzy or as though I have stomach flu symptoms, just as though I was kicked in my gut!. NOTE: I'm a healthy 23 year old male! Would'nt wish this on anyone!
Bacterial Urinary Tract Infection	raeanna, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/5/2008 10:07:18 PM	I had some heartburn related to this medicine but drinking a lot of water reduced that effect. It also brought on a intense yeast infection despite taking Diflucan at the beginning of the 5 days that I was directed to take the antibiotic. But, I was given a second dosage of diflucan to take at the end and it remedied that problem.
