It completely changed your psychological being after taking it for so long, I urge everyone to try and find another source of medicine.  
Panic Disorder	Bill, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/22/2012 2:42:15 PM	I believe this medicine is a &quot;God-send&quot; for me.  I can now do things that are a common activity for most people.  I've always dealt with some type of anxiety in new or social situations.  Now taking 1MG of Xanax XR my nervousness and anxiety are gone.  If I have a day that I know will be long I have a smaller prescription of the 2mg pill and this last all day.  Can't say enough about how this medicine has changed my life.  I look at it like take blood pressure medicine and it's something my body needs.  I hope it will always be available.  I have not felt the need to keep upping my dosage and believe with self control it is not additive.  It get's me over the hump.

Panic Disorder	girl87, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	4/12/2012 1:38:37 AM	I was diagnosed with a panic/anxiety disorder approximately 8 yrs ago. I have tried every type of drug possible to calm me down &amp; nothing worked. Finally, after seeing a psychiatrist he prescribed the regular xanax 1.0mg (3 per day). As, a worry wart that I am, I refused to take 3 a day for the fear of dependancy. I would only take 1 per day &amp; at the most 1 1/2 per day, which did help with the calming. Then about 3 months ago he decided to try the xanax xr 3mg per day. After a week of that, I found I was so sleepy! I went from climbing the walls to sleeping all the time. The dose was way to much for me. So, after the 1st month he lowered it to 2mg per day &amp; so far it has been much better. As we all know these kind of meds can become addictive &amp; that was just another thing I had to worry about, but I finally tried to use the power of my mind to NOT let myself get addicted to them, and I also look at it this way. If I can live close to a somewhat normal life again instead of being a figity hermit, then I am all for it. So far I can say that I am not 100% my normal self, but this is the closest I have been to it in the last 8yrs! I would definetly try it, if you got anxiety &amp; don't worry about the addictiveness. If you got a good dr. that will watch you closely &amp; that you are not abusing them, I think you will be fine! Life is to short to not enjoy it like you once did, so I say give it a shot &amp; try it. If someone would've told me they had panic/anxiety attks 10+ yrs ago, I would've thought they were crazy! Trust me, they are scarey, they are very real, &amp; I don't wish them on anyone. But, I am VERY thankful that I have finally found something to take the edge off!!

I have severe panic disorder and anxiety. I have been off of medication for about 2 years, but the attacks have flared up again. I cannot get one doctor to prescribe Xanax XR to me. I have been through Celexa, Paxil, and Lexapro; all will awful side effects and increased anxiety. He still will not give me what I know works because it can be addictive. Kicking a paxil habit can be like kicking a herion habit, so how is that any different. Anyone have any suggestions on how to go about getting a doc to prescribe Xanax?

I have one of those minds that never &quot;shuts off&quot; or allows me to fully relax to sleep restfully.  I take one 3XR per day after dinner, so that it has sufficient time to enter my bloodstream before bed.  I can now fall asleep and stay asleep every night.  My quality of like is so much better!  Previously, my doctor tried other anti-anxiety medications, anti-depressants and even sleeping pills.  Nothing has ever even been able to tough the rsult I have had from using Xanax, And I have had no ill side effects, either.

The XR lasts about 16 hours not 24 hours for me, so I do twice or thrice dosing during the day at 0.5mg to 1.0mg.  Xanax is a life saver for killing panic. Have used for over 5 years.  Generic is now available. But all meds have their side effects, mainly sleepiness, and seems impossible to get off of if you have full blown panic disorder like me.

When my doctor prescibed this for me, I thought &quot;I'm not crazy, I'm sick&quot;. However, he was right! Just one pill with .05mg dosage, and I'm right as rain and finally sleep all night with dreams! Something I haven't done in 10 years! Unfortunately, he is taking me off Xanax and prescibing me Zoloft because of the potential addictivness.

I worked my way up to this dosage during the 2 years prior. I had tried almost every medicine available, all with terrible side effects. (Effexor made me incredibly sick and nauseated, Zoloft made me suffer from severe insomnia, etc). This has been the only medication that has worked for me. Like a few other pts on here, I was suffering from terrifying panic attacks that would come out of nowhere and was having one everytime I'd drive. I became a hermit. I am concerned about weening off of it when I decide to have children, but I believe it's worth it. No more panic attacks! I also do not drink, so I have no problems with it making me feel dizzy or &quot;out of it&quot;. If you take this Rx as directed, you will not abuse it. It's a great medication, so I would not focus too much on the reputation. Take it as directed and it works wonders, giving a more free, fulfilling life.

I always thought that the side effects were from lack of sleep but it turns out that the lack of sleep is from Xanax too. Very addictive, it's almost easy to abuse. Withdrawl is painful and can occur after two weeks of 4mg. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any side effects. Don't make the mistake I made.

Panic Disorder		4	4	4			12/15/2009 4:43:50 PM	the lady below me could not be more wrong. klonopin is highly addictive and due to its long acting nature actually has worse withdrawal symptoms than xanax. i know this from experience of both. if you're on xanax, use it as little as possible to avoid the addiction. its not something to be taken all day every day. if you're afraid of the addiction to benzodiazepines, avoid them altogether, its not worth the dangerous withdrawals that could ensue

Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	12/1/2009 8:19:24 AM	I have taken Xanax for years. Yes, it was my miracle pill. I was able to function in ways I hadnt been able to before. BUT my experience took a turn for the worse. I ended up in the hospital twice in one week because I had seizures due to lowering my dose. I became highly addicted. Because of the seizures my doctor decided I should try to stop completely. Weaning off of course but I might as well have gone cold turkey. The withdrawl symptoms are horrible. I couldnt sleep, eat, think clearly, i was throwing up all the time. My body hurt. I was frustrated. My anxiety was ten times worse than it had ever been. Take my advice, stay away, find another alternative. Xanax will ruin your life in the long run. I have been off Xanax for over 2 months now and still experiece horrible side affects. I have terrible headaches EVERYDAY. I still feel so sick to my stomach all the time and usually end up throwing up. I have researed it over and over again. This can last for up to 18 months. I have been unemployed throughout this process because i cant seem to leave my house. it has ruined me. Coming back from this is so hard. im doing my best. If i had known that i would go through all of this I NEVER would have taken it in the first place. If you HAVE to have something try Klonopin. (not sure if i spelled that right) it is so much better for you. its in the same family of xanax but not so addictive. it gives you the same benefits. i just want everyone to know that xanax is horrible. these educated doctors who prescribe it are wrong, they know what it does and still prescribe. shame on them. Its not worth it...just my opinion but seriously think of the long term affects first.

I am greatful for this drug; I feel comfortable in large crowds unlike before. I feel like I am relaxed throughout the day, and don't worry as much as before I started taking this drug. There have been a few times when my script has lapsed before my regular doctor's visit, and just for the few days of not taking it I haven't really experienced any serious side effects. I used to grind my teeth at night and constantly waking up through the night with my fists clinched up, or just not being able to sleep at all. Overall, I feel great, not always feeling anxious or panicing about the daily grind at work. I work in a restuarant, and was always getting stressed very easily. This drug has turned my life around for me. I also suffer from chronic migraines triggered by stress, this has also helped keep my stress level down to help prevent the frequency of those migraines. As with any drug, this is not for everyone. It works for me.

Other	John, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	35-44	2/19/2009 2:51:14 PM	I have tried effexor,lexapro, paxil, none of them worked for me.I tried generic 2mg xanax and found it went up and down. Now I pay the extra for Xanax XR and I believe it is more consistent. I also believe anxiety also has alot to do with blood sugar and how you have been eating often and healthy and on a regular basis and of course stress.The Xanax has calmed me down alot the first day I took it it made me loopy but that was it. My doctor told me I have probably needed this my whole life and probably will be on it my whole life but whatever can make you happy, that is all that matters.

I have been on it for 12 years, yes it helped my panic attacks but I am in a fog everyday and now I am going to detox to get off of it.  It's only a temp fix.  Find another nonaddictive drug. Psychiatrist love it, Psycologist hate it. Go figure?

Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/5/2008 11:02:33 AM	I started having severe anxiety after a family tragedy.  This has really helped me get back into the move of things.  It has been a real life saver for me.  I take 2 mg XR, 3mg was too much.  The 2mg seems to take the edge off so I can function again.
Panic Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	19-24	12/1/2008 1:01:23 PM	I have been suffering from an anxiety and panic disorder for several years.  I have tried every medicine you can imagine, but most were more centered around depression.  Since I have begun taking this medicine, along with Buspar, I am feeling so much better!  I have been a little drowsy between the two, but I've been told that will go away as my body adjusts.  I would highly recommend this to anyone having these same issues, and if the price is an issue, go for generic!  It is practically the same thing, and while it will still put a dent in your wallet, it definitely won't be as big of a cost to you.  Hope this helps someone.

Other	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/23/2008 3:48:25 PM	I have generalized anxiety disorder and have been on benzodiazepine therapy for 25 years now. What I like about Xanax XR compared to some other drugs in this class is that it stays in the system, continuously working all day, so I don't have to worry about taking my next dose on time, for example if I'm stuck on a delayed flight. The downside is that since I have been on these medications for so long, my psychiatrist (a specialist in psycho-pharmacology) has told me I will need to take this for life. That's fine with me; I look at it just like medication for diabetes or high blood pressure. Anyway, that would be the case with any benzodiazepine. I'm functioning well and sleeping well, taking 4-5 mg. per day for several years now.
Panic Disorder	hopefullyhelpful, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/16/2008 1:13:43 PM	I suffer from Panic Attacks. Been taking Xanax 3xr for 2 years. And boy it helps. I read on another post that a woman pays 600.00 for a script. I pay 56.00 for 30 days supply. I went online and checked out  discount drug cards. I found one that is called The PCD card. IF i did not pay 56.00 it would cost me 157.00. This is Genetic but works the same. My suggest is to surf the net for presciption discount cards. I pay nothing for the use of the card and got it free.

I can leave my house, play with my kids and deal with the general public while working. I used to panic when alone with my kids, used to get written up at work and wouldnt go even to a store alone. I pick up my XR tomorrow im hoping it does the same
Other	ripdraven, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	7/9/2008 5:33:42 PM	Was using reg Xanax 1 mg 4xs day for 20 yrs for anxiety.  Neither Pharmacist could agree on how to covert my dosage from 1 mg 4xs/day to the XR. Dr put me on 1 mg XR twice a day.Made me so jittery I couldn't stand it. Had to take reg Xanax just to calm the jitters. Dropped to 1 mg once a day, still so jittery I could not write my name. Not worth it to me.
Panic Disorder		5	5	5			6/1/2008 6:52:28 PM	I was on this medication years ago but had to move. Now I take regular Xanax because I Can't find many doctors who like Xanax. I live in Houston Texas and would appreciate any help in finding a doctor who will at least listen to me. This medication is really a God sent!

Other	Xanax, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	19-24	4/30/2008 5:34:47 PM	I HIGHLY discourage any person from using this drug. Regardless of how anxious you may feel or if you have panic attacks, DON'T take it. I was on it for 6 months when prescribed by my family medicine doctor for occassional anxiety; I later went to the head phycologist at a nationally renound hospital in Washington. He is a lead prof in the School of Medicine, Phycology department. My new doctor spends 1 full day of class lecture on Xanax alone, and why NOT to prescribe it! This is serious...I attempted to stop taking the medication; only to find you have a serious risk of having a seizure and cannot stop cold turkey. The withdrawls are HORRIBLE, and you must wean yourself off Xanax! Because I was only on it for 6 months I went from 4pm/day to 2mg/day for 1 week, 1mg/day for 1 week, then .5mg/day for the last week and still had serious withdrawls. My doctor said patients who are on Xanax for longer periods of time, 2 years+, it can take them up to a year to get off it! And you can't rebound or relapse, you'll do nothing but hurt yourself even more! Even if you do take it to get rid of anxiety, it will get worse because your body becomes quickly dependant and immune to it, requiring higher dosages.I do not blog or post online, but I had to spread the word. I am an honors students, very stable, no drug addictions or problems, just a normal guy; so those who are prone to relapse or abuse Xanax, BE AWARE. Bottom line; in no circumstance take Xanax, if you're on it currently the best of luck getting off! Do as you wish, but thought I'd let you in on a little secret.

I tried buspar and zoloft and both gave me horrible side effects.  I loved Xanax but hated how sleepy it made me.  My doctor prescribed Xanax XR and it has worked great. I can concentrate throughout the day, I don't constantly worry anymore, I feel much more like the way I did before my panic attacks.

I was put on the XR 3mg, about 1yr ago. I feel relaxed and not so stressed, no more ups &amp; downs!! I would definatly recommend this to anyone that is on the Reg xanax to try (The XR does not have the same effect of calming down in 15mins,Your calm ALL day.) But I still have trouble sleeping!? Just a night owl I guess.   I hope this was helpfull.

I take it before bed and it helps me to stop worrying about everything that happened that day.  It does have a calming effect for me. Nice.
