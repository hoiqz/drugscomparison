&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs	neveragain, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	9/5/2012 10:46:33 PM	Had total hysterectomy 4 months ago.  About 6 weeks ago, began severe sweating, not just flashes.  My gynocologist had me try a low dose of prempro and wean myself off effexor after a month.  Sweating improved, but rest of my health went downhill.  Extreme shortness of breath started a week ago along with light headediness,  fatigue, coughing, watery eyes and other allergy symptoms, all quiet severe.  Unable to see my gynocologist until next week.  So today went to see my family practitioner,  after calling in tears, that i needed help.  Honestly thought i was either having a heart attack or going crazy.  After chest xray and bloodwork (which of course do not have results just yet), he said he was concerned about a pulmonary embolism.   That scares me.  But i am now convincing myself, until further testing, that its a reaction to the prempro!  Doctor told me to quit it immediately and start back on my effexor, which helps with anxiety.  And trust me, I am definitely anxious after this past week.  Things just sort of came to a head today.  Im hoping for better days soon, sweating or not.  Glad to hear other ladies have good results with prempro.  But to me, it was a nightmare.  Actually, lying in bed writing this because I'm still feeling pretty rough.  Please tomorrow be better!

No hot flashes, night sweats, I feel very good, or should I say I feel NORMAL again!  Ive been on it for ten years, and I am afraid to stop taking it.

I was experiencing extreme hot flashes particlarly at night. Doctor put me on this medication. Within 1 week saw a significant decrease in hot flashes BUT wieght gain, moodiness, cramping started. Went to every other day and seemed to be doing OK until I got a period! After speaking with the nurse, I have stopped taking the medication. May consider herbal treatment if the hot flashes return.

It's averaging 91/56 and I feel  terrible. Exhaustion is the biggest facture. I simply cannot move. I have no idea if the Prempro is causing this but I will be going off of it now.  If my bp corrects itself I will know why. I am 59 years old, 5'1&quot; and weigh 125 so my weight is not a factor.

Have been taking  Prempro for approx. 12- 15 yrs. and hope to continue forever.  I look and feel great.  No side effects that I'm aware of.My Dr. encourages me to stop taking, but I keep telling her, &quot;why fix something that isn't broken&quot;.  I started out on the highest dose and 3 or 4 yrs ago switched to the lowest dosage.  I have no history of breast cancer in my family, it's kept my bones strong and skin looking good, no weight gain (I'm 5'6, 140 lbs.)  I'm a believer, that our bodies need estrogen at this age. I have researched alot and have found many articles as to the advantages of HRT.  That old study was done incorrectly.  I'll take my chances.  At the time the study was done 1 out of 100 women got cancer.  Small %.  However, it may be right for me (good genes) and not for someone else.  I have yearly checkups, important to do.  Good luck ladies. and God's blessings be about you.  (:

I've had very good results from taking it.  It kept me active, free from hotflashes and other menopausal symptoms.  I helped me look young and feel young.  Once my doctor stopped me from taking it, all the symptoms came back including vaginal dryness, depression, and feeling like life was sucked out of me.  I'd like very much to continue taking the pills.  Please let the doctors know that the study done which claim it can cause cancer is flawed according to Dr. James Dobson.  The study used women in their 60's and they already had a variety of medical problems. He claimed the women on prempro should never be deprived from taking. them.  I want my prempro back!

I'm only 29 but have been through Lupron twice, left me with VT and just had a hyster. This has helped with my mood swings, sleep, and hot flashes but not so much on the vaginal symptoms. I am hopeful though. Worth a try!

I had a blood test 1 month ago and have been verified that I am in menopause.  My Doctor put me on Prempro 1 month ago.  After the first 3 days of taking Prempro my irritability and HOT FLASHES are gone.  I would suffer terribly at work and at night.   However, I just came from an ultrasound after experiencing severe bloat and pain in my abdomen for 10 days.  They checked my liver, gallbladder, kidney and pancreas.  I have been experiencing 4 days of constipation and after taking 2 doses of myrolax a day on top of upping my Prilosec 2 times a day, I am still having extreme abdomen and esophogus issues.  I was put on an anti-spasm medication which doesn't seem to be helping.  I have been experiencing left sided chest, arm and leg pain.  I have been on weight watchers and exercise vigorously only to gain more weight.  I look, yes, 8 months pregnant and have gone from a size 10 to size 16 in about 1 month.  Yes, the sweats are gone but sleeping is an issue.  I have developed migraines everyday, all day.  Haven't had them in 4 years. I also started bleeding after 1 year of not having my period. My eyes are blurry and watery.   At this point, I feel extremely sick to my stomach and getting off this pill. Going to try Dr. Oz' menopausal smoothie and going to the Herbal Emporium for a natural remedy. There has to be a better way!!!  Thanks for all of your comments lady, you've help me tremendously in making up my mind.  I'll keep you posted as to the difference of being off this pill.  Good luck.

Doctor could not explain reason for migraines.  Then started having mini-strokes.  Stopped Prempro and immediately stopped having optical migraines and strokes.  Hot flashes returned, however.

I have a VSG and I eat super healthy and exercise regularly--as in 4 mile runs, three times a week.  Breast swelling, nipple sensitivity, extreme mood swings, tightness in fingers, hands and face.  I HATE this medication and told my caretaker via email tonight that I'm done. I'd rather have the hot flashes.

My quality of life drastically improved after I started taking it 3 years ago. I couldn't sleep due to drenching night sweats and my mood was beyond irritable--my husband had to explain to my 10 year old what menopause did to women. I had no side effects and since I was sleeping and feeling more positive I've been able to stay on my exercise regimen, add new physical activities, lose 15 lbs. and continue to work full time and raise 2 kids. I'm not ready to old yet at 54 and my sex life has been amazing!

The hot flashes and anxiety came back with a vengence so after 3 months off, I went back on and all symptoms are gone.  I wish I could take a safer drug but had no luck with the natural remedies recommended by doctors.  I hope I don't have to take Prempro long because it worries me still but gee, what a relief to be able to function again.

I started prempro four weeks ago.  It took a total of 4 or 5 days until I started feeling relief.  This drug has been a true blessing for me.  The first time I woke up with a full night of sleep...I couldn't believe it.  I've had a small bit of spotting but that's the only side effect I have.  I sure hope that doesn't change.

I was so skeptical in using this because I prefer 'natural' medicine over drugs, but the herbs and supplements were no longer helping. My familty docotor actually prescribed these. He suggested if I was leary about all the side-effects, I should continue with my routine check-ups (mammo, pap smear, blood work, etc.)which I do yearly to check for any abnormalitis.  He also told me, 'Why are you suffering and more than likely making other's suffer as well'.  He was right.  I have been taking this for 3 months and it has helped with my hot flashes tremendously and mood swings! Although vaginal dryness has never been an issue, my libido has been out the door for quite a while now.  (I feel sorry for my husband, but I'm still trying!) My ob/gyn has prescripbed Estratest and am going to start that after a week or so of being off of Prempro. I saw alot of reviews that this helped with hot flashes as well as libido. (I really need both!) Will see how it goes.  If I have any major side effects, I will not continue with it Estratest.

I feel &quot;normal&quot; when on it, when off I revert to having hot flashes, inability to sleep and terrible mood swings.  My doctor wants me to take an antidepressant after reading the side affects, I will stay with what I know my body responds positively to.  This has been a big help with libido, in case I did not mention that!

It was prescribed by my Dr. for severe HOT flashes and all the other complications of &quot;the change&quot;.  The HOT flashes were taking control of what little life I had.  Within a wk I had my first cycle in years. I have a yeast infection that won't go away, and as of the last two wks can't get out of bed due to fatigue, severe nausea AND stomach pain.  My throat has been raw for weeks, I have put on several pounds while dieting and now I have to look up this BRVO because my eyes have been bothering me as of late and I never made a connection to the prempro.  For those prempro helps, God bless you.  As for me, I stopped taking it after discussing symptoms with my pharmacist after missing a dose and feeling better.  I have an apptmnt with my doctor this week to do some damage control.

After 5 different dr. visits (they treated me with antibiotic drops and steroid drops), I read a previous review that said the prempro gave her BRVO in her eyes.  I stopped taking the drug and the eyes started clearing up immediately.  I suffered with my eyes for 3 months before i finally figured out the prolem.  Ladies, your eyes are at risk.

I am 52 and haven't had a cycle in 2 years.  The hot flashes have recently picked up to where I couldn't work comfortably.  My doctor recommended Prempro .45 and I started to feel relief right after I started the medication.  I have been on Prempro for 6 weeks now and have started spotting with a few indications of a possible period coming on..?  I am not so excited about this aspect and have a call in to my doctor to check and see how long to expect this side effect to last.  I am not encouraged by the other reviews I have read in regard to this particular side effect.

I thought I was going crazy because people said I was to young for this!  But the blood work showed different.  My biggest problem was hot flahes and vaginal inflammation and dryness.  I wasted so much time suffering with these symptons.  I have been on Prempro for 4 months and it has changed everything.  I do not have any side effects as of yet, I was worried about weight gain but except for your normal over the winter blues pounds I have not put any extra on.  Its really been a blessing for me!  ;)

My sleep did not improve, infact, it worsened - I probably would have been ok with the sleep thing till I was diagnosed with BRVO in my left eye due to the use of this drug...had to stop taking it...I kinda like seeing the world...Now I'm back to my old hot sweaty self..except my left eye still hasn't completely cleared up yet....

I was on the patch and it worked well but was advised to come off and everything was going well. I thought wow the war of female issues are finally coming to a close. Now, I can work on the weight, memory...some joint discomfortfinally life is good...until about 2 weeks ago. The HOT came back with a vengance. Evert bone in my body aches...So, I poped the pill thinking that this was simular to the patch before I read the reviews and the side effects are disturbing. Not sure if the effects outway the relief. I cannot image being on this for yrs....? When does it stop? I have hot hot flashes, night sweats, headaches, weight is off the chart and joint painyou would not believe... How can this be better? Looking for answers.

I've been on Prempro .3MG/1.5MG a day for 5 weeks now.  Hot flashes are just about gone, maybe one a day.  Sleeping is not too much better other than the night sweats are gone.  Mood is greatly impoved.  Acne is a bit increased.  Stomach is gassy and bloated more than usual, but I have a very sensitive stomach.  Eye twitches more than usual, from what I have read others have had this issue.  Going to cut back to one pill every other day and wean myself off. Don't want to be on this more than necessary.

Slight decrease in frequency of hot flashes but they seem more intense when they happen.  Headache since starting medication which IS relieved with Advil.  Going to keep taking it - hopeful!

My gyn and I decided to give it a try due to constant hot flashes, primarily. The first couple of weeks were fine.  Hot flashes completely went away.  In the past month, however, I have gained 5 pounds, have had stomach issues (bloating, gas, reflux)and dizziness that is uncomfortable and daily. My migraines have returned with a vengeance and I have had a full blown period twice this month. I came to this site to read about other's experiences and will be discontinuing the Prempro and calling my doctor.  I am considering trying Black Cohosh in small doses to see if that helps the hot flashes. I never was able to handle BCP, either, so I'm not terribly surprised that these hormones aren't agreeing with my body, either.
Vaginal Inflammation due to Loss of Hormone Stimulation	Lisa T., 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	2/4/2011 8:14:41 PM	I went on Prempro because of vaginal dryness &amp; irritation and lack of libido. I have had hot flashes and night sweats, but they weren't the most aggravating symptoms. I had only had a few days of &quot;light spotting&quot; over the last 6 months and my periods had pretty much stopped. Since I began taking Prempro a little over 3 weeks ago I really didn't notice any change in my sexual drive, but I'd only been on it a short while. However, during week 4, I started feeling nauseous and having headaches. Day 4 of week three I started having SEVERE menstral cramps and started flowing heavily. If this is what it takes to have more sex drive, I'll pass. 
Other	tisherself4, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/1/2011 10:31:46 AM	I am 48 years old and have suffered with hot flashes, night sweats, lack of sleep, low libido, moody etc for 4 and 1/2 years.  I tried everything including bioidentical htr .  my obgyn has been recommending prempro for some time so I gave in.  After 3 weeks no hot flashes, slept through the night and because of that more energy and can wear sweaters in the winter without feel embarrased from sweating.  I am now on my second month and the only downside right now is I have gotten my period twice.  only for 5 days each time and I hope it may subside and even if it doesn't I am staying on it.  My like has turned around.  I love sex again and my life.  That is all I can say about this product.  Thank you and I hope this helps someone else.

I'm currently on the lowest dosage.  I did feel a certain loss of that &quot;sense of well-being&quot; when I began taking the lower prescription, but I've adjusted and continue to remain very active.  I gained 5 lbs., but could use it anyway.  The benefits have certainly out-weighed the negative for me.

Other	srab44, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	10/14/2010 10:48:13 PM	I am 66 years old and have been on HT since I was 42. I started on Premarin and a few years ago on Prempro. I have tried several times to get off, but I feel so sick,hot flashes, night sweats, loss of sleep, itching of the scalp,hair loss. I had cortisone shots and surgery of right shoulder and it interacted with my Prempro big time.The only problem is the dosage.The smallest is not enough and .45 is too much so I have to cut it in halve. It takes at least 3 months to make you feel better,you will feel side effects,but they will go away. My advice is start small dosage and patience, lot of it.You don't need sleeping pills or antidepressant drugs. Also helps with alertness.I am very happy,I take one other prescription(Lisinopril)for Blood Pressure.

I wish that my doc had given me samples prior to my buying the meds--thank goodness I didn't get the 90 day mail order script as I am NOT taking them any more.  I slept better before taking Prempro.

Too it 14 years ago for 5 years prior to the WHI study then stopped.  Shifted to Lexipro antidepressant to help hot flashes and mood.  Lexipro is a terribly addictive drug and it took me 6 months to step down.  Hot flashes, loss of sleep returned with a vengence.  I had hoped that stopping the antidepressant  would rekindle my mojo and it didn't.  Saw my great diagnostician MD today and he put me back on Prempro.  I loved it then - I thought then it was an absolute miracle drug and am *so* looking forward to being back on it.  Today is Day ONE!  I'll keep you posted!

I hope that will help- I started this pill for the night sweats and the panic attacks, I have had 3 panic attacks since being on this! I will give this pill another week by taking half of it, if I have another panic attack though, I am throwing the medication in the trash!!

I was reluctantly prescribed this med by my primary Dr. with an explanation of the possible side effects.  He referred me to an OB-GYNE and she agreeded that there are possible serious involved with the drug, so I threw it in the trash can in her office.  However, my symptons have become unbearable so I went back to my Dr. and we decided I would take the Prempro for a short period of time with a followup office visit in 2 months.

Very satisfied - sleeping well, major reduction in quantity and severity of hot flashes, mood so much better.  I did gain weight soon after, but I attributed this to menapause - started weight watchers program and have lost 19.8 pounds in a little over 3 months.  Very happy person!

Was tested for menopause and was past it, I had gone off the BC pill 6 wks prior. about 1.5 (total of 2.5 mts off of BC pills) months later started having swelling, arthritis, carpal tunnel, went to neurologist told that swelling can cause carpal tunnel, went to an arthristis spec all test came back normal. He asked what was different and I told him that I went off of BC pills and symptoms started 10-12 wk later, was told that some people cannot be taken off of these, my Dr gave me prempro and within 2-3 wks symptoms were going away. I have been taking the lowest dose every other day only and it works I'm afraid to go off of this med but do not think that I can take it for life, I fell 80 yrs old without it.

I just started taking it yesterday, so in an effort to be fair, I put my stars in the middle. :) I finally went to my doctor after two months of feeling like I was losing my mind. I saw a list of &quot;34 signs of menopause&quot; and said 'Hey! I have 30 of these!' After reading these reviews I am a bit apprehensive - especially about the weight gain. Then I noticed the age of the women remarking on their weight gain and looking '5 months pregnant' and I don't think that has anything to do with the PremPro. I am 56 and the last 2 years or so I have been putting on weight, particularly in the middle. Good look, right? And if getting my period back is a trade off for getting my mind back, I can live with that. Anyway, I will post back in a month (or sooner!) with an update.

I would wake up in pools of sweat. My gynecologist suggested the lowest form of prempro and told me to give it a try. It has helped somewhat with the hot flashes and night sweats but it hasn't helped with other things such as libido or vaginal dryness. I started bleeding and cramping also with the drug. My doctor said this may happen but I haven't had a period since I was 45 which was a year ago. I'm thinking the symptoms outweigh the benefits. I also worry about blood clots and stroke. I am not a smoker nor do I have a family history of either disease but I do carry extra weight and this is definitely a risk factor. I have a call into my doctor for the bleeding; I will tell her I no longer want to take it since it only takes care of one of my symptoms which isn't worth the risks.

She said try it for two weeks and see if I want a script. Well, the first week- nothing. I almost gave up, then end of second week it worked like a charm. After one month I do not have any side effects, for which I am extremely grateful. I will reevaluate need with MD after 6 months but at this point I am 100% satisfied with prempro. I want an estrogen patch but I still have my uterus and MD says I have to take the combo therapy drug. See your MD for your options. But for me I am sticking with this little wonder drug. I have tried black cohosh, vitamin E, primrose oil, soy and so on and so on. Like the recommendations say, take the least effective dose for the a little while. That works for me.

Their credo: if it has anything to do with &quot;s-e-x&quot; work the story to death no matter how bogus it may be.  I've been on Prempro for years.  I'm told by several MDs that the reported side effects happen very early in the treatment, if at all.  The Australian study was flawed because 65% of subjects were heavy smokers, and over half were also morbidly obese.  Therefore, cardiac symptoms were in the cards for them.  Meanwhile, a good friend of mine lost part of her jawbone thanks to Fosamax.  Our bodies soon become immune to the &quot;imitation&quot; and health food store hormone substitutes.  So please let's not give up our only viable choice.

Took Prempro fora little over 2 months.  The first month the bloating and gas were horrible. Had a headache daily for 2 weeks. Felt like crying all the time. Started to gain weight.  The second month noticed a significant amount of scalp hair loss.  Stopped taking and went to doctor who said they had never heard of scalp loss as a side effect but I found it is listed as a rare side effect.  I am in a better mood and hoping the weight will go down again and the bloating is easing up.  My daughter is a resident and was upset when she found out my doctor had prescribed Prempro.  She said the bad far out reaches the good of this drug and she would never prescribe it herself to any patient

Have had facial flushing more and more, and TONS of memory challenges and aphasia. Very frustrating and is affecting my job performance, = not good. Asked my dr. about HRT for memory problems and flushing. I've been on .3/.15 for 3 days but noticed tension-type headache on 2nd day. I do take Dilantin 400mg/day for epilepsy also. Today had low level headache virtually all day. However, headache went away during step aerobics class!  I'll notify my doctor. I had planned to try HRT for one month but won't get that far if headache continues!

I have gained 15 lb, but eat less (some days feel like I'm going to throw up); have stomach bloating, the breast tenderness(which left after the 3rd week) has returned with a vengance; irritable with NO libido-unable to reach climax anymore; sinus congestion &amp; headaches (migraines are back also); dizziness/light headedness.Need I go on?I'd been blaming ALL but the breast tenderness on other things. I'd even started taking it every other day.On the off days, the tenderness was less severe.Then I would take it, &amp; it was severe again. It is NOT helping with the few symptoms that I started taking it for.

It completly eliminated all of them.  I did have bloating and gas pretty badly at first but that become less over time.  I used Gas X when it was uncomfortable.  The slight weight gain I experienced was probably due to my over eating so I won't blame it on the Prempo.  I decided to cut back on my dosage to see what would happen so I started cutting every other day's pill in half.  No changes.  After awhile I cut all the pill in half and still no hot flashes.  I continued this for another year until I decided to try it without any pills.  I quit in Feb. and was fine until June when the hot flashes slowly came back.  They got much worse recently so my doctor put me back on the same low dose Prempro.  I've been back on now for 5 days and the hot flashes are slowly going away again but I am experiencing bad bloating and gas again.  I had forgotten about that part of it!  Since I went off the Prempro in Feb. I had lost 15 lbs.  Hopefully there won't be any weight gain which I'll monitor very closly but the bloating makes me feel like I've gained even though it doesn't show on the scale.  I've also  had a slight upset stomach at times but that will soon pass too, as I remember.  I also noticed that my brain fog seemed to lift.  There was some hair loss at first but that too cleared up and it all grew back.  Hang in there and good luck!

Im 53 and have not had a normal period for some time.  My periods either skip a month or two or go on for a month.  I have been on Prempro for 2 &#189; months and the only thing that is gone is the night sweats.  I still get headaches, although they dont seem as strong.    I will give it six months before I decide if this is the right medication or not.  My body feels like it still wants to cycle and I get bloated and have a headache but it then goes away.  Im glad for the comments here as I was sure this might be the cure-all to my woes.  I may have to go another route after I give it six months.

Within days I felt terrible. Hot flashes and night sweats returned, I was nervous and irritable, retained water, blood pressure went up, constant spotting, felt premenstral all the time. After about two monthes of that I went back to cyclical HRT and felt MUCH better. It definately did not work for me. The inconveneince of having periods is minimal compared to the effects that Prempro caused for me.

I then weaned off it over a years time. My hot flashes and night sweats returned but my biggest concern is my osteoporosis. I am seeing an endocrinologist for it. Also, vaginal dryness and pain during intercourse increased. I used prempro vaginal cream and that helped, but with the osteopreosis, my gyn recommended going back on prempro. It will take some time to see if it is helping in that department but it definitely helps with the common symptoms. What I REALLY don't like is the weight gain, I have gained five pounds in two months, while I have been dieting! I also broke my arm so will have to see if increasing exercise will help offset that, but after reading many of the other reviews I have my doubts-I hate the bloated stomach!

I was like extreme PMS without having a period to relieve it. I hated it, discontinued it and went back to old HRT, soon felt 100% better. It is not good for everyone.

Never had a tummy! My bowels are irregular and I am very sensitive to spicy foods now. It has been a horrible experience. It's not worth all the side effects.

Have beaten myself up about weight, walked, exercised, ate lots less and still only minimal loss... now I see that it's not just my habits, it could be the Prempro. May be looking to change even though it has helped menopausal symptoms like flashes... I hate the bloated, sore boobs symptoms, not to mention the extra weight - about 10 extra pounds.

It has alleviated most of my extreme insomnia and hot flashes, but at a cost.  I have gained some weight, but mostly my breasts are very swollen and very tender, and my abdomen is also swollen so that I look slightly pregnant.  These symptoms have increased over the one year time, and the swelling is very noticeable. I talked with my doctor just yesterday and he scoffed at my symptoms and hinted that I was not getting enough exercise.  However, I also feel much better with my arthritis symptoms receding, I am not so achy, and general well being is better.  Of course, getting sleep for the first time in 5 years would also help one to feel better. In summary, it has greatly helped me, but at a cost and I have to weigh the benefits vs. the side effects.  Not getting enough sleep is so detrimental to overall health.

The sleep disruption and flashes have become unbearable. Went to a new OBGYN, put on Prempro again at the next level dose, daytime has improved, but night time not much improvement, but what an increase in weight and still climbing at least 25 pounds, stomach bloat and the breast swelling &amp; tenderness (yes C to D approaching DD). At only 50% improvement, and unhealthy weight I seem unable to lose -- thinking of going cold turkey again! Is there any hope, or is this what the rest of my life will be

I WOULD RATHER HAVE HOT FLASHES THEN TO BE OVERWEIGHT AND OUT OF BREATH. AND WHO WANTS TO BUY ALL NEW CLOTHES, IT'S ALSO EMBARRASSING WHEN THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW LOOK AT YOU AND COMMENT ON YOUR WEIGHT GAIN, THERE HAS TO BE SOME ELSE ANOTHER WAY TO DEAL WITH MENOPAUSE

Wound up with estrogen-receptive breast cancer (have spent one really bad year with all the associated treatment) and, of course, had to discontinue use.  And now we have evidence from studies showing increased risk.  But those 8 years were nothing short of miraculous, and if I could go back, I would not change anything but the dose.  Prempro stopped my hot flashes, gave me great energy and memory and muscle strength, stopped bone deterioration, elevated mood, and increased libido astronomically.  So net-net, it improved my life greatly. But it's best to be on the lower dose, and dont count on staying on it as long as I did.

My Doctor thought it would be better for my health to go off of this medication I tried oh how I tried...Over the counter stuff, Sarafem and I still had hot flashes and horrible night sweats.  I asked my md to please let me go back on the prempro and he did, he but me on the lowest dose and  I've been hot flash and night sweat free ever since.  There is such a thing as quailty of life.

I just lost 20 lbs and am hoping that it all doesn't come back.  I have been without my period for a year. That came back too.  The hot flashes have gone away, and I sleep better.  But don't know if I will continue if the weight keeps coming.

I completed the 2nd month and did not re-order. I still have a couple of pounds to loose and the insomnia but will get that fixed.  Hot flashes have stopped and vaginal dryness will use OTC products. Loss of libido still working on.  HTT not worth it to me or maybe this was wrong one for me I don't know.

After only a few days hot flashes ceased and sleep improved, However after not having periods for 18 months I began continous spotting and very sore boobs. Time will tell if I remain on Prempro or decide to go solo.
