I have noticed it seems to have increased my appetite a bit also. I am taking this medication because my GI doctor says I have bile in the stomach although my liver and pancreas is ok and also because she thinks it could be my gallbladder. I am giving it a chance.

After 3-4 months I began having moderate itching. No rashes, just itching. The doctor lessened the dosage but I couldn't stand it anymore. I notified the doctor and took myself off of it. I was saddened because the drug was working...

Have been on it since it first came out -?mid 90s. My mother who also has this did not do as well as I but was never given this drug as she had a transplant about the time it was discovered. Expensive but worth every penny!!

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	25-34	5/23/2009 2:08:22 PM	I have chrrosis of the liver from fatty liver disease. Found out a few yrs ago after so much testing for fatigue. My gallbladder does not work at all but Dr's dont want to remove it for fear of bleeding out and making my condition worse. I just started this medication a few months ago and have found it a little hard to take 3 times a day but find that at least once a day has kept me out of the hospital for the last 3 months-was going about every 2 months for an average 6 days. So, Im not going to complain about it at all. It must be working somehow.

I'd like to find a good generic that works as well.

Other	dannyrgeorge, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	45-54	10/16/2008 4:53:09 PM	I have been diagnosed with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver disease. I had been advised of this condition years ago but all the doctors I ever saw never gave it much thought. I have high blood lipids and high triglycerides. I am not significantly overweight and do not drink nor smoke. I have for years expierienced abdominal pain episodes which doctors from some of the leading teaching institutions have not been able to diagnose correctly. I have had this condition for neary 15 years. The pain at times is unbearible, pain meds give some relief. Doctors at the Mayo Clinic in AZ believe my condition is due to the fatty liver. The liver itself has no nerves in it but the sac surrounding the liver is extremely sensitive and when inflammed can cause radiating abdominal pain and into the back. I have been on crestor and tricor for some time and now I am on the Urosodiol 1x3 300mg. I also was told to take Vitamin E daily with the Urosodiol. I am now starting to adjust to this med, side effects I have are slight headache,fatigue, sweating and metalic taste with drop in appetite.

I'll just say that I tolerate the drug well, and that it has helped keep my liver functions down.  It is a bit of a pain to take six pills a day, but I'm on other things, too, so that's not a huge deal.
Gallstones	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	19-24	6/6/2008 4:45:15 PM	I have to take 4 pills every day, 2 pills 2 times a day.  It makes things very inconvenient, but it has prevented me from having surgery so far.  I was placed on blood thinners at the same time, so there are no major reactions with that as far as I know. Sometimes my stools are too soft and it reacts that way when I eat fatty foods.  The drug is normally VERY expensive (about $300/month for my dose).  My experience has been okay overall.
