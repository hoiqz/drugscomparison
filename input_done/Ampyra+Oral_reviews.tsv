My side effects stop after the first week, but I find this med seems to work for me some days and other days it doesn't. When it does work I do walk much better, and faster.

I do not use my cane a much and can now climb stairs without help. I have not had any side effects.  It has brought back walking distance without assistance.
Multiple Sclerosis	Mom, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	6/15/2012 12:11:34 PM	I was diagnosed in 1995 and I am doing very well as to moving around, my significant complaint is nerve pain and weakness in my back and legs. My former Neurologist is a leader in his field. He said there are two types of people in relapsing and remitting MS, those with pain and those without. The without patient usually has more physical disability whereas the patient who has pain has less physical disability, but more increasing pain, I am one of those people.My current Neurologist wanted me to take Ampyra to improve my walking, since my gait was starting to worsen. I took one pill of Ampya, I started dropping both my feet, couldn't stand, and I was in worsening pain. I take a lot of medication for my nerve pain and it was manageable, but it seems that the Ampyra counteracted those drugs and increased my pain by 100%, it was a terrible drug for me. I would not take it again. I and my Neurologist both feel that because Ampyra opens the nerve path ways it is not a good drug for people with nerve pain. 
Multiple Sclerosis	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/16/2012 1:29:19 PM	Before taking ampyra, I couldn't walk without using a cane or walker.  I also had a problem with fatigue.  I had an opportunity to do a clinical trial and in the beginning doing a 6-minute walk I had walkeed 530 feet.  Two weeks later doing a 6-muinute walk I did 750 feet.  I FEEL SO MUCH FREER NOW AND I LOVE IT.
Multiple Sclerosis	Fuso, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	4/9/2012 10:46:13 PM	About a year ago I was feeling great about how I was handling my MS. I had lost some functions over the previous 7 years since onset, such as the ability to run, but I was still able to bike and hike long distances and on steep climbs. At my neurologist's prompting, I started taking Ampyra, thinking I could only get better. At first, it seemed to help slightly with my gait, but it also brought on more tingling and spasticity and even seemed to make me more wobbly. My neurologist said that the sensations were probably part of the healing process, so I stuck with it for three months. During that time the symptoms continued, and then I got the warned-about side-effecta urinary tract infection. I stopped taking Ampyra. Since then, I've been on a very gradual decline with increased spasticity, fatigue, tingling, patches of numbness, another UTIand yet my MRI's have shown no new lesions. I have a different neurologist now, who has no explanation for why I'm feeling significantly worse.  I can't say with 100% certainty that Ampyra brought about my decline, but it seems to have played a part. I've read posts about Ampyra on many forums, and it appears to have very inconsistent effects on people. According to studies, only about 30% of the people who take it see an improvement in their physical functions. So be aware that if you give Ampyra a try, you may be taking a gamble with lasting effects. 
Multiple Sclerosis	Jim S, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	55-64	3/22/2012 2:01:18 PM	Been on this drug for about a year and can't see any improvement of MS symptoms.  I have experienced few, if any, side-effects...maybe some dizziness.  Am only staying with it for now because there is nothing else and it may be having some minor benefit that I'm not detecting.

My balance is much worse and I have taken many more falls.  
Multiple Sclerosis	laurac78, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	1/17/2012 7:18:42 PM	I have actually only been taking this for 1 week. From the first pill it has helped. I had pretty bad foot drop and if you asked me to lift my leg, it would only raise 1 1/2 to 3 inches off the ground. Now I can bring it up to about my chest. My food drop is basically gone. Normally when I go to a store w/o a shopping cart, I use a cane, but I didn't need it after being on Ampyra for only 2 days. I would have to say that my worst day so far on Ampyra with walking would compare to one of my better days when I didn't take it. For the first day and a half, I had pretty bad dizziness and slight nausea but it has disappeard since then...I do have a bit of insomnia, but I've only been taking this a week, so I hope it will go away. I do need some PT for my left knee, but that wasn't doing too good before I was dxd w/ms and started having leg problems and is now worse from lack of exercise, so I am hoping that will help with the locking and buckling of my knee. *fingers crossed* that this little pill keeps working! It has given me a bit of self-confidence back already.
Multiple Sclerosis	vallo1, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	4	Male	45-54	1/2/2012 9:08:10 PM	This is my second (or third) post to this site.  I've been on Ampyra since July 2010.  After a few months it helped me get around easier.  A while after that, I started going downhill.  I suggested to my neuro that I stop the drug for a week or two and then re-start.  My doctor told me not to stop all at once, but to take one pill a day for a week then stop.  After my 4th day of taking 1 pill a day I started feeling terribly weak and went back to two pills.  The problem is that the underlieing MS was getting worse - remember that Ampyra is NOT a disease modifier.  Otherwise, I'm sleeping fine (most nights) and have suffered no ill effects from the medication.  So, until something else comes around, Ampyra is my &quot;drug of choice&quot;.
Multiple Sclerosis	diane C, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	11/20/2011 7:00:30 PM	It did nothing to help my walking and caused nausea. I stopped it. I took it about 3 weeks.the occasional vomiting and constipation was enough to make me give up.
Multiple Sclerosis	Dalsnan, 75 or over on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5			10/29/2011 8:53:40 PM	I am a late diagnosis as so many were. I was having occasional falls without much injury until I took a bad fall (right leg didn't step up when it needed to) and was injured rather painfully. My MS nurse practioner told me about Ampyra and gave me a walking test and started me on PT until I could get the drug. The PT is so important--I was tested in many things and she made up a program to help me with leg strength and balance. After about a month of taking she retested me and there was a big difference. I continued the Pt until I was able to walh uphill and down without help. I feel strongly that the drug should be given with the PT. I didn't read all the reviews but it seemed to me that the men had worse experience than the women. It has been a miracle for me.
Multiple Sclerosis	qtbunny, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	10/4/2011 4:03:03 PM	I don't know what this medication is supposed to do for me but I have the complete opposite effect of what it says you can have.  I have no constipation!! I sleep great!! and I don't know if this is what it's supposed to do to you.

Started Amp. in 2010 for 3 months &amp; it did nothing. Decided to give it another chance. Dumb ME! Have taken Amp. for the 3rd mo. now and as I type this, just decided NO MORE. For me it has been terrible, those who it works on,,,congrats! Symptoms are shocking sensations,all over, but a lot in my legs and feet. My feet, toes, and legs seem to be on fire! RED and swollen and BAD! Weaker body functions.Eyesight blurring, I felt better before this. My Neuro Doc said absolutely nothing about side effects. I'm going to fire my &quot;so-called nureo doc today. Since taking amp I have also developed a &quot;filmy&quot; sensation in my mouth &amp; on my teeth.SICK! FYI, I was also diagnosed with Pulmonary Fibrosis. Since the amp. it has gotten worse also. Keep fighting peeps, one day at a time!
Multiple Sclerosis	grandpa ron, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	65-74	9/6/2011 3:02:51 PM	Diagnosed with MS in 2007 but probably had it for 20 yrs. Started draging right foot, memory problems, fatigue, falling. Started Ampyra July 2011 and had no improvement. Legs got worse, back pain, stumbling worse, felt like my legs were on fire, memory worse. I saw my Dr. and we decided this wasn't for me. After I got off I felt better and luckily got back to where I was. Sorry Ampyra makers, this is a bust. Glad to read this works for some but it doesn't look like a halleluia type drug to me. Good luck everybody!
Multiple Sclerosis	BugBrown, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	45-54	8/18/2011 7:32:10 PM	I've been taking Ampyra for 4 weeks now. I've had every side effect except seizure. So far I've noticed some improvement walking, but the headaches, insomnia, tingling in both feet, hands, and face, skin hot to touch, and flu-like aches in my left leg and arm leave me wondering if it's worth it.Since I'm just one month into it, I'm leaning toward giving it another month (or two) to see if the side effects subside.

Multiple Sclerosis	Karen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/1/2011 6:47:37 PM	It has helped my walking very much,do not use my cane half as much as I did before Ampyra.

It took six weeks to start working. Sore throat three weeks. Then insomnia. I switched to one pill a day in the morning. Then lower back pain. It went away after three weeks. Now skin problems, maybe due to hot summer? But I'm sticking with it. We have nothing else.

Had to rely on a cane and person to stay steady.   Stairs were taken verry carefully.  Three weeks into Ampyra I noticed the stairs were easier to take (my foot didn't drag on the step behind me).  I also noticed my footing became more confident.  Yes, I notice my balance seems to be a bit more wobbly, but with the Ampyra I can usually move my feet in time to catch myself!  My balance issue is the most noticable side effect but it was an issue before I started taking the drug.  I will admit I have a fear of the siezure side effect (even with no history) but I am more curious about the affect on the kidneys.  Anyone have problems with kidney stones?
Multiple Sclerosis	KJ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	3	1	Female	35-44	5/25/2011 7:37:12 AM	After 2 weeks was only taking one a day, balance worse, optic neuritis came back after 3 years,insomnia, back pain,insomnia and in the bathroom alot. My Dr. stated work thru the side effects, not sure i want to do that. Having MS since the age of 28 and now over 40, I work thru enough :)
Multiple Sclerosis	lm, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	5/11/2011 7:11:05 PM	Amp was prescribed for me last summer to help with walking.  I was mostly chair bound due to legs giving out on me suddenly (&quot;fatigue&quot;).  I can now walk around the house and sometimes outside and my vision improved dramatically (which I don't believe is an expected effect.  I have been warned to never take the two doses close together because of risk of seizure so i have at times missed a dose (unsure if I took it at the time).  Life is slow and discouraging without it.  I do get sick of having to answer all the questions every month instead of just talking to my doctor.
Multiple Sclerosis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/6/2011 2:15:37 PM	I've had MS for five years. Started taking Ampyra June 2010. Immediately felt relief from summer heat, and nagging fatigue. I haven't felt this strong since the MS started. Began PT this month to work on gait and build strength back up in legs.
Multiple Sclerosis	lisalu, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	5/3/2011 2:44:27 PM	I have had MS for 15 years and have mild spasticity so decided to take the drug for help with walking, it worked maybe a month and now a year later I am worse, falling, walking slower stopped taking it a few days ago I hope to regain the stamina I had before I started taking the drug 
Multiple Sclerosis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	4/26/2011 6:01:45 PM	I was diagnosed in 1988.  I took Ampyra for 4 weeks last August, stopped due to severe burning/pins &amp; needles in my legs and feet.  It did help my walking and stamina.  After I stopped, my walking was even worse than before.  I saw my neurologist last week &amp; decided to try it again - but I'm worried.  I'll take one/day, not 2.  I think a smaller-dose pill should be available for patients with tolerance issues.

We were so excited that something was FINALLY working on his spasticity in his legs. He had no problems at all until one night we were driving down the street and he had a grand mal seizure. He had never had anything like that and it was the scariest thing I've ever seen happen to someone. We were so disapointed because he is now off of it due to the seizure and is back to having horrible spasticity in his right leg. We are looking for something else to help. 
Multiple Sclerosis	Ezmerleda9, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	3/30/2011 1:58:48 PM	I have had MS for 19 years and I am only 36.  I heard about Ampyra from my Neurologist.  I was told that it is for walking/gait issues, but is being tested on other symptoms.  I have horrible issues with cognitive impairments and since starting the Ampyra, I notice a significant difference.  I can really tell when I miss a dose!!  Also, if your doctor tells you that it does NOT cause an exacerbation with your MS, they are wrong, it can happen and it did!  
Multiple Sclerosis	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	3/14/2011 4:30:33 PM	I have been taking ampyra for 6 weeks. So far I have not experienced any benefit.

I walk like a drunk sailor! I decided to try Ampyra on 3/1/2011. It's been only two days so far. I am taking my pills at 7 AM and 7 PM. No real side effects to report (except insomnia and constipation...which I already had so not sure it's the medicine). I really hope it works for me. I plan to give it a try for the 3 month recommended period. Will post again after 1 month.
Multiple Sclerosis	tshaffer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	2/25/2011 4:51:07 PM	This is a follow up to my previous post under tshaffer:  I was on my fifth night of the medication and had a seizure.  I'm disappointed because I just started to feel electrical sensations over 3/4 of my body,  so I do believe that this medication does work. I took the medication correctly and experienced the normal side effects at first. If it were not for the complications that I have - I would not stop taking it.  Please do not let my experience with the medication deter you from trying the drug.  Good luck to all!! 
Multiple Sclerosis	tshaffer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	3	Female	45-54	2/21/2011 2:24:31 PM	I received my prescription 3 months ago and due to fear of urinary infections I didn't start the drug until yesterday.  So far I have a bad headache and stomach problems.  I started with one tablet a day, but I am planning to increase it to two a day as prescribed.  I'm still nervous about using the drug because of the side effects, but after reading other reviews I decided to give it a try.  I have also had dizziness and neck pain but I am hoping that my symptoms will improve.  I would really like to be able to feel the 65% of my body that I haven't been able to feel for the last 11 years.  I'll keep you posted.
Multiple Sclerosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	2/3/2011 9:36:59 AM	I was placed on the drug Ampyra in the summer of 2010 to better my abilility to walk that had been hindered because of having Multiple Sclerosis. It did a fantastic job until the night of January 28, 2011. On that night I took a full blown seizure. Luckily my friend was there with me because otherwise I would have been by myself for an unknown length of time. I know that seizures are a severe side effect but just to warn others this was not a mild thing that you can bounce back from. I was hospitalized for 2 days for observation and am still feeling the residual effects like memory loss, mood swings and bouts with confusion. I would recomend this drug to anyone with MS that has expierenced problems walking but be forewarned of the mild to severe side effects that can result from being on this medication.
Multiple Sclerosis	David, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	2	Male	35-44	1/17/2011 11:36:31 PM	I have poster 2 other times on this drug.  I have been taking ampyra for 3 months, just started my fourth refill.  The beginning showed promising effects but since then I am doing the same as before I started.  I hear so much good from others that I wonder &quot;why not me&quot;.  I have had MS for almost 23 years so this is just another bump in the road for me.  Good luck to you all.
Multiple Sclerosis	denise520 , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	1/4/2011 12:44:32 PM	Dx's in 1999, terrible flare in 2007. Had to learn to walk again, spent a year in hospitals and rehabs.  Walking stiffly with a walker, can't climb stairs.   On Ampyra 3 weeks.  Great changes ... more energy, stronger legs, good balance, easier to &quot;walk&quot; with walker, going to start PT next week to try to get on cane.  My right knee is bending when walking for this first time in 3 years! My left leg has also improved noticeably.  I have regained some lateral movement in my right leg, as well, for the first time.  The side effects I had were nausea and a very bad headache, which disappeared within the first week.  I dose at 10 am and 10 pm.  I set a regular alarm reminder on my phone to keep me on schedule.My neuro warned me would be at least 2 - 6 weeks before any difference might be apparent, but I saw changes begin within the first 4 days. :)

I started the medication in late July and saw improvements relatively quickly.  I've been standing and transferring much easier. I've had no further improvements after the first few months of taking the medication, but am happy (overjoyed) with the improvements I've seen.  As far as side effects, I've had none - maybe a little insomnia, but I do sleep well most of the time.  I, like other patients, was a little nervous about seizures at first. Luckily, these haven't materialized.  I guess they're a bigger problem if you have kidney issues. Overall, I'm happy with Ampyra - it's made my life a bit easier.   
Multiple Sclerosis	nouna, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	12/17/2010 5:39:01 PM	I just received my perscription yesterday and hesitate to take my first dose after reading that Amphyra can cause seizures.  I'm alone 5.5 days a week and that would be disasterous,  I've read the reviews shown here; no one described seizures as a problem.  Has anyone experienced seizures, or is that rare?  I'm nervous, but my gate is so spastic, my balance waaaay off without canes, and my right foot drags a lot.  Guess I'd better give it a try.  Thank you all for being honest.  Will review again in a few weeks to let y'all know how I am tolerating the drug.
Multiple Sclerosis	OP,  Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male		12/15/2010 9:59:16 PM	I have been taking one pill a day four days with no side effects. Starting with the first dose my wife and I think that I am walking better and easier.  I feel more stable and am walking faster.  I rode 7 miles last night on my recumbant bike with no problem.  Feeling stronger.  I will try two doses when I can fit it in with my work schedule.
Multiple Sclerosis	slkings, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	12/6/2010 8:39:08 AM	I am still only taking one pill a day &amp; have been on it for almost 4wks. I was hesitant to take it because it has a form of bird poison in it, but Dr told me Cumadin (blood thinner med) has rat poison!  I guess that we have to choose the lesser of 2 evils. So I started taking it at 1st it seemed to be really helping, but now I am losing my balance a lot, I've had headaches &amp; neck pain - which I didn't relate to the Ampyra until I started reading some comments. (For those whove had similar affects what have you done to help that esp. the neck pain) I also have had fatigue which could be due to a different med &amp; depression (crying spells).  As I said at 1st my walking was improving now I am falling into things. I don't know if people can respond to this or not, if so I would appreciate any feedback.  I'm calling my Dr today but would be interested in others input. I am debating if I should stay on it or stop taking it? I've been stressed a lot lately and really would like to have some opinions. Iam also wondering if there is a natural supplement/herb that can work in the same way, wish insurance would cover that as much as all these drugs cost us! Well I hope and pray that a cure comes up for all of us and that would be the only gift Id ever need for this season. I know this isn't a Dr.'s response place or a medical opinion - I just like to have a MS patient's opinion and if they had the similar exper. and has it gotten better?   Merry Christmas &amp; God Bless Us All! Thank You, Sharon K.

I was nauseous the first two weeks but that has stopped.  I have seen a marked improvement in my walking.  My left leg would drag when I got tired which does not happen now.  I am keeping pace with my husband when walking and that has not happened for quite a while.  I think this med is working great for me.

I have an infant and have to walk up/down stairs to nursery all day long.  It was hard to climb stairs, but have noticed amazing improvements already!  A little dizziness, but well worth the improvements!  Can't wait to take baby for a walk... finally!

At first I expecyed more from the drug, now I'm happy to have more energy, stamina, and alertness.  Orriginally I didn't have much hope,  I'm glad I stuck with it, going on 7 months.
Multiple Sclerosis	Mizizzi, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	11/3/2010 9:45:57 PM	Ampyra for 7 weeks.  Headache always. Increased weakness then a MS attack.  Not my idea of improvement or a good time.

At the advice of my neurologist, I will only take 1 pill for 10 days, then advance to twice a day.  So far, I get the side effects of nausea,dizziness and mild headache; but I do notice more speed in walking
Multiple Sclerosis	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	35-44	10/25/2010 4:31:22 PM	I started taking Ampyra in May 2010.  I was hoping for some benefit from it.  I would get better results from a tic-tac mint.  I felt nothing from it.  Four other people from the Wellness Program class I attend, also had no reaction.  Sorry doctors, swing and a miss.
Multiple Sclerosis	CasinoKathy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/23/2010 3:30:05 AM	Have been on Ampyra since July 1 and had seen improvements right away. Weak leg has gotten stronger,can now tolerate warm showers.Last night about 10:10 I had been walking in the house with my cane, when all of a sudden my walking became easier and had more feeling in my feet.4 hours later I'm still going strong. Cannot not believe how good I am walking, don't know how long it will last, I might just stay up all night. Can't say enought good things about this pill.
Multiple Sclerosis	Dave, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	35-44	10/19/2010 12:15:58 AM	Today is my 5th day and my headache and neck ache have stopped as of last night. I have felt signs of tingling in legs disapearing but have not left completely.  At times i seem to stand-up easier and walk better but not all the time.  I will continue to take medication and hope that it will get better over time
Multiple Sclerosis	Bubba42, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3		35-44	10/18/2010 12:41:48 PM	I stopped taking Ampyra in August after developing rashes.  I am attempting to take again, hoping that the rash was from something else, or as my neuro stated, if it was the Ampyra that I reacted to, it is possible that I may not react in the same fashion again.
Multiple Sclerosis	dave, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	35-44	10/17/2010 12:11:12 AM	I have been taking ampyra for 3 days(5 doses), the first 2 days were fine, i noticed that certain movements were easier and my right foot was not as heavy.  On the 3rd day before i took my 5th dose I had a headache that lasted all day and was very strong and my neck ached severely.  I am hoping that side effects will subside soon.  I am tempted to stop but will give it time.

Multiple Sclerosis	fallapartman, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	9/3/2010 3:55:17 AM	I have been taking Ampyra (10mgx2/day) for 33 days. I saw results after Day 15 - was able to walk unassisted for the first time in eight years (walk without cane). Some balance problems persist, leg pain and cramps ... but the worst side effect I'm experiencing is indigestion -severe, excrutiatingly painful indigestion. Trying to deal with that aspect because I DO NOT want to stop taking this. 
Multiple Sclerosis	Killarney, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	9/1/2010 6:07:20 PM	 This is the start of five months for me and last night I went to the Yankee game. Leg power and walking was somewhat better however once fatigue set in the advances were slowed until some strengh came back. There were manystairs to climb but trying is everything as this new med is primarily for leg strength andwalking and anything else is a plus so continue stretching,yoga,aquatics etc..
Multiple Sclerosis	Tati, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	8/29/2010 8:56:09 PM	Not sure...taking Ampyra for2 months, have difficulty sleeping, at first I thouhgt it was helping a bit, now I am not sure...afraid to walk with my walker, feel like I am having a relaps, though i have MS for so long. I wish the pill was on the market earlier. Don't know what to do...
Multiple Sclerosis	killarney, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	4	Male	45-54	8/20/2010 3:56:30 PM	 I've been on ampyra for 4 months and after reading about spacisity in the MS FORUM MAG physical therapy,yoga and stetching is vital in my improvement whereby my flexibility canimprove and the new med will work. Give it achance to work.
Multiple Sclerosis	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	35-44	8/19/2010 5:08:58 PM	After 5 weeks, I developed skin rashes and it is likely I am allergic to Amypra.  I do think I had some good moments on the drug when walking seemed better.  I'm holding out hope that the allergic reaction was to something else, but I doubt it.I think I would like to try Ampyra again after the rash clears and hope for a different result.  Otherwise, just keep waiting for the next miracle drug.
Multiple Sclerosis	jr1909, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	8/18/2010 9:13:13 PM	I have been taking Ampyra twice a day for 3 weeks not.This is a miracle,walked almost normal.(Still have good days and bad,Think it is due to weather changes). Seem to have more energy and balance. A little trouble sleeping but is getting better. I'm starting to ride my exercise bike again hoping to increase ease of walking. can raise leg higher than i have for years.No tingling and decreased spasms. I've been diagnosed with MS for 11 years.

Multiple Sclerosis	Delighted, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/14/2010 11:20:24 AM	This is an update to my July 11, 2010, review. I've continued with Ampyra and have raised my &quot;Ease of Use&quot; rating to 5 stars - I purchased a watch with an alarm to remind me to take the second dosage of the day. My daily quality of life has improved drastically. I no longer even notice the transition from sitting to standing because it's no longer effortful. I no longer have the feeling of carrying around 100 pound sandbags on my legs. My legs don't wear out after the first 300 steps of the day. Yesterday, I spent a day with a friend for our annual vacation-in-town day - we went from museum to museum, at one point climbed 84 steps, got in and out of the car 10 times, all for what just six weeks ago would have been an impossible 8 1/2 hours of tourist activities. I haven't had any negative side effects. If you and your neurologist think you might be a candidate for this medication, don't wait to give it a try - life is waiting for you.
Multiple Sclerosis	CasinoKathy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	8/14/2010 10:48:53 AM	I have been on Ampyra for 6 weeks and noticed an improvement right away! Weak leg has less spasticity, moves easier when in bed or chair, less foot drop, overall has more strength. Balance has improved slightly, along way to go yet, but I am really impressed with the Miracle Drug! Off and on I am walking around the house without using my cane. I can really notice the difference when I do my leg exercises while standing on the treadmill. Can lift leg and foot higher and do more reps. YEA-HAH to Ampyra!!!
Multiple Sclerosis	Jean, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	8/13/2010 5:21:12 PM	This is August 13, 2010.  I started taking the generic Ampyra on August 8, 5 days ago.  I have had 2 experiences today.  1)  I used my left arm/hand to assist picking up my coffee cup in the am...which has been so weak-it wouldn't have happened, and nonchalantly surprised myself.  2) stood up by sink &amp; stayed erect (straighter) and longer than I had since 4 years ago.  I am looking forward to seeing more improvements.  Oh yeah, and I have more energy!!  But wonder about it being less hot &amp; humid today, regarding that energy.  I will be on this positive treatment...most definitely.  To have this hope that replaces depression is priceless!!!
Multiple Sclerosis	vallo1, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	8/13/2010 12:36:29 PM	I started taking Ampyra at the end of July and started seeing improvements in standing after a few days.  I didn't want to say they were improvements too soon, but after over two weeks on the medication the cause-and-effect is pretty evident.  I'm standing and transferring easier, I'm able to get in and out of the shower easier and (I'm happy to say) I don't have major problems getting my pants up when I use a restroom in town.I've had no real side-effects - maybe insomnia (isn't that why God invented Tylenol PM?)It's pretty easy to take - I'm on an 11am-11pm schedule.
Multiple Sclerosis	killarney, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	8/10/2010 7:15:41 PM	 Ive been on this medication for 3 and a half months and have a little more leg strength. The walking has improved slightly however with some spasticity ampyra may kick in when the stretching is done twice a day and the leg musles aren't as stiff.
Multiple Sclerosis	suzyQ1133, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	2	Female	45-54	8/9/2010 1:56:46 PM	I have been on this drug for six weeks and have seen NO improvement.  I have had greater pain and am wondering if I should continue.  Another let down.  What is the FDA doing?
Multiple Sclerosis	jtrac, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	8/8/2010 3:50:31 PM	I have been taking this Med for 3 months and my walking is getting worse. I workout 7x per week Before taking MedI had little trouble with my Gait( walking) now It does not matter how much I workout I can't seem to hold a good steady pace without falling over. I have had MS for 10 years eat right workout 7x a week now this. I feel that this med is not the Ans.Is anyone feel the same I have No other Reasorce.
Multiple Sclerosis	msteachk, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	35-44	8/7/2010 9:26:58 PM	I hsve been taking Ampyra for 2 weeks.  I can't believe how much it has helped.  I have much more stamina when walking.  I have also noticed that I have less spacisity (even though my NP told me that it would not help with that)  For the first time in years I was able the stand and fold laundry in the laundry room not sitting on the couch!  I hope that I continue to make gains.  I haven't seen much improvement with my foot drop(I will be trying the walkaide)  I also have a hard time remembering to take the afternoon dose because I do not take anything around that time but with the improvements that I have made I remember!
Other	ms2002live@gmail.com	1	1	1			7/26/2010 6:25:39 PM	please contact me to sell ampyra to me for a good price, I live in Europe and want to test it. ms2002live@gmail.com
Multiple Sclerosis	Sherry, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/30/2010 10:08:33 AM	I've hit the &quot;jackpot.&quot; My energy level has improved tremediously. I have been able to cook and clean, all in one day without taking naps in between. Not as much pain and my stability is also a plus. 
Multiple Sclerosis	Arisu, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	55-64	8/7/2010 11:27:25 AM	I get asked by prospective Ampyra patients if I experience insomnia.  I believe I have a deeper level of sleep and dreams that I have not experienced since a major exacerbation 8 years ago.  I have greater stamina.

My stamina has improved along with my speed going up stairs.  My husband noticed pretty quickly that I was standing up straighter.  I have been able to walk across open spaces completely unassisted.  I need to get over the fear of falling and do it more often.  Plus I need to retrain myself to walk straighter and more confidently.  I didn't even realize it but I was able to cook dinner last night without having to take breaks.  If it's working this well after less than a month, I can't wait to see what it does after an extended period of time.  Maybe I can get rid of the cane!!!!
Multiple Sclerosis	arisu, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	55-64	7/25/2010 8:21:04 PM	Almost 8 weeks.  Little improvements still continuing.  I have noticed that at the end of each dose that the effectiveness starts dropping off.  I am able to do stationery bike now.  Leg does not wobble. Can raise affected leg much higher.  Exercise is key.
Multiple Sclerosis	Bubba4242, 35-44 Male  (Patient) 	2	3	3	Male	35-44	7/23/2010 7:07:16 PM	Only 14 days into use of Ampyra, and have not seen a big diffence as of yet (as expected), but I have what I would call &quot;moments of brillance&quot; that the walking was much better.  Enough that others have commented on it.I have high hopes, and look forward to how I'm doing in 4 to 6 weeks.Good luck all.
Multiple Sclerosis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	45-54	7/22/2010 12:48:38 PM	What a God send! My right leg is able to go a lot longer,  I'm bending my knee now when I walk, and I don't feel as if I am dragging it.  I am able to do a lot more because my stamina is soooooo much better.  Everyday I feel little improvements.  Now I just have to practice walking normal.
Multiple Sclerosis	lisalou33, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	7/20/2010 9:10:13 PM	I have been on Ampyra for 3 wks, and can tell a huge improvement.  My left leg is not as numb as before, I hadn't felt my 3 middle toes for several years, now I can feel them no longer numb.  My legs are not so Heavy in the late afternoon, can even tell an improvement in my upper arm strength.  I would call this a miracle drug also!
Multiple Sclerosis	steve, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5		55-64	7/20/2010 1:54:34 PM	only taking ampyra for two weeks and already see an improvement in walking and rasing my leg
Multiple Sclerosis	jtrac, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	7/20/2010 12:10:37 PM	This is a update on my last post. I have been walking better but only when I use exercise as a combo. It took over a month to see any results. But I am seeing them.Anyone that thinks that this med. is going to allow you to walk as beforemust also try using streaching and if able to use a treadmill with handrails. I have a friend who also uses the med with 0 results. thanks to Clohe for the feed back last time It DID keep me on the med.I encourge feed back on anything that helps others. This is a life long battle any things helps.I would also like anyone to look for DR. Palo Zamboni and read his findings this is awsome and unbelivable Thanks Mark
Multiple Sclerosis	kkilpatrick, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	55-64	7/14/2010 9:52:13 AM	After 2 months no effect, and walking is worse.
Multiple Sclerosis	Arisu, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	55-64	7/14/2010 12:31:42 AM	Still improving after 8 weeks.  I recommend the medication is taken with food and lots of water if you have heartburn or any other stomach ailment.  I did not have any reaction from taking generic Zyrtec, tylenol.  I have noticed the effectiveness decreases near the end of twelve hours. I plan accordingly to maximize medication benefit. 
Multiple Sclerosis	threelabs, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	7/13/2010 4:28:26 PM	I havebeen taking Ampyra for almost 2 months. So far I see no difference at all. Still have major trouble walking and with balance.
Multiple Sclerosis	Delighted, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	7/11/2010 11:03:51 AM	It's day 11 for me. I began noticing subtle changes on day 2 and have had daily improvements in walking, strength, and balance. On day 3, close family and friends could notice the difference - straighter walking and less swaying. I'll give some examples of how Ampyra has affected my daily life. On day 4 I stood at the kitchen counter and stove preparing and cooking a meal for an hour without needing help or to sit and rest; prior to Ampyra, I prepped ingredients (chopping, peeling, etc.) while sitting at the kitchen table and my husband did the work at the stove. On day 6 I felt strong enough to return to some gentle exercising after not having the strength or energy to exercise for the past 18 months. On my weakest days, my husband needs to assist me to stand up from our too low &amp; too deep sofa; on day 7 I was able to stand up from the sofa on my own...not even needing to use my arms to push off. I have used a cane to to assist with weight bearing and balance for a year; on day 8 I felt strong enough to walk my dog around the block without the cane and haven't used it since. On day 9 I shopped at two different grocery stores instead of waiting in the car for my husband to do it. I've been surprised that my brain and muscles still know how to coordinate and execute all the movements for walking and balance. They say you never forget how to ride a bike - that's next for me! 
Multiple Sclerosis	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	45-54	7/10/2010 6:52:45 PM	I have been taking it for 6 weeks. Dont like the 12 hour interval, other meds are once or 3 times/day. Had knee to foot tingle for about 4 weeks. No change in hip flexor weekness. Still drag foot. Stamina has not changed. Spasticity has not changed. No problem sleeping. Considering giving it 90 days, if I cant identify noticable improvement going to stop taking it. Will be looking for a change when I dont use it.
Multiple Sclerosis	chloe, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/5/2010 8:23:37 PM	On another MS website (Patients Like Me) I have seen another person who had results at 3 months!  So it's worth it to keep on with the Ampyra..........
Multiple Sclerosis	jtrac, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	45-54	7/5/2010 9:26:32 AM	I have been on med for 4 wks and I have yet to see anything that working out and streaching as not already have had the same results. I don't feel that It has had any effect on my daily life.I don't know If there is a Sat. leavel that must be met or It does not work for me. If anyone could fill me in on the length of time it takes to see results It would be very helpful. Thankyou
Multiple Sclerosis	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	7/2/2010 9:10:18 PM	eye sight is a little better. walking is a little better. not as tired. lifting my leg better. not 100% yet, but only been 2 weeks!   
Multiple Sclerosis	maggiemae, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	6/29/2010 3:06:10 PM	I've been taking Ampyra for 3 weeks now without any major side effects.  I'm walking better than I have for the past 15 years.  For me, it's truly a &quot;miracle&quot; drug.  A word of caution-Ampyra tablets look very similar to Nuvigil tablets.  Hope everyone could have similar results-true improvement in quality of life!
Multiple Sclerosis	Arisu, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	55-64	6/26/2010 12:05:45 AM	I knew the medication was working the first day.  My hip joint was able to move up a bit after I had dragged my leg for two years. I am able to walk quite a bit faster and others have noticed. I haven't experienced bad side effects, however, I think the side effect about falling is due to the increased ability but since atrophy has been an issue for me--my limbs were not strong enough to walk faster so I fell.  I think once I start strength training falling should be less of a problem.  Because I had a positive experience the first few days, my legs had pretty strong cramping.  I eased the walking a bit and didn't have anymore cramping.  My walking improved every day.   
Multiple Sclerosis	jjdms5, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	45-54	6/17/2010 7:16:45 PM	I am definitely walking more quickly and smoothly!  I still have my bad days (balance issues/unsteadiness) but I'm noticeably walking better.  The big pills are difficult to swallow.  
Multiple Sclerosis	Scootergal, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	6/17/2010 3:05:57 PM	This my third wk on Ampyra. Side effects so far are weakness,tingling in feet (only lasted 2 days), balance issues, and had severe nausea on 1st day only.  My walking seemed to improve somewhat but could have been cooler weather. Walking has been harder lately could be due to extreme temps. Research I have done says you have to be on it for 3 mths to see improvement.  Not giving up on it yet, will review again in Aug.
Multiple Sclerosis	Vicki, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	6/14/2010 7:20:56 PM	Since I began taking this medication( 3rd week) I have tingling in my hands and feet (did not have prior to use) My balance improves some.  I'm wondering if the strength is too strong? Discussed with my pharmacist and she encouraged me to continue for 30 days. Then consult my doctor if symptoms do not subside.
