High Blood Pressure	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	5/3/2012 6:56:59 PM	I was prescribed Benazapril and the side effects were horrible.  One minute I was dizzy, then I felt like fainting, couldn't drive, hardly could walk.  Then I got all kinds of body rashes all over and was so tired I could sleep forever.  Will never take this medication again.
High Blood Pressure	lacfirst, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	3/9/2012 5:00:52 PM	Have been on generic for almost 7 years, after trying two others that were awful. This one has some side effects but nothing I cannot live with. The throat tickling in the am when taking I guess I have gotten used to, a few other minor things but nothing to stop using it. I did have to increase from 20 mgs once a day to twice a day less than two years ago. Dr thinks it might be because of alot of pre-menapausal issues I have though. Very inexpensive as generic too.

High Blood Pressure	75 or over Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		1/10/2011 3:00:56 PM	I have experienced several episodes of extreme swelling of the lips; my sinus doctor/surgeon, of Beckley, WV suggests that it could be the Lotensin I take for BP; am dealing with such today, keeping area moist with Aquaphor* lip repair and will take some benadryl recommended by local doctor. Any similar reports? 
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	7/16/2010 6:46:14 PM	I am on the Benezepril/HCTZ 10/12.5  My blood pressure is running good. My only complaint after taking this a number of years is that on certain days I am feeling like I have to urinate 10 mins. after I have already gone. Some days are worse than others. I am almost afraid to take one when having to take any type of road trip. It gets uncomfortable when you feel like you have to go all of the time. It's almost like having a bladder infection.
