Since he came home his legs and body &quot;JERK&quot; out of bed. When he was abouty to be discharged the doctor told me that &quot;his&quot; lawyers had told him that he could only pratice in the hospital but not out. Strange thing to tell a patient don't you think? My husband has bipolar1,2,3. He is not being being treated for schizphrenia.  what do you think?

I have only been on it for about 2.5 weeks but so far, the only side effect is some muscle weakness. I don't take it with a large meal but on an empty stomach in the A.M. So far no nausea nor other intestinal issues. Others have noticed a huge change in my moods. I hope it continues to work. I take 80 mgs and so far, after going off Seroquel, I have lost 13 pounds. Hope that continues.

Had to stop owing to tardive dyskenesia side effect.  Have continued with Wellbutrin 300xl. Latuda: began with 20mg--no effect; at 40mg, the benefits, after a little over a month, have been amazing and life-saving.  I am thinking about upping dosage to 60mg but am very ok with 40.  Virtually no side-effects.

I am 51 and have been on psych drugs since I was 23 and have been bipolar and have ptsd and general anxiety disorder and have been on ALL the PSYCH drugs I think ever invented. I have NEVER been able to take an antipsychotic that works this well AND with NO BAD SIDE EFFECTS so far. (been on it 2 months!) I have NOT GAINED ANY WEIGHT AT ALL - HUGE PLUS!!!! I had never heard of Latuda before the day I started it and I missed a few doses on my second month and was an instant basket case and after a double dose (approved by my DR) to get my blood level built back up, I was a completely different person and nice again! I was having bad anger rages before this and they just STOPPED immediately! I am SO much happier and so THANKFUL for this med and I WOULD SUGGEST giving it a try.  My life has had such a turnaround and I attribute it to LATUDA!! I have had some muscle problems while on it but I had them before but seems like they got a bit worse, but not so bad that I would consider stopping it. I give it an 11 out of 10!! From a HAPPY customer!
Schizophrenia	theguy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	25-34	7/21/2012 2:57:00 PM	Has caused weight gain which is not bad. What side effect I do not like is the bloating everyday. Medicine cause bloating and constipation. It works for voices , just do not like the side effects. Have gained over 20 pounds in two months.Side effects has not gone away in three months of taking it. Taking 40mg each day
Schizophrenia	Colorado B, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	7/18/2012 7:46:05 PM	I started taking Latuda after being diagnosed with Bipolar I/Schizophrenia.  Beforehand, I had tried Risperdal, which made me very emotional (and gave me stomach fat) and Seroquel which made me a zombie.  Latuda has worked amazingly on my conditions, although it took 6-8 weeks to fully suppress my abnormal thoughts and feelings (even though it took only 2 weeks to begin combatting my concomitant sleep maintenance insomnia).  My only concern is that I've been taking it with Lamictal and, after 3.5 months, my liver diagnostics look badly off the charts.  I am tapering off the Lamictal to see if Latuda alone does not cause this.  Wish me luck.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	7/11/2012 3:29:32 AM	It was great except for the side effects--stiff painful muscles, nervousness and hives. Took muscle relaxant for musle pain but had to stop taking it due to hives. Nervousness usually occurred during 1st couple of hours after taking medication then it dissipatate. Took it in the AM when took in PM nervousnee was too much and it made me restless and unable to sleep. Worked when took in AM gave me energy

I take it with lunch since that's my bigger meal and I'm not a big dinner eater. This med only made me sleepy this first day. I still have my big personality while on it and no side effects. Its even helping me lose the last 10 pounds of all the weight I gained on other meds. I also take Lithium. These are the only meds I have liked and help with my mania. I give it a 10!
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	5/19/2012 9:55:55 PM	I hate that I have to eat 350 calories with it. What's the point of having a med that's weight neutral if it forces you to eat an extra meal's worth with it? It gives me slight, not bad but slight, akathisia and drowsiness, so I can't take it at dinner, so it forces me to take it with more food before bed. However, I love that it has only made me a little flat, not extra hungry, and  not as much akathisia. It's a good drug, just annoying I have to take it with food and like any antipsychotic, I do have some muscular and inner discomfort
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	5/12/2012 10:55:27 PM	I have been taking this med for about a month. I have more energy and I can think more clearly! The only problem I have with it is eating before taking the med. YOU HAVE TO EAT AT LEAST 350 CALORIES BEFORE TAKING THE MED!!! If you don't you get sick!! I have to take it before I sleep and I really do not want to eat before I sleep, but that is the only problem I have with it. I take it for bi-polar 2

It helped me get to sleep (usually) but did nothing for keeping me asleep so I continued to wake 5-7x/night. It does nothing for my anxiety. However I would say it did have some antidepressant properties b/c I became very depressed off of it. Main side effects that developed was an unpleasant twitching of my scalp and nose (and sometimes a few fingers) at night or in the morning. Also, b/c it needs to be taken with 350+ calories I gained about 13 pounds from the extra meal at night. It didn't leave me feeling hungover like the small dose of Seroquel I used to take though. Still, I am experimenting with my Dr for new (and hopefully better) options.

After just a couple days on Latuda, I felt sooo much better (calmer, more peaceful).  Now that Ive been on it 3 months, I have lost 25#, been able to control food cravings better, and all-in-all feel MUCH improved in overall mood.  I take this plus Effexor XR, which Ive been on for 4 years.  Also, Id like to add that so far, I have had NO negative side-effects with the Latuda.  My Dr put me on it to help with the depression I was still experiencing with Effexor XR alone; it is WAYYYY better now. I recommend it to anyone whose doctor recommends it to them.

It's a 'done'.  Ilperidone, risperdone were my worst drugs.  My best drug was Loxipine, so similarly my other two best drugs should be asenepine and clozapine.  but, they already messed up clozapine because I'm stuck on the sleep aid temazepam, and can't take the two together.  Be careful what drugs they are putting you on in the hospital.  Educate yourselves on drugs.com about the interactions and such...

I kept taking the medicine hoping the side effects would lessen but they continued to escalate.  I finally stopped and have not ran any fever or had any of the other effects since stopping.

My doctor explained this med is similar to Abilify which scares beyond words. I took Abilify for approx. 3 months and had serious side-effects. I had to be hospitalized for those side-effects. I am afraid to take this new med but I am also tired of constantly feeling like life is passing me by. I am losing life. I no longer know what happiness is. I don't want to jeopardize my life trying new meds but I need something to work. Hopefully this, Latuda, is the one that will give me my life back, with God's help of course.

I have a Bipolar disorder, as well as anxiety, and a panic disorder, and arthritis. This medication has helped me emotionally so I am now able to live and not let things bother me. My moods are controlled and i am actually very calm. My life has changed for the better within only two months. This medicine latuda has in a sense saved me. I have been on various medications for moods and depression over the last seven years and was about to give up on medications all together. I haven't had any weight gain thus far i am actually losing weight. This medication has helped me overall mentally and helped me physically. I put the trust in my Doctor when he suggested this medicine and I am glad i stuck with the medicine latuda.

After one day and uncontrollable body movements and a psychotic episode, I was never going to take it again. NOW,  Im a believer that antipsychotics are NOT for me because all of them have the same effect. Sapphris, risperidal, serequal, geodon' abilify (funny how the commericals say its for treating just depression rather its an antipsychotic). My doctor laughed because she was like, &quot;your running out of drugs to take&quot; so I decided to put faith in switiching my antidepressant cymbalta to Viibryd.  Perfect combo Viibryd 40mg/Lamictal 600mg

A/H, delusions and paranoia have diminished considerably. Can't wait for the full effect. I also have PTSD, I take Cymbalta for depression. I also have diabetes, high cholesterol and hypertension under control.

I have to say this drug has been like a miracle pill for me. My depression and anxiety have both lifted and I just can not say enough good things about Latuda.  
Other		3	4	3			7/6/2011 12:35:29 AM	Been on 40mg since late March. It is effective in calming and smoothing out bipolar symptoms. How ever, I tried 80 for a short time then discontinued. Still feel like things could get better, as I am taking Klonopin on a daily basis and feel it is a &quot;downer.&quot; My question is, anyone taking 80 mg for bipolar and if so, hwat do you think?

Was afraid of weight gain, and happy to day there is no weight gain. I feel much calmer and my moods are stabilized, but in a normal way. Not like a zombie, more like a regular person. Very good medicine!
Other	Aubrey, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	6/28/2011 12:36:42 PM	I started taking Latuda, for PTSD and bipolar. I have been on it for about 2 weeks, and I have noticed sever muscle ridgity in my knees and back, the drug has been working very well for me.  The doctor said i could start taking another pill to help with the symptoms caused by Latuda.  I dont have nightmeres, I have lower anxiety, and I can function through out the day with little episodes.

I was hoping to change my ADD medication from Dexedrine to Adderal but my Dr suggested I try Latuda.  He was telling me about the success rate of other patients.  I made a comment it sounded like a miracle drug.  He said it kind of is.  I have been on Latuda for nine days.  I'm definately feeling better!
