Remarkably, most of my overt symptoms (walking, balance, etc) have improved dramatically. If this is cause and effect, I would like to know if there is an explanation.

Less fibromyalgia pain and just feel better physically.  The &quot;brain fog&quot; has pretty much cleared.

Lack in Vitamins	jess, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/26/2008 10:51:22 PM	I was diagnosed with pernicious anemia. Getting those b-12 injections was annoying. Doctor had me take 1 cerfolin a day because it metabolizes very quickly so you don't have to wait for stomach to absorb like other vitamins. My orig. b-12 level was 201 and after a few months of taking this pill, it went up to 440. Dr. wants me to take it still, until my numbers are even higher.  It is a little pricey ($40 for one month) but if you are squeemish with needles like me, I def. think its worth the price!

I think meds like this are the &quot;medical food&quot; that will redefine the future for many of us that suffer quietly or otherwise. It is up to our doctors to be willing to open their minds and adjust traditional training to prescribe the status quo that will help so many people.  If you are being treated for depression or in depr state of bi-polare (and i've heard for vegetarians, as well!) ask you doctor and dont let him or her relegate medical food to some fringe comment.  These are real and effective. If it doesnt help, you are still being smart.  Youre still trying.
