Birth Control	ese827, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	9/5/2012 1:27:46 PM	Well its been almost a yr, and I havent come up pregnant. BUT for about 2 weeks out of each month I experience these symptoms: extreme bloating, extreme moodiness, extreme irritability, EXTREME lethargy. After reading the other reviews I now see why my face has abnormally stayed broken out for the last 6 months &amp; I have almost completely lost my desire to have sex =( I have always pms'd but this medication makes everything times ten! My periods are predictable though and I have normal bleeding but the day that I ovulate, I KNOW, BECAUSE IT KILLLLLLS. I am going next week to get on something different. 
Birth Control	Sheana, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	8/13/2012 11:34:37 AM	I just gave birth 3 months ago and I am now taking Errin because I am breastfeeding. I'm on my first pack; last week of b/c, and I've had my period 3x within 1 month. It's not spotting, but more like a regular period with mild cramping. Sometimes there are even clots. I do find myself nauseas about once a day, and I've been getting more sleepier than usual. I take the pill on time, but I do admit I was within the 3 hr &quot;safe&quot; window once. I haven't had any experience with hairs loss or acne yet. i haven't been keeping track of my weight so im not sure if it's been affecting that area. Has anyone else experience something similar? What should I do, continue for another month or bring it to Doc's attention?
Birth Control	WopWife, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/30/2012 1:51:51 PM	I had to get my IUD taken out because of the horrible pain it caused for a year. Next they put me on Sprintec which made me one miserable bitch. I was hostile and moody, not a good thing!! I had just recently had a horomone inbalance from stress that caused me to burn through all of my progesterone and left me running on pure estrogen - not fun. So when the doctor recommended trying a progesterone only pill I jumped at it, hoping not to have the normal estrogren bc pill side effects. I loved the results I got with Micronor (though I liked the generic version Jolivette better than Errin) my sex drive stayed the same as before I was on a bc pill, I did have a bit of an increase in acne but nothing noticable. I did not gain weight, in fact I continued losing the weight that the IUD caused me to gain. The doctor said to be super careful about taking this pill at the same time each day in order not to mess with it's effectivness, so I guess if you are a forgetful pill taker this one is not for you.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	7/20/2012 10:59:37 PM	The doc prescribed me a combination BC but i reacted to the estrogen so i was switched to Norethindrone which is the same as Errin oral. I decided to read these reviews before taking it and I am very glad I did, because I thin my hair out alot already so I can't afford to lose any.. and i'm already breaking out so I don't want to make it worse.. and the mood swings sound horrible. I am so not taking this pill. I'm not risking these side effects just to regulate my stupid period.
Birth Control	Nellie-Bellie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	7/11/2012 10:41:03 AM	I got this medication after getting an IUD removed due to complications with it (constant periods). I was on the IUD and mini pill due to nursing my son. From this medication I had lots of experiences with dizziness and my skin breaks out horribly. I've been on it for almost 3 months and I am now unexpectedly pregnant with my 4th child. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/16/2012 9:44:45 AM	I switched to errin from sprintec and apri. The sprintec made me a maniac. Apri was slightly better and gave a shorter period but skyrocketed my blood pressure. Errin has worked well so far after 2 months, I've had a cycle both months. I just haven't narrowed down when to expect one yet. I have been more hungry. I'm happy to trade hunger for the crying and mood swings. I have sex regularly and have felt an increase in desire where I felt almost none with other pills. I would recommend this to others that are having difficulty with estrogen.
Birth Control	mknight, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	19-24	6/12/2012 4:00:01 PM	I got pregnant! I took it every single day and here I am with a 4 month-old sitting on my lap. 
Birth Control	Sarah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	5/26/2012 1:55:40 PM	I don't like this medicine at all.  My doctor switched me from Ocella because I have high blood pressure.  For the first month I was on it, I was bleeding almost constantly.  Since then I haven't had a period in over 2 months which is freaking me out, I've already taken 2 pregnancy tests.  Despite that, I'm crampy all the time and my face is breaking out like crazy.
Birth Control	Mrs. A, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	5/26/2012 11:36:54 AM	I've only been taking this drug for almost three weeks and I've already had two cycles. My poor husband is going on a job trip Monday and we can't even have sex. Can't wait until I'm able to change my pills!!!
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	5/22/2012 1:34:07 AM	I have been taking Errin for 4 and a half years. I started the pill due to extremely heavy periods and was put on Errin due to migraines. This pill is amazing! I have gone as long as 5 months without my period (I was a virgin) and have had one migraine in the last 4 years vs once a week before I started taking it. I don't have any side effects the others have mentioned but I never really had moodiness or breast sensitivity with my period beforehand either, just heavy bleeding. Anyway, it is important to take at the SAME time everyday or you will get spotting the following week. Since becoming sexually active, we just use a condom for extra precaution because I don't usually have a monthly period to know if I'm pregnant or not. 
Birth Control	MAD, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	5/14/2012 11:21:10 PM	This medicine SUCKS!!!!!!!BEWARE LADIES DO NOT TAKE THIS STUPID PILL!!! i'm 23 years old moody as heck..can barely have sex and i get a period every two weeks it has ruined my vacations..i have had an appt. for the SPA i have yet to make....grrrrrr and my poor poor husband has had to suffer weeks without sex and weeks of me ranting and raving...please stick to the rhythm natural method before you use this dumb pill.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	4/23/2012 10:06:34 AM	I have been on Errin for almost 3 months and I plan on switching to another oral contraceptive as soon as possible. I have terrible acne breakouts on my face and back, my breasts are swollen and sore all the time, I have cramps all of the time, I have missed periods and am always afraid that I am pregnant, and I feel like I'm on a constant emotional roller coaster. 
Birth Control	kg, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	4/22/2012 1:52:55 AM	I have been taking Errin for a week now and the last couple days I have had SEVERE moodiness/irritability. Things that didn't bother me too much is now all I think about. I came to realize that it is probably this drug b/c I am starting to have to hold my breath and get myself under control when watching my kids - - my kids are something I always enjoyed even if they are crying and bratty; I've had patience. I've always been headache prone since giving birth to my second daughter - - but haven't noticed them being any different.  I have problems with my vision &amp; dizziness on this pill.  I am going to stop taking it. 
Birth Control	chestonandbht, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	4/18/2012 4:43:31 AM	This pill has made me LOSE MY MIND. I am so extremely emotional. My mood swings are out of control. Plus cramps.

I haven't noticed the hair loss like others. I am very tired and nauseas. I'm taking this because im breastfeeding. 
Birth Control	Mg123, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/31/2012 12:15:47 PM	Began taking this medication Feb 24 ,,, have had bleeding for 4 weeks solid !!! I hate this med!! My Doctor said to give it time well he is not the one bleeding daily nonstop For four weeks!!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	3/30/2012 1:04:55 PM	Prevent pregnancy......it sure does do that. Not because its a good BC pill, but because I haven't stopped bleeding long enough to have much sex!!! My hair has gotten thinner, and I have noticed I'm starting to get pimples on my back and chest! This is something I have NEVER had a problem with until I started taking this pill. Also the constant bloating feelings is awful!! The only good thing I will say about this BC is..I'm not pregnant!!! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone
Birth Control	Camry, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	3/27/2012 8:33:25 PM	I am so relieved to see that I am going through the same things as everyone else. It has been hell for me while on this BC. I had to switch 5 months ago due to high blood pressue. The first 2 months, I bleed all the time. Then I was fairly regulated for 2 months then this last month I was on for 3 weeks on and off heavy bleeding. I just stopped bleeding. I was going to deal with it, but after seeing everybody else's problems, I think it's time to switch. Thank y'all. 
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	35-44	3/6/2012 10:49:19 AM	I've been on this pill for 4 months now, and not sure why my doc even changed me to it.  The irregular periods, thinking you are pregnant are horrible.  Now, my breasts are absolutely killing me...not to mention the mood swings!  After reading the reviews, I'm glad I did, as I too thought I was going insane.  This is a horrible drug and I'm not taking it anymore.  I know my doc will change me back, but I'd rather have no sex at all then go through this.  Especially reading the percentage on having a kid while taking this pill.  Why even take it if it is that high?  Horrible pill!  Oh, haven't had the hair loss yet, but my scalp is every itchy lately.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/1/2012 9:14:08 AM	I used to be on the combo pill Cryselle, and then my doctor switched me to Errin because of migraines.  I'm going to be completely honest, the first month on this pill was horrible.  I was extremely bloated, my breasts were extremely swollen and sensitive (so much that taking a shower hurt, I was very emotional, I got horrible cramps after having sex, and I didn't get my period.  However, my migraines did go away.  After talking to my doctor, she said my body was adjusting and to stay on the pill for another month.  I did just that, and I am extremely happy with Errin.  All the negative side effects disappeared, and I got my period for 5 days and haven't had a migraine! I haven't had any issues with hair loss either.  If you can stick it out through the first month, this pill is great!  Ps. I take my pill at the same time everyday - just set an alarm on my cell phone!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/28/2012 8:46:14 AM	I have only been on this birth control for two months and have had little side effects. I may be having more mood swings but they are mild and have not found any other side effects. So far this is a good birth control pill for me since I am breastfeeding.
Birth Control	Happywithmy2, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	1/30/2012 7:03:21 PM	I started this pill right after my 6 week appt. I was recommended this by my Dr. as a great BC-I don't agree. I started the pack on a Monday, and have been bleeding a whole week. I have menstral like cramps a majority of the day, and I can't wait to stop taking this. I have called my Dr. asking for another non-estrogen BC-as I am breastfeeding my daughter. I would say that this pill is effective because you can't have sex with all nof the uncomfortable cramping and bleeding. I would NOT recommend this to anyone.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	12/29/2011 8:36:29 AM	I was put on this medication due to my blood pressure. I'm still not sold on this medication. I'm not having hair loss nor my moods are not of the chart. Like I have read on most of these post. But I'm not happy with not knowing when I'm going to have my period. Unlike the other kind of pill I was on I knew every month when I was going to start. I've been on it for 3 months now and I'm still un sure about it.
Birth Control	trish, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	11/18/2011 3:54:57 PM	Overall I haven't had any mood swings or anything but the hair loss is NO joke! Pretty much everyone is subject to some hair falling out post-pregnancy but I've been on this pill for two weeks and in that two weeks my pony tail has gone down to half the size it was. Before I was losing 2-3 strands when I ran my fingers through it, now I lose 15-20+. I clean my hair brush out every time I use it and lately after I brush my hair it looks like I haven't cleaned it in a month!! Yikes! I'll finish out this month and see if it subsides but I can't afford to keep doing this.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	10/6/2011 6:21:48 PM	Just to let other women know...I've been off this horrible pill for 6 months and have lost about 2/3 of my hair (including the 3.5 mo of use)....Don't have much left and it's not really growing...mood swings were horrible..it's a wonder I'm still married, we both agreed that we wouldn't be if I would have continued to take this...only positive is that I didn't get pregnant..but I would've prob. taking an &quot;uh-oh&quot; over this!!! Don't take this pill unless you absolutely must..my gums have even started to recede and I never had dental problems...I still have cystic acne and I never had pimples before...I guess it will take over a year to get out of my system...*sigh...I had no problems with this pill initially except for mild hair loss...while I was on the pill, I didn't really think I felt moody and emotional, but looking back, omg...I would've divorced me!!
Birth Control	Blak Rose, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	10/4/2011 1:19:48 AM	I started taking Errin after my fifth child. I had had some anxiety issues before but when I started taking this drug I couldn't even handle my own children because it gave me extreme mood swings and irritability. My husband even wanted me to stop taking it because it was tearing our family apart because &quot;mom&quot; could not function...
Birth Control	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	9/26/2011 6:47:18 PM	I have been taking this BC for over a year. At first it was good. Lighter periods. Now it works great at preventing me from getting pregnant because i constantly have my period.I have it for 7 to 14 days. It stops for 4 or 5 and then its back again. And my hair has also been falling out.After reading these reviews i too have decided to seek another method of BC.
Birth Control	crystalnoel83, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	9/24/2011 1:22:50 AM	I have been on this b/c since having my daughter in May 2011. Everything has been fine, but recently I have been having migraines and have had instances where I almost pass out and feel incredibly nauseated. I am also loosing my  hair at an alarming rate, more so than with my other pregnancy. I have a check up and I am sure my Doctor will agree with me that it is best to discontinue this form of b/c as these side effects are worrisome. I have been through the gauntlet of b/c in the past, and never have I had such a problem as I have had with this form. 
Birth Control	Adm2844, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	9/18/2011 9:43:54 PM	I've been taking Errin for a month now. So far the only problem I am having is extreme breast tenderness. This started around my third week on the pill. While I normally have mood swings, I haven't noticed a change in their severity or frequency. I had my period for a week and then it went away. I haven't had any spotting in between. I also haven't had any headaches, but i did experience the bloating during the first week. It soon went away. I have extensions so my hair is currently not out. Hopefully, the hairloss will not affect me. One draw back is that you have to make sure you take you're medicine on time. That can be difficult since we are all busy, but I set an alarm and have it on me at all times.
Birth Control	NCMommy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	3	3	Female	25-34	8/31/2011 2:42:47 PM	I am on my 3rd pack of this mini pill and the last couple weeks have noticed I am losing a lot of hair especially after showering and a little acne on my face.I decided to look up reviews on this drug and see I am not the only one. I also have ocassional headaches.Which I assume is from the pill as well.I take this pill due to BF but will be looking to switch to another pill is possible.
Birth Control	Kandess, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/13/2011 8:16:21 PM	Review by Kandess: At the time I write this review my new daughter is 8 months old. I started taking Errin 6 weeks postpartum, due to breastfeeding,I didn't want estrogen in my milk. While I breastfeed exclusivly I have not yet had a period, which can be compleatly normal as my mother did not until I was 9 months old while nursing me. I do take a pregnancy test at the end of each pack and started this around month 6 as my daughter began solids I was told by my doc this could tamper with the effectiveness of the pill. I did have extream hair loss 4 months into use, but it is now growing back thicker than it was before. I think natural hormon changes after delivery have caused this change. I do cry more than I did before and think that will also change as time goes by and my body contiunues to regulate. My diet remains ok, I have more cravings than I did while pregnant, but I suspect these will subside after weaning. I gained 40lbs during pregnancy and have lost 30lbs. I continue to see slow weight loss and think that I would loose more weight if I where not as seditary as I am. Extream weather has been preventing us from going outdoors in this part of the counrty. I will repost at 12 months and after weaning to give an update of long term use of this pill.

Soon after that the weight started coming on. I constantly feel bloated like I have my period everyday. My period is pretty regular, once a month, lasting 4 days. BUT there were 2 months my period didnt come causing a pregnancy scare. AND THE HAIR LOSS i have thick hair but every day after my shower i pull a huge clump out of the drain....my hair brush is constantly full after each use.  Also, mood swings are ridiculous...I yell then i cry....i have NEVER been a crier in all my life until this pill.  Im getting married in 3 months and am afraid to change pills before the wedding but the day after the wedding I'm getting off this TERRIBLE pill
Birth Control	LadyGator, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/24/2011 6:12:52 PM	I have had uncontrollable mood swings,I stay drepressed all the time I have weight gain,insomia, major headaches along with blurred vision.  I am so not happy with this product. I have recently taken myself of it. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
Other	Errin User, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	7/19/2011 11:34:08 PM	I started this mini pill in Spring 2010. Due to meds for high blood pressure, I was unable to take the combo pill. The first 7 months I was constantly bleeding, buying pads, tampons, and new panties. Horrible moods swings, weigh gain,but no problems with acne or hair loss. The last 6 months I have not had a period, I've lost weight and recouped the money I spent on  feminine products.
Birth Control	NursingStudent, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	7/13/2011 6:53:38 PM	Had I known that I would gain this much weight and loose so much hair, I would have never made the decision to start taking these pills.  My poor fiance has dealt with my horrible mood swings and irritability, but it's getting out of control.  At first I thought it was the stress of school, but after reading SEVERAL reviews, I know that it's the pill.  I've too gone on a strict diet, lowered salt intake, started exercising, and cut off all sugary drinks and still I gain weight and have not lost one pound!  I've had at least one pregnancy scare since taking this pill (total of 8 months).  I don't have kids nor can afford to have one any time soon, so I will be contacting by GYN for a check up and switch birth control methods. as for now...no more ERRIN for me!!! I don't recommend it to anyone!
Other	Tweeter5, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	7/7/2011 5:29:58 PM	My oldest daughter has been on this drug for 11 days and is not using for birth control but for other reasons and has had severe cramping in her stomach area especially the right side and has gotten diarrhea from this prescription drug. Called her gynecologist and was told to take 3 iubrophen every six hours for cramping. We are ready to have her discontinue the use of this prescription drug.
Birth Control	Nashberry, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	7/3/2011 12:39:51 AM	Like many others, I started taking this after having my son while nursing. It was great while I was breastfeeding but I did notice a decrease in my milk supply. After we weaned, I started spotting and having horrible headaches and lots of weigh gain. I'm now too heavy for clothes I wore during my 9th month prego. Very unhappy with the side affects and am done with all hormone bc.

Birth Control	Jbird, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	35-44	6/21/2011 2:33:27 AM	THANK YOU to all the ladies who posted on here!  I was on this medication for 2 weeks, I really wanted to be on BC and can't take estrogen. I instantly had major breakouts on my face and a very oily scalp(gross) and back. And my lower back hurt very badly which i attributed to my DD learning to walk. Today, day 15 I woke up to severe cramps on my right side(ovary?) lasted all day had to stay in bed. Also lost 1 lb in 1 week and gained 2 in the last week, usually sale doesn't move! I was unsure if i should ride-it-out but after reading these posts and seeing others having similar problems, but esp ALL of the pregnancies!! And what if this pain continues or comes back monthly?!?! Not worth it, I am DONE!!  Hubby is just gonna have to wear a condom........ Why suffer all the side effects and be afraid your preggers all the time??
Birth Control	Gogo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	5/30/2011 6:50:12 PM	I was prescribed errin because of my frequent intense periods (every two weeks, severe bleeding). I just turned 35 and I just quit smoking, so my Dr. told me I had to quit for 6 months before he would put me back on the combo pill.  I also have PCOS and Uterine Fibroids.  I have been going nuts since on this pill.  The mood swings are awful.  What makes me so upset is my Dr. knows that I am bipolar, and from what I reading, this only makes the situation worse.  I am calling him first thing in the morning and we are going to have a conversations. The depression has me to a point to where I feel like I felt before I was on my meds to treat my depression. Seriously, I just broke up with my boy friend, cursed my mother out yesterday, and have been crying all day.  I felt like something was not right, and did some research... I am not happy with my Dr. at all.

Take it at same time every single day. Did have lots of weight gain and hair loss as well as feeling crazy and shorttempered as other users have described! Tried this one cause they said safe for breastfeeding moms. Wont do it again!
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/16/2011 5:42:30 PM	I was put on this med for other reasons than BC.  Have been taking it for a moth now, my breasts are super tender and i have been getting little shooting pains in my legs every once in a while.  It has not solved my &quot;problem&quot;, im hungry all the time which ultimately resulted in a few pounds. I dont know, if it resolves my problem i will stick with it but if it means sore breasts all the time and maybe even the development of DVT's?  No thanks.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	5/2/2011 7:00:47 PM	My son is 4 months old. I have been taking this pill since my 6 week check- up. I have been unable to lose any weight and i walk 3-5 miles a day. I am very active and i can't even lose a pound. I am no a bad eater so i am blaming this pill. After reading the reviews i no its this pill. Also i have been losing so much hair its scary. I am a hairstylist so i no its ok to lose hair but let me tell you, i lose so much that i told my husband im going to be bald and i can feel the difference and it stinks. I used to have great hair...well not anymore. I am going to stop taking this pill!!! 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	4/28/2011 5:08:06 PM	This pill has caused me to lose so much hair that I cry in the mornings when I have to watch it all fall to the floor.  I'm so glad that I found this site and found out that others have experienced this too...I have a question though, I've been off of the pill for 2.5 weeks...can anyone tell me how much longer I will experience this excessive hair loss?  I've probably already lost 1/3 of my thickness....
Other	endo.pt, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	4/26/2011 4:58:45 PM	I'm taking Errin due to endometriosis. I just had my second surgery in March and my doctor started me on the depo lupron shots. I had way too many symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats, all the menopause crap... My doctor then added Errin to help with that. Errin made my mood swings 10xs worse! I cry and freak out over everything now! My hot flashes and night sweats have gotten better... But the endometriosis pain is still there... The only issue I've had with this pill is the mood swings that it's caused. But as far as my period, the depo lupron stopped that so I can't tell how the Errin would effect it. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	4/23/2011 8:18:42 PM	When I started Errin 5 months ago, I read the reviews here and I thought &quot;these women are crazy! This pill is great.&quot; However, I now understand what all the reviewers were saying. I haven't gained weight, and I'm not pregnant, BUT my hair has been falling out, and I feel like I'm going insane. The smallest things make me so angry, and I cry for no reason sometimes. I'm surprised my boyfriend hasn't broken up with me because of how crazy I've been acting. I will be contacting my gyno to get me on something else.
Birth Control	skittles1969, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/19/2011 12:14:13 AM	I've been taking Errin for a little over a month now and I haven't had many problems. I switched after being on the Nuvaring for 2 years and developing migraines. I've had far fewer headaches with Errin. I have actually lost a few pounds and noticed that I am not as hungry. I haven't had any spotting at all and my period was light and painless compared to the excruciating period I get if I'm not on anything. My acne has stayed the same--it hasn't gotten better or worse. The only problem I had was dizziness in the first month. It's not as bad now so I'm hoping it will be gone by the third month. I was expecting really irregular periods but so far things have been fine. 
Birth Control	Pipp12, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	4/11/2011 11:50:43 AM	I've been taking Errin for just a few weeks, but I'm already noticing changes. On my previous pill, a combination pill, I found myself being constantly crabby and moody...a miserable person to be around. Not to mention, I gained weight and felt bloated all the time. In the few weeks since the switch to Errin, I've lost about 8 pounds and am not longer as emotional and moody. I haven't noticed any of the terrifying side effects that some people report on this pill - no hair loss, no hair growth, no acne or bloating. I haven't experienced any spotting between my periods...I do set an alarm and this pill at exactly the same time every day, and I suggest you do the same. My boobs have gotten a lot smaller, which is probably why I weigh so much less, but really, who needs big boobs anyway!? I like this pill.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	3	1	Female	35-44	2/26/2011 4:58:57 PM	I have been on this pill for 2 months, and already Ive had a pregnancy scare. I'm having severe mood swings, my boyfriend probably thinks Im crazy! Ive been breaking out and Ive even gained weight. My first period lasted seven days, when normally they last three. After reading these reviews I decided condoms are much easier then dealing with all this crap. Dont take this pill if you are thinking about it!Its so not worth it.
Birth Control	scaredmommy1, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	2/23/2011 12:10:41 AM	I started taking this pill because my dr told me it was my only option since i was breastfeeding my daughter. I was taking it for 4 months before i stopped.The first two months i had my period like normal but after that i didnt have anything, i started to have pregnancy symptoms but pregnancy tests came back negative. I stopped taking it just in case. that was 37 days ago, i still havent had my period, but pregnancy tests still come back negative. I never had any problems with hair loss, but weight and acne were a problem. I plan on waiting for the 45 day mark and taking another pregnancy test, if it comes back negative im afraid that this fu**ing pill has taken away my ability to have children. i would never recommend this pill to anyone!
Birth Control	Vhively, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	13-18	12/31/2010 6:14:20 PM	I was put on this drug after having a severe blood clot from taking Yaz, I was afraid that I would not get my periods because I have PCOS, but to my surprise Errin keeps my periods coming. And even though they are crazy times and never really regular I'm very glad that it has kept my system going. I have not had any of these side effects such as the hair loss or loss of my sex drive. And I would recommend this birth control to anyone that I know. This drug is much less dangerous than the other birth controls that are out on the market right now. And even though you are having side effects, it's still not as bad as almost losing your life from a blood clot or stroke that the other birth controls are now famous for. If you have a daughter put her on this medication, because I was 17 when I got sick from Yaz. I'm 18 now, and no I wasn't on Yaz to have crazy sex, I was on it to help my system with PCOS. Don't know what it is? Look it up.
Birth Control	 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female		12/30/2010 10:25:28 AM	I now see that I should have read about this awful, horrendous pill prior to taking it.  However, I've been on the pill for at least 15 years and never had a problem w/any other brands.  This pill has basically rendered me fat, bald and angry.  I can't imagine that my husband would even want to come near me, so it's defeated the entire purpose of it!  The weight gain is ridiculous (after only 2 weeks my favorite, fit me all the time jeans were tight and I couldn't imagine why; then the hair loss!  So when I decided to look up reviews of Errin it all became clear).  I have an appointment on 1/3/11 to get my tubes tied since we are not planning on having more children.  I can't go back to my old estrogen pills because I was suffering from debilitating migraines.  I have to say that on Errin, no headaches!  However, fat and bald and very moody do not suit me.  Awful, awful, awful pill and whoever created it should have to take it for the rest of their lives.
Birth Control	Sam, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	13-18	12/3/2010 9:54:59 PM	I was put on this medication and i am deciding to stop taking it because i am a breastfeeding mom and it is drying me milk supply out and gives me no sex drive i have only been on it for a month and a half and i have already gained 15 lbs. I am done with this pill. I do not want to give up my hard worked body after i had my baby away for a birth control nor stop breastfeeding. 
Birth Control	bleh, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	11/24/2010 6:15:37 PM	I've been taking this pill for 6 months and stopped last week. My period has not been regular since i started takin it. At first it was coming every 2 or 3 weeks. now its not coming at all. I have had 3 pregnancy scares, bad acne and have turned into lady of rage. I was unaware of the issues concerning this pill, but now that I have went thru the reviews I am sticking with my decision to switch to a new pill.
Birth Control	minski75, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	10/10/2010 10:00:26 PM	I'm glad I decided to look this up. I've been on this for 7 mo and I've had the same side effects. My hair falls out like crazy. I'm constantly picking it off me and everything around me. I also have the headaches, abdominal pain and no sex drive. The mood swings are terrible, I don't know how my husband puts up with me!!! And the last 3 months I've had a period every couple of weeks. In fact I've been bleeding for 15 days straight. I had cervical cancer when I was 20 and since I've been bleeding like this I've been scared to death that it was back. Still getting checked but I'm feeling a little better. I'm done taking this pill. I want my sex drive back!!! We will be using condoms from now on.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	10/6/2010 1:54:48 PM	I have been on this pill for 6 months. I absolutely love it. I have had no side effects and, other than having to take it at the same time every day, this pill is simple to use. I'm very happy.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/25/2010 9:12:25 PM	I had unexplained bleeding and my gyn prescribed Errin to control my periods and b/c I also have high blood pressure so I cannot take the bc with estrogen.  I've taken it for three months and I have no side effects.  
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	9/23/2010 3:45:01 PM	I am so glad I am not the only one experiencing all these awful symptoms while on Errin. After wondering and now reading up on it I have decided to stop taking this pill and would not recommend it to anyone. I have 3 children,the youngest is 4m, this is my first time taking Errin, which was prescribed by my dr because I am breastfeeding. I am almost through my 2nd full month of it and was starting to think I was dillusional. I have headaches everyday, skin breakouts, feel constantly bloated, very moody, lack of sex drive...and I mean NONE..., and I've shed more than enough hair to keep a wig company in business. And the worst thing is that my milk has all but disappeared. I also had one period during my 3rd week on this pill. Since then I have not had anything to speak of and am 2 days away from the 45 day mark of which it is recommended that you take a pregnancy test. Now I know that postpartum symptoms are completely normal and I expected those. However, these are beyond the norm and my reasons for taking this particular pill are being outweighed now by my reasons to not take it. Breastfeeding is very important to me and to be honest, I'd rather use a condom when we do have sex than have to worry with all of this everyday.Not to mention the very regimented schedule you have to keep. Oh, and the husband and I had noticed a change in our sons usual happy and content behavior. After reading lots about this pill I can only assume it is the reason he suddenly became fussy for no other known reasons to us. Good luck to anyone who chooses to use this pill. I'm just happy to know that there is an explanation for all of this madness and that I can put an end to it! 
Birth Control	GaMomof2, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	3	2	1	Female	35-44	9/22/2010 1:20:10 AM	I was switched to the Errin contraceptive due to monthly migraines from previous pills over the years (finally told the estrogen drop ea. month was possibly the culprit). After 2 months of use noticed very oily skin and breakouts. By month 4or5, noticed increased hair loss! Didn't realize it could be the pill until I began to research Errin and norethindrone. Apparantly these conditions are symptamatic with Errin. Will discontinue use beginning tomorrow and contact my gynecologist. Guess we will find hormone-free methods of birth control!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	9/16/2010 10:51:37 PM	im taking this pill because i was breast feeding..im on my second pack of pills,with the first pack i got my period the week before i was supposed to get it and it lasted all the way till the second pack, and it was heavy. Now again with the second pack im on the second week and i have some discharge that looks like blood but it is not bright red like a period..so i was afraid maybe i was pregnant but after reading the other reviews i now see that im not the only one with the same problem..o and another thing i have lost alot of my hair ive noticed thinning hair on the side of my forehead..so what ima do since im not breastfeeding anymore is look for another type of contraceptive...
Birth Control	Cam, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	19-24	9/6/2010 6:15:08 PM	I have been on this pill for about four and a half months now. For the first two months I hardly even had any side-effects and my periods were very very light. However in the last two months I've seemed to have had 2 periods each. I felt like I just ended my period a week ago and it is starting again. I'm going to refer to my Doctor very soon. I'm not pregnant though so it seems to be doing its job in that sense. I'm not a fan of the inconsistent bleeding :( 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	8/24/2010 7:39:28 PM	I feel like I'm constantly menstruating-i have 3 week long periods, very hard to even schedule my yearly exam b/c i have maybe one week at a time w/out flow of some kind.  This in turn causes anemia after the 2nd week or so, so i constantly feel terrible and extremely hormonal! So everyone else gets to suffer along with me, not at all fun. considering another form of b.c. this is too stressful!

Birth Control	jaxmom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	7/28/2010 4:26:19 PM	I just began taking this medication a week and a half ago since I am nursing. I am experiencing headaches, dizziness and upset stomach/gassiness. My son has also developed extreme gassiness and stomach upset. I know he's only 3 1/2 weeks old now, but for the first 2 weeks he was fine. Since I started taking this pill, he has begun to spit up after each feeding and has huge burps that he chokes on. His dr said it sounds like he's refluxing so he prescriped a Rx for him, but I'm gonna stop taking this pill to see if it helps with his issues. If not, then i'll start him on his Rx but I have a feeling it's this drug causing the problems for both of us. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	7/27/2010 11:48:17 PM	I went through numerous combined pills and had awful side effects (nauseas, upper abdomen pain, extreme migraines, and loss of sex drive). Because I have always been a migraine sufferer with aura's my doctor decieded to put me on errin. This may not be the case for you, but when I take errin each day I feel like I am taking a sugar pill each day. The side effects are so minimal that I sometimes forget I even took my medecine. The only cons I have from taking this pill are irregular periods (they still last  or 7 days but do not come at the same time), and half way through each month I get this weird white discharge for a couple of days (I know its gross), and the fact that you only have a 3 hour window when taking the pill sometimes hinders the ease of use of this medication. I highly reccomend this birth control to women who are sensitive to estrogen in combined pills. Everyone is different with each medication but this one seems to have minimal side effects to me, and do not have risk factors of blood clots, strokes, and heart attacks as the combined pills do. 
Birth Control	Scruz, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	7/26/2010 8:52:25 AM	I just started this pill today, but out of all reviews I saw one review where the girl has not had many side effects with Errin, she also stated she takes multivitamins everyday. I am going to take a multivitamin everyday with the pill to see if there is less hair loss (I have so much hair , a little less wouldnt hurt in my case). And my periods are so heavy I could see if this pill will help lighten it up. But I recommend trying with a mutivitamin everyday , may help.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	7/15/2010 11:18:06 PM	My Doctor prescribed Errin after the birth of my first child because I am breast feeding.  So far I am not pregnant so I would say it is effective but I missed a day and took two in one day.  BIG MISTAKE!!! the next day I lost so much hair that I had bald spots near my forehead.  I am also spotting randomly during the month ... but at least i'm not pregnant

I have been on Errin for seven months now and I don't like it at all. It is working because I am not pregnant but my once thick, quick growing hair is falling out and I have more acne now than I did when I was a teenager. I also have my period every three weeks, they last at least six days and are exteremely heavy. On the combo pills I lasted three or four days and they were very light.

Haven't had any problems, no period, not pregnant. wanted to comment about other lady losing hair: that's all part of post partum stuff and it will stop soon.  Not a side effect of drug.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	6/28/2010 5:07:56 PM	I am on this pill due to breastfeeding. Like others, I think it is making my hair fall out and also causing it to be greasy. And I think, but I'm not 100% sure, that it is decreasing my milk supply. I think I'll stop taking it soon and see if I am able to pump more.

I have lost TONS of hair.You do not know hormonal till you see me these days.Mild cramps and strange spotting with no period.Weight gain and bloating.It's not working for me.

I highly recommend it for nursing mothers. I used after the births of all three of my children (while nursing for about a year) and no side effects whatsoever.  Also, I easily lost the baby weight.  Now I'm done nursing, but do not want to go back to an estrogen-based BC.  I tried the Depo shot and it was horrible, so I went back to this BC.  It is great when you are nursing, but now that I am not nursing, my periods are so out of whack.  No hair loss or acne just bleeding all the time.  I didn't have this problem when I was nursing.  Great for nursing moms, but not sure about normal use. I'm so sick of all BCs.
Birth Control	overall satisfied, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/31/2010 2:06:06 PM	I took the Depo shot for 3 years before having my second child and had no problems with it.  After my son was birn, I took the shot for another year before deciding to switch d/t the increased risk of osteoporosis.  My gyn first put me on Lybrel, but I was having 1-2 migraines a week.  My gyn said that my body couldn't handle the estrogen, so she put me on Errin.  I have had no problems thus far with this pill.  I have not, however, had a period in the 2 months I have been taking it.  I am going to finish this pack, and if I still have not had a period, I will take a PT.

I have taken five pregnancy tests the last on Tuesday and all are negative.  Even though I have negative results it still makes me wonder if I'm pregnant.
Birth Control	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female		2/26/2010 6:16:54 PM	I was prescribed Errin after suffering migraine headaches while on Kariva. I started Errin Sunday night. By Wednesday morning I had started my period, had a migraine, and had a dull pain in my left side (not period type cramps). Thursday I had another migraine and the pain in my side became sharp and stabbing to where I almost could not walk. The same thing happened Friday too. I know this is NOT a coincident and has to be the pill. I called my doctor and we are going to try another kind of pill. I would never recommend this pill to anyone who likes to be pain free!

I have been on it for about three months and have have been having abdominal pain for the past 1.5 months. I thought there was something wrong due to the Surgury to remove the IUD. I had an ultrasound which was normal and they have no explanation of the pain I am feeling. Based on the commentary here, I am stopping the pill tomorrow to see if the pain subsides.

Other	AB, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	1/10/2010 2:32:22 PM	I have been on Errin for 2 months now. I had a baby 3 months ago and my doctor put me on this pill. For the last few months I have been super moody, have had face acne, spotting to the point if I go out I wear a pantiliner and my hair has been falling out like crazy. I normally have thin fine hair and with being pregnant it was so thick and beautiful but now it is falling out and thin again. I'm worried some days I will go bald! I have a doctors appointment coming up and am going to discuss with my doctor these side effects and look at switching BC pills. I had a tubal ligation done so I am on the pill to control my heavy periods and it seems like I am spotting every few days. I have only had about 2 weeks without any type of spotting. I thought the side effects were due to my TL but after reading other reviews I am relieve to think its because of my BC. Thanks all for your reviews!
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	35-44	12/29/2009 11:21:58 AM	I have only been taking Errin for 5 weeks; however, I did not had a period when it was suppose to start, and I am use to regular periods that last 3-4 days. The week after my period was suppose to end, I started to have very severe pain in my right lower abdominal/pelvic area.  The pain was so bad that I had to go to the ER twice in two days. During the time of the pain, I had difficulty urinating and having bowel movements.  The last 3 days have been horrific! If it is the pills that caused the pain, then I will have to discontinue use because I do not want to ever experienced pain like that again!  I too had to purchase a pregnacy test because I have never missed a period, except 12 years ago when I was pregnant with my daughter.  I can not take estrogen so my options are limited.  I am now thinking about trying the IUD.
Birth Control	SSW,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female		12/23/2009 11:07:43 AM	I've been taking Errin for about two months. It works just fine but the side effects are awful. NO SEX DRIVE!! mild abdomen pain, mood swings and no sex drive what so ever!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	12/7/2009 2:19:03 PM	I have taken this since shortly after having my son because I was nursing.  I am switching now that I'm done.  I used to have a cycle so regular you could set your watch by it...now I think I might be pregnant all the time because of late periods, abdominal pains, nausea, etc.  Like other commentors, I have increased acne, my hair is unmanageable, and suffer mood swings.  This pill does not stop all women from ovulating (me being one of them) and I always worry that I really am pregnant...then I get a 12-14 day period.  The hair loss that many have experienced is most likely the normal post-partum hair loss.  You lose less while you're pregnant because of the hormones.

Birth Control	Foodie800, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	10/12/2009 1:16:05 AM	My doc put me on Errin since it is a progestin only pill.  Even the &quot;low dose&quot; pills like Yaz caused me to get too many yeast infections and hormonal side-effects.  I was on Errin for about 3 months when I began to have SERVERE abdominal pain simialr to that of an ulser.  The only food I could keep down for 1 entire month was bananas and bread.  I had to see a GI Dr. who had me do an endoscopy.  Everything came up normal.  Process of elimination lead me to stop taking Errin.  I was frustrated that I had to have the endoscapy procedure and still the Dr. had no idea what the issue was.  After just one week of going off Errin my abdominal pain completely ceased.  I have been off Errin for 9 months and have never experienced that type of pain since.  I can't seem to take any type of birth control without suffering some sort of side effect.  My husband and I have resorted to condoms.  I am still not 100% Errin caused my abdomin problems.  The Dr was never sure. Although, I read online that servere abdominal pain is a rare side-effect of the progestin only pill.  Has anyone else had this problem?

I am no Doctor but I have been on many Birth Control over the years always with severe side effects..vomitting, migraine, dizziness.Tried this one because of no estrogen. On it for one week and had to stop. I had severe legs cramps and leg numbness and abdominal cramps all week and woke up on day 8 and had bled all over myself. No hair loss but I was starting to get oily hair. On to the next &quot;option&quot; I guess.
Birth Control	Jen5105, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	35-44	8/30/2009 8:56:27 PM	Effectiveness - 5 stars because I'm not pregnant.Ease of Use - 3 stars trying to remember to take it in the small window.  I never heard a specific &quot;3 hrs&quot;...that is interesting.Satisfaction - This is the 2nd time I've used Errin, due to giving birth and nursing.  The first time, I took Errin for 3 years and never had an issue.  This time, I took Jolivette for the 1st year postpartum and didn't have problems.  Errin was subbed because I switched pharmacies and they didn't carry Jolivette.  I've been on Errin for 4 mo now and am getting my period/spotting about every 2 weeks.  How much does that stink?  I am losing hair, but I didn't attribute it to the bcp until reading the reviews.  My daughter is 18 mo and still likes nursing, so I can't really quit the pill right now.  Or hoping my husband will get a V  :)
Birth Control	massachusettsmom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	35-44	8/17/2009 10:47:47 PM	I was breastfeeding my second child so started taking them after I finally got my period after five months. My hair is falling out and I am surprised that I have any left! Although It can be difficult to rememer to take it within the 3 hour window, it seems pretty effective. EXCEPT for my hair falling out, the dizziness, and I am having trouble wearing my contacts. After 4 months of use, I am stopping them... too many side-effects. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	8/4/2009 4:37:20 PM	I took Errin for BC while nursing my second child after stopping depo shots (which work wonderfully).  I wasn't fully aware that the timing was to crucial or that if vomitting or having diarrhea it isn't effective for 48 hours.  The first month I skipped a day and continued the pill, I bled for 2 months straight (moderate flow).  Then I had a 4 day dry spell before beginning what I assume was my period.  It lasted a normal time frame for me.  Now I am expecting my period, it is one week late.  I had a day of spotting and I vomited once that day.  Am I pregnant?  Is it just the pill?  I don't know.  I have also experienced much more oily skin and uterine cramping happens often.  Now that I am not BF my daughter, I am speaking with my doctor about the future.  I previously used Ortho-Evra for 6 years and loved it.
Birth Control	Sunshine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	8/3/2009 9:53:26 PM	Started this medication 5 mths ago and did not have problems for the first 2 mths.  In my 3rd mth began to loss alot of hair daily and skin broke out like crazy...continued to get worse, so stopped taking.  My doctor agreed ...not the hormone for me. 
Birth Control	sakura, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	19-24	8/3/2009 3:54:30 PM	I started taking this pill because I have been breastfeeding my daughter(now 6 months old)  I didn't have a period for 5 months after breatfeeding and took my vitamins regular so my hair was getting very thick(I have always had thin hair)  I starting taking this medication about a month or two ago, and I have asked my husband at least 3 times if I was having bald spots showing up. I couldn't understand what was happening to my hair(until I started reading more about this medicine)  I also seem like I am having a period every few days for a week at a time(before this if I had periods they lasted 4 days)  I wouldn't recommend this medicine to anybody!  I think I am going to find another way for birth control!

Birth Control	Staci, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	35-44	7/15/2009 12:33:41 PM	The only good thing about this pill is that I'm not pregnant. I take it at 11:30am everyday. I have to set my cell phone alarm to remind me. Even though you have a 3 hour window, if I miss it by a couple hours...I get my period for 8 days. Before I was on this, I got my period for 3 or 4 days. Now it lasts 10 days, plus the 8 days if I miss a couple hours..can't get pregnant that way, I guess! I have hair loss, and had bad acne for the first 3 months. Plus I've gained probably 10 pounds that won't go away. There's lots of spotting for no reason and at any time. I am VERY good about taking it at precisely 11:30 every day. Perhaps one day a month, I may take it at 2:00 and it's very depressing because I know I'll be bleeding for the next 8 days. I don't like this pill at all. I never had any problems with any other birth control pills. Besides the IUD, this is my only option. I'm 35 and smoke. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	25-34	7/6/2009 6:23:47 AM	I've been prescribed Errin to help control hormone levels in an attempt to control severe migraines. I've been on it for a month and a half and so far things aren't going too well. Migraines are seemingly unaffected, and since going on Errin my period while always erratic, is happening about every two weeks. Also I have naseau and am no longer able to eat chicken and am dealing with food cravings and other pregnancy symptoms. The only reason I'm not worried about pregnancy at the moment is I'm currently not sexually active. I know this medicine works for some people, but I'd definitely talk to your doctor about all the side-effects before starting so you have a real idea of what to expect.
Birth Control	NicoleP, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/23/2009 11:01:49 PM	I have been taking this for about 11 months, because of breastfeeding my son. I have had only 2 periods in the last year. I have not had any side effects, but even if I had, I would rather have side effects than not being able to breastfeed my baby
Birth Control	Pink, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	6/20/2009 7:07:21 PM	Due to a medical condition my doctor switched me from regular birth control to Errin.Within a week of taking it, I have noticed my skin is very oily, I have light cramps throughout the day, and my hair is abnormally greasy.I never have acne, but I do now because of the oil it is making my skin produce. Also, I take a shower every morning and by mid-afternoon my hair is so oily it looks like I need to shower again! This is very annoying.I wish I could switch back to Yasmin, but since I cannot do so I'm considering not taking birth control at all anymore because of these unpleasant side effects Errin is causing.
Other	lolly_0226, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	6/6/2009 11:21:41 AM	I HATE this drug. I've only been on it 3 wks and I've already been bleeding almost 2 wks.I can't take estrogen because I get migraines. I have to take this in order to have a period because of my PCOS.I hope my doctor can figure out something else for me.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	5/26/2009 1:33:55 PM	The only thing I like about this pill is that I am not pregnant. It has made my hair fall out and I bleed for at least 6days every other week. This is the worse thing ever I took my last pill 4days ago and did not refill. My husband and I will be resorting to condoms or something besides all the bleeding I'm doing there isnt much sex anyways.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	5/25/2009 9:29:40 PM	I have been breastfeeding for 7months and it seems to be okay...except the fact I have to use drain-o all the time because of my hair falling out...by the way i could sweep my bathroom floor everyday.so far i am not preggo
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/17/2009 4:26:42 PM	My doctor prescribed this because I get migraines and should not be taking any bc with estrogen in it. She warned me that it was not as effective as regular bc but I figured it would be better then getting a stroke in my 30's. After reading the pamphlets I found out that this is only like 1-3% less effective than traditional birth control and way more effective than condoms. After 4 months on it I am doing great. It was kind of annoying at first to take it them same exact time everyday but I am use to it by now. I have been also working out and trying to lose weight and I have found that I am actually able to lose weight while on this rather than on the other birth controls I have used. So far so good! I recommend it!
Birth Control	Lianne, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	4/13/2009 6:00:22 PM	This is my first month using this.  I am on it only because I am nursing.  Recently the side affect that I have experienced is really bad break outs.  I am not positive it is from using this pill but usually I only get a breakout like every other month.  Currently my whole face is broken out.  Not too mention very oily.  I would really like an alternative to it but I dont plan on nursing much longer anyway.  Hopefully my hair doesnt start falling out like the others!! : )

Never had a problem or bleeding with it. I continued to take this pill instead of switching back because I have not had any problems with it. I just dont know how normal if I will get my period back with this or not.

I like it.

Birth Control	Shaquetta, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	2/27/2009 7:30:48 PM	My doctor prescribed this pill for me because I wanted birth control while I was breastfeeding actually my doctor reccommended taking birth control because he said you can get pregnant after six weeks after having a baby if you are not taking anything. Anyway, he prescribed this pill because I was breastfeeding. I stopped breast feeding when my son was five weeks old because I had to go back to work after six weeks. After having my son I bled for three weeks, spotted a couple of days then started bleeding for two weeks which I thought was my period. When I went for my post partum check up my doctor said that was not my period. I did not bleed for a week then I started bleeding again and as of today it has been 21 days. I called and spoke to my nurse and she said it was not the pills. I don't believe that, this is my second child and I did not have this problem with my first child and I took another birth control pill then. I hate this pill and the nurse told me to call back when I am almost done with this pack so they can prescribe another birth control pill for me. I have two weeks left and I hope I do not bleed for the remaining two weeks. This is absolutely the worst pill I have ever taken.
Birth Control	Jus a mom, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	2/20/2009 10:53:48 PM	I was given this birth controlafter I delivered my son in sept 09'.I am on this pill, due to me breastfeeding my son. I take it everynight at 10pm. As I was reading everone else's review, I relized it's just not me! I take a shower and while I am rinsing my hair, I keep rinsing and getting rid of the loose hairs and it keeps coming and coming. I think that is the only thing that bother's me about this mini-pill.. No acne, no weight gain or loss, I have not had a period at all which is great. I am not pregnant. After my son turns a year old, I will be seeking a stronger birth control for non-breastfeeding mothers.Also keep in mind everyone's results are different, and some people take to it really well, and some don't.4stars for satifaction is due to showering and hair falling out like crazy. I still have a full head of hair by the way...lol
Birth Control	IsabellasMommy11, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	2/4/2009 2:35:27 PM	Like everyone else here, I too am losing a lot of hair, which is frustrating. Once I am done nursing my daughter, I will most definitely change back to a regular birth-control pill such as Femcon, which worked very well prior to us TTC. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	1/30/2009 4:26:00 PM	I am not happy with this pill at all, but unfortunately I can't take estrogen. It seems like I always have my preiod. I have gotten it once every week for the past 4 weeks. And along with it come really bad mood swings, bloating etc. So I pretty much always feel like I have PMS. I have also had hair loss and started taking Biotin (which has helped. I would love to go off this pill, but I can't for medical reasons.   
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	1/22/2009 1:00:44 PM	I have only been taking this for a week.  The only things I have noticed is that my stomach cramps up about a half hour after I take it and I am having some mood swings.  I decided to take the pill before I go to bed so the cramping won't bother me.  Other than that I haven't noticed anything else and am happy with it so far.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	35-44	1/9/2009 10:06:36 AM	I normally use a different brand name of the same drug used to help my endometriosis. My pharmacy likes to subsitute with Errin and it is the worse pill for birth control I've used. Constant bleeding and pain and never know when you will start or stop. After reading other reviews, I have not had hair loss or acne, but would take that over bleeding for 21 days straight. Ive since had my physician put DAW(dispense as written) on my scripts.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	1/7/2009 10:44:42 AM	I recieved this prescription due to me not having a period since my son was born on 9/17/08 plus I nurse.  I have only been taking it for a week &amp; as with others my hair is falling out.  Until I read this site I didn't know what was causing it.  From what I read about this pill it may actually cause me to still not get a period.  With the other side affects that I see I'd rather be pregnant.  I am stopping these pills &amp; hopefully I get my period so that I can have the I.U.D. put in instead.

I get a period every 6 days for 6 days.  It's been this way since I started taking it so it feels like I'm bleeding all month long!  I hate this drug and I don't recommend it.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	12/2/2008 12:40:53 PM	Well, thankfully not having problems with my skin.  I've been on it for almost 3 months and no period.  I was starting to get a bit concerned that I might be pregnant, but it sounds like some women don't have periods on it.  Having some nausea, again was worried that I might be pregnant, but again sounds like some women have this problem, too.  So, for now I will continue to take it.

Birth Control	Jasmine, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	11/12/2008 7:26:49 PM	I had been on pills before without side effects and normal periods and was put on this one because I developed a medical condition I was told a progestin only pill was more appropriate for. That ended up being untrue, but for the short time I took Errin I hated it. I was constantly spotting. It was like I had my period all month long. It worked as a birth control method...but only because I didn't do anything that would have gotten me pregnant since I blead all the time!
Birth Control	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	3	3	Female		11/4/2008 1:10:32 PM	I have been on Errin for three months, I have experienced a slight weight gain, breast tenderness and mood swings. At times the mood swings are so out of control that I wonder if it's worth taking the pill.I still get my period regularly and it lasts longer than usual. 
Birth Control	halonat, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	10/19/2008 11:08:11 AM	I had my son back in April and my doctor put me on Errin because I'm nursing (still nursing now). I've been on it for almost 5 months, still no period and I'm losing all my hair. I found a hair loss sight that said your postpartum hormones can cause hair loss, but that scalp hair loss is also reported in users of oral birth control pills containing norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol, like Errin tablets (Brevicon, Norinyl, Norethindrone). I want to keep nursing, so I'll probably go off this pill and go back to following my ovulation on mymonthlycycles.com once I get my first period.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	19-24	6/15/2008 7:38:12 AM	I started taking this because it seemed every birthcontrol that had estrogen in it made me very emotionally unstable. I have been taking it so far for 3 months and I have felt like myself. I haven't gained any noticable weight. And as far as acne, I just wash my face more.I love this pill and I've already tried, Aleese, Ortho 7/7/7, and the Depo shot.I would suggest this pill to people who have a bad reaction to b/c with alot of estrogen in it.

I have been taking this drug since my postpardum visit. So far no problems. No breakouts. The weight gain issue is hard to tell since i did just have a baby. I haven't got a period yet but i did just stop nursing a few weeks ago. The only hard part is remembering to take it at the same time daily. Otherwise so far so good.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/24/2008 12:29:29 PM	I have been very happy with this birth control.  I have been on it for 3 years and have had no pregnancies.  Being as my first pregnancy only took once, this pill must be doing it's job.  In reading other reviews, I now know I can contribute skin break outs to this pill.  This has been the only pill, though, that has not given me migraines or made me sick.  I've had regular periods on this pill.  Overall, as long as I dont get migraines, I'm happy!

I take it almost the same time every night.  Started breaking out so bad the last two months.  Oh yeah, I am now pregnant after taking it regularly for a year.  My suggestion, don't take this.
Birth Control	jamiejeaner, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	3/27/2008 2:48:18 PM	I have been on this pill for almost 5 months, I gained weight very soon after beginning this med.  I have gained over 15 lbs. and I have also gotten the lovely acne issues, my face is breaking out like never before and my back is disgusting.  Oh I forgot to mention the noticeable increased growth of facial hair.  It is so embarrassing.  I love not having my period and I don't get migraines very often like I did with my other birth control pills.  I am not pregnant yet!  I am not very fertile to begin with though, so I have that on my side.  Good luck to those who try this, I hope you don't experience these side effects.

I have high blood pressure and unable to take any estrogen pills. It has alleviated my symptom. I do break out the week before my period and I never broke out before. You have to be disciplined to take this medication since it requires you to take it within 3 hour window. If you miss a day you have to wait to start your period again before you can continue to take it.

I have some side effects like breast tenderness and gained a little weight but other than that I like it. I also had some breakouts but I started to take vitamins and my skin cleared up.

I still have regular periods 95% of the time.  Every once in awhile might go longer.  Sometimes I might spot in between.  But overall...no problems.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	1/25/2008 6:48:21 PM	I started taking this medication right after stopping Depo because I did not want any periods.  I also cannot take estrogen because of family history of stroke (everyone and very young!).  I love it!!  Easy to use, cheap &amp; best of all NO PERIODS!!!
Birth Control		1	3	1			1/18/2008 8:35:28 AM	I was taking this pill while nursing my baby, but was unaware it wouldn't work after I stopped nursing.  I have a three year old, a one year old and I am 4 months pregnant with twins because this pill didn't work.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	1/5/2008 12:12:50 PM	I've taken this pill every morning with my breakfast. I rate the effectiveness very low because I just found out I am pregnant. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	1/4/2008 8:55:13 PM	No problems to report really. It's just kind of a hassle to remember to take it exactly at the same time.  No weight gain or breaking out here.  However, I'm losing quite a bit of hair, but it could be due to hormones from being post partum.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	12/27/2007 10:56:33 PM	I've been on the pill for about 2 months and all of a sudden I am getting headaches, Im nauseaus at night and I have breast tenderness so I am currently unhappy with the pill.  I also never know when I am going to get my period or for how long which I find quite annoying!

Birth Control	TrinaMae, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	12/7/2007 2:20:13 AM	I am currently on Errin and I am extremely unhappy. I have gained nearly 10 pounds, my skin is EXTREMELY broken out. Even on my back. It is disgusting. And to make matters worse, I have now been on my period for SEVEN weeks! I would NOT recommend this pill to anyone. I have seen my doctor twice about this problem but she insists it will get better.But I do not want to continue use.
