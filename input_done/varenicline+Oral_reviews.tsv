Stop Smoking	MrsGorden, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	9/28/2012 1:16:49 PM	I started these meds 2 weeks ago. I have been reading a lot of reviews/blogs and I have found that for the most part everyone's experience is different. At first I thought this might be a miracle drug that would make me stop smoking. I was wrong! I still have some cravings but they do get better the longer you take it. I have found that keeping myself busy and changing routines really helps. Overall this is a great drug for people who have tried to quit before and know what its like to go through &quot;withdrawals&quot;. As long as you have some will power you will do just fine!
Stop Smoking	john, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	8/18/2012 5:37:07 PM	i got a prescript for 30 days.  Took the 10mg split in half once a day then twice a day after the second day.  It really kept me balanced took only a half a tablet each day.  I was very motivated and happy with life. Very energized the small amount was just enough to keep me happy and get off smoking after 30 years.  Now I want to use it to help me with some mild depression to get myself back in the swing of life.  I had no problems with energy or sleeping when I took the smaller dosage it worked well with me....I hope this helps someone. I also used a quit smoking tape I found on youtube.com and I would listen to the tape in conjuction with the medication.  Allen Carr The easy way to stop smoking....Blessing and peace and clear breathing to you all.....I didnt it and so can you

Stop Smoking	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	8/5/2011 11:30:47 PM	Having a lot of trouble sleeping with this medication. Even though I am tired I have a very hard time falling asleep. I also get dizzy from time to time. I have not had any thoughts of killing myself yet. I have quit smoking for the most part but I have not been able to quit using chewing tobacco. Chewing tobacco and cigarettes taste very nasty to me and I need to find the strength to stop all tobacco products. I have tried the patched before but they do not stick to my skin very well. I would recommend this medication to my friends if they would ever have the desire to quit smoking. I would recommend having a great support system with friends and family.

But I think I might have an alergy to the drug. I'm going to go to the doctor to get checked out. so far I haven't smoked for 4 days.

I've never been a heavy smoker but been smoking for 10 yrs and want to stop. I experienced nausea one time and now make sure I eat before I take the med but I do suffer from the headache. I'm not so sleepy during the day but I sleep very well at night which is great a little bit of the crazy dreams but that's okay too. I love this med and how it just curbs my appetite for a cigarrette. I want to be smoke free.
Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/13/2009 3:07:38 PM	So far this is a very good way to stop a horrible habbit. It's hard to quit smoking after 28 years but Chantix is easy to use. It is not a miracle drug but I have found it more effective that any patch or gum. I have never been smoke free in 28 years now it is going on 6 weeks! I recommend joining the GetQuit program they have for extra support.
Stop Smoking	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	12/19/2008 3:41:36 PM	I have been smoking a pack to a pack and a half a day for 10 years and now I have been using this med for the past 2 weeks. Over the last four days or so I have found myself smoking only 3-5 a day so I am hppy with that and feel a little while longer and I will be able to &quot;kick&quot;. I have been experiencing some altered sleep as I am constantly tired and am going to bed 2hrs or more earlier than normal. My biggest complaint so far is that over the last few days, when my smoking has gone down dramatically, I have been experiencing a lot of stomach pain and nausea. I have been dry heaving every day during that time as well. It's a means to an end though, right?
Stop Smoking	sam, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	11/9/2008 1:05:08 AM	excellent to cease smoking for me, but i was mentally ready, REALLY! Only took 1/2 thr dose to avoid future side-effects. Still, not smoking after many months, but can not stop chantix yet, decreasing dosesslowly. Seems it gave me a feeling of well being and when i try to stop taking the pill, well, wild mood swings. but no smoking.STRONG medicine, this &quot;cure&quot;

It took me three tries but ultimately I was successful and now I have been cigarette free for 6 months. My final statement is that you really need to want to quit for this method to work. It is very easy to take this pill and to continue to smoke so the desire needs to be there.

Stop Smoking	Beth, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	45-54	7/9/2008 9:01:34 AM	This drug is poison! It is not safe and many people will not notice side effects until it is too late to stop the damage. Causes diabetes, heart problems and a whole lot more, READ the side effects and look up the medical terms before you ingest this poison. If you want an idea of what it is made from look up cytisine. There are better ways to stop smoking then using poison like this drug and it is a substitue for the poison of tobacco a much deadlier one!

We are no longer smoking. I have not become sick or tired. We have been on the medication for 2 weeks. It has really worked for us, we are so glad, we could never quit without help.
Stop Smoking	MALAPIERRE7, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	4/29/2008 9:35:08 AM	I am on day 10 taking Chantix.  Had nausea with the 0.5 mg  but its much greater with the 1mg, tolerable if it helps me quit. I am constantly tired and thats whats getting to me. I am going to bed early (900)which is very unusal for me, I am a 11-1200 bedtime person but while I am at work I could put my head on my desk and take a nap which is so not me. I never nap. If I can get through the tired part I will be able to make it.

Didn't expect that, but I got through it and its been 16 days and I can say, I did it. I will NEVER smoke again. Very happy me and family.  No nausea, some weird dreams, sleeping a lot, which is kind of nice, but the gas (I feel quilty, I think I'm diminishing the ozone). Hang in there everyone, its got to be worth it!

So much so that i prefer the nausea to the smoking. The bad thing is trying to quit the meds. Lots of depression. Hope it goes away Anybody out there that is going through same thing please write somehting. Im trying to flush it all out by drinking lots of water. Ive only been taking it for 33 days and i cant stand the nausea. Quit taking meds for two days and wahala , lots of depression and anxiety . Wonder if i should tell my doctor . If I wouldve known before hand I probably would of still taken Chantix thats how good they are . But eventually pay the piper . No smoking for me ever again. Its so much better as a nonsmoker so much more energy. Well folks gotta go hang in there and hope your succesful!
Stop Smoking	madison, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	3/11/2008 2:20:05 PM	I'm on my 6th week of meds.  I was smoking a pack a day.  I'm 60 and have smoked since I was about 10.  At first it was hard not to smoke after eating.  I figured I wasn't trying hard enough.  I tried harder and didnt buy any more cigarettes after I ran out.  After a couple of weeks I noticed I was so tired I could hardly get out of bed and when I did get up I went right to the sofa where I went back to sleep after a couple of hours.  I feel so tired like I could just sleep all the time.  I still want to smoke sometimes.  Mostly in the mornings with my coffee.  I used to drink a lot of  coffee, but without smoking I only drink about 2 cups in the mornings now.  I find I want to eat more now  which is not good.

I just need to know how long it stays in your system.  It has bee 2 1/2 weeks since I have been off of the Chantix and I feel like I could sleep all of the time.  Any feed back would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you
Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/1/2008 4:51:16 PM	I quit cold turkey 16 years ago,for 8 years. Picked up smoking again and have smoked for 8 years.I am experiencing the same 'withdrawls' as the cold turkey, yet it has been much easier to handle with this medicine. I feel much calmer when an urge comes along. I certainly feel energized by the ease of quitting this time and knowing that this is a slow adjustment I know I will succeed. Last time I quit it took me 3 months to say &quot;yahoo I did it!&quot; so my expectations are the same with this medicine. I am eating less, have gas just after I take Chantix, and the dreams are interesting! My nasuea is only if I take it before eating, so I take after or during meals.

I have smoked about two cigarettes per day since my quit date and yet I am still proud of myself.  I am currently going through a very stressful time in my current position (political election involved) and I do believe that Chantix is helping me resists the urges to smoke.I am having a problem not smoking after sex.........got to work on that!!I find the on-line &quot;get quit&quot; very helpful....This is the best that I have done on any of my previous &quot;trying to stop smoking&quot; tries.I must admit that I have been experiencing severe gas pains since I started the 1mg (second week).......I realize that my body is getting accustomed to the medication.Good Luck to my fellow &quot;I Want To Stop Smoking Crew&quot;
Stop Smoking	bossman, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	10/3/2007 1:57:18 PM	After 3 days, I began to feel a little woozy. Cigarettes no longer tasted good. The 4th and 5th days I was able to prepare myself for a quit date by reducing from 15 cigs a day down to 4. Missed a couple of doses and moved my quit date back a few days.  Had a bad craving on the day b4 my quit date and bought a pack. Normally a pack a day smoker, I finally finished the pack 4 days later and now have gone over 24 hrs without. May not be much but normally couldnt go a day without one.  The evening of that quit day is when I began to have my strongest urge, normally I would give in but this time I had a will to fight the urge.  The deep breathing techniques do work and quickly removed the urges.  The second day is going rather easy.  No  strong urges yet.  Ready to tell myself to fight and remembering to breath deeply. Never tried patches or gum, because it didnt make since to continue to put into my body what I was already addicted to.  This is really helping.
