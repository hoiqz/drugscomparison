So for me, this unknown fear keeps me from drinking.Also, I am taking Antabuse voluntarily; not court ordered. I have a friend I work with who is sober 15+ years who makes me take my pill and stay with her for 1/2 hour. All that probably isn't necessary for everyone but I appreciate her care and encourage-ment. I also go to Calvary Chapel on friday nights from 7pm-9pm. &quot;The Most Excellent Way&quot; is a 1 step program. JESUS! AA meetings just made me feel uncomfortable but I believe in the 12 steps. You can call people that go to the meetings for support and get prayer. Check it out even if you go to AA.

No matter how much sleep I get I'm still tired and drowsy during the day and yesterday I got bad stomach cramps after taking it. It served a purpose for me but there is no way I would use it on a long-term basis.

I have been unable to stay sober for more than a month at a time over the last 5 years. When I drink I smoke crack. When I use I am sometimes gone for days getting high and staying drunk. My girlfriend of 5 years has put up with my constant relapses and somehow has stayed with me, always hoping I would stop. I tried absolutely everything to stop drinking and Nothing had stopped me. When I had the cravings I could not stop myself. So now it has been 3 weeks and I have stayed sober taking it everyday. My girlfriend gives it to me every morning because if it were up to me I would probably not take it so that I could drink occassionally. So if you have the option of someone literally putting it on your tongue and watch you swallow then do so. You can fight the disease out of fear of getting violently ill as so many other reviewers can attest to. Save your life...live your life. God bless us all.

I finally started intense psychotherapy and antabuse therapy and I have been able to stay off the booze. This drug is a life saver. Taking the pill every day is like making a covenant with myself. Almost a year. I had side effects ( tiredness) at first but it went away quickly. Now I'm not sure if that wasn't just after effects of alcohol, not eating well, no excercise, all the things people do when they are boozing. At least try it-- different things work for different people!

Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	Gee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/27/2011 6:39:34 PM	I have been on Antibuse for almost 2 weeks. I find that I feel like I have control over my drinking because I choose to take the pill each day and therefore do not have to worry about how much I will drink later. The choice to drink is no longer there. I have been SUPER tired, though, and have a bad taste in my mouth. I may start taking it at night. I want to stay on this for at least 90 days to get out of the habit of drinking. I am not having cravings nor do I wish to test if it is working.

The 1st I taking it in the morning and found it hard to drive.  I switched to taking it at night.  I am still very tired but it is managable.  During week 2 and 3 I stated feeling sick with headaches and stomach aches.  I am going to work on reducing my coffee and chocolate in take which are pretty high.  All in all, I like the medicine, cuts the desire out and makes me face my life on lifes terms.  I still go to AA regularly.  Hoping this general fatigue will pass soon if I change my diet.

I am going to start this medication tomorrow.  Everything I've read about it says it's contradicted for use in patients with hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).  I'm a 26 yr old female taking Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, and so want to know why this medication may interact badly given the hypothyroidism.  Has anybody else been in the same situation???

He is sober and afraid to drink due to the side effects, family life has improved. He has high stress at work he doesn't sleep much.He is also has depression issues and is on lexapro and also takes trazodone to help sleep. He does suffer from anxiety but not sure if it's partly due to the anabuse or not. Anabuse gives him peace of mind that he can function and work every day. He had some chicken marsala, not thinking, and he has been dry heaving alot his skin was red and hot and in some places white and cool. Anabuse seems to work. MY sister in law died due to the disease and we don't wanna lose him the same way, so anything is worth trying. He's been an alcoholic for many many years he's been sober for 2yrs without meds but lately can't do it on his own and this seems to be helping. It takes a load off knowing he can't drink and if he doesn't drink all can be good. GOOD LUCK TO ALL.

Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	Eliza, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	1/27/2011 9:39:27 PM	My husband has been on Antabuse for 2 months - the first month was really difficult as he had significant side effects (fatigue, headache, general feeling of unwellness), but these have settled down.  Initially he was able to continue drinking without any significant reaction (he flushed and got racing heart but was not sick and felt discouraged that the medication was not worthwhile and not providing the disincentive he had hoped for).  After about 3 weeks on the meds he did become very sick after drinking 12 std drinks (which was very scary for me to watch and hope he would be OK).  At 4 weeks he was only able to drink 2 std drinks before feeling ill and now has been completely sober for a month.  The best thing is it is like a weight has lifted from him as the effect of the meds provide a physical motivation to not drink rather than just willpower alone and the daily stress of not drinking isn't such a burden.  For this medication to work you need to have high motivation to take the tablets in the first place and then to persevere through the side effects - it is worthwhile and it is now certainly working for my husband.  As a partner, it has certainly helped life at home but it is not a magic or easy fix.  His plan is to stay on the meds, and sober, for another few months and then try controlled drinking.
Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	annie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	1/17/2011 1:39:20 PM	I'm a successful, high functioning alcoholic.  I've been on this drug for two weeks now and it's a real lifesaver. It is such a huge RELIEF to know that I cannot drink - so much easier than just willpower alone. The beast is off my back!  The only side effect that I'm having is fatigue. I do wish I found this sooner... I thought this was for extreme cases only. I've tried everything over the past five years (naltaxrone doesn't work, AA isn't for me) and antabuse makes it so much easier. I only have to think about alcohol once a day (when I take the pill) instead of pure willpower which is impossible.

I have not drank anything out of fear of reaction. This is a good thing. I now take it every other day because it stays in your system up to 14 days. I truly do not ever want to drink again and this gives me the courage to not drink. I am very thankful for this. I have no side effects except if taken in the morning Im tired. I take it at bed time. I havent noticed any problems with perfunes or soaps.

This has been the best thing that happened to me.  So glad I found it.

I very nearly lost my job as a nurse when a combination of depression and alcohol addiction took hold. My whole life fell apart. Went to AA,  which was not for me, too religious. Did a couple of home detoxes with chlordiazepoxide and campral which worked for a short time until I got so depressed all I could do was drink. Drinking whilst on antabuse is lethal. I tried it once, I thought I was going to die. I looked horrendous, my whole face, neck and upper body went purple, my eyes were so bloodshot I looked like a drug addict. I am ashamed to admit that I am an alcoholic, but just being open about it helps.

My question: Do you really have to watch everything you eat/ or use around you (lotion, hair stuff, etc.) I have the lower dosage, 250's. Any comments are appreciated.

I started on 250 but found I could drink on that so I asked my doctor to increase it to 500mg.  I did drink again and felt the full effects including vomiting, red skin all over and racing heart which were terrible.  At first I resented taking it but now I am glad I do.  My life is so much better and I feel I have the awful beast (alcohol) off of my back!  When I think of drinking again I remember all of the antabuse side effects and I don't want to.  The only problem I'm having now is the sleepiness- I come home from work and can sleet until the next morning!  But it's much better than drinking!

I cant pretend to take it and then spit it out.  It has made me give up alcohol completely since 2nd April this year as the side effects are too unpleasant. I had been a very heavy drinker for 26 years.

It needs to be used with the help of some other type of support system.This is a disease that cannot be fought alone. I attend weekly group counciling, as I found that my local AA group looks down upon this, for reason unknown, so I attend other means of positive support. It's alittle tough to get used to, you need to allert to everything that may contain alcohol, such as lotions, hair products,etc. But in the long run it is deffinatly worth it, if you need help to save your life. I highly reccomend it.

I understand I will be violently ill if drinking on this medication.  I am 52 and do not want this to happen as I could die!  Will continue to monitor side effects.

Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	Barbie Doll, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	4	5	Female	55-64	3/6/2010 12:17:37 PM	I wanted to take back control of my life.  I wanted to finally stop drinking for good.  I wanted to have energy again, enjoy my life and do more than just drink.  I asked my doctor to prescribe antabuse.  I have been on it for about 3 weeks now.  My system is quite sensitive and 500mg was just too much - I was having reactions to everything.  I also didn't realize how many things contained alcohol until I ate a couple of chocolates (choc liquer) and I was sick for a day!  I cut back to 250 mg and started to research all the other items I needed to cut out that contained alcohol.  The list is very long!!!!  I have learned that you need to return to basics and cook your own food.  All forms of processed foods contain some sort of alcohol.  nail polish, hair spray, hair dye, dish liquid, even clothes detergent!  As soon as I started eliminating these items I begin to feel better.  Seek advice from a pharmacist or a homeopath regarding vitamins you can take that really get rid of cravings.  And, most of all, don't give up!!!!!  It will give you back your life and you will feel amazing!
Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	wind, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	3/3/2010 1:57:54 PM	I have been on Antabuse for 3 days now.  Like many others the fear of the side effects of drinking are keeping me away from alcohol.  I am a strong person, however still felt the need for additional support.  I take 250 mg, 500mg is for chronic alcoholics...Daily, heavy drinkers.  This med. does not take away your craving, and does make you tiered.  However so far, without any other side effects being tiered and sober is better then the alternative.  Good luck to all- Have faith in yourself!

The first day was pure HELL!!! It said don't take within 12 hours of drinking, but I was on a week long binge. Mt husband forced this medication on me. I have not drank in 2 days, but the cravings are still there. I hated AA, Celebrate Recovery and all that. I hope this helps.  But ALL I can think about is how to get &quot;over&quot; on this medication.  I DON'T think drinking is a good idea.

DO NOT DRINK WHEN TAKING THIS MEDICATION!!! my skin turned flush red, my throat swelled, i became dizzy and disoriented, my heart rate increased to a extremely scary rate, severe vomiting, stomach and chest pains, muscle aches, joint aches, i thought i was going to die. this drug is one not to play around with when taking and consuming alcohol. death may occur. i have to say, taking the medication made me fearful of alcohol *since you have to be sure not to use Listorine, cologne/perfume that contains alcohol, or eat or drink anything with alcohol*but i wasnt satisfied for the fact if a strong enough urge to drink came along, it would do me in for sure considering the side effects. but taking the medication normally, without consuming alcohol, i did not experience any side effects.
Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	40nfit, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	35-44	11/9/2009 1:05:45 PM	I took only (1) 250 mg tab and the side effects convinced me to make it my last.  It made me sleepy, weak, gave me muscle aches, and raised my blood pressure &amp; resting heart rate. I am a fitness person, and I was reduced to walking instead of running for 3 full days after taking 1 tablet.  I didn't even attempt to lift weights due to fatigue and my new high blood pressure.  My normal blood pressure is 120/80 with a resting HR in the low 70's. In the first 12 hours Antabuse took my BP up to 140/88 and my resting hr crept up to as high as 97.  I decided to discontinue the medication.  6 full days later I decided that the half life of the pill had likely passed, and decided to have a beer with dinner.  Not a good idea. I sipped it slowly and felt no adverse effects, so I decided that I was in the clear and had another.  The next am my blood pressure had spiked to 142/90 and my pulse had dropped low to 57 bpm.  I decided to check again an hour later and my BP was 146/93 with a resting HR of 103.  Very erratic pulse.  It took 24 hours to recover, and now I'm safely at 120/79 with my resting HR in the 70's again.  As a precaution I will not drink again until next weekend. The only good thing about this medication is that I didn't drink for 6 full days and gained some perspective on my drinking habits.  I broke my pattern of 4-6 beers a night, which achieved my goal of harm reduction from alcohol.  However, the risk of harm associated with this pill makes me feel that there must be better alternatives.  People who have strong compulsion issues definitely should not take this medication.

It does not kill the craving. I wished I had known about the side effects of this drug. It started with numbness in the front part of my feet and moved up all over my body. I have been diagnosed with periphrail neuropathy. It did not start until after 3 months on the drug.  I did not put it together until it started getting worse. Make sure you look at the side effects good. By stopping the drug I might be able to repair some of the damaged nerves. There are new drug out now to try!

Finally the Dr realized there was a problem and suggested AA and gave her a prescription of Antabuse. She was scared of the violent reaction for a week and stayed sober, then curiousity got the best of her and she drank. NOTHING happened, Im still making her take the pill dailey but all she does is drink and sleep for the last week again. She is currently taking 250 mg. I was wondering if because of her surgery she is unable to absorb the pill, because certain vitamins she must take in liquid doses. I have crushed the pill up and put in a drink, seeing if that helps, but still nothing. After researching and finding that 500 mg is often given tried that also, but nothing happened again.

With a hangover, I need one nap.  On Antabuse, I need three naps.  I can take Antabuse less than one day after drinking, but I get flushed if I drink within 3 days of taking Antabuse.

My first week of body adjusting made it even more scary;brain pains,wheezing,nose bleeds and made my ulcer flare up.My second week all those side effects but also extreamly sleepy and no energy now I'm on week 3 and I have all the above,and have wanted to drink for the last 3 day's,but will stick to my goals and continue to go to my out-patient groups and keep appointments with my Doctor. Nobody said it's going to be easy,But don't make it harder either. Good-Luck!!!

Otherwise, a remarkable tool for someone as hopelessly addictive as myself.
Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	KL, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/13/2009 12:48:01 AM	I have been sober for 5 days now since starting Antabuse (500mg). I have not experienced much in terms of side effects except for one awesome side effect - the fact that I am too scared of getting violently ill to even THINK of having a drink. I feel lucky to have been finally prescribed this drug. My newfound doctor is a god send in my eyes. I am also taking cipralex for depression and now that I have a few days clean time, it too is actually working... surprise surprise! Now just trying to figure out when will be a good time to kick the smoking cigarettes. Feel full of life and back to my old self. AA meetings and talk therapy are also in my regime. Not a big fan of some of the views of AA but I will take everything I can to stay sober and use from that what helps me. Good luck to us all.

So if you have a problem drinking, then please heed the warnings with this medication, even if you think you can just buck the rules and drink earlier.

I'm reading labels carefully, have had a reaction to a few of my lotions and colognes. Just use a little, and wait a day to see if you have any reaction before you apply it all over. I still have a desire to drink because I am an alcoholic, but my desire NOT to get very sick is more powerful. I just have to remember to take this every day, and I will not drink any alcohol (first time in many, many years.)

I'm afraid Of what he might do to himself. Sometimes he is up for four days without sleep. I feel he needs to be commited to the Behaviour Health Center because of this medicine.  He never was like this until this med.  He was on this before and got the same way.  I worry about his safety, and life.  He needs help.  This stuff needs to be out lawed.  Do somethigs before it is to late.  PLEASE!I know of a young man that is now having seizures because of this drug.  His mind is like a little kid.  He is not able to hold a job now.  I don't want this to happen to my son or anyone elses.  You are the only ones that can do anything about this.  Save our childrens lives.

I'm a little dizzy. Really tired but not drinking.I have slight headaches that come and go. Motrin is helping with that. I have some abdominal discomfort (not pain). I feel the antabuse scare tactic is working. I will not even think of testing this drug for effectiveness. I may try taking it every other day. I tried Campral prior to Antabuse and couldn't take the dizziness.

A sincere desire to stay sober is required. I am happy to say I have had no ill side effects.  I recommend this drug to people who truely want to live a sober life, and deal with lifes issues as they are dealt to us.  Using a recovery program is also a priceless tool.

The result was unpleasant - numbness in face, flushing, dizzy. BUT, it wasn't enough to stop me from drinking. So I drank again on it. That time, I remember nothing until I woke up in a jail cell, the entire side of my head swollen and black and blue with my eye swollen shut and nobody willing to give me information on how I got that way. It took two weeks to regain a normal appearance, and my eye retained bruising for a month. I also find out that if one has liver problems, since antabuse works essentially by not processing the toxins in your liver, it can be very dangerous.

Then one day I tried a beer a day after taking my 500mg dosage. Within about 5-10 minutes,my face felt flush, my heartrate increased, until eventually, it felt like there was an anvil on my chest.  My hands and feet became incredibly itchy, but I did not vomit. There have been a few occasions where I have drank within a day or 2 of taking antabuse and a few times have felt like dying!!  It's hard to breathe! The flushed face and itchy extremities are one thing, but when you feel like you are going to suffocate, that's quite another.  I briefly occupied myself with wanting other things, such as Starbuck's or shopping.  I am an addict at heart.  The cravings for alcohol don't stop, but are better when taking antabuse.

It did help with my cravings because I knew of the consequence if I drank therefore chose not to drink.

It does not remove the cravings in fact I find them intensified!  I wonder how long one needs to be off it before they can drink again.  My doctor says 2 weeks but I bet it's less than that.  I haven't had any side effects from the 250 mg. dose I take in the morning.
Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	Jen, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/5/2008 3:08:05 PM	I have been taking this medication for almost 60 days at 250mg. At this dose I have only experienced mild abdominal discomfort. I began at 250 mg, but found I was still able to have a sip of alcohol and not experience the side effects. I spoke with my doctor and upped the dose to 500 mg, but found the abdominal discomforts to be too great and went back down to 250mg. I have been sober for 20 days now. I take Campral in addition to Antabuse to help treat my alcoholism and Lexapro for anxiety. I attend counseling and see a Psychiatrist and regularly go to AA. I have found the Antabuse to be an integral tool to aid me in quitting drinking as it keeps me honest. The side effects that occur when mixing this drug with alcohol are quite unpleasant and are enough of a deterrent to keep me away from alcohol.

Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/13/2008 7:28:28 PM	The effectiveness of Antabuse comes from fear, at least for me.  I did not want to become violently ill from drinking alcohol or breaking out in a rash or other topical irritations from coming in contact with products that contain alcohol.  Yes, it does effect you if you use, for instance, hand lotion that contains alcohol.  Antabuse does not stop the physiological desire to drink.  It is merely a deterrent.  I had no hard-core side effects but did have a mild upset belly during the time that I took the drug.

Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	3/29/2008 11:56:52 AM	I have been an alcoholic for a long time.  I had trouble relating to people in AA because I never hit rock bottom, so I rarely went to meetings and never quit drinking for a long time.  2 years ago my doctor offered me Antabuse.  After a 'last' binge I started taking 500mg/day.  After a while I cut back to 250mg/day.  I was sober for 9 months on it.After 9 months I decided that I wanted to drink at a concert, so I stopped taking the med 2 weeks before the concert.  After the concert I went on a 2 day binge (no big surprise).  Then I went back to the drug and stopped drinking again for several months.  I have followed this pattern for the past 15 months - a while on the drug and sober, then off and drinking for a few days, and then back on.My dosage is now 250mg every other day.  I have experimented and found that I need to be off it for 4 days before I can drink without side effects (AT THIS DOSAGE).  When I drink too soon, my blood pressure goes way up and my entire body turns beet red - very scary.Overall I'm very happy with the results of the drug.  My system only works because I have the willpower to return to it after a few days of drinking.  I feel that Antabuse has allowed me to 'control' my drinking better than I could do on my own or with meetings (gee - do I sound like an alcoholic?  Yes).  Your mileage may vary...
Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	35-44	2/11/2008 2:45:56 PM	Definately reduced desire to consume alchol.  However, caused horrendous headaches, rash on hands and face, dizziness, nausea, extreme tiredness, blurred vision, and hands and feet became very, very cold, as if my circulatory system was not functioning properly.  The bad has far out-weighed the good for me on this medication.

However, care must be used in those suffering from hepatocellular dysfunction or other liver problems. Unlike other expensive drugs this deterrant can help the alcoholic build a foundation to recovery.
