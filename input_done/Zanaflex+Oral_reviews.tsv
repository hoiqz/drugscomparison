I can definitely tell when I don't take it - my legs are much worse. I'm not sure if its the baclofen, zanaflex or the combo that does make me a little sleepy, but I overcome that by getting up from my desk and moving around for a few minutes. I've not had any other side effects and personally I couldn't live without zanaflex - it makes that much of a difference in my spasticity.
Muscle Spasm	Lmarsh, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	8/6/2012 7:34:09 PM	I've used 4mg/3 x a day for 5 years , after developing an irregular heart beat, extreme high blood pressure, stomach problems and a 100k worth of tests that showed nothing that could cause such severe symptoms I stopped all medication to detox my body this is the only medication I have not started using again and every problem has resolved by stopping this drug. For short term use it's a miracle drug but long term use is a bad idea.

I'm curious about what is considered a low dose. I'm on 4mg 3times a day.  So far the spasms have subsided.

Muscle Spasm	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/6/2012 5:52:02 PM	I had very severe negative side effects from taking this medication over the period of one night (couldn't even bring myself to take it one more night). I got very dizzy/drowsy, had severe hallucinations/delusions/extreme confusion, and had to literally crawl upstairs to go to bed because it sedated every muscle in my body. The next morning I woke up feeling &quot;hung-over&quot; and had no alcohol or other medications in my system. In addition, I had extremely blurred vision (and seeing doubles) to the point it caused me to have severe migraines all day long at work (which I have never had before) - not to mention I have always had 20/20 vision (never had any blurred vision in my life). On top of all of these awful side-effects (as if they weren't bad enough) - I was very irritable, aggitated, paranoid, depressed, extremely anxious, nervousness, worsening of neck/back pain/stiffness, and just kept snapping at everyone for no reason at all. As a result, I decided to switch back to my 10mg Flexeril's. I may just need to consult with my doctor for modification of my dosage of the Flexeril. I am glad that this medication has worked for some; however, I wasn't fortunate enough for it to work for me.

For me it has been awesome.  After reading the reviews I call into question some of my past emotional instability and whether it is from this medication.  I have degenerative disc disease, double sway back and vertebrae breaking down - especially in my neck.  I am like a bobble head with my broken neck. This drug is not a pain reliever like a narcotic. It is spec. designed to reduce muscle cramps that cause pain.  Think of horrific leg cramps, i.e.  I see some are confused.  This works very well and sometimes spells the difference of walking that day and/or holding my head and shoulders up in combo with meloxicam (mobic).  It does not make me sleepy like antihistamines (flexeril) and other than muscle cramp/pain relief I cannot tell I'm taking it.  Have trouble with my liver via urinary infections. Hard on the liver (as is mobic) but my quality of life is so much better. Now ... if I can find a REAL doctor who will perform urinalysis occasionally like they are supposed to...  Sorry to hear about all the bad reactions!  I'll keep a closer eye on myself over the time.

But I do not like some of the side effects. I've had sexual side effects on this medication. This is not listed on the side effects page. So i've been trying to get off this medication but it's been very hard. This is not a controled medication but I think it should be. I've had bad withdrawl when trying to stop this medication. So I am trying to cut down slowly and finally get off it. Only problem is besides the withdrawl, I start to hurt again when I try  to cut down on it. It has been very hard and sometimes I wish my doctor never put me on this!

Muscle Spasms caused by a Spinal Disease	Cameo girl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	2/8/2012 2:57:50 PM	I have now taken Zanaflex for 9 months and it is the most effective medication for the severe muscle spasms I experience due to my spinal injury.  It can make you very sleepy so I would never suggest you take this outside your home.  For the person who took two after leaving the doctor's office and returning to work, that was a very unwise decision.  One should never take a new medication outside the home or a controlled area as you do not know how your body will react.  Zanaflex does casue severe dry mouth and dry eyes.  because of this I keep Biotene handy for my dry mouth, drink plenty of water and use artificial teas during the day and a ophthalmic gel at bed time.  Dirnk plent of water to avoid additional damage to your kidneys and liver.  Do not take with any other medication that can cause sleepiness.  Zanaflex can cause marked drowsiness so do not drive and most especially do not drink.  It works very well for my muscle spasms but it can have withdrawal side-effects so  consult with your doctor if you are going to stop this medication after taking it for a long period of time.

I'm now taking 2mg in the a.m., 2mg @ lunchtime &amp; 4mg in the late evening.  I like the med, I don't have any noticeable side effects, BUT I also take Topamax (for migraines as well) 100mg every time I take Zanaflex &amp; I have severe heaviness in the back of my head, constantly.  Migraines are better, strongly diminished but the heaviness is extreme &amp; I feel like I can't hold my head up-have to lie down.  I've exchanged one bad situation for another.  After lots of research, I think the 2 drugs are 'interacting' &amp; making me so groggy I haven't consciously realized it.  I think I will ask my Dr about this &amp; whether a different muscle relaxer would be better.

In one hour I was &quot;drunk&quot; at work! I could not function at all. Dr said I could &quot;work on this medication&quot; - well, not so far. But you sure do sleep well. Have had the sweating, but not the hallucinations. Sometimes I take one pill and when I'm going to sleep I take 2. Pain free sitting here right now.

Zanaflex has been a God send I not only do not have the muscle spasms I had to deal with daily but I also do not wake up in the middle of the night any more with muscle spasms. It really has been a wonder drug for me.

Muscle Spasm	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	10/13/2011 9:33:11 PM	The neurologist prescribed zanaflex for my muscle spasms associated with a c5/c6 herniated disc. I started on 2 mg each night. It certainly made me sleepy but I usually woke in 3 hours with more pain and spasm. Then in a couple days the dosage was increased to 4 mg. Severe side effects ensued. Dry mouth and sweating I can handle but the severe drowsiness and nausea were horrible, the latter especially in the middle of the night. I reported the symptoms to the dr and he told me to take more and even take it before driving to work. I immediately stopped taking it. There was no way I would tolerate that drug and get into a car. Patients should read the NIH info before starting this drug. I did. Once you are on it, you can have severe reactions during and getting off of it. Plus, it is super expensive. The 30 days supply I was prescribed would have cost over $200. Instead I got a 5 day dose of prednisone for $3, and turned to a chiropractor.

I would use it right before bedtime to help sleep. I would have some awesome dreams as a result of taking. Regrettably, I had to stop taking because my liver enzymes went through the roof. I also am taking Crestor. Since both work on the liver, it may be a good idea to have your Doctor closely monitor you while taking so you don't end up permanently damaging your liver.

I have severe spinal problems related ton bicycle accident 15 yrs. ago/degenerative disc disease (have had several major surgeries, and expect more soon.  Needless ton say, my drug tolerance is pretty high-although I have worked VERY hard with my doctors to keep them as low as possible - there are so many drugs for pain relief/insomnia/back spasms, etc - it took several different approaches/combinations/dosage, etc. Before I found the best solution(s) to treat my:  back (c-4,5,6 ~ L-2,3,4) spasms/pain, leg &amp; shoulder pain/cramps, headaches, etc.  My pain level without meds was 7-9 @ 50%  of the time.  The bottom line:  all drugs have side effects, most wear off or diminish with time (obviously, severe side effects are not acceptable, but extremely rare- I really think that most of the people who write the 'my nightmare' stories are either super sensitive (to everything) or have never taken anything stronger than Tylenol.    Do your research (on several websites) be willing to try something, but be firm to your doctor if it doesn't work for you, and make suggestions   to him @ what you want to try (yes, it's ok to admit you use Web MD to your Doc!). MY RECOMMENDATION FOR THIS DRUG:  4mg Zanaflex + 6-800mg Ibuprofen (prescription strength, not OTC) with food- start trying first time in evening.  Ibuprofen is an 'anti-inflammatory' and the combo. Works like magic!  Do NOT ever take Soma (aka: carisprodol - a diff. Rx muscle relaxer...it should be taken off market).Talk to your Pharmacist @ ANY. questions you have.  - I 'love' my pharmacist and staff!  (same as MD's - there are good/bad/indifferent ones...so 'shop around' if possible .

The first time due to very tense muscles across the top of both shoulders.  It didn't seem to help.  I'm now taking it to possibly help with frozen shoulder syndrome, which is VERY painful and long term.  The only thing I can tell is that it makes me sleepy, so I only take it at night. I usually can then get in about 4-6 hours of sleep before the shoulder pain wakes me. Sure wish there was a quick fix for this but I haven't found one yet.

I read all of the reviews on here, and I was really scared to take it! For me, it worked great! I was looking for something to replace Soma. I reciently changed health insurance and for some reason they don't cover Soma or the generic?! I have 3 chronic pain conditions and last night I was able to sleep a full 8 hours!!! I don't remember the last time that happened... seriously! I didn't have any of the weird side effects. I take 2 4mg tabs before bed and 1 4mg tab every 8 hours after that. I have tried flexeril and chloroxazone. No relief with them. The only thing I didn't like was the pain was so intense when I woke up and had to wait for the morning dose to kick in. Then again I am used to being in pain all the time, so I will take a half hour of pain over all day and night pain! Just to let you know what my chronic pain conditions consist of are 1 hurniated disc, two bulging and my left SI joint is grinding due to the ligament being overly streched out from years of dance. I also have chronic pelvic pain due to way to many operations, and IC of the bladder. I know, probably TMI, but it is all very painfull:(!
Other	writer997, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	55-64	6/10/2011 4:15:30 AM	My Doctor gave me this for Fibromyalgia. It works for the first few hours at night, then I wake up aching again. I am active during the day, so I can manage the pain and discomfort. It is when I try to relax and sit for any length of time that it bothers me. I have told my doctor this, but he just increased the dosage which makes me really dizzy, then backed it off again. Not sure if this going to work for me. I will discuss an alternative with him.

I decided the pain was not as bad for me as the sleep problems.
Muscle Spasm	Click, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Male	35-44	5/11/2011 10:36:40 AM	I've been receiving trigger therapy in my upper back, between the shoulder blades for a few weeks now.  Dr said myself and a &quot;roller derby girl&quot; were the worst he's ever seen....needle in my back was clicking loudly when it was inserted into the muscle!  Muscles were &quot;freaking out!&quot;  I've been on it for a few days, it works fairly well.  Taking 2-4 mgs 3-4 x per day....no drowsiness, lowers my bp, which is good cause I have  high bp normally.

I have continuous pain and muscle spasms and take the generic form of Zanaflex (tizanidine HCL) for this. This medication helps me cope with my pain and muscle spasms. It does make me a little drowsy so I only take it when I am going to be at home.
Muscle Spasm	MVA back pain, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Male	25-34	4/13/2011 1:00:48 AM	I have been taking it nightly for a week.  I changed up from Flexeral.  The difference was with this medication i did not wake up drowsy.  However a big side effect is hallucinations. I could sleep last night, I woke up three times, and thought there was something in my house.  i had to sleep with the lights on.  I have stopped this medication now.  Look out for this side effect, it is scary.

My dr. increased the dosage to 8mg @ night and I haven't had a migrane in a couple of weeks now. I have been on the 8mg for several weeks now. It doesn't make me sleepy during the day (4mg in the morning). So far so good, seems to be a good dosage.

Esp. when I take it @ night. Sometimes I'll take it in the morning. It makes me sleepy. I can't take it when I'm working. I'm also, on Perkiset &amp; Aderrall. I think with the combination of the 2 that is why I get some relief. I've been having problems with my back since they've found that I've got Disc Degenerative Disease. My disc slip all the time. I also have scolosis &amp; arthritus. For the 1st time in 10 yrs. I've finally got some relief with my pain. Thank U Zanaflex!!!

I suffer from degenerative disc disease and nerve pain due to pinched nerves. The problem is that this medication can make me feel like I am drunk! I slur, can't walk straight and usually end up passing out after 1 hour. The dosage is 4mg. I cannot take this medication during the day but it is effective before bed. I may try 2 mg during the day over the next weekend to see how it effects me. I drive during the day for my job so I can't take the risk of &quot;driving under the influence&quot;.

I can't give this med a good review yet b/c I've only taken it once...but as a heads up on the side effects, I was up and down that first night and most of the next morning with diarrhea and I felt cold all night long while under a sheet, blanket, fleece throw and down comforter.  And that was just a 2mg dose.

Waiting for the testing to see if I can get the baclofen pump. yes it causes drowsiness/dry mouth.  NO nightmares or hallucinations- wish it worked  better but thats the downside to progression of MS I suppose.

It started slowly like a couple times a month moving to a few times a week to every day and then multiple times a day, where he would have &quot;blackouts&quot; and fall, semi-conscious.  He was taken by ambulance at least 3 times from serious injuries because of these blackouts.    Had stitches in his head 2 times, numerous deep serious bruises and a broken foot.    This was a very stressful time for me (his wife) and kids when they were around.   We never knew when the blackout would happen.    There were many times when he blacked out in parking lots on the way into stores, inside stores, at home, outside in the yard.    As it got to 3, 4, 5 times a day, he was hospitalized 3 times in 3 months until a neurologist finally figured out it was Zanaflex related.   When they took him off the Zanaflex, the blackouts stopped completely.   We had 3 and a half years of this.   3 and a half years of a nightmare and he and I lost those years enjoying things because of this drug.

I might as well have taken a Tylenol. But the side effect really scared me, so I won't be taking them anymore. What's the point?? I have used Soma in the past and that is THE best and most effective muscle relaxer there is, but doctors act like you are asking for heroin. I can get all of the morphine I need for a month, but the disgust and shock when I ask for Soma is insane... especially when it is the only drug that helps at all. And I hate taking drugs that mess with the brain instead of just going to whatever body part they need to go to. OMG has anyone taken Ultram?? Yeah, doctors LOVE that it isn't AN OPIATE BUT IT MESSES WITH YOUR HEAD like mad!! Works 1 out of 5 times for pain and then just makes you a looney toons.. well I am not taking this pill long enough to turn me into Wile E Coyote either... forget it.. I have as much muscle pain as before I too the stupid pill!

Extremely effective and powerful muscle relaxant. My mistake was I took 8 mg. per normal @ 1AM and soon thereafter vomited/unrelated to the drug. Assuming I had also expelled the medication, I took 2 more. This was a mistake that almost cost me my life. The shortness of breath started and I ended up unconscious and in ICU. My BP had dropped to 90/40. The staff had my system and me back to normal within 24 hrs. Bottom line, don't misjudge the amount of time it takes to get into your blood stream and do not take more than prescribed. I Was one of the lucky ones.

I have multiple, chronic spinal problems along with Fibro, Chronic Fatigue, and insomnia.  Prior physicians repeatedly convinced me to try various anti-depressants.  But first, I'm not depressed (and I'm not in denial); two, all brands either made me ill or turned me into a sleepy zombie; and three, caused me massive weight gain (from size 8 to an 18 in only five years without any change to my diet.)  Finally, my current physician listened and prescribed a sleeping &amp; pain med and Zanaflex. I can now function around the home, but I am still unable to work outside the home.  However, I would caution a person to use Zanaflex only as directed and take adequate tablets with them if they're traveling out of town. I learned this by failing to correctly calculate the number of tablets I would need on our vacation and run out. So, a thousand miles from home, my B/P suddenly zoomed sky high, I became severely anxious, developed sweaty tremors, and could not sleep.  In short, this ruined the balance of our vacation, and I ended up in an out-of-state ER convinced I was having a heart attack. Of course I wasn't, and the ER physician explained that my symptoms were all the result of my sudden discontinuation of Zanaflex. He wrote me a prescription for Zanaflex and I later received a bill for several thousand dollars. He then added, &quot;most insurance plans will allow a vacation over-ride for an early refill if you might run out.&quot;

I only took Zanaflex maybe 1 or 2 times a week until I got hurt at work. I then started taking it every night as my spasms increased and I was unable to sleep from pain. It wasn't until 3 months later that I started looking for answers that I found a real list of side effects that have been bothering me, and never had before, and I never suspected it could be the drug. To name a few: stomach pains, abdominal cramps, severe diarrhea, night sweats, dry mouth and throat, nasal drip (how you can have those two at the same time is beyond me), bad dreams, hallucinations, increase in aggressiveness, depression, forgetfulness, and one hell of a &quot; short fuse.&quot;  I've since realized that I cannot use this drug if I want to have any good quality of living. The side effects are just TOO great for the benefit it provides for me. I understand that meds affect people differently, for me... I'll have to pass on Zanaflex. Hope this helps a few people who are looking for answers. God knows I thought I was losing my mind. =^\

Muscle Spasm	be careful, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	7/7/2010 12:08:35 AM	I was given this drug to relax muscle tone due to having thick skeletal muscle bodies. 4mgs capsules 3Xs daily. In 24 hours I was vomitting up food that looked undigested &amp; w/o nausea, straight to vomit. I had skin rash bilaterally, low blood pressure, insomnia, short term memory loss, urinary infrequency, w/in 6 days I was hospitalized due to a allergic reaction. The doctor that wrote the script failed to explain the interaction with caffiene, Pepcid and Tagament. With no appetite I was drinking caffinated cola, which I warned the PM about and stressed to him I am very sensitive to a majority of meds. The ER staff didn't know what the drug was or how to help me. If I hadn't read the label they were going to IV me w/ Pepcid for a cortico-steroid reaction that causes severe heartburn. I informed them that Pepcid can have serious interactio, &amp; because I read more and knew what I was saying they relied on me to give them what info I could. The icing on the cake is the PM that wrote the script never returned 10 calls/emergency pages in 5 days. I had to stop immediately and my pain is back, but it's better then being on Zanaflex. Doctors need to listen and communicate with their patients.
Muscle Spasm	iwantmyMTV, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/25/2010 2:00:49 PM	This medicine along with my percocet really helps.  I do not get sleepy like everyone else.  I also take Pamelor which has caused me much discomfort.  I have just recently found a doctor that will listen to what I have to say and not group me together with everyone else.  I am much happier now that I have been on these meds.  And my weight has gone from size 0 to size 4 Yeah!! I have taken other like Flexeril with ZERO results.  Doctor just upped my meds to 4mg and still I do not sleep.  But at least it controls my pain.  I suffer from Myofacial (sp?), Fibro, and lost all my muscle that supports my spine due to my stress and lack of taking care of myself after a gastric bypass.  I think if you have the right doctor then you can get the right meds.
Other	Brightspt2, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	6/10/2010 12:39:14 PM	My doctor prescribed this for me to see if it would help with my headaches.  I took the first one this morning, and it was also my last.  Within 5 minutes of taking it, I was nauseous and lightheaded.  While drinking milk for the nausea, and talking to my Mom to try to not think about, it, I started to cry, for absolutely no reason, and kept crying for a few minutes before I abruptly stopped.  My face has gotten all tingly, and fluctuates between feeling raw and feeling like I've had a numbing agent applied, although it's not numb when I touch it.  My heart feels like it's beating off, but I haven't had it checked, and I am SO tired.  I even messed up when trying to use my car remote (and no, I didn't drive).  And, I still have a headache!  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

I am on routine pain meds and meds fir break through pain. I had been on soma for the severe muscle spasms and related cramping/burning in my neck and shoulders. On my last MD visit my Md d/c'ed soma and ordered this med. I am so happy with the results! This is the 1st muscle relaxer I have taken that provides significant relief! Much more so than soma.   I only take it at night as my MD ordered and it does cause some sleepiness. However in my situation that is welcome. My pain has been interfering with sleep. I'd say it reduces the muscle burning and spasms by almost 75% for at least 3-4 hours. It has definetely improved the quality of my life!!!

I was prescribed this for severe neck pain, headache and also insomnia. I was averaging an ER visit at least once a month for IV pain meds and IV Ativan to stop the pain in my neck and head. This med worked miracles for me almost immediately! I felt the pain starting in my neck and took 2mg of Zanaflex and the pain never escalated to my head as it had in the past. This med is a godsend for me.I now take 2mg in the am and 2 mg in the pm and have been pain free. I have a little dry mouth but nothing major and no morning hangovers!

I felt a little sleepy but when i shut my eyes they dont want to stay shut. I also have the following side affects, nausia but not to the point of vomiting, stomach aches, diharia, and minor headaches. I also seem to get short dizzy spells here and there like i'm gonna faint while i'm laying down. I also feel weird for the first hour of the medications affects and thats when the dizzy spells come in. From the the things i've read about this med i wouldn't doubt the weird feeling which i really wouldn't call a drunkeness along with the dizziness has something to do with abnormal blood pressure this med seems to cause for a lot of people. Although i didn't check my blood pressure to confirm this.All in all this med is not for me, and this was my first and last dose.

It relaxes me, the dry mouth is actually gotten better, but can only take 2 mg at a time if i need to function. 4 mgs make me tired. Thru the night i take 6mgs/2 x's and i sleep well-taking lunesta too.  if i take 8 mg at a time i hallucinate and have crazy dreams. I do wish there was something that i could take and function thru the day that was stronger.  this just makes me too tired!!

More of a relaxer to aide in sleep. I only have to take half the dose to get a good sleep, but to get a full coma like sleep, the whole dose works well. I recommend getting all chores done before taking this medicine. I am useless after 30 minutes of taking the pill.

It makes my mouth like an old piece of dried out leather and I do nothing but sleep. Quality of life is poor for me with this medication, I will not tke it anymore. Suffering a stroke was bad enough, this med made life even  worse.

I took it for 4 days and then stopped it and returned to flexeril after I had accute dizziness, depression,[with suicidal ideations]and violant mood swings .I suffer with S.L.E. AND Fibromyalga.I also have meniere's  sydrome and can have an horrific vertigo episode from even just getting water in my left ear from the shower. This medication,ZANAFLEX, has caused me tremendous suffering and  close to fainting spells-even while just lying in bed.I may be the first to say this; but I think this medication may also be the colprit of my very recent depression and angry mood swings. Although I have returned to taking Flexerilonly 3 days ago, I can confidently testify [as can my immediate family and friends]that I am my old self again;very patient,not feeling irrate and very glad to report-not wishing to die in my sleep.The meneire's is much improved also.I have one qualm with the P.D.R. regardingZanaflex and that is so far- I have not readanywhere eles including the P.D.R. about any of the very DANGEROUS adverse reactions I have mentioned with the only exception ofdizziness.Can you PLEASE FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITYlook into the other reactions I advised you of?

It works-I sleep well but have suffured severe bowl spasms both times, and now recently have developed a severe rash on both elbows and wrist, and one hip. Stopped taking drug and took benadryl.Then developed flu symptoms with firehidrant vomiting and diaria with reched stomach pain. I reported all to doctor and was treated for flu.

It seemed to work for a few hours.

My doctor prescribed Zanaflex 2mg, and I must say, it was not the drug for me.  I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. I was extremely dizzy, constantly on the verge of passing out, VERY jittery, upset stomach, slurred speach, my chest hurt, and my heart was beating so fast, that it scared me.  I had to call my husband at work to come home and watch my kids, because I felt dangerously ill.  It did relax my shoulder muscles, but the side effects were not worth it for me. I am smaller than the average adult (4'11 and 100 lbs), so maybe that had something to do with it, but I had scary side effects.

I take 6mg 3 times a day. I still have spasms. I ran out of meds due to a mix up at the dr's office and realized i have became dependant on it due to withdrawal symtoms and asked the dr not to keep me on them. the withdrawl isnt awefull but enough that i dont ever want to go threw this again. My withdrawl includes tremors, irratability, nerviousness,lack of concentration just to give you an idea. the drs office assures me that this will pass and that if it gets intense to get the nearest ER. I feel for anyone that has been on this longer and stops taking it suddenly for whatever reason.

However, I can live with the side effect as I only take it before I go to sleep.  It really helps otherwise I would never get any rest due to chronic back pain. If you don't mind seeing a kaleidoscope of colors coming out of the wall or 1000's of bugs crawling out of the bathtub, or having the creepy sensation of being able to see thru your closed eyelids, then you might get some good relief, at least at bedtime.  I don't like the hallucinations, but otherwise I would never get a good night's sleep.

Muscle Spasms caused by a Spinal Disease	PacificLightsKen@aol.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/21/2009 1:46:49 PM	I have Osteoperosis, and had to have 3 Titanium cage's placed in my back 2 year's ago. At first, I was taking Percocet and Soma to deal with the pain after surgery, which did not elminate the pain. (MY surgeon did tell me it was a 50/50 chance the surgery would not help with the pain issue). After taking these med's for over 1 year, with no relief from the pain, I sought out a Pain Management Doctor. He has since placed me on 180mg of Morphine daily, Oxycodone, 45mg daily, and Zanaflex 16mg daily. I also receive epidural's once monthly, with steoid's and a numbing agent, into my facet joints in my back below my cage's in the Lumbar area, and in my first 3 cervical vertebrae. This seems to be working very well, and as long as I take my medication's on time, and receive the shot's, I can say that thing's are looking a lot better for me.  I am terrified of becomming addicted to the Morphine and Oxycodone.  I notice that when I don't take them every 8 hour's (Not at the same time, Morphine first, then 4 hour's later the Oxycodone, then the Morphine, etc...), I end up getting kinda shaking a little, so I am probably already hooked. In 2 years, I have not had to increase his original dosage which I see is a good sign.  Without the med's and the shot's, my body will not move, and I can feel my muscle's bunching up and then I begin having spasms in my back and neck. I never take more then I need and often skip dosage's, and then take the med's when I feel the pain coming back.Overall, I give this med 5 star's for spasms over flexeril or Soma's.

Haven't really noticed any side effects...I take other meds that have some of the same side effects as this. I don't always take the full dose if I don't need it or don't want to be too sleepy. I'll take 2mg instead. I like having that choice and control. Now I'm trying Parafon Forte DSC b/c of mood swings &amp; anxiety. We'll see how this new one works in comparison. If I don't get the same relief I'm switching back regardless of the side effects. But hell, I'm in pain 24/7...who wouldn't be moody?

I also have Fibro. severe pain 24/7, I take zanaflex at night as I would not sleep at all if I did not have this. I would tell others on there reviews to see about skelaxin, that is what my doctor gave me for daytime muscle relaxer. both of these meds work great for me. nothing is going to give pain free but this helps me to sleep some. and as for the dry mouth most meds do that I suggest half the tab. and if I don't go to bed when I take it it usually don't work as good. I have done thing after I took it at night with no bad side effects, it would not out weigh me getting relief and sleep...Hope this helps

Not all people who need them are on disability!  I work - or try too - but can not take this drug if I am going to drive and/or go to work.  It is impossible to stay awake and I am on the lowest dosage of 2mg!  I take it at night but am already in deep spasm, then.  I need it during the day but can not take it and have a life with any quality.

I have tried everything, with little or no affect of pain relief. I think I may have tried every type of narcotic available. This medication does more for nerve pain than anything I know of.The only downfall is the drowsiness. I almost always fall asleep about an hour after taking a 4mg tablet. I have taken half (2mg) but not effective enough for me.I have been taking this med for about 2 years and it is still working on me without building a tolerence to it. It has been a godsend ......

HOWEVER, the side effects are becoming increasingly difficult to deal with, including the night sweats, night terrors, and most disturbing of all, the horrible hallucinations I've been experiencing WHILE AWAKE!  I've read that one of the side effects can be &quot;seeing things that aren't there&quot;, so I was relieved that I wasn't going crazy, even tho I felt like I was losing my mind at times!  I've thought I've seen bugs crawling on me, people in my house when I'm alone, and even more horrible, terrifying visions I care not to mention.  But, you see, they appear VERY REAL TO ME, so it's very scary!!!  I have no history of mental illness, and am not an easily frightened person, as I'm a paramedic, and have seen plenty of gruesome things without blinking, but this really shook me up, I'll be honest.

Muscle Spasm	Jan Harrington, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	3/7/2009 11:42:35 PM	Scary drug!  I totally spaced out several times.  Found myself shut inside the pantry.  When I snapped out of it I was quite confused as to why I even went there to begin with.  But the worst part was the mood changes.  I became severely agitated and angry, probably to the point of being violent.  Luckily I took it at night when everyone was in bed because I swear I do not know what I would have done!  I was overcome with feelings of hurting someone/anyone for no reason.  I was aware that I was feeling this way, but could do nothing to stop it.  My husband rolled over and said I love you, goodnight and I felt like punching him in the face.  It took several hours for the anger to subside.  Be extremely careful when you take this drug, especially if you are taking care of small children!!

After several years of only partial relief from Topamax and Epideral injections, I've been taking zanaflex for 3 months now, and am 90% pain free. Initially the doc ordered 4mg 2x/day, but it made me too sleepy during the day and found the effect wore off between doses.  I changed to 2mg in morning and the afternoon, and 4mg at night.  It's helped so much that on most days I only take the morning and bedtime doses!  I thank God for this medication and for giving me a great doctor! (Dr John Knab in Wilmington, NC)

I wake up now every 3 which is not bad considering not sleeping at all.  It helps my leg pain and back spasms well.  When my duragesic wears off, I take one and if it doesn't work, I know it's time to change my patch.  I've been able to drop other meds because of this med.  I do not get the hungover effect and can drive the next day and do next to normal activities (limited).   I've tried Soma and it's heavy.  This is perfect for me.  It is addicting and I don't plan to get off this med because of the withdrawals, however, this med has been a Godsend for me. Don't take more than you're prescribed and you ought to be okay with the hangover effect.  It doesn't make me slur, stumble or fall to sleep in my dinner plate.  However, once I take it, I make plans to go to bed and ready myself for bed.  I don't start cleaning the house, etc...  I do as the doctor says.  I don't try to be superwoman.  It's a miracle drug.  It doesn't even make you gain weight.  Amazing, most drugs do.  I'm happy with it.

Thank God I didnt choke. I reccommend that you do not eat after you take this medicine. I sleep solid for about 4-6 hours, and I wake up feeling very refreshed. I like this medication because it doesn't leave me feeling like I have a hangover and sluggish. Zanaflex helps my back tremendously. I also use it as a sleeping pill since it is fast acting and leaves me feeling refreshed and well rested.

I mentioned how tired I am having to get up at 6am M-F with little to no sleep &amp; no naps during the day.  I thought he would give me Ambien or Restoril (which both work for me, Ive had them prescribed in the past), but instead gave me Zanaflex.  He asked if I needed something mild or did I need to be hit over the head with a bigger hammer LOL!   I suggested going with the info I had just given him, so he prescribed 6mg of Zanaflex right before bed.  He did not write an official script for me to go &amp; fill, just gave me sample boxes, which contained; 3 capsules to a card, 2mg each &amp; 3 cards to the box.   He then told me to keep coming in for the samples as I needed them.  I have very good insurance, but this is great!  (He did ask about how well my Ins. covered scripts before he offered the samples).   I didnt start with the 6mg, instead I decided to start with 2mg and go from there.  Ive never really taken muscle relaxers before &amp; did not know how I would react to them.  Im sure that I will eventually be taking the prescribed amount of 6mg due to tolerance and such, but for now I wanted to try the lowest dose &amp; work my way up as needed.  At 2mg, I have some of the same effects as others, only when I stay up and dont go to bed right away, the drunkenness feeling and dizziness.  I have not experienced dry mouth, but then again Ive only been taking Zanaflex for a week now at 2mg .  It does help me with sleeping &amp; I can wake up in the morning without a lot of grogginess.  I was just a little surprised at being prescribed a muscle relaxer for sleep &amp; not the usual sleep meds.  I dont have muscle spasms nor do I wake w/ leg cramps &amp; such.  I have just plain ol insomnia &amp; a brain without an off switch!

Which is why I took it for 8 yrs.But it is highly addictive and nearly killed me when I stopped taking them. I suffered a small stroke from my BP going so high, non stop vomiting and diareah for 10 days.  Lost 40 pounds in 2 weeks.  Didn't sleep for a week straight.  Hallucinations, dizzy and couldn't walk at all.  I slept on the floor in the bathroom for over a week.  Stupid me didn't go to the hospital either.

Muscle Spasms caused by a Spinal Disease	Alan, R.N., 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	35-44	2/6/2008 4:01:08 AM	This drug, even in small doses, causes dry mouth, which required me to keep a bottle of H20 at the bedside.  I would wake up an average of two times nightly and have to take a small drink of water because my mouth and throat were severly dehydraded, causing a burning sensation.  Furthermore, to be effective, this medication had to be increased in small (1 to 2mg) increments or I would experience a druken stuper type sensation, which was unpleasant.  I experienced this feeling when I first started taking this medication, which was 4mg by mouth approximately one hour prior to bedtime.  At 6'4&quot; tall and 250 lbs., prior to this, most medications I have taken, including strong doses of short and long-acting narcotic analgesics, required a significant dose increase to be effective for me.

Muscle Spasm	soulcarrier, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/12/2008 8:13:26 PM	No other medication stopped the spacisity in my legs, after suffering a concussion.I would wake up from the muscle spasms in my neck and legs from sleep, as the bed would be shaking.  With this medication I am able to sleep, but still wake when needed.  I was concerned that I would be unable to work overnight, on call, at the hospital, once I took my PM dose of Zanaflex, and that my ability to wake to being paged would be hindered, and it was not.  I was able to successfully resume work, without the use of a cane or walking aide, as long as I use the full dose prescribed of Zanaflex.I did experience horrible pain, once hospitalized, and unable to hold down my RX due to vomiting.  The pain RX did not manage the leg pain that resulted from my bodies lack of regular dosage of Zanaflex and the Dr did not prescribe a liquid dosage IV.  If one is hospitalized and unable to take oral RX dosage, a family member or patient needs to insist/request the liguid dosage to maintain levels and muscle spasm relief.

I have tried starting at a low dose and working up to the amount the DR. has prescribed, but most likely my other meds interaction with zanaflex mean that I will no longer be using this medication.

The drawbacks have been the dry mouth and the possibility that my last 4 kidney stones were caused by Zanaflex. The last one was 4mm x 6mm no fun there for sure. The alternatives to Zanaflex are either too sedating or stay in my system so long it makes me loose time because I just cannot function (Flexeril) or makes me dizzy after it should be worn off (Soma).

Other		5	5	4			9/25/2007 10:29:55 PM	I did not react well to the generic Zanaflex, most likely the binding agent in it. However, the Brand name has decreased my muscle spasms due to a herniated disk in the upper cervical vertebra.
