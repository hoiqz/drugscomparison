Accumulation of Fluid Resulting from Chronic Heart Failure	Reddevilsurvivor, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/11/2012 10:00:18 AM	This pill is like magic at removing the fluid.  I take 5mg and was instructed to use it no more than once a week (because it strips all electrolytes also). I take spironalactone 50mg and demadex 60 mg daily also. My instructions were to take the metolazone I hr before the other two diuretics. When I take the metolazone I pee like crazy for 3 days. I also have to take prescription potassium to keep from getting severe leg cramps. It works wonderful for my condition.

Metolazone could get water out of a rock. I do however have much lower potassium from taking this, so if you are thinking of taking it make sure to to have your Dr. check your levels regularly, I take 800MG of an OTC Potassium Chloride (make sure it's Potassium chloride as other types of potassium will not be enough to make a difference no matter how many you take) daily and it seems to keep my levels within normal range.

I have stage 4 kidney failure and I also have COPD and congestive heart failure. If I want my heart and lungs to work I take the combo of drugs until my blood work shows that my kidneys are failing then I stop the duo for a couple of weeks.

I have no other problems relating to the use of this med. Lasix is not fully effective but seems to work better. I am also uncomfortable taking a drug for med. conditions that do not exist. 
Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	8/4/2009 7:25:31 PM	My physician placed me on 120mg of prednisone for an immune disorder.  I immeditely began swelling, picking up over ten pounds in just a few days.  He tried me on lasix, with no results.  The day after taking my first 5mg dose of Metolazone, my ankles and feet were back to normal, and I was 2 pounds lighter.  The next day, my face had nearly returned to normal, and I was only 4 punds heavier than before the prednisone.  This medication worked wonderfully for getting rid of the fluid.

Will only take twice a week as addition to lasix I take daily, but already getting results just from the first dose.

I also suffer from acute kidney failure.  This med has greatly helped to reduce the generalized edema I have, nearly 25 pounds if water weight loss has been realized in just four days!  I breath easier...can move about easier.  I feel so much better it is amazing.  I will likely take this med along with Lasix daily.  It clearly helps to potentiate the effects of Lasix.
