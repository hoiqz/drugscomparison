The main side effect is severe fatigue, I'm often so tired I can hardly move. Having said that, it's very effective, and certainly better than the alternative.

Casedex takes my psa down to .07 from 255. When I am off, it increases, then I take it and it decreases. I don't know how long this can go on before one becomes immune to it. Side effects are worth it. Mostly breast enlargement and some itching, but lotion works.
