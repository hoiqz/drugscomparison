So...don't do that.

When he is on it he walks around like a zombie. I believe he hallucinates and hears things.  He asks me questions that I have no idea what he is talking about and the he gets mad at me because I don't understand. I can't stand to be around him when he is on these things.  I think he takes too many, but he won't let me control them. I am afraid to go to sleep at night, I never know what I will wake up to. He is always breaking and spilling.  I hate this drug.

Was feeling nauseous most of the day, lost a lot of weight, and became very anxious.  Took a low dose ativan 2x/day for a month and got back on track emotionally and physically.  Followed the dr's plan and decreased grandually with very little adverse effects.  Whatecer you do, consult with your doctor before you adjust any doses, and follow advice to the letter.  I am so grateful to be back to myself and I would not hesitate to go back to ativan again if I needed to.

My uncle takes it, so he recommended it. I saw a doctor and he decided to give it to me, and so far it works well. I take it as needed, which is usually 2-3 times a week. At first it worked amazing, now im starting to notice its not as strong. I feel calmed, but anxiety symptoms might peek in but I feel more relaxed and dont panic as much about it when I take Ativan. .50mg, 2-3 times a week. At times in the past ive had to take it 2-3 days in a row, and I noticed I felt depressed. I doubt I can take it everyday.

Your tolerance builds significantly faster than opiates if you up your dosage or take more than recomended. Do not take with other benzos like clonapin or xanax it will increase the effects and you'll probably go into a sleep coma for a couple days and don't mix with any amount of alcohol at all. Over I was really satisfied.

It worked very well.. actually a little TOO well. To be honest it was such as strong medication, even at it's lowest dose, that I have hardly any memory as to what happened while I was taking it. I was so drowsy while on it, I could practically be a zombie! Works well, but a tad too strong for me. So I got off of the medication to switch to another one that was less strong.

I took this med for 15 years 1 mil gram each day. after retiring, i started breaking my tablet in 4 pieces for about a month and came off the meds completely for a year. i had to start taking again about a month ago and this week i have start to break in 4's again, taking only when neede and it is working fine. this helps me not to become addicted. It is a very good drug and should be used wisley.

While in CCU, the nurses gave him 1 mg every 3-4 hrs in his IV so he would sleep, otherwise he would lie awake all night and bug them. As soon as it was pushed in his IV, he fell right asleep in about 5-10 minutes.  Now, at home, while recovering, we give it to him on some nights when he has insomnia, in the 1 mg pill format. The pill takes about 1-2 hours to make him feel anything at all - definitely not as effective as the IV formulation was. It doesn't make him feel sleepy, but it relaxes him enough that he will dose off. It does not keep him asleep, though - he wakes up every 2 hours or so throughout the night. We usually have to give him 2 doses about 5 hours apart. The second dose seems to have a much better effect on enabling him to sleep.  However, his cardiologist now wants him off the Ativan due to the addictive side effects, and has put him on Ambien to sleep instead.  The Ambien doesn't seem to do much of anything for him. I would say the Ativan is a good drug if you are keyed up, restless feeling or have anxiety, simply to calm you. I doesn't seem to make my dad fuzzy headed or unable to function after he wakes up, so that is good.  He is 63, 5'11 and 330 pounds, so perhaps the 1mg pill is too weak for a man of his size. We will try some other natural remedies to help him sleep so he doesn't need to Ativan as much.

Anxious	pookie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/3/2011 10:15:18 PM	Before taking this medicine I had no life I had full blown panic attacks and couldn't leave the house due to anxiety and depression.  They tried me on other medications but they always made me feel loopey.  My life was destroyed by my mental illness but when they put me on ativan the tension, heaviness in my heart, the shaking and feeling like my life was over all went away.  I was back to being myself again and have ever since.  Sure I have some bad days but don't we all.  Just to live normal again and not have the fear in your heart or in your head is worth it to me.  You need to take your meds as prescribed and don't increase the meds or drink alcohol with them.  I have been blessed they finally did find something to help me live a more normal life.  All meds work differently on people so just work with your doctor and what works for you to be a normal person again is what it's all about.

Over a nine month period I have taken a total of 35 tablets when stress starts to build and symptoms of an impending panic attack are experienced.  So far, the generic lorazepam has worked well with no noticeable side effects. Almost immediate relief from an impending panic attack is achieved. However, many of the reviews of this medication are alarming.  I am concerned that the drug may be responsible for many of the difficult to read cryptic posts.

Anxious	danieldom, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	5	3	Male	19-24	7/20/2011 2:43:42 PM	This medication seems to be slower acting than it's counterpart Xanax. It's great for a quick panic attack of if you need to be in a crowd of people. It doesn't get you 'high' unless you abuse if profusely. Just beware if you do choose to overdo this drug. It is capable of competely stopping your heard rate because your body becomes so relaxed. Only take as prescribed. Even as prscribed you will get the same effect, just at a slower pace. I have been on Ativan for about 4 months now an it helps quite a lot when i need to meet new people. I almost fear &quot;Fearless&quot;. I will just walk up to someone and introduce myself  and strike up a conversation. In a work environment you become more productive. You no longer feel like you are 'dragging ass' the entire day just waiting for it to be over. Only think i worry about is dependance. Get yourself  good support system. Family is the best since they know you more. I also have my Doctor and therapist to keep an eye on me. I suggest many of you can do the same if possible. I watched my brother start out on Xanax, and now he's a cocaine head, meth addict, crack addict, and will do anything to feel high. **BEWARE** 
Anxious	capulet, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/11/2011 1:55:39 PM	I take ativan for my anxiety that I have had for years.  I take Buspar regularly, and then Ativan, as needed, and it helps for those breakthrough anxiety moments.  It is addicting though and you will build up a tolerance.  I find that 0.5mg does not work as well as it used to.  I normally take about once a day in the evening as it seems my anxiety is worse then, and it helps me sleep also.  Definitely can't live without it.

Anxious	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	6/18/2011 4:27:42 PM	I recently had to start flying again after 10 plus years, due to my job. My doctor prescribed Ativan, and although a little skeptical, I can say with 100% conviction, that this helped me alot. I was completely awake and conscious for the duration of a recent 4 hour flight, however I was quite calm and felt like I was in my comfort zone, a &quot;business as usual&quot; type feeling. The drug did make me a bit drowsy as it began to wear off, after about 4 hours. The drug took about 10 minutes to start taking effect.

I am about 110lbs, 5'4&quot; and the .5 calms me down but doesn't make me a zombie, while the 1mg usually makes me pass right out and have a great sleep. Sometimes it feels like the drug takes up to an hour to take affect, but once it does I feel great. When I am really anxious, I feel the effects more quickly, within 15 minutes. I only take them when I feel anxious, and it usually helps my anxiety go away long enough for me to deal with my problems, so I never feel myself &quot;coming down&quot; from it. Both doses feel like they last the same amount of time (about 6-7 hours), but the calming effect is just stronger with the 1mg.

Anxious	Lindalu, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/12/2011 6:20:23 PM	I have been on lorazapam for 8 years. I started taking 0.5 mg 3Xs a day after being kidnapped, beaten and threatened to be shot. I was diagnosed with PTSD.  This medication helped me get my life back together.  I too did not feel that I was addicted, until my new doctor advised me to stop taking it. He felt that at age 64 the medication would continue to cause problems with my balance and would end up causing additional problems. It would be easier to get off of it now than later.  Even though he has been taking me off slowly, I have had really bad side effects.  Believe me, this is an addictive drug!  While it helped me deal with my problems initially, it also caused me problems.  I do have issues with my balance and took a nasty fall (for no apparent reason)a few years ago. My doctor says it is alcohol in pill form.

It works Great for a couple weeks, you will love it, and then you will discover your body has grown chemically dependent on it.  The effects of that are  truly disastrous.  Ativan is a strong fast acting benzodiazopine  which is not safe for use longer than a week.  You will truly regret using this drug.

I restarted the ativan to stop the side effects. Also, ifI only take one mg. at bedtime to help me sleep - I have withdrawal reactions the very next afternoon - especially terrible needles and pins in arms and legs. I have near taken a drug in which you begin withdrawal reactions within a 24 hour period - how strong and such a short lifespan for a drug.

Anxious	GodLovesU, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/11/2011 2:03:50 PM	A few weeks ago, I was in the ER having a panic attack, and I was having trouble breathing and I had really bad akathisia which means that I couldn't stop moving. I had been suffering from the akathisia for about a year. Right after I started taking Ativan I had no more breathing problems and my Akathisia stopped!  This drug along with my faith in God, and my family and friends helps me a lot with feeling inner peace and helps me with my restlessness. So to anyone experiencing trouble breathing during a panic attack or akathisia for any reason, I would highly reccommend Ativan.  Good luck to all of you and God Bless

On the few times I have run out, I have spend sleepless weekends and the old anxiety is back. You cannot just discontinue abruptly wihout having withdrawal symptoms.  Now,I must wean myself off since the doctors do not care and I can expect a period of symptoms which are more than uncomfortable and lots of sleepless nights!

I was struggeling with Chronically severe anxiety (Always thinking I was about to die do to my heart, and other many many Illogical fears) And tried an assortment of medications that did almost nothing.2MG of this pill (2MG for my weight - 185) worked amazing.It does Indeed calm you down, but not that &quot;I'm high&quot; feeling or &quot;I'm so tired I just want to sleep&quot; feeling.This medicine made me feel &quot;normal&quot; for once. Though getting this medicine may be extremely hard to do, you might be extremely happy that you tried.If you're taking any of the Benzo's (Klonpopin, Xanax, Buspar ect) then this medication should never cause you to withdrawl.However, It can become &quot;mentally abused&quot; by which It's you new &quot;Emergency medicine&quot; and if you run out, why you may not be withdrawing being out can easily send you into a massive chain of panic attacks.Please ween yourself off of this medicine as It produced visions, night tremors ect for myself.Please do not abuse It either as It directly effects the brain, be careful.The normal dose Is 1MG 2x a day.Some people MIGHT take 1MG 3x a day.Some people MIGHT take 2MG 1x a day, or, 2x a day If they can handle It (Tollerance)Taking this medicine for myself Has prooven to remove 100% of my anxiety and fear for about 1 hour, or so. Extremely effectly In my opinion and is very affordable.

Now this past wkend I have had clusters of panic attacks even w/the celexa. I don't know how to explain to her so she will understand that I can't afford $124 (with insurance) every time I need a refill, single 30 tabs.

I only take it once or twice a week since it is very habit forming.  It is great for insomnia but does nothing for my stress or depression.  I get up the following day with hangover like symptoms:  fatigue, cloudy headed, etc.  In summary, this drug is a great sleep aid if you can tolerate the hangover the following day.

When I had that panic attack I remembered feeling the exact same TERROR, when I was a young child, maybe 5 or 6. I've been coping w/it my whole life; not a good test taker, always shy and to myself, then later in life did the drinking and other stuff to get me numb... it just wasn't working. My doc prescribed Ativan (.5mg up to 4x a day) right away, along with Zoloft. It's been one year, and although I do have mini attacks now and again, I am in control - I take .5mg and within minutes I am better. I have never actually taken the full 2mg a day. This drug has saved my life... my relationships, my job... and I now enjoy life like I know I should.

Many employees at my work have stressed related disorders.  For me getting pysically ill stomach aches, headaches and a general feeling of not wanting to go inside of the building.  Then one day going to work I couldnt breath felt like I was suffucating. My doctor gave me a prescriptian of Ativan. Told me to try it at home to see how I react to it prior to taking it at work with an attack and to only take it with an attack. Tried it for 3 days. Every time with in 45 minutes of taking it I was passed out, unable to function there is no possible way I could take this at work. My doctor switched my med to Xanax, so far it is helping with out knocking me out.For me Ativan would be a perfect sleeping pill not a med to function on.

Anxious		1	3	1			10/14/2010 11:43:11 AM	This drug is pure brain damage. It feels great at first but if you take this drug everyday for just one month you will lose your short term memory and when you get off the drug your anxiety will be permanently worse and your muscles will be much more tense and rigid then you ever thought possible and your memory will never be as good. DON'T TAKE THIS DRUG MORE THAN ONCE A WEEK! OTHERWISE IT WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE!

Doctor didn't even try weaker things, just went straight to Ativan. Big mistake! Caused excessive sleeping, memory loss, language difficulties, serious mental confusion. And the half-life was very long so it took close to a week after I STOPPED the medication before the side effects wore off. It's a horrible drug, and I would hope they take it off the market someday.

After a month's worth , the insomnia came back w/a vengeance. Withdrawl was horrible. he should have rx'd an SSRI. I became extremely depressed.Then came the Ativan. Excellent for panic but highly addicting. listen to others w/ experience w/ this drug...yes it works, but too well. i also suffer from OCD, and because of it's high addictive profile it's the wrong thing 4some1 like me to be on. The craving you get are horrible. If you can, please don't start using. Ask your Psych about  Buspar, natural remedies (Homeopathy) to releive anxiety. Take 5htp, or melatonin at night. See if calcium ingestion at night helps you sleep. There's a reason Dr's out there don't like to prescribe this, but other's unfortunately are too quick w/the pen. Remember you have choices. Don't despair and god bless. don't add addiction to your list of problems.

I started this drug for difficulty falling asleep that came on with menopause. Worked great-no side effects. With sleep I am perfect during the day. But my Dr. will only prescribe it along with an antidepressant, so now on zoloft too-side effects-weight gain/sexual-Ugh...not happy about that. Benzos like ativan are addicting though and she wants me to eventually ween off the ativan and stay on the zoloft only. I tried this last year and couldnt just get off the ativan, so I weened off both slowly after a year with no problems...had 8 months med free...5 good months then 3 struggling...and now the need to start all over. Now have to try to come off it again and stay on the zoloft. I take one .5 at 5pm and two .5 at 9pm. Slept thru the night for the first time in a very long time. Tonight I will stop the 5 pm one as I want to keep the dose as low as possible. On zololt 25mg now...going up to 50 next week per Drs orders, but I'd like to stay at 25 and just might.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	8/1/2010 1:14:15 AM	Highly addictive. Not worth it. When you finally realize how it has caused memory loss of precious moments of life and worse symptoms than before taking the drug you'll find out how addictive it is. It makes a person a slave to the medication. A fear comes over one...&quot;what if my doctor stopped prescribing this?&quot;. You can't help but feel that the pharmaceutical company making this is nothing more than a dealer and you are &quot;hooked&quot; on a &quot;drug&quot;.  After over 20 years on this I am here to say it is possible to quit taking it. It must be done slowly and decreased without cheating. You can be a &quot;human&quot; with feelings again. No need to be a &quot;zombie&quot; just functioning on &quot;auto&quot;. In a literal physical way &quot;feeling&quot; has returned. Being alive again with all the pains of reality is so much better. If you are out there trying to quit ativan, stick to it. You will succeed. I am proof you can.

I'm an EXTREMELY anxious (borderline bi-polar/depressive) person and things have just been getting worse lately, w/ struggling to pay bills, work, provide for my family, etc. a month ago, my doc increased my dose of ativan to 1mg 2x/day and put me on Prozak. I almost killed myself after 3 weeks on prozak.  Prozak is a HORRIBLE DRUG!  anyway, back to the ativan, yesterday my doc increased my ativan to 3x/day and added deprokote.  I'm hoping this will finally calm me down enough to enjoy life and have a little more patience w/ people.  Overall, ativan has been pretty good for me w/ no side effects.

Before that I used Librium for panic disorder but eventually stopped using it with the instant result of insomnia.  After a few years of insomnia I tried many medications to help and finally came across Ativan which instantly helped.  I have used Ativan ever since and occasionally use during the day when feeling extreme anxious.  I feel I will have to use this for the rest of my life.  I am now 69 years old.  Started using Librium at 21.

Tension Headache	Stepher, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	5/22/2010 3:13:16 PM	I have to say that I have had bad headaches since i was 16yo and i am now 30.  After getting a MRI and years of trying to find a causes i found that if i took something that relaxed me and layed on a heating pad for about 30min i would feel better. Tylenol made then worse and ibuprophen made me sick...Long story short. My Dr has started me on Ativan 1 mgt 2x daily morning and afternoon (i am also now on amitryptiline 50mg at night) and i have noticed a MAJOR difference! I am nowhere near as anxious and once i started this med, after a few weeks i felt normal for the first time in YEARS. My mom has anxiety issues also, just hers come in panic attacks and mine is constant which causes major headaches.  I have a very stressful job as a dispatcher and 2 yound boys at home so i know stress and i have found that Ativan has given me my life back.  I do believe that eventually i will have to go up to something a little stronger but i am just relieved to have finally gotten some answers and relief from headaches that i had usually 5-6 times a week, sometimes lasting for days at a time. Now they are about 2x a weeks if that...Life is better now than it has been in a long time :)

This is a med you have to use daily not as a prn. Xanax is better for prn use since it hits harder than Ativan. Ativan does work with my extreme anxiety, but not so much with my panic attacks. Xanax works better for that. I haven't experience any complications and i've been on it (1mg ativan) for 3 months now :]

She is 93 and never had to take drugs except atenolol.  She broke her ankle and needed to be confined to bed so nursing home doctor prescribed ativan as well as pain medication to keep her in bed.  Could not stay awake and started talking gibberish and was totally out of it.  We were sure she had had a stroke.  Was sent to ER where they did CAT scan and blook work.  ER physician said it was absolutely not a drug to be given to older people as it affected their balance and their brains.  Hard lesson to learn but hope this keeps others from making same mistake.  Could have killed her, but she is again bright and cheery and in bed, thanks to family 24-hour surveillance.

Anxious	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	5/13/2010 12:54:51 PM	Ativan worked great for me.  Took .5mg a day for about 1 month and really helped me with my anxiety.  I actually wanted to get out of the house and do things, which I never could do before.  But after about 3 weeks of taking it I developed an irregular heartbeat.  The doctors say that the Ativan is not related to the palps but I never had anything wrong with my heart before I started taking the Ativan.  Now on a beta blocker to calm down the irregular heartbeats but that is a whole different story.

I am a simple person, living a simple life, I work full time and I am having problems just paying my bills,  I could not exist without this drug. I don;t drink because I worry about my liver. I take this medicine occasionally, no more than two at a time, and not every day.  I find that I can drive if necessary  and it calms me when my patience is wearing thin. It keeps me from crying, as I can't tolerate most antidepressants. This drug is my saving grace!!! I highly recommend it to anyone, in moderation!   5 stars for sure!!! and the  generic is cheap!!!

It makes me have the patience to deal whith constant negativity. I find I can drive with just one or two. I don't take more than that at one time. I do not drink with it, as it impairs me rather quickly not to mention I worry about my liver. Although I don't ever abuse it and I don't take it every day, I couldn't live without it! It grounds me when I need something. It is my saving grace!!! I recommend it to anyone in moderation!!!

Other	voxian twitch, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	5/4/2010 9:47:42 PM	I was initially medicated at an ER due to severe tics and panic attacks I was having due to my Tourette's.  (I was hitting myself and jerking so much it was horrible)I was giving Ativan IM injection around 10:00 at night in the ER, which made me very drowsy, and made my vision blurr. I recall talking about how I saw 4 doctors, though I knew it was only a split in my vision.I can't remember anything after lying down on the gurney, or the following day, other than what I've pieced together.My parents were given a 'scrip for tablets, which they had filled immediately.Well, we went home that night, and the following day, according to my parents, I became very agitated, to the point of physically ripping the clothing off of my body... (I'm glad I don't remember that) and clawed at myself, at which point my doctor told us to go to the ER and request admission to the pychiatric unit.I didn't know what to think--I was terrified and watned to stop having these crazy movements and feel alittle calmer, and stop breaking things.At the ER, I was physically restrained and given yet another dose of Ativan, at which point, I became delusional, and believed the ER staff were cannibals whom planned to eat me.It took two days and several consultations with neurologists and psychologists to sort out the facts: I was a teenage girl with a movement disorder who had a severe psychotic reaction to Ativan....pretty much, adn I went home, horrified at what had happened.  Taht's not all that transpired in the ER, but that's not the point.  My point is this: it can do things to you.Ativan made me psychotic.  It is very rare, but it has happened, and doctors may not always recognize this.
Anxious	Regretful, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	5/2/2010 6:13:10 AM	to those who think this is NOT addictive, I say haha...try running out of the stuff for a few days &amp; see how you feel.  I rely on a mail-order service for my prescriptions &amp; my Ativan refill was &quot;lost in the mail&quot; for a week.  During the dreadful cold turkey stage I gradually got numb &amp; trembling extremities and trembling lower jaw.  I was convinced I had Lou Gehrigs Disease; I was convinced that if I got in my car to go to the ER I would get in an accident &amp; die also.  Finally called a friend to take me to ER where they gave me a shot of Ativan &amp; a temporary supply to last until my refill arrived.  It doesn't help my anxiety at all but I can't stop taking it due to the horrible withdrawl side effects.

I have major anxiety that has interfered with my life and just a few days ago tried to commit suicide due to being on the wrong anti-depressant.  Well, coming off of that brought on the shakes and more anxiety, so the Dr. put me on this and it is working well.  Finally, a day or 2 where I can actually be calm instead of a nervous wreck.  I don't know if I can be on it for very long, but it's nice to have it in my medicine cabinet for when you really need it cuz Prozac alone won't cure all anxiety.

It causes permanent problems with memory, concentration, muscle tension, inner tension, anxiety and depression. When you get off this drug all of your symptoms before you got on it will be 100 times worse. This is pure misery and no one should ever get addicted to it.

Anxious	 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5	Male		3/30/2010 4:12:04 AM	I have been on Lorezapam (generic for Ativan) for about 12 years now. I have stopped taking it for periods of time (up to 3 months or more), but only wound up having acute panic attacks again and often hospitalized since some of my symtoms were considered life threatning. It is the only medication that has been able to prevent me from having acute anxiety attacks and some other health problems especially hypertension(the silent killer). The reason I would stop taking it was because of all the &quot;BS&quot; I heard about how harmful it could be and was very addictive and you would have to take more and more of it, not so with me!  I take 1 mg twice daily and it does the trick, I am able to function totally normal while taking this medication with NO SIDE EFFECTS!I have been told by Doctor's that the 1 mg dose I take twice a day is considered a small dose and is not harmful to me and actually benefical for me to take because of the other health problems I have. Sometimes I will only take 1 MG daily and have NEVER taken more than 3 MG in one day.From my personal experience with this medication, I would rank it right at the top if you need treatment for acute anxiety.As for the treatment of anxiety before I started taking Lorezapam, THEY ALL FAILED!Yes, I understand this is not the case for others, if you have suceeded my some other method, GREAT! But if you are going to need medication, myself I don't know of anything better. Doctor's have tried me on everthing else from just plain Aspirin and a night of good sex to Thorazine.

Anxious	Bob, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	3/27/2010 9:06:38 AM	I originally started on this medication back in 1985 when it was given to me for panic attacks - I tried several other drugs before ativan (including the various anti depressant drugs, all of which did nothing except produce terrible side effects) and none of them worked - ativan worked immediately and I have been on it ever since - at one point, I was taking 6mgs per day and am now on a regular dose of 1mg. I have to laugh at all the medical experts who warn against long term use of ativan (and similar medications) suggesting patients will require larger and larger doses for effect when the exact opposite has been the case for me - the only side effect I experience is the relief of anxiety. I am now in excellent health, do not suffer from panic attacks nor any anxiety beyond the usual day to day stress, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this medication to anyone given my experience. I would rate it a class A medication in all respects!

I took one pill following complications of surgery and didn't wake up for over 24 hours.  I was told that the whole time I was passed out, I was hallucinating and scratching the roof of my mouth.  Very scary!  I've never taken it since.  I lost an entire day and don't remember anything which is terrifying.  Obviously not the right medication for me.  I have since switched to a combination of Zoloft/Klonopin and my anxiety is almost non-existent.

It really helped to sooth me.  I do not take it every day; only as needed if I have a panic attack.  It works great for helping me to relax.  I wouldn't recommend taking every day unless you have no other option because it is a highly addictive medication.

After a while the drug's effect lessens slightly, but it has changed my life completely and no longer have panic attacks or trouble sleeping.

Other	anonymous,  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	4	1			2/12/2010 12:08:34 PM	This drug was given to my father who is 77 yrs old while in the hospital because he was agitated.  He has dementia and this made him worse.  He started having night terrors, screaming and hallucinating the entire night.  I got home and looked up this drug and see under side effects that this drug can work the opposite in the elderly.  I think the docs should have known that this drug was not appropriate for the elderly before prescribing it.  I'm not sure what the dose was, but it has lasted for 18 hrs already and he is only slightly better.  I hope this does not cause a permanent change in him.

At the ssme time i don't like drugs and have fears of getting even sicker if i stop taking it all together...lately i've been getting really bad headaches too. I have a hard time just getting through the day.So this is not a drug that makes me feel really good.The lord knows i want to just go back to being naturaly calm and sleep well at night.On the bright side of this whole experience exercise and spendig time with family and friends is a big help.In the mean time as much as i don't like taking drugs i guess i&quot;m just gonna have to be a champ n take the stuff even though i feel like absolute crap when i don&quot;t take the whole amount every day, bacause of fears of addiction to this drug.

I suffered silently with this affliction never knowing what was wrong with me. I was in a bad car accident years ago and I believe I was traumatized by it but never knew it. Ativan gave me back my life. I am no longer afraid to get into a car or get even behind the wheel. I can leave my house without fearing I will have an episode in public. This is a wonder drug for me.

It has helped tremendously calm me down.  It has helped me to sleep better. It makes me feel not afraid in social situations. I know for sure I am not going to have a panic attack when I am on this medication.  I have no more fears being alone in my car or in a store.  It makes me feel whatever &quot;normal&quot; is.  I am a happier person because of this drug.

It started with the left side of my chest becoming numb, then gradually got worse. Not knowing what to do I called my brother and he didn't answer. At this time I was still able to control my body and breathing. Trying to sit down and calm myself is the only thing I could think of. Then the pain kicked in. It literally felt like someone was holding a blow torch to my heart. I started the hyperventilate and my muscles tensed. I was scared, I thought that if I closed my eyes I was going to die. My sister in law took me to the hospital where upon arrival they took my vitals. Heart rate, 196, blood pressure, 140/90, neither one was good. They gave me a shot of liquid Ativan which calmed me down and took the pain away. When I went home I tried to sit down on the couch. As I stared in the distance the house came alive. Chairs were moving, chandelier talking, baby stroller walking. None of them were scary, but it was very weird. After doing some research I found out that haluccinations aren't on the side effect lest for Ativan. Can someone please help me to understand why my halluccinations occured?

I am 28yrs old and have 2 kids, full time job and going to college, i don't need the drama this medication brings to our family. she says its the only thing keeping her sane, but many of us feel that she is the opposit on this drug. It should not be allowed to be taken by depressed individuals, and a phyc. test be done randomly. She was taking up to 6 per day of the 10mg. This has changed my grandmother from a 'all natural foods +healing &quot; person to a drug popping idot that 'needs' to take it in order to deal with day to day activities. HIGHLY ADDICTIVE.

I take .5mg 4x a day and dont always do this.  Its good to have the flexibility to take when needed and take one or two depending on severity.  I find less instances of anxiety and sleep is much better.  I did have my first real panic attack recently and chewing up 2 .5mg tablets calmed my heart rate down enough to get through the attack without making that expensive trip to the ER.  If you are only having mild to moderate anxiety this is a good one to try.  Like it a lot better than the SSRIs such as lexapro.

Well, only if you run out. I had vicious and brutal anxiety for 20-25 years and finally did something about it in '06. First, Lexapro. Disaster. Along came Ativan. It was like Santa and Jesus worked at a drug co. and made a wonder pill. My anxiety was gone. 1mg 3times aday, right off the bat. Things were great until you run out. This stuff will hook you fast and hard. You will tell yourself it is worth it, and it is, for a while. Had to move, new psych, got me off slowly. Whatever you do, get off slowly.., now I'm on this crappy Seroquel XR, I suppose it works but, too many side effects. If you can be responsible you should be ok. If not, be careful.

I didn't take it every day and thought I was doing ok. One day at work I became very angry and thought I should try taking it daily instead of as needed. Boy, was it a life saver. My doctor agrees. I take 1 mg twice daily and I feel normal for the first time in my life. I can go outside, get on a bus, shop, etc. and not have to think about it for a while first. I just jump in the car (or bus) and go. It's wonderful having such a &quot;normal&quot; life. Before, other drugs like Paxil or Zoloft made things worse for me. I felt suicidal at times so I stopped them.

This drug is a nightmare yet a wonder drug at the same time.  I started taking it because I have multiple sclerosis and had muscle spasms.  That was 6 years ago.  I NEVER had anxiety before then.  It worked for the muscle spasms when nothing else would.  I tried neurontin (hallucinated), as well as all the muscle relaxants which just didn't touch it.  I knew this was a scary drug because my mother was a counselor and the doctor switched her from ativan (lorazepam) to ambien.  She began going through severe withdrawals.  She hallucinated, shook and had seizures.  They thought she was psychotic (she was and I tried to tell them why but they wouldn't listen), they put her on the psychiatric ward and gave her haldol.  Then she began to twitch and couldn't walk, half her face hung down (tardive dyskinesia).  They were ready to put her in a mental institution.  I begged them to listen to me, and even tried to sneak in ativan but I got caught.  She almost died before they gave her ativan.  Then she was back to normal.  It was truly a nightmare.  She had to move her practice to a different town.  She was so humiliated.  So, when I started taking it 6 years ago for my back, I was really careful.  Since then, and now I only take .5 to 1 mg at bedtime.  I went on a trip and forgot it.  I thought I would be fine.  By day 2 it was me this time.  I couldn't think, I was having horrible anxiety, and was scared out of my mind.  I drank a beer (I heard that helps a little), and it did some, but not enough. Finally I got the ativan and I got better.  Turns out, it doesn't matter how little you take, it's how long you take it.  Yes, it works wonders, but make sure you never run out, and if you start to have anxiety before your next dose, remember, it CAUSES anxiety too.  Just be very careful.  Dont take too much and let yourself run out.  Itcanbefatal

I have found it to be very effective.  Also it is easy to take.  I get effectiveness a lot faster because I can put under my tongue and it melts fast and it doesn't taste bad at all. The only probably I have is the generic brand lorazepam is very expensive too.

I was then diagnosed with Bipolar disorder as a young adult and it has really helped with that too. I usually take one at bedtime and then up to 2 others anytime throughout the day. Ativan has been a Godsend. But... if you are on a high dose it is imperative that you back down slowly- it can be very scary if you don't reduce usage one step at a time.

Had visible success at first taking only 0.5 mg to 1 mg per day.  Did notice a strong dependence on the drug after only about a month.  Currently, I am trying to wean myself off of the low dose I was taking, but still having some nagging withdrawal symptoms.  Dizziness, some shaking, etc. but will be worth it in the long run.  Replacing Ativan with 600 mg Neurontin daily for GAD and impulse control.

I started seeing my pulse on my neck! Like a frog sign. First my doctor thought I might have developed AVNRT but all tests showed negative ,Than I went to my psyciatrist, he immediately changed the Ativan and put me on Xanax as needed during a panic attack. I took Xanax few times when I felt I was gonna have a panic attack, Since than it has been 5 months and I never had a panic attack. The pulkse on my neck has been dissapeared.  It is the Ativan made my heart racing! I do NOT reccomend this drug for panic disorder at all.

Finally, when the SRIs came out, I started Prozac, and found it help my overall mood, but, it had no effect on the sometimes debilitating worried feelings I've felt since child hood. After my divorce,I had a total mental collapse, with all of the terrifying and overwhelming physical and irrational mind trauma that accompanies a classic &quot;panic attack&quot;. My Psych/Doc said at first to rest a few days and the total withdrawal from daily hassles and stresses, might make this terrifying event subside, or stop altogether. It did not!!!  I was soon diagnosed with Gen. Anxiety Disorder(at age 27, now 38), and have been on ativan and prozac since. I'm no fool, and i know I am 100% dependent on this med. But The worst thing about this med is that it works. And it works so well on my condition that I am prepared to take it until either a magic psychiatrist casts a spell or waves a wand that stops these feelings, or it's time for my &quot;dirt nap&quot;. I am 6'1&quot; and 245 and have slowly built a tolerance. I now take prozac 40mg in the AM, and 1mg ativan twice daily, and 1 take a 2mg ativan in the AM. These meds aren't a magic bullet, and I still have problems in life like everyone, but at least i can function pretty normally, and can sleep well knowing how to keep that dragon in my head at bay.

Use to treat anxiety and heart arrythmia associated with anxiety. Ativan works great to reduce anxiety in about 30 - 60 minutes. I do go months without taking a pill but they're there if I need them. Lately I've been having dizzy spells and reduced vision so I have been taking the ativan to help, but I'm concerned if the symptoms are anxiety related or withdrawl related. I was a fairly heavy drinker for the last year or so. Now I'm in a &quot;catch 22&quot; situation. Alcohol withdrawl? Ativan withdrawl? Or anxiety symptoms. Wow, that went off track. All in all I feel the drug is great for anxiety but WILL cause issues when mixed with alcohol. Hey I thought of a side effect that I haven't read yet. Six hours after taking a 1 mg pill, I get cranky and irritable for a few hours. As with all meds, use wisely.

Anxious	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/1/2009 11:39:55 PM	I want to warn everyone that even if you only take this drug for a week it can cause withdrawl symptoms.  I was on 4+mgs a day for 4 years and I have recently stopped taking it.  When you stop taking this drug ( and one day you will have to) the anxiety is HORRIBLE, your whole body hurts, you cant sleep, eat, function.  It will be WAY worse than any panic attack you have ever had.  I PROMISE you that you need to find other ways to control anxiety.  Benzos will ruin you.  Dr's cant treat a panic disorder when you are blocking the problem with this terrible drug.  If you decide to get off ativan there is a manuel called &quot; Ashtons manuel.  PLEASE follow this, it will help with WD symptoms.  Getting off this drug is the best thing I ever did, taking it was the worst.  It is NOT helping you.  OH did i mention seizures can be part of WD.  If you dont believe any of this I dare you to stop taking the drug and see how you feel.  I will tell you.....stomach pains ( nauseous) legs will cramp, PANIC ATTACKS, and utter misery.  Get out now while you still can.  Dont be scared.  Try googling a benzo support forum....you wont be alone and trust me it helps.  Detox centers are not prepared for Benzo withdrawl.  Good luck, and if you stay on this drug then your just damning yourself for the inevitable.  Your dose will get to high or your DR will stop writing the Rx.

I've been on this dose for close to eight years and have never had any negative effects. My anxiety is under control and my life is managable.

It will make your joints hurt and it will cause terrible depression. That was my experience. It is a dangerous addicting drug and should NOT be prescribed, in my opinion. It made my insomnia WORSE.

Anyone that is using it now -beware.  I was an ativan user for 4yrs. It was a nightmare. Of course it worked in the beginning, but after awhile it stopped working.  I started with xanax then went to klonipin then ativan. What a mistake. For extreme anxiety it started to work. The md had to continue to increase the dose so I would still get the relief -- or high!  He wanted to increase it to 8mgs but I said no and decided to get off the drug.  It was slowly killing me. Er visits started to increase. I started having a lot of stomach pains, chest pains, and leg pains. Most important was that I felt like a zombie all the time. I wasn't leaving the house and  sunshine bothered my eyes. I just couldn't function outside of the home. I finally had the courage to take control of my own life and decided to admit myself to a hospital detox unit. You cannot do this yourself. I tried. I've been off ativan for 2 1/2 years and I'm doing much better. My NEW md has me on lamical. I'm taking vacations, moved into a new house, gardening, put in a pool. I'm not totally free of the withdrawal yet but I'm still hanging in there and enjoying life. Exercise does help and I've joined two classes. Hint- walking outside helps a lot, drink plenty of water(helps with anxiety) breathing &amp; relaxation music is a must. Remember- ativan is very addicting. My diagnosis was that it was slowing killing me. I DO STRUGGLE EVERYDAY BUT NOW I'M IN CONTROL NOT THE ATIVAN--IT DID IT'S DAMAGE ON ME. Ativan puts a block in your brain so you don't feel the anxiety which makes you feel like you are in a waking coma. If I can help at least one person by my experience then it was worth it. Please don't use ativan -it slowly kills.

My addiction to it led my prescriber to change my med to Klonopin. That drug did nothing for me(maybe my dose was to small, or i didn't take it long enough to get into my bloodstream). The anxiety attacks worsened. I now am on 2mg Ativan twice a day and it does wonders. I've been on Ativan for about 6 months now, and I find it very Effective. As all benzodiazapines are highly addictive, I find myseslf even breaking the Ativan in half at times. If Xanax or Klonopin dont help or you have (m)any addiction problems with certian drugs/medications, ask for Ativan.

I have been given this when having severe muscle spasms and lack of oxygen seizures. I feel like I am going in and out of consciousness over and over even with one small dose. It is hell. My throat and tongue have swollen, too. This is an allergy but doctors that don't understand allergies will dismiss the side effects that I have lived through because they say they aren't listed anywhere. My side effects have happened on multiple occassions. My lack of oxygen is from allergic reactions to other things, too. If a side effect happens let others know so they can be informed of the risks of this drug in some people. Respectfully,An adovocate for all medical uses of a medication to be listed and known.

Did the klonapin thing, too groggy.  Ativan works just right.  I started out with 2mg 3x a day, and am now down to 1mg 2 or 3x a day,  if I'm just chillin at home, just 1mg is effective of keeping &quot;el diablo&quot; (panic attacks) away.  I feel that the abuse of this drug would only be by someone that doesnt have panic attacks.  For me having such a high anxiety level, this drug simply takes the edge off and actually allows me to function as a &quot;normal&quot; person.   I can go out to dinner, shopping, to a concert, on a vacation.  Not stuck in my house, or an ER anymore.  YAY FOR ATIVAN!!!!

Works very quickly, and without side effects except for a tendency to be flippant.

Nearly drove him crazy.  Made him hallucinate.  He fought everyone and had to be restrained.  When they stopped with Ativan, he was fine again.  A friend's son was put on Ativan while in the hospital with Pancreatitis - he got beligerant, anxious, depressed.  Took him off - he was fine.  Same thing happened to a friend's father.  I would NEVER take this drug.

It also works well for mild to moderate insomnia. I've found that 1/2 of a 0.5 mg dosage is usually effective for me.  Occassionally I will take  a full 0.5 mg dosage.  I keep the dosage and frequency as low as possible to avoid physical dependence, which is a high risk with this medication (more so than many other drugs in the benzodiazepine family).

It stops my panic attacks in their tracks and helps me calm down when I'm unreasonably nervous. I highly recommend Ativan for anxiety, but only if you take it as directed. I've seen people have seizures when withdrawing from high amounts of this drug. I have had no side effects or dependency issues.

At this point in my life I would have hoped it would be gone but I struggle with it daily and lorazepam gives me some comfort.  I don't abuse it, I try .5mg during the day, once or twice and them 1 mg at bedtime.  I still have alot of anxiety because I am a compulsive worrier but hopfully with my therapy and this med I will get it under control.
Anxious	 (Patient) 	5	5	3			8/1/2009 1:19:28 AM	I used this as an &quot;abort&quot; pill at first when I felt a panic attack coming on, at .5 mg as needed. However I became tolerant of that dose and was then prescribed 1 mg twice a day. Incredibly addicting, so much so that I felt the need to take 2 or 3 mg just to fall asleep at night. When I wouldn't take one I would have a panic attack.ALSO: put me to sleep.Eventually I made sure that I did not have any more remaining refills and basically holed myself up for a week or so, with no possible triggers for a panic attack, and cut it off cold turkey.Again, can't stress how addictive this pill is.

During my panic attacks my blood preassure and heart rate goes up too.I did not find any help from SSRI's that much and still had panic attacks.Xanax and Ativana re the best for emergency.But both of them are highly addicted. I found Ativan to be less addictive than Xanax.Now, I take Ativan twice a week, 0.5 mg and I am simply fine. If I do not take it than I get panic attacks.If I get a real bad panic attack, than I take xanax because it wokrs faster. Those are great but should not be used everyday. If you can control your self, I think that those are the best.I tried Klonopin once and I was so tired and depressed the enxt few days. never again,

I developed this my sophomore year in high school. Just a few months ago I was having panic attacks about my upcoming wedding and everyone watching me while I say my vows. I was scared I would be shaking so bad that I wouldn't be able to put my husband's ring on his finger! I took 1.5 mg of Ativan and everything went perfect. Normally I am unable to speak, choke up, feel like running out of the room, or like I'm going to pee my pants! I was so worried about not being able to say my vows, but this drug worked amazingly well! I have tried Xanax, clonipin, paxil, and welbutrin but they didn't help. Xanax just made me tired, but still anxious. The others did nothing.

Its now 6 years later and I'm just finishing up a long, uncomfortable, slow withdrawal from this stuff. The drug is highly addictive and is, along with all benzodiazapines, very difficult to quit. Do yourself a favor if you are considering taking this stuff and do a Google search on Ativan withdrawal. Read the results carefully. This stuff only works for a while and then you need to updose to avoid interdose withdrawal.Take it from one who has suffered, stay away from this stuff,

My chemo was 5 years ago and the painful neurapathy has never went away.  It keeps me awake at night and I can barely stand the pain during the day hours.  I have been taking lorazapam now for 5 years just to sleep and get any relief I can from the constant burning and tingling in my feet and legs.  I am also trying lyrica with the lorazapam and I get some added pain relief but have fears of becoming addicted to these drugs.  Insurance Co's give me a hard time about pre-existing conditions but I figure they can't possibly understand the constant pain I am in.  It's terrible!!!!!! I survived cancer but I am left with pain and uncaring people at the insurance co.  I hope I will be able to keep taking these medications as my husband has lost his job and has been unable to find a new one now for more than a year.  Keep me in your prayers.  My opinion on this drug is that it all I have.  Has done alot of good for me and I would recommend it for people with painful chemo neurapathy.

It has worked very-well for my anxiety.  There is one problem, it is addictive and taken with alcohol or after alcohol in any frequency is a recipe for disaster.  I used it for &quot;hangovers&quot; because it &quot;helped&quot;, and it did just that, but wait, Get into that cycle and coming off puts people in a serious world of hurt.  Be SafeAtivan is a good drug ONLY when taken at small doses and when absolutely needed, otherwise try meditation or something less scary to stop.

Almost every symptom listed set in. i saw 5 gp doctors and 2 specialist and not one said anything about the withdraw. i was told to keep taking them until i almost killed myself and after hours and hours of research i discovered what i was going through. i have been off of them for a little over a week and the nightmare seems to be subsiding a lttle each day. i was a healthy active person that happened to have a so called panic attack out of the blue in January and it has been a terror ride ever since.

She was diagnosed in October 2008 with Uteran Cancer, and in April 2009 with the spread of that cancer to the brain. She was prescribed for this medication after she became ill with pneumonia, incoherent (verbally and mentally non-responsive to everyone and everything around her); she was all but not breathing, and they prescribed her for this. How do they know she's having anxiety complications? With her death on the way, I am entirely unsure if this medicine is helping my mom. I don't reccomend it for anyone, by the reviews I've read about it.

When ever I obsess to much on my thoughts and get anxious, I just need to take ativan and it puts me back in a good mood. You can get hooked on this drug so be carefull on how much you take, I started at .25mg and after about a month I was at 1.25mg. I have been doing better on a anti depression med so I have gotten the ativan back down to .25mg where it helps.

I've been able to lower my starting dose of 4mg per day to 2mg per day with the incorporation of exercise and cognitive therapy (they have been a big help!).  I hope I can discontinue using it altogether some day (I'm not big on meds) but it has made a huge difference in helping me manage my symptoms effectively and safely.  Only side effect has been mild fatigue, which I'll take over a panic attack any day.

Ativan was given to her after her other medications stopped being effective. She was taking it for a month and she was on such a high,but unfortunately, she ended up crashing. On my birthday, my dad found her dead. She ended up hanging herself in the basement. Think twice before taking this medication or allowing a loved one to take it. I started taking Wellbutrin for anxiety (can you blame me after what happened?) and it works great.

Seems they always want me to try something else. I am comfortable with  the Ativan. If I have to take it the rest of my life, I will feel safe ntaking this medicine, because no other has helped me. I can function properly everyday,and I know Ativan has been around for many years.I trust Ativan, and my worst fear is not  being able to have doctor prescribe it for me,for I know I will have serious withdrawls.I thank God for Ativan, and the therapy that is out there to help me live my life normally.

I took 2mg 6 times a day. My doctor said he didnt understand why I was not a zombie walking around. But I wasnt and barely felt the effects, which in turn is a good thing. I used to have anxiety so bad that I avoided most social situations. I didnt even answer the telephone for the anxiety it would bring. Taking these I function quite normal. As 90% of people in my condition are on disabillity and cannot work, i functioned fine. The most difficult part was getting it from the pharmacy or to get my insurance to pay for it. They always flagged me and tried to make me feel like a druggie or a drug dealer. After years of squabbling with multiple pharmacys over the drug i decided to switch to Alprazolam 2mg ER and another 1mg 3 times daily. yet to see how that works out. 
Anxious	Nic, 25-34 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	3/30/2009 4:39:45 PM	I have had anxiety issues for years but they have worsened considerably lately.  I had an anxiety attack so bad a week ago that i went to the e.r and was prescribed a low dose ativan until  could see my regular doctor.  The medicine helped me so much that i cant begin to describe it.  I wasnt able to get in to see my regular pain doctor for the next week or so, and when i did he did not want to prescribe it to me, even after i described how it had opened my eyes and made me realize that i wanted to to stop taking my regular pain meds (methadone, norco)just so that i could have something to make me enjoy life again.  My doctor of course says that he &quot;hates that medicine&quot; and it took everything to convince him to at least give me something else for anxity.  So instead he prescribed me very small doses of klonopins.  At first it sounded to me as if they would be similar but to my dissapointment they are not.  Ativans changed the way i was thinking and made me feel very positive about life.  I am now in the process of trying to get my doctor changed so that i may have the option of changing the med.  My advise to anyone out there is to be on top of your case, and dont just let your doctor take advantage of the fact that you dont know as nuch about med. as they do.  Nobody can tell you how much pain you are in. GOOD LUCK

I quit with the help of ativan.I have learned from myself I had anxiety problems, that is why I drank, to cope. I have been taking this drug, 0.5 in the morning if needed and 0.5 in the evening if I have problems sleeping.I still have panic attacks ans periods of anxiety. Dr.'s tried to put me on prozac, didnt work, I quit that real fast, They tried effexor, that was a scare, that did not work. And now zoloft. I did not feel the need to sleep at night., sort of a zombie effect. this ativan has helped me function perfect with no symptoms of anxious feelings. I just wish they can come up with a daily dosage like a timed released pill, so I can take it once a day.

I had never had an anxiety problem, or sleeplessness issue prior to taking this. It worked for both problems by the second night, and the next 7 months. I was concerned by the second month about becoming dependent on it, but my doctor was not. In hindsight, I would have thrown out what was left, gone to a counselor, and asked for Lunesta. As it was, I could not conduct a normal day without that pill, and spent several unbelievably hellish months attempting to ovecome the physical and emotional dependency. I had no experience with any drugs other than pain medications post surgery, so this warning is given to other drug &quot;virgins,&quot; in the hope that they will realize several very important things: counselors are expensive and your health and well-being ARE worth spending this money and time on, and, occasionally, a drug is necessary When it is, get the hell off of it as soon as possible. Do not just assume your doctor will call you up and tell you that he's been thinking, and it's time to take you off! In addition, do an Internet search on what other users of Ativan are saying.

Within an hour or so, my stomach was 75% or greater better.  I have recently been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and my rheumatologist and I both agree that the IBS was probably just the beginning of it, especially after I noticed that the Ativan also worked great on the muscle tightness and soreness, not to mention the fact that going through all ths would make anyone crazy.  Even though they say it's addictive, I haven't had issues with that.  Sometimes I go for a week without the need to take it, so I don't call that addicted.  I personally think they're just being too paranoid about it, but it does depend on the person taking it.  I would highly recommend Ativan to anyone going through either IBS or fibromyalgia symptoms as it has really helped me a lot.
Anxious	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/28/2009 3:10:51 AM	I have been taking this medication as prescribed/ as needed for over 14 years with no side effects.  I have tried every other med for anti anxiety effect (anti-depressant or SSRI or SNRI or Prozac) and NOTHING has had ANY effect in relieving the anxiety.  Those meds have actually increased the anxiety and added depression.  I have nothing but good things to say for Ativan/Lorazapam if used as directed for decreasing anxiety.

It was wonderful and I became addicted quickly. I would tAke my pill and knew that in 20 minutes I would just drift off and sleep thru the night.  My docs allowed me to be on it for about 6 mos. (got me thru chemo and radiation) and then they cut me off. Withdrawl was a bit rough-- I tapered down slowly--2-3 days of headache, muscle aches, upset stomach.  It is good for short term use, but be careful. It is really habit-forming.

I also take Klonopin at night time.  The Ativan is just PRN (as needed).  It does not work as well as Xanax, but it does help.  My psychiatrist does not feel comfortable prescribing Xanax, so this is what I get.  Overall I am satisfied.  I take it about 1-2x/wk on average.

I have completely stopped the Zoloft, as it was not effective at all, and am also somewhat disappointed with the Ativan.  I usually have the need for the medication most at work, and when I take it, it doesn'ttake the anxious edge off...it only seems to provoke yawning and a feeling of being physically tired.  Fortunately, I have not suffered many side-effects, but I do believe that it is giving me headaches, for which I then have to take an OTC pain reliever...to many medications with too little benefit...sad, really

I have severe Generalized Anxiety Disorder.I am not addicted to any pills and i prefer not to take them.The Xanax worked great for my surgeries but they refused to give them to me again saying&quot;it is a very addicting drug and gave me Ativan. Maybe I just need a stronger dose? I only take it when I am going on a road trip,to the Dr,or to the school to talk with the teachers. My anxiety is so bad that i miss appointments all the time and am always late. Very embarrassing!!!! I can't even leave the driveway all the way before I am running back in to go to the bathroom #2.

I was tramatized as a child by the number of shots and IV's I had to have, and have snice been terrified of needles, especially the feeling of it being in my skin. I took Ativan to help me stop crying, relax and sleep in the 5 days prior to surgery. I was also given IV Ativan prior to one of the procedures to prevent anxity while being preped. It was a God send. It worked so well that I have almost no memory of the time I was being preped and no memory of the needle stick. This has helped me deal with my fear of needles!

It's difficult trying to dose because some days are better than others and I don't require the max dose. It has helped me with my anxiety, migraines and helps me sleep. Although it does help it is also addictive, just a few hours of a missed dose is painful, my head starts to hurt, my body feels like it is tightened up and I start developing aches and pains, can't sleep. So I recommend to anyone who takes this med to make sure that you always have your scripts refilled before you run out.

I have severe PMDD/PMS which is why I currently use Ativan as needed.  Every OBGYN wants to put you on an antidepressant which have terrible side effects, so I just stick with this from my primary doctor so I can just take it when I need it.  The doctor prescribed 1. mg but I break them down to .5 and even .25 depending on how I am feeling.  I am prescribed 90 pills at 1.0 mg. and it lasts me a year or so.  I was nervous at first of getting addicted to it, so it makes me more aware of taking it.  I try not to unless I really have to, although, I think sometimes I should just take .25 around ovulation time to help me get through the depression days before my period.  I think it has been a lifesaver for me with my anxiety and it helps me to sleep well.  I usually just take it at night, but I should probably take .25 during the day when I am ovulating.  Working out also helps a great deal with anxiety and depression.  I have started taking a B-complex vitamin, and that seems to be helping as well.    
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Patient Zero, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/4/2008 4:03:13 PM	I Have been taking this for 12 years and have no side effects.  I want to comment on the post concerning alcohol withdrawel and the proper amount to take.  In looking up the drug in a drug book, the possible amounts that can be prescribed are usually somewhere between 4 mil. and 40 mil. per day.  I take only 1 mil. per day for insomnia but a doctor SHOULD know how much to prescribe and if they don't then I suggest another doctor.

I was worried about dependence and my doc said to take it as needed and keep to the smallest effective does, this is not a drug that needs to build up in you system like most anti-depressants. Thus far, it has been effective for treating immediate anxiety symptoms and helping me sleep. Also, I've yet to have any bad side effects.

I stopped pacing and was able to think more calmly.  However, after six months of use, typically 2-3 mgs per day, its effectiveness is waning and side effects are occurring.  Namely, poor sleep or insomnia and strong anxiety in the morning.  It has not helped my concentration or energy level throughout the whole six months.  I want to get off the drug now, but the withdrawal symptoms are horrendous - insomnia, depression, and anxiety.  I wish I had never started this stuff.  AVOID THIS DOPE AT ALL COSTS!!!

True, it does make be a bit sleepy, but one regular cup of coffee takes the sleep away and I'm good to go and ready to function throughout my day. I was on Paxil and all I got from that was a stomach ulcer and other bad side effects. I was taking Ativan PRN and so far my doctor has decided to put me on it regulary. I'm thankful, because it's helped. I've taken prozac with no results as well. Ativan has worked wonders without bad side effects so far.

The effectiveness is more than nothing at all, more than Benadryl, but less effective than the other commonly prescribed sedative or benzodiazepines. I think that rather than calm or sooth the anxiety away, it makes me too stupid to notice some of the things I'd normally notice and possibly feel anxious about. I do like that it lasts longer than others of it's kind, but since it mostly makes me plain old stupid, that can end up a real inconvenience and even an embarrassment. I sometimes get leg cramps or headaches. Also, it seems to give me a cough? I know that may seem way weird, but it does this thing where I get gaggy, and cough a lot. This strange mouth-throat tickle, itch, or just annoyance is hard to describe.It will have to do until more Doctors feel comfortable prescribing the other benzo type anti anxiety again.
Anxious	LexiFaye, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	9/18/2008 11:20:03 PM	Ativan was presribed to me after weeks of feeling sick because of stress, and moderate panic attacks. At first it gave me the feeling of being nauseous as if I was drunk, but I started to eat a little bit with it and that helped. I have since quit taking it, however my doctor is going to start me back on it to help with my IBS. I have to say that I have taken other &quot;anti-anxiety&quot; medicines, and this one gave the least amount of haziness, and after taking it for 3 months, I never felt dependant on it. (Even with a history of dependency.)

I definately feel that this has helped keep my emotional level more even and I feel less tense.

It works great for me, just to take the edge off when I feel a panic attack coming on, or when I am extremely anxious, I have been on prozac, klonopin, and much heavier drugs that give me a hang over effect. I can fully function just taking an ativan and getting over being anxious. I have quit taking the other medications and just take the ativan when needed. I don't feel that I am addicted to it as I only need to take it a few times a week.

He has bipolar disorder - my warning is read ALL the side effects - even the RARE ones - Ativan made him mean. He became a child we did not recognize. At one point he became like a baby sitting in the kitchen throwing things and grunting. He had horrible muscle pains - screaming and hollaring in pain. It was torture!READ ALL THE SIDE EFFECTS before you take or give to a loved one.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Sister, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/10/2008 11:34:24 AM	I was prescribed 0.5 mg about 6 months ago for a combination of anxiety and trouble relaxing enough to fall asleep.  I take 1 dose at bedtime and have no trouble falling asleep, and occasionally use one dose if feeling especially anxious.  This medication doesn't put you in a haze as Xanax or Valium does.  I have had no side effects and use it maybe 2-3 nights per week if I have trouble falling asleep and maybe twice per month for anxiety.  I am very happy that it isn't real strong and you can still function on it.

I was prescribed ativan a year ago when my son needed surgery and the panic attacks became much worse.  I take half the prescribed .5 mg dosage (am taking .25 mg)and it works great for me.  Takes the edge off of the panic attack, and helps me deal with the vertigo.  It's been a life saver.  I only take it a few days a week (or less), and only one 1/2 dosage pill because I'm concerned about the addiction factor, but so far I haven't noticed any issues - could be because I'm taking such a low dosage.

Anxious	Milo, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/24/2008 8:34:31 PM	I took this medicine for generalized anxiety disorder for over 10 years -- 4 mg./day. It is excellent at relieving anxiety and giving a general calming effect. When I felt like I was becoming tolerant to it, that it was losing its effect, I would just cut back on the dose for a while, and then everything would be OK. I did have a very strange reaction one time when I had a glass of wine while on Ativan, all out of proportion to what you would expect, so it's best to be careful about drinking while taking this medicine, I suppose. It is also helpful for insomnia.

Xanax is way too strong for me and gives me a hangover effect-not good when you are a caregiver! Ativan has been a godsend for me. I have been taking .25mg-.50mg at bedtime for a year. I don't find it to be addictive at all. it sometimes takes a lot to convince a doctor that you are NOT depressed! I had a BAD experience with Prozac years ago. Some doctors immediateley diagnose depression based on what you tell them.It can sometimes be dangerous to allow your family doctor prescribe phychiatric meds! My psychiatrist gives seminars to groups of GP's outlining the hazards of doing just that. I believe Ativan is safe, well tested, and effective based on my experience. I hate it when doctors just write a script for the newest thing on the market, when there are older, tried-and-true drugs that are cheaper.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	TT, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	7/1/2008 8:05:51 PM	Was given one dose of this while in hospital to drain a brain hemmorrhage (normal Ambien-type sleep medicine out of the question due to neurological surgery). It made me somewhat more relaxed for about an hour, until images started appearing every time I closed my eyes, got stronger and disturbing for several hours, and only wore off 12 hours later after I ultimately dozed off briefly (from exhaustion). Defeated the purpose of helping me to sleep, and needless to say I requested that it not be given to me again.

She saw things and people that were not there and didn't know where she was.  We didn't know they were giving her activan (or what it was).  Both times I demanded to know what was given to her, saying that this was not my mom! As soon as i pulled her from the hospital so she wasn't given it, her mind completely cleared.  Second time, I was across country so wasn't there.  Based on these behaviors, dr diagnosed her with a  type of alzheimers!  I flew in and quizzed the nurse and learned the nurses had been giving her activan to 'calm' her. (really gave it to her so they didn't have to deal with her b/c it made her completely out of it and they could put her in a diaper in a corner and restrain her (she is wheel chair bound).) We took her home and stopped the activan and she quickly returned to normal (no confusion/no delusions)! Please be careful with this drug!! The dr was ready to put my mom in long term care permanently. omg! she is home and doing fine

I took 2 before bed and it works very gently to relax me and in an hour or hour in a half my eyes start to feel heavy and to bed I go. No hangover in the morning, plus if I wake at night I can get back to sleep easily. I love it. Too bad they say its addicting and builds up tolerance quickly.

We were sleeping horribly and having anxiety attacks at night because we are afraid the same thing will happen to our elder son. It did help us sleep better but after using it for one month I found out I was pregnant and had to stop taking it. I had withdrawl and I was actually craving the drug. I have never been on drugs on a regular basis, except for birth control pills. My anxiety attacks were horrible when I went off the drug, nearly unbearable. I woke up in the middle of the night panicked. My husband has reduced his dose for fear that he will become addicted and he has experienced some withdrawl as well. He is experiencing feelings of anger. This drug does work, but for us it has some downsides. But our situation is fairly dramatic and stress/tension/anxiety are to be expected.

I have had no desire or need to up my dosage for 20 years now.  I know I will probably be on this for the rest of my life.  I take it gladly for it has given me a life free of panic.  Respect this drug and do not overuse.  I also saw a pychologist to learn how to deal with anxiety.  This combination of therapy and medication has been priceless for me.

Anxious	Jbarton, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/28/2008 9:50:46 AM	I am 50 years old and have been on this drug for about two years. I started taking it for insomnia and found that it greatly lessened my anxiety attacks. Before taking Lorazapam (Ativan), I would sit at work and spend hours plotting my own death. Now, as long as I take .5mg regularly, I can work without the distraction of suicidal thoughts or anxiety attacks. I take two-three mg at bedtime. I've never slept better and do not have trouble geting up in the morning. I am sure that I am dependent on this drug by now but I would rather take Lorazapam for the rest of my life than deal with the alternatives.

Im perscribed 2mg 3 times a day. the first couple of weeks it screwed me all up as if i was drunk and couldnt remember anything from this time period. after 2 weeks it worked great. I tried to stop taking it but couldnt function without it. I am dependent on it now but starting to not work as well. I think i need to up my dosage.

But at least no full blown panic attacks. Yay. However, it made me really drowsy. Works better as a one before bed thing for me.

When I have troubles in my life I can't stop thinking and this drug helps a lot. I take a very low dose--.5mg at bedtime, but I still find it hard to wake up in the morning. I have not used it as much lately. I think I should find more natural methods to calm my brain.

I have been on this drug for 10 years now and now they want me to stop - I am miserable and don't understand why?  Is it really addiction if you are able to function and live a normal life due to the addictive drug?

I have 3 other siblings on the same drug, same dose, long term.  I have never had a problem with increased tolerance (wanting to take a higher dose), and find it to be an inexpensive, highly effective drug. I didn't sleep for more than a couple of hours for almost two years, and within 3 days of taking this, my sleep was normal, and for the most part has stayed so since. I don't notice any problematic side effects-might not be the right drug for everyone, but it I feel like it saved my life! 
Other	sunsetdreams, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/9/2008 3:26:41 AM	I discovered Lorazepam/Ativan 13 years ago, when I was first diagnosed with a severe panic disorder (after 5 yr of not knowing). I had up to 24 attacks daily, which immobilized me at times, causing much mental pain. Immediately I was given 1mg 4x a day, and within 2 days I felt back to life again, like I could do anything. I have tried other treatments, only to fail, since, so I have stuck with this med now 13 yrs, and take 2mg, 5x daily preventively. I have maybe one full blown attack annually now :-)I highly recommend seeing a therapist while on this med if for a mental condition because they can help identify underlying causes and issues.I had drowsiness as my only side effect the first few months, now none

My tolerance has increased slightly over time from.05 to 1 and a half mg I.m taking now...For sleep it is important that you give yourself 6-8 hrs to sleep off the med, otherwise you may have a slight hangover. I have increased the dose and decreased it without symptoms, but I always ladder off the dose slowly so I don't get withdrawl symptoms.

Anxious	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/19/2008 10:28:36 AM	I have taken ativan for over 12 years for severe panic attacks. This medication has helped me live a normal life &amp; allows me to go out in public with out thoughts of having an attack. I have attempted to get off this medication 3 different times but each time my panic attacks would return within 2 days. I started taking 4 pills during the day but I have been able to reduce the amount to 2 pills a day unless I have to go some where in a crowd or previous panic attack situation.  Then, I take a pill before going which prevents an attack. It took 6 long months to diagnois my panic attacks but 2 weeks after startingativan I was able to return to stores that I had experienced attacks in before.  I was almost totally house bound because of the dread of having an attack in public.  I realize I will be on this medication for life but the ability to function as normal as possible is definitely worth it. Before starting ativan I tried several other medications which had severe side effects. This is the only medication that works for me.

Anxious	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/7/2008 9:09:54 PM	Had an adverse reation to this drug!! I was on Ativan 4mg daily for 1 year after a neck injury. It worked SUPER!! Was just put back on after four years, 1mg daily. After being on it for 3 days, I suffered an adverse reaction to the medication and now have for the last week lost my short term memory. After 7 days off the med,I am now able to remember a couple hours out of my day. This is very scary and I suggest before anyone goes on it for long term you read the fine print that Wyeth has. It is common for this reaction in 10% of the prescribed people and in doses of 4mg or more daily. I was not on 4mg, so beware. It also takes 7-20 days for memory to return to normal. I am not saying this drug does not work, because it works well. Just please read the fine print!

I asked him to leave me on it but he said he couldn't it was additive an to wait 2 wks. The reason I wanted to stay on it was I could sleep better at night and anxiety was not there.  I went back told him I was off the lexapro it wasn't working anymore and the ativan did a lot better He asked if I had trouble stopping the lexaprox any side affects I was a little jumpy I was on it for 3 yrs so he went for 2months than 10days off. When I went back this time I told him I had no problem with just quitting Ativan no side effects nothing. He gave me a scrip for 90 days. I wean myself off at times just don't sleep good when I do. This works for me sleep good at night my depression is better and it is CHEAP not like the fancy lexapro.Doc let me have the 90days with refills if I promise him I would stop for a week or so than start again if I had problems stopping call him I am going to continue to take it if I get addicted so be it. I am still better off than I was. I am 71yrs so I have been here a while. Alcohol and gambling are gone that saves me a bundle. I think ativan if there is such a thing is the all in one drug. I quess I will contiue to go off and then back on. Still don't know why you can't just keep on it.
Anxious	Veroncia, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/4/2008 2:27:47 AM	I have been taking Ativan for about 5 months now.  I started taking it when my mother passed away.  It has relieved my panic and anxiety attacks.  I started out with 1mg twice a day and are now on 0.5mg one a day at bedtime.  It has been helpful, I get very severe panic attacks that usually end up in the ER.  But Ativan has helped me a lot.  I am concerned about becoming addicted so my doctor suggested, weening myself off of it, by taking it every other night for a week, then every two nights for a week and so forth.  He has also suggested I see a Phsycologist, which I do on a regular basis, excercise, and relaxing techniques, such as meditation, massage, accupuncture and Yoga.  I am going to try the accupuncture first, then the excercise and then the Yoga.  I will report later.  It was great reading all the reviews, I hope that my review will help someone deal with their anxiety and try the things my doctor has suggested.

Anxious	inspiredmomof5, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	35-44	2/28/2008 4:25:50 PM	I am getting off of pain meds, which include hydrocodone and soma. I have been on those meds for over 13 months now. My dr. prescribed Lorazepam 1 mg. every four hours to help wiht the intense withdrawal pains that I am experiencing. It is one of the most painful things my body had ever had to go through, and I have had 5 children. The antivan is much more helpful than not. If I didn't have it I do not know where I would be. My anxiety/panic attacks are too numerous to count. My legs are so achey and can barely walk. There is NO relief for that, is there? My heart races like it is going 400mpminute. I can not sleep more than 2-3 at a stretch. so I am overwhelmingly beside myself. If anyone has any answers to this I would so apprecriacite it. My doctor is tapering me off rather quickly, but not cold turkey, thank God. This all started when I went in for a routine outpatient surgery last Jan. 2007.Three days later I awoke to my entire left side going numb ( a painful numb). Long story short and a gazillion tests later, it was discovered my discs at C7/T1 were completely damaged somehow, during the surgery. Now I have massive panic attacks and anxiety that is unbearable at time.Anyway enough out of me.thank for listenting. would appreciate any imput. 
Anxious	mel, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/28/2008 1:44:46 AM	 Fantastic drug when used in moderation! Not to be used if genetically inclined to be addicted to anything esp. drugs! Started Ativan when I had a &quot;screamer&quot; of a boss. Thought I was just a &quot;Drama Queen&quot; while venting my opinions. I thought I was verbalizing for everyone who wouldn't. I swore profusely &amp; rationalized it by calling myself jokingly &quot;Tammy Tourette&quot; (as in the syndrome.) However, all my co-workers were indeed stressed but did not &quot;dramatize&quot; it as I did.  I went to the Doctor. He diagnosed me with borderline high anxiety and prescribed Ativan. It saved me profusely. Took 1mg at that job(waitress at very busy place.) Was fantastic! Realized I am only one person that can only do what I can do. I want to make everyone happy--Really!Have now used Ativan off &amp; on for 4 years. No side effects (can take at 2a.m. for insomnia &amp; go to Jazzercise @8:30am) &amp; feel wonderful &amp; go to work standing for 8-hours, lifting, walking, people pleasing, all day. Only side effect for me is that it takes away my stressfully induced &quot;humor&quot; which everyone knows me for. But it such a relief to take a break! For them &amp; me!It's so funny that I'm so paranoid about becoming addicted to a high-anxiety drug that works so well for me. Use it when you need it only. Like taking the sleeper airfare to your destination. Or going to Europe when the jet-lag will kill you the first 3-days. Or going on a job interview. This drug works for that!!

Only drawbacks is that It erases my memory on the days that I take it....Seriously - cant remeber anything that happened or went on while I was on it, even on very  very low doses.Second problem is that is wrecks your sex drive, and makes it impossible to climax while you are on it, for up to 2 days after.
Anxious	bjr28, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	2/10/2008 8:15:32 PM	Ativan is probably the best (perhaps second best behind Xanax) short-acting benzo on the market.  It works wonders for anxiety and other conditions.  Its efficacy is often times demonstrated by the fact that it makes you fall asleep, which is sometimes desired (as opposed to remaining awake and suffering ).  Be careful not to drive after taking this medicine, however, because it has a similar effect on the brain as alcohol (I am not sure of the Chemistry behind that statement, but that is what I have been told by psychiatrists and pharmacists.)  Great short-acting benzo, but highly addictive, so be very careful.  Do not abuse it, and be cautious when coming off of it - make sure you do not precipitously stop taking it b/c there could be serious withdrawal symptoms.  Just be careful with it and it will work wonders (in the short term).  Try Klonopin for a longer acting benzo...

Anxious	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	55-64	2/7/2008 5:57:39 PM	Initially started when diagnosed with lung cancer and starting chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Worked well for preventing nausea and vomiting during treatments but now it has been 7 months I've been on it and am trying to stop taking it. It isn't helping my anxiety anymore so I'm taking 1/2 of a 1mg. tablet once or twice a day. I am having a very hard time with my nerves. Also, I take ambien cr at night along with the Ativan and it had helped with Restless Leg Syndrome. I don't know if this medicine can cause a feeling of pressure at the base of your throat or not but I've already had my esophagus stretched once and it didn't help. If anyone else has had that choking or lump in the throat feeling please post that.

Anxious	Mary, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/5/2008 7:34:39 PM	I feel that Ativan is an excellent drug! I have GAD, Bipolar and PTSD! Along with my other medications, Ativan taken on an as needed basis and always at night for sleep it really helps me to calm down and releave tension. As anyone with GAD you feel as if you are &quot;A CAT ON A HOT TIM ROOF&quot; (edgy). Resulting in many headaches and mood swings that can sometimes make the attacks worse. So taking Ativan is great and the side effects are mild. It can be an addicting drug but so can chocolate!

After suffering for my entire 51 years with GAD the Adivan settled me down with no side effects.   I have also started Lamical which in combination has settled down my mood swings.      Both are very effective in my case and the mental health MD I am seeing has nailed it in my case.

My tolerence kept building and I was taking more and more every couple of days or else it just wouldn't work.  I took Ativan for four months and one day decided to stop because Ativan had been causing headaches.  Don't get me wrong, the headaches were worth the relief from panic attacks, but I figured I was going to try to beat my anxiety without drugs.  I stopped taking Ativan and had no side effects and no withdrawl symptoms.  Also, my panic attacks went away.   All in all, this is a good drug, just don't become dependent on it!!!  
Anxious		5	5	5			1/29/2008 4:07:10 PM	I have taken many Anxiety medications, But Ativan worked the best for me, Like any medication it effects people differently, But I was on Xanax for a while, And it made me too high to do anything, Ativan still made me a little loopy, But I could function.

Unfortunately, I would find later that I would have yet another episode (often worse) exactly 24 hours later. To me, this was a sign of withdrawal, as the subsequent attacks were otherwise unprovoked. I've heard of how addictive this drug is, and using it caused me to spiral into a pattern that I would not have gone into had I simply taken a hot bath. So nowadays, if I do have a moment, I take a low dose of Diazepam (Valium) instead.

I should have never got back on it. The are alot of non addictive medications for anxiety. If you read this take my word highly highly ADDICTIVE.

It wears off though, and can at first be very tempting to take more, or much more than you should. dont do that. withdrawl was a bitch. in combination with seroquil my anxiety and moodiness are 80% under control. Lexapro helps with the depression. no more months of deep existential self-doubting, i may have a bad couple days every now and then, but usually that ends up being forgetting to take seroquil for a day or two. lets face it, we're all a bit off, but this helps to limit the anxiety and stress.

Anxious	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	35-44	11/28/2007 5:43:40 PM	THis is a very effective drug for anxiety. Withdrawl symptoms can be evident and unpleasent if I've used my prescription too quickly in a given month.  I take 60 .5mg tablets every thirty days.     This medicine has wonderful potential to help anxious people  feel comfortable; however, it must be used with descretion.  I have discussed increasing my dose or number of tablets with my doctor, but am concerned with withdrawl symptoms.  Three tablets a day may be better than two, but eventially I'm afraid I would require four and on.  Each patient and physician should determine the dose and frequency based on the individual's condtion, body and response to therapy.

However, I wasn't keen on the memory loss, lethargy or complete loss of sex drive, and am endeavoring to kick it in favor of &quot;lesser&quot; medications.  After 1.5 months, I am physically addicted and finding the withdrawal (nausea, insomnia, hot flashes) very troublesome.  A potent and useful medicine, though not without its cost.

When I needed something more, they gave me Buspar, which I've taken before; &amp; has been kinder &amp; gentler; much easier to tolerate. Ativan Withdrawal is extremely difficult: like riding a roller coaster w/ your nerves exposed; &amp; physically painful as well. I never experienced that extreme w/ Buspar.

I took one pill the night before and one pill 1 1/2 hours before my appointment.  The pill made me very nauseated and I threw up three times while at the dentist.  In all, it took about 12-15 hours before I stopped throwing up completely.

Anxious		4	2	4			11/5/2007 11:48:47 AM	This medication did help, but made me feel out of it. I got very tired and lightheaded. I felt nauseated and it lasted on and of for most of the day. Before taking this, make sure you are not alone until you know how it will affect you. Especially if you have children.
Anxious	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	11/4/2007 10:19:51 PM	If I take this drug several days in a row, or more than once a day, I find myself forgetful.  After the effects wear off, I feel like a fog has lifted.  However, it does disminish the anxious feelings that it was prescribed to help.

It was very effective in helping me relax enough to get to sleep and then sleep for a full 8 hours.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/26/2007 1:17:24 AM	I began taking this drug to treat anxiety while being treated for cancer, which it worked wonders for. I now only take it once a day to help me get a full nights rest, dream free. It does not knock me out, it just allows me to fall asleep naturally, and feel well rested every morning. If something causes unusual anxiety during the day, I would not hesitate to take 1mg to help ease the situation.

IT PUTS ME TO SLEEP AT NIGHT, THAT'S THE ONLY TIME I TAKE, BECAUSE I'VE BECOME DEPENDENT ON IT AND I CAN'T GO TO SLEEP WITHOUT IT. MY DOCTOR HAD TRIED OTHER MEDICINE ON ME BUT IT DOESN'T  DO WHAT THIS MEDICINE DOES. I HATE THAT I'M ON IT AND WISH I COULD GET OFF AND SLEEP NORMAL LIKE I USE TO DO. I'VE TRIED LEXAPRO BUT IT DIDN'T WORK ALSO EFFEXOR WHICH TAKES ABOUT 2 WEEKS BEFORE YOUR SYSTEM WILL WORK WITH IT.IF ANYONE KNOWS WHAT CAN HELP GET OFF THE  ATIVAN I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT.

Anxious	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	10/20/2007 5:43:07 PM	I take Paxil to treat my chronic panic disorder but lately tragedy in my family has brought back some anxiety that the Paxil doesn't fix.  Lorazepam is a godsend in that on days I'm feeling anxious, I take it, and I feel like myself again.  Other days, if I feel good, I don't take it.  The only downside is that about 5 hours after I take it I get pretty drowsy, but it's worth the relief and the ability to be free from anxiety.  My only concern is that I've heard it can be addictive, so I'm always overly fearful of taking it more than a couple of days in a row.

I no longer agonize over air travel due to the fact that I know Ativan will take away my anxiety.  I only take this about 3 times per year when I travel, one pill to my destination and one to get back home.

Since ativan is the primary drug used to treat major seizures, I asked my neurologist if I could take it to prevent aura's and &quot;breakthough seizures&quot; from progessing to grand mals. It works.. but only the brand name ativan is prescribed since it dissolves most quickly sublingually.  Generic lorazapam takes too long, and recirculates too much leaving a bad &quot;hangover&quot; effect then next day. PLEASE educate docs about this use!  Too many epilepsy patients are left seizuring ending up in ER's or with &quot;nuked neurons&quot; when parents and patients can intervene on the spot

The only problem I have is that if I don't take it my anxiety worsens.  This pill is very addictive and should be monitored closely.

I also use the medication if I drank too much wine the night before (too much sugar), I take one pill and the anxiety is gone.  Ativan is though very habit forming and addictive.  I have been taking it for over a year and feel as thought I cannot stop taking it.
