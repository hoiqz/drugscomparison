I agree  with other  commentator that masturbation after sex is only way to have an orgasm sometimes. Does increase girth and length some.  This may be the reason for loss of sensation since the penis's outer skin is stretched so tight.Wife likes it--duh.

This was fabulous 10 mins. after injection, I had a real boner, hard and firm. It's kind of expensive, and one poster said he had a tr--mixture put together by his pharmacist that was much cheaper. I never heard of Pharmacists doing such a thing. I would be afraid to ask mine. CVS

Using less than 10mg and erection is sufficient, however, having a hard time ejaculating and usually have to masturbate to get off.  Anyone else with this problem?

It is firm enough for sexual activity, but not as well as Caverject did in the past.  I've been using Caverject for almost 10 years with excellent results.  edex 40 mcg just isn't as effective everything being equal.

OK for a while, then started having pain and swelling to an extent that I stopped using it.  Recently tried Edex with good results.  Started with 20mcg, but used only about 3/4 of dosage.  Later reduced to 1/2 and works well.  My latest script is for the 10mcg dose, which I think will be fine. After injection, rub site will with alochol pad for a couple of minutes to prevent swelling or bleeding.

AFTER GETTING OVER THE THOUGHT OF STICKING THE MANHOOD, IT IS THE ANSWER TO A PRAYER.  PUMPS DONT WORK, NOR WILL VIAGRA WITH ITS SIDE EFFECTS.  THIS PRODUCT DOES IT ALL!  IF YOU HAVE ONE FOR AN EXTENDED TIME LIKE 4 HOURS, YOU ARE TAKING TOO MUCH MEDICATION.  CUT BACK TO HALF, OR A THIRD OF THE DOSE.  YOU WILL ACHIEVE THE SAME RESULTS, PRACTICALLY, WITHOUT THE AFTER TIME, WHEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO TO SLEEP AND SIMPLY CUDDLE WITH HER FOR A WHILE.  GOOD LUCK AND DEFINATELY GIVE IT A TRY.  I FOUND NO PROBLEM WITH THE INJECTION NEEDLE OR METHODS.  VIDEO FROM DOCTOR'S OFFICE STATED TO INJECT THE MIDDLE OR SLIGHTLY TWARD THE TIP FROM THE MIDDLE, AND TO ALTERNATE SIDES.  READ THE DIRECTIONS THAT COME IN THE BOX.  ENJOY !

I indicated the needle/syringe combos I used were 26 gauge...they are actually 28 gauge.  At one point I tried something smaller; I believe it was a 30 gauge---really tiny!  For some reason, it hurt more than the 28 g I had used (and subsequently still use).  I have no idea why---perhaps needles from some manufacturers are just sharper.

Ric9 was stressing the need to insert the needle at a 45 degree angle and to rub the area for 5 minutes to avoid bruising.  No disrespect, but I've not found either to be the case.  I go straight in (perpendicular to the skin)and rub the area for maybe 30 seconds--I've had minor bruising once, and have used the product successfully many dozens of times. I have also been inclined to go with the underside of the penis, maybe 1/4 to 1/2 inch off midline. As they say, watch out for veins.  I, like some others, don't like the injector system they provide--just too cumbersome.  I get small insulin syringes (with, I believe, 26 gauge needles) at the clinic I work at, and they have worked well for me.  The whole syringe holds only 0.5 ml (= 0.5 cc) and is calibrated to giving down to 0.01 ml.  Giving even as little as 1-2 mcg is easy with these.  (I'm currently taking more like 25-35 mcg, with good results.) The needles themselves are 1/2 inch long, and I insert it (biting down on the cap as I do so!) all the way in. Also, I don't know how expensive the Caverject is (haven't tried it), but the Edex seems to be effective, readily available, and reasonably priced. I, like others, draw off what I need and refrigerate the rest for later. (It seems to start gradually losing potency after a couple of weeks.) If you do this, be sure to use aseptic technique: I keep the vial in a clean plastic baggie, and, in addition to wiping the skin with an alcohol swab, I wipe the rubber portion of the vial before inserting the needle.   With multiple uses per vial, I find this system to be much less expensive than Viagra (and, for me, much more effective).

Dr. requested return visit to show how to use drug.  Showed how to set up injection and actually gave .25 of 1.0 ml.  He stated to watch erection to discern whether I needed a higher dose.  Left office to go to work, walked around with an erection for 2 hours.  Dr. stated that I could adjust between .25 and .50 dose.  He stated any medicine left in injector was supposed to be disposed of.  Off the record, he said to cap it, put in fridge and use within 3 days.  Went today, to V.A., to get same meds. Upon talking to V.A. Dr., who did not offer much information, he informed me to inject entire 20 mcg's.  He's crazy.  My new wife and I are extremely satisfied with Edex.

Had Prostate removed and it had been 9 months since I had an erection so I was so excited about it working that I just wanted to stand sideways in a mirror and look at it. My wife was pretty excited as well BUT!!!!!!!!!!! after an hour and a half or so she fell asleep and I had an erection for another 2.5 hours which got kinda old. ANYWAY... My question to ya all prior to doing it a second time.... Will less shorten the erection time? what is a good amount. P.S. Medic in VietNam so I can do whatever with a needle. So lay it on me. Thanks in advance

This only after pills, (which had side effects) pumps (which did not work) and creams (well...waste of time and money.  We used it (a bit skeptical) my husband hates needles. He's diabetic and after 15 min of using the entire 20cmg dose; it was like 25 all over again.  It was great. But...then he got spooked because after almost 4 house it had not completely gone down and he was ready to go to ER.  I examined and found it was going down and not at the rock hard erection from the beginning.  after about 30 more minutes it was back down but he complained of some moderate pain.  Perhaps next time we will use 1/2 of dosage to see what result we get with that.  How long can we keep the remaining dose in frig 3 to 5 days?  Hate to lose the meds.  All in all a satifying experience with a new med.

Side effects from my treatment of shingles has caused total impotance.At first it was hard to locate but a pharmacist at Wal-Mart located it and had it available within 48 hrs. My doctor had recommended using .50 ml to start and using the remainder if needed. That was not required. I now use .25 ml to start and in most cases thats all I need. Great Product!

I have to transfer the medication to a 31 gauge needle (the type used by diabetics) to keep from butchering my penis with the huge needle they use.  Help!  Can i order a 31 gauge needle to use?  I lose medication every time i transfer it to a smaller needle.  The large needle has caused serious scar tissue.  The Edex people are making a huge mistake that large needle.  Plus it hurts 10 times worse than a 31 gauge needle.  Roy

Because I need about 4mcg and no injector provides that and you can actually get 10cmg when you dial 5, I bought diabetic fine needles and waste the injector by filling the needles and fridge them.  I was trained in a trial using the drug in a vial so I can use needles fine.As to pain and bruising, you have to be very careful that you go in about 45 degrees to the top of the penis and it is incredibly important to hold and rub the injection site for a full five minutes.  Doing that and bruising does not occur and the pain that can occur disappears.  I did hit a nerve once and was in agony for a week.The dosage can be quite dangerous.  I started on 10cmg and that caused an eight hour erection.  That is not a good thing.I've complained to Pfizer about the injector sometimes delivering zero dose and sometimes double the dose but they just ignored the complaint.  It seems to be a problem with how the selector works and only happens in some batches.

Those who can find EDEX..as for TRIMIX with your Urologist - its the same thing and they will get a compounding pharmacist and provide needles and swab..cheaper to I hear..SO its not the MEDICINE that is hard to get..its the PRODUCT combo of EDEX...My girlfriend was so supportive - and now she is enjoying it as well...be smart - its not our fault guys..We are just not perfect..Im only 38 and in prettygood shape but this is the tragedy from Diabetes for a long time..

However, like the reviewer who commented that it &quot;hurt like h---&quot; I must agree.  My doctor started me on 20 mcg which, in retrospect, seems like a high dosage to be starting at.  I am intrigued with the idea of using much smaller doses (a few mcg, up to maybe 5) as did that gentleman.  Does anybody have any good information as to the stability of alprostadil in the fridge?  I too would be inclined to pitch it within a few weeks, a month at most.  I also wonder if anyone has combined, say, Levitra (20 mg 'almost' works for me) with very low (1-3 mcg) of alprostadil injectable?  I ask because, while the 20 mcg lasted 2-3 hours for me, I wonder if 1-3 mcg would be much more short-lived in effect, such that the Levitra would help carry the day.  (The idea of only, say, 15-20 minutes of sexual activity---if using only the low dose of alprostadil injectible--- is not all that appealing to me.)  I realize priapism is a potential problem here---I would 'experiment' cautiously with such combos.  But I just wondered if anybody else out there had tried such an approach.

However, for me is does not produce a full erection using 20 micrograms. For anyone who is having trouble finding this drug, try CVS Drug Store/Pharmacy. Or you can also get it through Wal-Greens mail-in order pharmacy. It usualy has to be &quot;back-ordered&quot;, but it doesn't take very long for either of them to get it for you. But you better have good insurance, because this is a VERY EXPENSIVE medication!

If anyone reading this post knows of a source, please post on this site. Would be a shame if no one will distribute it. My pharmacist is searching with no success. Schwarz  Pharma has seemed to disappear off the face of the earth. At the price it sold for, they couldn`t be losing $ on it, I would think. But well worth the money. Compounding pharmacist can compound it but no good delivery system and bulk has to be refrigerated,making travel difficult. Any suggestions anyone ? Would appreciate any response

A doctor at the VA told me about the medication and said that most men don't want to use it because of the delivery method.  I have found that if you are familir with giving injections it is very easy to use.  Since I have been using the med I am more confident around women and can have an erection that lasts longer than it did prior to the medication.  The needle is small and possibly flimsy but if you are careful it causes no more of a problem than most needles that are for injection.  Since starting alprostadil I have gotten maried and my wife thinks it is great.Most of the women I was with before my wife said they would never give the injection because they didn't want to hurt me but giving it myself has proved to be the best way to inject it.

The needle that fits on the rub top is so unstable, the needle could possibly break off during injection or bend and then become too dangerous to use.  I am extremely suprised the FDA passed the design.  In the 18 years I have been exposed to these types of products, this is the worst and scariest design.  I strongly suggest that no one use this product.  I plan on pitching the prescription and asking the pharmacist to get another product.  The risk of injury is not worth the savings from this generic product.

Inability to have an Erection	harryone, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	2	4	Male	65-74	9/24/2007 11:03:31 AM	I became completely impotent after cryosurgery for prostate cancer. None of the pills worked and vacuum devices were  only marginally successful.  First experiences  with caverject produced great erections  but also  hurt like H---.  Eventually  I reduced  dosages to about 1(one) microgram by  drawing about 5% of the contents of a 20 MG hypo into a  small hypo commonly used by diabetics. These cost  only a few cents each and have  a very small needle.  This  method  eliminates the dull pain which occurred with dosages of 5 MG or more and I get several  doses per  hypo. My Dr.  suggests that  I keep  the mixed hypo in the refrigerator and  discard any mixed alprostadil  after one month and be very careful not to contaminate the stored  medicine. I have been using this method 2 or 3 times a week  for nearly one year with absolutely no problems and nothing but smiles  all around.
