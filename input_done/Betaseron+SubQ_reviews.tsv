Multiple Sclerosis	dqincww, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	8/11/2012 10:54:43 PM	i found that holding the syringe in for a couple of seconds after injecting medication, my injection site bruises/marks ceased.  it is really easy to use, much more so that when i was on avonex (ever see the size of that needle!) but i think it is a normal reaction to hesitate when you're going to stick a needle in yourself.  oh, and btw, it had a profound effect on improving my health after a very frightening exacerbation.
Multiple Sclerosis	Sue, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	6/29/2012 6:47:28 PM	Have some skinsite reactions. Have redness that comes and goes. Depending if hot or cold. 
Multiple Sclerosis	bbgirl60, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	12/3/2011 5:23:32 PM	This has been easy to inject with the provided betaject system and I have learned when and how to massage the injection site when I did not get all the bubbles out. Learning to get all the bubbles out is the trick...they STING when they go in!
Multiple Sclerosis	Happy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	55-64	10/1/2011 12:06:10 AM	I've been using this Betaseron medication twice since 1999. For a short period of time I switched to another, but came right back to the Betaseron. I had only one relapse,and that was in 2009.
Multiple Sclerosis	gayleh, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	9/5/2011 2:12:00 AM	I have been on Betaseron for 16 years.  At different times I have had problems with injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms but overall I have remained extremely healthy which I attribute to being on the medication.  I feel very fortunate.
Multiple Sclerosis	cdb, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	55-64	7/20/2011 1:30:53 AM	I was allergic to copaxone, tried rebif and was sick with every shot and my liver enzymes started climbing, so my doctor switched me to betaseron.  I have to mix it so it takes more time to prepare but my liver enzymes, after 6 months on it, are back to normal, and I have only had two times when I was sick.  Normally I just have a mild headache that tylenol takes care of.  My MRI was good with no new lesions, so my doctor and I are both happy.
Multiple Sclerosis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	55-64	6/10/2011 2:40:36 PM	Have been on Betseron for 2 yrs and no new lesions but flu like sypmtoms have been constant also general weakness. Went off meds for 2 months and feel human again. Just got notice from mt insurance co. that they will no longer cover Betaseron (they recommend Extavia) so the decision of going back on this medication has been taken out of my hands. Will be discussing next step with my doctor.
Multiple Sclerosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	25-34	4/20/2011 12:49:27 PM	I was on Extavia for the past year with no problems.  Due to insurance changes, I had to change to Betaseron 2 months ago.  I have had many injection site reactions and other side effects that were not issues when on Extavia despite being told they were the &quot;SAME EXACT&quot; medications.  I would change back to Extavia given the chance.
Multiple Sclerosis	Beener, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	35-44	3/16/2011 2:10:42 PM	I believe this medication has helped stabalize my MS symptoms and lesions. Had taken copaxone prior to Betaseron and had too many reactions as well as no improvement with MRIs or symptoms.  Switched to Beta in 2005. Injection site side effects: redness and itching along with some small knots. I do get occasional flu like symptoms after taking the meds but take Tylenol for it.  My last blood check shows some issue with my liver so I will have to see if I can remain on Beta.  I will take the side effects if it keeps my MS at bay. But if my liver is not liking the meds, I may have to consider other options (if there are any.) Overall, it is my belief this medication has helped keep my MS from worsening.
Multiple Sclerosis	readfullinfofirst, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	3/7/2011 10:31:14 PM	I was on Copaxone for about four years, and suddenly I  was rushed to the ER (via 911) and diagnosed with Pulmonary Embolism (blood clots) in my lungs, it was also determined that I had high liver enzynes.My neurologist has told me to discontinue Copaxone. I started using Betaseron in Feb. 2011, I had shortness of breath immediately (in 4-5 min) after the injection, severe stiffness on the left side of my neck,severe headache, dizzness, increased heart beats, and other less severe symptoms, overall, I just did not feel well immediately after the injection. I recorded and reported these symptoms. My Neurologist has told me to discontinue Betaserone. It was suggested that I may be sensative to the MS medications. Betaserone was certainely not for me. My plan is to choose not to be on any therapy for my MS, but I will have to see what my Dr recommends first. I will comply with his treatment, but if it's up to me I will NOT take any more MS injections.

The needle really is thin, the symptoms have gotten less severe, and I feel better on this drug with no relapses.  Everyone's experience will be different, but it's clear a lot went into making the home-injection process patient-friendly.  If it is keeping your MS from flaring up, keep at it!

Multiple Sclerosis	HJB, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	9/23/2010 7:15:56 PM	I was on Betaseron between 1998 and Feb 2003.  I had begun to feel ill after taking my shot.  I worked full time despite having had MS since diagnosis of relaxing remitting MS in 1991.  I had a bladder suspension operation in Nov 2002.  No one told me increased urination was a side effect of the drug~ I was phoned by the MS clinic in February '03 and told I was to stop taking the &quot;medication&quot; immediatly as I had developed 'reciprocating antibodies'!  I have since been diagnosed with 2ndary progressive MS and can barely walk with my walker...

I've had injection site reactions like bruising and welts under the skin. Sometimes I'll stop the injections for 3 to 4 days and I will have much more energy. I need to discuss this with my neurologist at my next visit. Sticking needles into my skin isn't something that I look forward to, even if it is every other day. The flu-like symptoms ended shortly after beginning the drug, but I feel that continuing on Betaseron is having a negative effect on my overall energy level.

Multiple Sclerosis	Carole, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	7/16/2010 2:39:51 PM	I have been on Betaseron for 3 years now.  At first I had a few flu like symptoms but they soon went away.  My biggest problem is bruising and redness at the injection site, I have had one bad relapse since taking this which was made better by IV infusion of steroids. 
Multiple Sclerosis	Adam, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	45-54	6/2/2010 6:34:34 PM	I have used Betaseron for 12 years.  I have not had any relapses since my diagnosis that started with double vision. My MRI results have remained stable.  I have had injection site problems in my thighs, stomache and arms.
Multiple Sclerosis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	5/21/2010 3:46:33 PM	I switched from Avonex to Betaseron 6 months ago. The skin reactions - bruises, redness, lumps and necrotic spots - have become so sever I have stopped it. My MS syptoms are actually much better off the drug so I don't think it was the right one for me.
Multiple Sclerosis	FrancinesAvon@yahoo.com, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	3/25/2010 6:48:41 PM	I've been using Betaseron since it first came out.  The first few years I used it I would get redness at the injection site which would either hurt or itch.  For the last few years I've been getting extremely painful knots.  I only inject myself in the stomach because the thighs are too painful, and reaching my butt is awkward.  When I went off this medication for about a month several years ago, I noticed a pronounced increase in my MS symptoms.  I went back on the Betaseron immediately.  I just wish I didn't get the knots.  Does anyone have any suggestions? 
Multiple Sclerosis	glady, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	3/19/2010 2:37:11 PM	I have used Betaseron since 1995.  I did have a relapse in 1996 leaving me semi-paralyzed on the right side.  I used a wheelchair in the home.  Shortly after the relapse, I returned to walking in the home unaided. I was left to believe that the Betaseron was a help.

Multiple Sclerosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	10/26/2009 4:43:38 PM	I started taking this medication in Aug 2009 and I haven't felt normal ever since. I get terrible headaches and extreme exhaustion. I feel like I'm in a fog the day after taking this medication. Thank goodness the flu-like symptoms have alleviated somewhat but I still get muscle aches and chills the night of my injections. I'm running out of places to inject myself since I have bruises and welts at the injection sites.

Multiple Sclerosis	spencer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	9/26/2009 2:52:18 PM	I have had worsening of pain and haedaches. It has concerned me. I have been very sick since I started this medicine. Although other meds have also been prescribed that cause me difficulty so its been hard to know. I have stopped the others and lowered the dose to half seems to be more tolerable with the help of meds I was aalready on for pain. They tell me there is no document of other drug interactions.
Multiple Sclerosis	linda710, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	8/18/2009 3:36:20 PM	I have been on Betaseron since 1995. My neurologist strongly feels it has made the difference between being in a wheelchair and walking with a cane, as I do now. After 15 years I have never developed antibodies against the drug. I take two Tylenol to alleviate the flu-like symptoms with each injection. I urge others with MS not to give up. A positive attitude helps as much as any medicine.

I think I had more energy before starting this med.  side effects are nil, no flu effects anyways. my optic neuritis is continually worse so, it doesn't help with that.

Multiple Sclerosis	ailing_, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	45-54	5/8/2009 4:56:29 AM	Besides hating giving myself injections every other day, this medication made me ill virtually very time I used it.  So every other day I would have flu-like symptoms as well as a mind-fog for the 16-24 hour period following the injection.  And the drug was ineffective.  It did absolutely nothing to help slow the attacks, or relapses, and neither did it help prolong my inevitable slide into secondary progressive MS.  I used this drug for nearly 18 months before switching over to Copaxone, which also was ineffective on me, but at least it did not make me ill every time I used it.

Multiple Sclerosis	Promiseland, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	3/27/2009 10:43:55 PM	My experience with this medicine was depression, liver trouble, and flu symptoms.  I did not take the meds. very long.  About 10 weeks.  I could not handle the depression.  I went off the meds for 2 week and my liver function returned to normal and the depression lifted.  I really tried to stick it out, but I could not live like that.  I finally went to copaxone.  So far so good.

Now with the new injector it has improved. I have had one relapse but was over it pretty quickly after steriods. I have  started exercising every day and this has improved my well being.

My exam, after being on the medication for a couple of month's, was the best I'd had since being diagnosed. However I begab to lose my hair. long story short, I've lost 3/4 of my hair, been taken off this medicine,am being put on Avonex and am praying the hairloss stops and reverses its self. Be careful out there!

Starting about 3.5 years, began experiencing significant muscle weakness in my knees and legs and toe numbness in one foot.   Is there any documented delayed Betaseroon side effects explaining any of these?  Neurology exam followups continue to be reported as clinically stable.

Although at times I experience some mild flu-like symptoms, Betaseron has done an amazing job of slowing the progression down! My current physician's are amazed at how well I am doing since starting treatment. It's a little rough when you start, but hang in there with it if it is a bit' rough. It's worth it!Gina Soriano

My first few months were horrible. The injections left me with knots and huge red circles at the injection sites. It's been over a year now, and I'm doing much better. I've had 2 relapses since I started the medicine.I find mixing the medicine fairly easy. I hold the syringe in my hand for 2 to 3 minutes before I mix everything. That warms it up to body temperature which is better than a cold injection. I mix for 5 minutes now instead of 3 and that cut down on the burning when I inject.I can't inject into my thighs. It's just too painful.  I use the stomach areas and extend around to my hips and butt, saddlebag area! I use the auto injector because I still have a huge needle phobia. I position the injector and close my eyes, then push the button.The side effects for me were minimal. I never did pre medicate despite my beta nurse telling me I should. I inject before going to bed at night, so if there were side effects, I just slept through them. I've had trouble with 1 package where the syringe came apart from the connector to the bottle of medicine. Another syringe was broken, the glass was cracked and one had no needle. All of the defective materials were replaced with no trouble, after a phone call to the pharmacy that ships to me. I am momecat@cox.net
Multiple Sclerosis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	9/26/2008 3:33:23 PM	I was hesitant to start this medication and did not like the idea of injections. Have to say I've had very few problems and am in much better shape than I was before--only one very minor relapse in over 3 years.  A few side effects have occurred but nothing I can't deal with.  You have to take the med as directed and take care of yourself in other aspects of your life, too!

And have only done four injections so far!! I was a bit nervous at first about having to give myself injections. But, my Beta Nurse visit to my home was a wonderful experience! She was very very helpful and guided me through everything. She was very imformational... I would have never gotten through it with out her!! I'm doing well on my injections and hoping for the best! &quot;Thanks Dana&quot; So, so far my experience with this treatment has been a success........As for the effectiveness of if it has worked for me, I guess I'm just not sure yet! Again, I've only been using it for, four injections so far!!! But, very eager to get some relief!!!

SO FAR, AFTER 10 YEARS, I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY PROBLEMS FROM THE INJECTIONS.  I HAVE TO ASSUME IT IS SLOWING DOWN THE PROGRESSION OF MY SECONDARY PRORESSIVE M.S.

However i do experience some brusing and knots at injection sites.  I weigh 115 lbs and dont have much fat to inject it into.  They are very tender at times.

Now my main problem is finding where to shoot myself.Lhasalover@netzero.net

Everything stays together as long as I take my time.  I do get little bubbles but all I have to do is wait a little longer and they will go back up into the medicine jar.  I think this new way of mixing the medicine is great.  All everyone has to do is take their time.

Sometimes the pieces will separate and is difficult to keep together.  The valve also tends to catch small air bubbles.
