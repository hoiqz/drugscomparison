Skin Condition	SChristian, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	9/20/2012 5:29:50 PM	Was prescribed for severe, infected poison ivy (1st time event).  Was dumbstruck that it worked on everything else!  Arthritis in feet, knees and hands virtually disappeared; swelling nearly gone.  Spider bite on elbow vanished.  Total skin transformation on face...including bags under eyes gone and eyelids totally lifted (been sagging nearly shut for 1+ yrs. Swear it looks like I've had a face lift in 13 days.  No exageration. Gums totally firm, with no softness at all.  BUT!!!  This stuff kicks my butt!  Heart is constantly racing and feel full of anxiety one minute and the next minute feel like I can't stand on my wobbly legs.  Feel like i need to just sit and lean over.  Feel like there is literally a spare tire around my chest/waist and dont' sleep at night.  I had ONE objective and that was to keep the poison ivy out of my blood stream.  Had NO idea everything else would be effected.  I can't decide if this is the best thing that ever happened to me....or if it's the biggest downer side-effects.  Have to say I'm a bit nervous about what will happen when this gets out of my system....
Asthma	AlmostDiedFromIt, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	55-64	7/6/2012 12:18:25 PM	The closest thing I can find listed here for why I took this is asthma.  Actually it was prescribed for bronchitis inflammation along with Ceftin for an UR.When I started the drug, I felt totally invincible and with the eerie sense of well being. No aches, no paines.  However I immediately I began not to be able to sleep and when I did had extremely strange dreams and constant sweating.  I went for six days without sleeping well.  Then came the digestive problems with no food being digested by my body and completely backing up my system.  Then came the constant hiccups, in groups of 10 for hours.  Then came the constant reflux because my digestive system was full.  I lost my voice due to the reflux.I thought things would settle down as I tapered the dose but more problems came as then.  More sweats, more strange dreams, pounding heart, trouble breathing, constant itching all over, extreme weakness and periods of feeling faint and almost passing out.Then came the emotional instability with an uncontrollable rage.  I have never been out of control like that.  More weakness, depression, holding fluid and food.Finally four days after tapering the dosage I have begun to feel better.This product should be taken off the market because it has far too many side effects and could kill someone.  I will instruct my physician NEVER to prescribe mt this product again.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Maddie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	7/1/2012 1:24:01 PM	I was on a 10-day pack. Although I was pain free, it was the worst experience and will NEVER take it again. I do not do drugs - I was uncontrollably aggressive while taking Dexpak, existed on 3-4 hrs sleep each night, and experienced withdrawals with the shakes for a few hours the first and second morning and hallucinations one night after my last pill. I was super hyper and didn't care what I said or how I reacted - I think this is a dangerous medication and although I was pain free, it was not worth it and today is the 3rd day being off the meds and I am OK, but my pain has returned. NOT WORTH THE EXPERIENCE AND FREEDOM OF PAIN FOR 10 DAYS!

Blistering Skin Diseases	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	4/6/2012 7:21:41 PM	Everytime i have taken it before this, it has worked wonders, brilliant, but this time i took it and i think i had too many bad reactions, and it came back, im miserable!
Asthma	MamaLinda, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	1/20/2012 9:35:00 PM	Experienced blurred vision, heart palpatations.  Would not have taken this medication if I had known it would make me feel so bad.  It did help with the asthma.

Disorder of the Connective Tissue	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	6/9/2011 3:01:36 PM	I took dexpak for flare of a muscle disease that came out of remission after many years. I was well prepared for side effects prior to 1st dose but to tell you the truth, I was so ill prior, I didn't notice anything other than feeling hot, a slight headache.  I did take with yogurt to lessen chance of upset stomach.  This is great med but should only be considered if you have taken other weaker meds to no avail.
Presence of Polyps in the Nose	cajun, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	45-54	5/31/2011 12:44:30 PM	If this were the last med on the market I would NOT take this med. You think you are losing your mind, no focus, confusion, irriability, numb feeling on the outside, insomia, depression, no energy at all. I am an outgoing energetic person, I could not get off the couch the entire holiday weekend....Beware!!!
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	cajun, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	45-54	5/25/2011 3:46:17 PM	The side effects were worse than the condition I was being treated for. The confusion, tiredness and just right out not being to function clearly was horrible. Would not take again.
Other	Dubyah1970, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Male	35-44	4/17/2011 4:58:46 PM	Prescribed for occipital neuralgia.  Side effects worse than condition.  Jitters, headaches, dizziness, leg cramps, and loss of composure.
Asthma	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	3/6/2011 3:02:23 AM	Worst experience ever. I had to stop 4 1/2 days into a 10 day dose. The back and stomach cramps had me in a fetal position in tears, my face and body are still distended. My fingers are numb, I eat everything in sight and have gained 10lbs in 4 days. I feel disoriented, dizzy, drunk, lethargic, weak, irritable, depressed,and beyond tired. My lips, tongue, face and throat are swollen and sore and itchy. Everything I eat or drink feels and tastes covered in oil. My heart still races and I have the shakes/jitters constantly. I thought I was going crazy until I read the other horror stories similar to mine. The worst part, I still feel this way right now and I haven't taken a pill for 4 days. I will never - EVER - take another steriod unless my only option is death. These 10 days have felt comparable. I just want to feel normal again. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	lilonie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	35-44	1/8/2011 9:51:44 AM	While this medication somewhat worked for my RA, the side effects were AWFUL! It sent me into a medication induced mania. My mind raced and would not stop. I had heartburn/indigestion so bad I thought my chest was on fire. I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. The horrible side effects out way the positive effects. I would have rather hurt than go through what I did. I had to be taken off this drug early due to the effects I experienced. 
Other	kariered, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	11/2/2010 3:17:21 AM	 Took this for a sinus infection due to allergies, vocal chord swelling that didn't respond to Keflex. Really helped me a lot. Some side effects I had were: trouble sleeping, a bit moody, energy, felt hot, increase in hunger, no food tasted normal
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	Skeller85, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	6/21/2010 8:05:32 PM	After years of undiagnosed/treated allergies, I finally fell apart two years ago.  It has been a battle getting my sinuses back to a consistent and functioning state.  Dexpack was the final piece of he puzzle, preventing swelling that eliminated the ability to taste or smell, as well as chronic sinus infections.  This has literally changed the quality of my life.
Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	35-44	6/20/2010 10:49:42 PM	I was prescribed this medicine because I was had sinus infection on the left side of my head. Took the medicine for about 6 days and had to stop it. This was probably one of the worse side effects I have ever had with a medicine. I was feeling very jittery, the whole left side of my body seemed to be restless for about 48 hours. I had really bad heartburn that would make it difficult to breathe. I had taken other steroid medicine before, but never felt nothing like this. 
Rash	gigi, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	3/7/2010 2:53:43 PM	I took two rounds of DexPak 13 plus a Medrol Dospak and two Kenalog Injections. But the DexPak, I took last, and became short of breath and fatigued, my PCP and Allergist both thought there was an underlying problem besides the anaphylaxis and hives. Now it seems that the shortness of breath and fatigue was caused from the DexPak.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	2/19/2010 7:54:46 AM	I have had chronic sinusitis for over 2 years. This drug, along with Levaquin has been my worst nightmare. Extreme heartburn, swelling all over, numbness in feet and arms, burning sensation in feet, dry/cracking skin that bleeds easily, raw feeling like a bad sunburn, extreme irritibility to the point of wanting to be violent, extreme nervousness and inability to sleep, increased appetitite but food has no taste, a drunk-like state of being, constipation and no relief from the sinus pain. I stopped the Dex-Pak 3 1/2 days early, and became worse. Swollen body has intensified, body feels bruised and tender, extreme sinus pain again. I will never take a steroid again unless it is definitely a life or death situation. 
Other	sherry, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	45-54	11/10/2009 1:29:41 PM	So relieved to read the other reviews. prescriped this for sinus infection - cleared that up, but have never felt worse.  i am sick every day...so swollen, out of body experiences, feel like i'm crazy.  indigestion, feel horrible.  only 4 more days of weaning off of it - will never use it again.  this stuff could be dangerous in the wrong person.  makes me feel like another being.
Rash	kjenner929, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	10/8/2009 9:34:30 PM	I was prescribed Dexpak for a rash of unknown origin. I had never taken steroids before. The rash cleared up after two days. My doctor prescribed 6 days of tappered steroids. The day after I finished the steroids I felt horrible. I have never had such bad side effects from anything! I can't catch my breath,my heart feels like it is racing, I have bad acid reflux, upset stomach, a huge appetite, I'm dizzy, jittery and yet all I want to do is hide under my bed covers. I am soooo irritable I could run someone into a ditch with my car. I feel like a serious crack head coming down from a really bad high with the worst PMS of their life. I really would have rather dealt with the rash. I am very dissapointed that my doctor didn't warn me about any of this. 
Rash	Barah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	9/30/2009 10:27:37 PM	Horrible hives that won't go away and no one knows why I am all of sudden getting them. Put on these meds and they went away!! BUT! HORRIBLE side effects!! Couldn't sit still for a minute, talked like crazy, couldn't sleep, sweat constantly, weird dreams, thoughts, mind racing non stop, co-workers thought I was on illegal drugs for over a week, husband couldn't stand to be around me and I snapped at any little altercation! After the last pill, everything was all better right away! :o) Weird, weird drug, but I will say, my hives are gone! But if you can, try the shots first, usually works for most people and try to avoid this drug! I will say though, I did get about 3 weeks of school studying done in about 24 hours, the energy pick up was awesome!
Rash	tlw, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	9/23/2009 1:40:38 PM	took medicine for rash that was thought to be allergic reaction that prednisone wasnt handling. rash cleared quickly but horrible side effects. Heart burn was so bad hurt to breathe.  finally quit med before end of pack just to quit eating tums. Though I didn't mind the constant desire to eat I could have done without the resulting weight gain and fluid retention. The energy it gave me while on it was ok but after 5 days running of not being able to sleep more than 3 hours straight I was a walking zombie.

Bar None, I have planter fasicittis in both heels of the feet. I was out of work for a week and was buzzed to the point of not being able to function.

Walking was painful, resting at night was impossible.  There was no position I could remain in and find relief.  After months of pain, this medication gave me relief I thought I would never find again.

Rash	icladyv, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	6/23/2009 11:50:16 PM	I started taking this medication because of a rash on my chest and arms, along with penicillin, stopped taking on 5th day, dizzy, short of breath, weak, excessive sweating, and low heart rate. Was put on potassium to aleviate the dehydration. Dr said to continue medication, but i felt so badly by the 5th day, i could no longer bear it. Stopped on my own, and hoping that rash completly clears on its own, probably dermatitis or an allergy to food, will see how it goes without the medication for a while.
Skin Condition	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	6/3/2009 3:18:38 PM	I had a mysterious rash on both arms and was prescribed this.  The medicine has done it's job, but the side effects have been murder!  I can only think about food constantly!

I can now walk again and do simple things like going into a store with out a scooter. MOst of the time I can't take any thing because of the side affects and with this I had none just all my pain went away almost over night.
Asthma	supernanny, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	55-64	5/8/2009 2:22:57 PM	I was given this drug for an asthm attack  and it is the worst drug I have ever had.  Within a couple of days I was flushed, stomach aching, nauseated, dizzy, thought I was losing my mind.  My heart was beating so fast that I could not breath.  I thought I was going to die.  I have not taken any for almost 36 hours and I still have numbness in my face and hands.  I was taking a couple of other drugs so I took myself off of them one by one and this was the culprit.  I will never, never, take this stuff again.  It is evil and foul.

I definately saw good results however I think my numerous side effects were just as bad if not worse than the original symptoms, but I was told not to stop taking them once I started because I would become violently ill.Diareha, night time heart burn, indigestion, extreme gas but unable to release, constipation, night sweats, night terrors, jitteryness, insomnia, mood swings, inability to stop eating.If you can look past this then the drug is great!

I have never felt this strange in my entire life, and that's saying something.  I am achy, dizzy, moody, dopey, sneezy, and all the other dwarfs combined.  I can't eat enough and I am going to the bathroom constantly.  At least every 2 hours, even during the night.  I would rather have poison oak on my face than feel this way.

Allergic Reaction caused by a Drug	ann, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	65-74	7/21/2008 6:51:51 AM	After 10 months, I had an allergic reacion to Herceptin, a treatment for breast cancer. I was at first mistakeningly treated for shingles but soon discovered it was a reaction to the chemo drug. The Dex Pax ended my rash which started on my back and went to the stomach and under my arms. It seeme to be dealing with my stomach and glands were inflammed. However, I am very disoriented and have trouble functioning in every day life as a result of the steroids. It has greatly effected my &quot;balance&quot; and I do not feel I can drive or do most normal things. I am assuming this will all change as I near the end of the treatment....I am on day 9 and have 5 days to go. 
Rash	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	6/23/2008 10:04:38 AM	My son took this drug for poison oak.  While it did clear up the poison oak, the side effects weren't worth it.  He was irritated, hungry, and urinated a lot. He had muscle cramps and headaches.  I asked his dr. to make a note to never put him on this medication again.  Regular Prednisone never affected him this way.

My muscules were tense, i could not catch my breath, my stomach was terribly upset and i was so jittery i could not function.  My whole body hurt and i could not work or anything for a week.  This drug is criminal.
