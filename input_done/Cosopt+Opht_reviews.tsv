If you have any questions regarding the information, consult your doctor or pharmacist.This medication is for use in the eye(s), usually one drop in the affected eye(s) 2 times a day, or as directed by your doctor.To apply eye drops, wash your hands first. To avoid contamination, do not touch the dropper tip or let it touch your eye or any other surface.Some products contain a preservative that may be absorbed by contact lenses. If you are using a product with a preservative and you wear contact lenses, remove the lenses before using the eye drops. Wait at least 15 minutes before putting in your contact lenses.Tilt your head back, look upward and pull down the lower eyelid to make a pouch. Hold the dropper directly over your eye and place one drop in your eye. Look downward and gently close your eyes for 1 to 2 minutes. Place one finger at the corner of your eye (near the nose) and apply gentle pressure. Try not to blink and do not rub your eye. This will prevent the medication from draining out. Repeat these steps for your other eye if so directed.Do not rinse the dropper. Replace the dropper cap after each use.If you are using another kind of eye medication (e.g., drops or ointments), wait at least 10 minutes before applying other medications. Use eye drops before eye ointments to allow the eye drops to enter the eye.Use this medication regularly in order to get the most benefit from it. To help you remember, use it at the same times each day. It is important to continue using this medication even if you feel well. Most people with glaucoma or high pressure in the eyes do not feel sick.What conditions does Cosopt Opht treat?

Increased Pressure in the Eye	TinaL, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	45-54	12/8/2007 7:17:53 PM	I don't like cosopt. Not all the time but sometimes the blurred vision is really bad. It seems like if you are physically moving around and doing things the blurred vision is worst. I have taken another drop, Xlatan at night and that drop is wonderful but after a complicated eye surgery the pressure  in my eyes got worst and I'm now taking tree different drops for the pressure. Cospt is my least favorite.
