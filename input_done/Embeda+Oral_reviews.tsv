Chronic Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/29/2011 4:23:39 PM	 EMBEDA has helped me tremendously!  I have no side effects from it and it relieves my pain more than any other medication I've tried so far!

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	ChronicPain, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	2/26/2011 6:34:07 PM	I was taking two Embeda a day for about two months and the only thing it managed to numb for me was my lips and emotions.  If you want to be a mindless zombie and still have considerable pain then Embeda is for you.  I now take three 30MG Oxycodone per day and it totally puts these worthless pills to shame.  They may be okay for a mild pain sufferer but for anything moderate to severe they aren't even worth mentioning.  I've never responded well to any form of morphine.  
Chronic Pain	casperbabe, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	2/15/2011 10:07:21 PM	I have been on it for a couple months now due to having surgery and then one month later having a car accident.  Works pretty well although I have to take Morphine IR 15mgs every 6 hours for breakthrough pain.  I've been really happy, though it does make me cry at the drop of a hat and I still have some pain, some days are good some or not.  I'm going to begin physical therapy in about 3 weeks so I am hopeful :)
Chronic Pain	Mustang01, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/1/2011 7:39:14 PM	I have been in PM for 4 years, My old Dr retired and I was sent to a new Dr. This new Dr. put me on the Embeda and was tapering my BT meds.He said to me and infront of my husband he didnt like narcotics,(why be in pm then?)He spoke directly with my old Doc on taking over his Pts and will continue the Pts Pm meds, This med is VERY BAD!!! with the 1st dose, it thru me into W/D, I take my meds as directed! tried to take it for a month, it was perscribed 3x/day but due to the bad SE, I had to stop taking it. I had very bad itching, constipation, severe HA that made me feel my BP was up, I informed my PM Doc but he said to take a Benadryl with it, OMG!I am a Nurse and knew it was an reaction, and for the Dr. to say this?, needless to say, I am quiting PM with him, and am going thru w/d right now to get off this crap he is dealing out. I believe he is getting kickbacks because he wouldnt change the med. I probably would have died if I took the Benadryl with the Embeda due to it also amking me very drowsey. I have read that a Pt should not ake BT meds with Embeds due to serious or even fatal SE.I also have hpothyroidism and believe that was contrubiting to the release of the Naltrexone in my body/slow matabolism, but that Doc didnt consider that when perscribing the Embeda, and it is a contraindication on the imprint, so that is also why I think he is getting kickbacks, The Docs only education onmeds is thru the Drug Reps, I have seen this 1st hand! I am in bad pain but dont want this feeling of w/d all the time and possibility of dying.
Severe Pain	nope, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	1/26/2011 2:49:17 PM	I've been fighting for 11 yrs with severe pain - 4 operations - trying not to go on disability - better pain relief than some not as good as others. Side affects are present - nausea, constipation, and the need to sleep are the worse. Hard to stay focus at work.
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	25-34	1/14/2011 12:44:11 AM	The medication was given to me after surgery because i have a high tolerance to narcotics due to chronic neck, back, and shoulder pain. It worked great for about 3 weeks and then it basically stopped working as if i built my tolerence up to this. I find regular morphine works better and seems to last longer on myself.

Chronic Pain	mr. tmj, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	12/26/2010 7:21:26 PM	I've been on many different narcotics, long- and short-acting, including oxycontin and methadone.  And although something like a 30mg roxicodone will relieve acute pain better than the embeda, the roxicodone only lasts an hour or two, and I get a crash afterwards.  The embeda keeps me close to pain-free around the clock.  I am waking up in the morning pain-free for the first time in a long while.  I still need a 10mg percocet or something every once in a while, but the embeda helps significantly.  I am on 60mg 2x daily.  This is my first experience with morphine in any formulation.

One 0.8mg capsule. i was on 3 10/325mg of percocets before this. this stuff is horrible. im sure it has something to do with the low dosage. but not sure how my doctor goes from 3 10/325mg of percs to this. still have pain and have stopped taken this stuff.

Before the procedure and Embeda my pain level was a 10+ for four months and now in less then a week my pain is down to a moderate two. Since Embeda is a 12 hour time release capsule I no longer have the ups and downs I was experiencing from other pain relievers.

I WON'T BE A GUINNEA PIG FOR THIS DRUG. I DESTROYED THIS USELESS DRUG. NO RELIEF OF PAIN AND HORRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS. I COULD HAVE TAKEN A BABY ASPIRIN AND PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GOT A BETTER EFFECT.

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	25-34	10/4/2010 9:11:24 PM	My pain management doctor put me on this in June, the 20mg 2/day, and just upped it at my last appointment 2 and a half weeks ago.  In August she did give me an Rx for instant release morphine for breakthrough pain, which i do need on occasion.  Overall i haven't had too many issues with this drug and while everyone is different i would give this a chance for long-acting pain control.

I am now disabled because of my knees and back. I have been taking Embedda for 2 months now, but still require at least 3 Percocet 7.5mg/326mg a day. I don't believe it helps as much as other long acting pain medications.(I'm not sure if it a good idea to have Narcan &quot;incase you might overdose because you are dumb enough to crush your narcotics.&quot;)

I still hurt sometimes and I hope he ups the mg or something. It does help some and less pills to take a day because I was taken 6 percocets a day and still hurt. Good luck and I hope ya'll find something that will help.

Chronic Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	6/12/2010 4:03:46 PM	I've been on narcotic pain meds for 5 yrs. for 3 herniated/bulging discs. I've used hydrocodone, oxycodone, oxycontin, and fentanyl patches. I have been on this med. for almost 3 months and it seems to be working, I don't get the ''immediate'' pain relief exactly like I use to with oxycodone but it is relief that lasts alot longer than a short-term medication. Since I don't get immediate pain relief, my pain management Dr also has me on short acting, immediate release morphine for breakthrough pain. I guess all people are different so they have different experiences, but as a chronic pain sufferer for YEARS that was taking 5 oxycodone 10/325 a day, this drug has helped me alot. But again everyone is different and my dr understands that I still need something for breakthrough pain &amp; has also kept me on a muscle relaxant (Zanaflex) My suggestion is to communicate your problems/concerns with your doctor &amp; if you still dont find relief, find a dr that WILL listen. GOOD LUCK, I hope others find the relief I have

Chronic Pain	DWP, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	55-64	5/19/2010 6:13:40 PM	58 W/M with Chronic Osteoarthritis &amp; multiple joint replacements/fusions; used to taking Avinza which greatly helped. Prescribed Embeda as replacement, less than 15 min after 1st dose went into severe withdrawal symptoms lasting several hours. Could not stop writhing and spasms were so bad I ruptured disc in neck requiring surgery. Was terrified heart would give out or worse injury would occur before symptoms subsided. If someone had seen me at the time I have no doubt I would have been committed to psych ward.  Absolute worst Rx experience of my life. Something in my body released the Naltrexone in the Embeda and NO, I did not crush the capsule. I called nurse and was advised to continue taking. Could only tolerate by placing capsule inside lump of bread and swallowing whole. Was in constant withdrawal and had severe headaches for rest of month before being able to see Doctor again. Was placed back on Avinza. My advice: Do not take Embeda if you value your life. Also, it did nothing for my pain and that month on Embeda is forever burned into my memory.

Chronic Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	25-34	5/5/2010 2:10:40 PM	I have been on this for about 3 weeks. My 1st experience with long acting pain killer. I have been on Oxycodone 10 mg 3xs/day for about 10 yrs. The oxy worked fabulous to control my pain, but was too short acting. I couldnt deal w/the roller coaster ups and downs from a short acting med. So, went to see a pain management dr. (previously only seeing Rheumytolgist).I have really tried to give this med a chance, but its is very disappointing. The first 5 days it helped my pain but I think that is because I was too tired from it &amp; foggy to know any better. It also made me nauseous for close to 2 weeks. I am now well into the end of the 2nd week and I hate it even more. Pain relief is very minimal, although it does make my condition at least tolerable. For some reason it makes my teeth hurt. (and no I have never had any problems with my teeth in the past, so considering the timing I know it is the med). It makes me very tired so that it is nearly impossible to get up in the am. Then I have very little motivation throughout the day.It is imo, a weak painkiller with awful side effects. Can't wait for my appointment in 1.5 weeks. I have to make a switch.I am 34 and suffer from chronic pain caused by a hx of Lupus and Fibromyalgia. Also, some minor disc herniations in my upper back.In summary, this med does not touch the really deep pain, but does take the edge off. Side effects unbearable. I have always handled meds well. Not this!

Within 8 hours I was  in withdrawal  form my Kadian.  I have a headache that goes up and  over my head into my right eye.  I have almost lost my voice from  a severely dry throat.  I call my PM  the morning after I took my  first pills and toldher what happened.  I was told if my breathing gets worse, go to the ER.  I took the  pills the second night and was worse today.  I got in touch with the PM today and wastaken off the Embeda.  I feellike I  was a Guinea Pig.  This is a med that was only approved by the FDA September, 2009.  Shame on our doctors forputting us through these changes when I wasn't having any problems with the Kadian.  We allknow that we have no choice  when we are in a Pain Program.  We have to do what they say when they say it and for how  long  they say to doit.  It  is just not right.  I was given a perscription for my Kadian today and will be taking my pill within four hours.  If they offer you EMBEDA .. DO NOT TAKE IT.

Perhaps this medication is more for neuropatic pain than anything since my pain is due to a destruction of the coating on my spine and is a form of neuropathy

Chronic Pain	frustrated, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	3/14/2010 12:28:50 AM	I also have a large variety of health issues with Chronic Pain, and cannot have surgery due to problems after open heart surgery. Too complicated to list...THIS DRUG IS HORRIBLE....I have been taking Hydrocodone for several years and it is the ONLY medicine that enables me to get up out of the bed and function.  Pain is still there - but it is manageable.  I also feel like I am in some study and that the doctor gets kickbacks.  When I go back to see him in early April I am letting him know that I cannot keep taking this medicine.  The headaches are outrageous...So bad I keep checking my blood pressure to make sure I am not about to have a heart attack or my head explode. Enough is enough - if he wants to keep me on this medicine - there will be a new doctor(pain management) for me in the future.  It is 4 times as expensive also even with the dicount coupon I have to pay $25.00 for 60 tablets. And I have good insurance.  I pay $10.00 for 120 hydrocodone.I am over 60 disabled and only have a disability check coming in for me.  If the drug worked perhaps I might consider what I could cut out in my budget, but it does not and I cannot stand the fact that I feel like I am being used.  I have Diabetes, Irregular heartbeat even after open heart surgery with 4 bypasses and a stint, Sleep Apena, use oxygen, but the pain I have with a torn rotator cuff, bad knee and  hip and also from the results of a torn achilles heel tendon surgery PAIN Relief medication is necessary. As it is I feel like my life does not have a good quality to it, if I am in absolute chronic pain also and not able to at least dull it, I might as well go drive down to the ocean and walk in and say goodbye.  The hydrocodone helps me manage the pain.  Do not go off hydrocodone for this medicine, you will not be satisfifed at all....he started me at the lowest dose...last time in I told him it was not working and he uped it to the highest dose. It still does not work for the pain. 
Severe Pain	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	3/12/2010 3:47:57 PM	This was prescribed to me for back pain caused by a bulging disc.  It did absolutely nothing for my pain.  I had no major side effects from the medication, but I did lose my appetite and had constipation.  The drug was incredibly expensive ($200/mo).  Maybe it works for others, but did absolutely nothing for my pain.  I had to take a ton of ibuprofen on top of this medication to get any kind of relief.

At 11 am I felt sick  to my stomach.  By 4 pm I felt like I was stoned.  I ate supper at 6 pm and then proceeded to throw up.       Yes it did relieve my pain however I would recommend that YOU DON'T TAKE THIS.  I had read the reviews and wasn't thrilled with what I read.  I had to experience this first hand in order to find out what everyone else was saying.       At 6 am the next day, I was still feeling sick to my stomach.   Will be calling the doctor to get a new prescription.       I agree with everyone else it just isn't worth it!

My GP prescribed this drug until I could find a &quot;good&quot; doctor who will put me on Seboxone. I am on 30-1.2mg 2xday and hydromorphone 4mg 3x day prn. I am in so much pain 24/7 and am having a hard time finding a good pain mngmnt doctor who can help me be more comfortable. It seems there is so much &quot;more money to be made in interventional medicine instead of just writing prescriptions.&quot; (A an honorable doctor told me this. I have seen proof that this is the case. Latest MRI shows that at the C5-6 there is  indenting and abutting the right ventral cervical cord. Also there is a far lateral 8mm cystic lesion in the left neural foramen.At the C6-7 level there is a disc bulging on the ventral thecal sac and a small tear of the annulus. What I have read about these findings all prove why I have this excrutiating constant pain.
Chronic Pain	Not 4 Me, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	12/31/2009 3:37:45 AM	DESPITE the fact I am now well adapted to my current meds, always pass scfreenongs, have had much progress after years of suffering.... I was given a free card for the medication and basically felt like I was being asked to be a monkey or test subject...I absolutely refused,..I am not a monkey for THE companies pharma SALESFORCE, WHO I OVERHEARD IN THE DOC OFFICE months ago griping about layoffs from a merger that would put Avinza/Kadian together...and how King was releasing this drug. Acurox is next... I am all for pain management and appreciate the efforts of pharma for safe and effective meds, but how in the world can this med that may cause sudden withdrawal and complications really be the correct solution? Please create a long lasting, effective, extended release morphine formulation without the (albeit profitable) trickery you think you need to please the FDA. Grow a set....we suffer every day.

I have been on Duragesic patches for over 5 yrs starting with 25mg ending with 100 + 50mg.  My PM Dr switched me when the patches changed and were no longer working for me at that time I was on 100mg + 50mg every three days.  And  was not lasting for the full 72 hrs.  Embeda was a great transition he started me at 60mg every 12 hours &amp; it is working very good.  My mind is clear and I do have some pain but it is working very well.

After finally finding a pharmacy that had it and adjusting the dose 2 times, I could not be happier. Relief without worry.
Chronic Pain	Ladybug, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	11/29/2009 1:45:13 PM	I have been on pain medication for about 10 years. The last 3 a pain specialist stabalized my overall pain with an extended (time-released) drug and a 1-4 a day breakthrough medication. This helped me believe in the extended release type of meds. Unfortunately the pain clinic closed and I was referred to another pain specialist who decided to try this medication on me. I feel as if I am a test subject for him concerning this drug since it is fairly new. I am soooo disappointed, depressed and in PAIN. I live in a small town, 60 miles from the small town that the docter comes to once or twice a month from a city that is about that distance from his main office. I began this medication right before a long holiday weekend so I was not able to call him to let him know it doesn't work or if I had to wait to see if it would work eventually. After seeing these reviews, I know this is not the drug for me. Also I have experienced many of the side effects, can't sleep, cramping in the stomach, headaches, itching, etc. So if your doctor recommends this for you, be assertive and ask questions. Make sure you have an alternative so you can maintain a pain level you can live with. Good Luck

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	19-24	11/19/2009 12:09:43 PM	i have been on percocets for almost 4 years now so my doctor switched me to this embeda to take only 2 times a day. it has no effect whatsoever as far as a pain killer goes. i thought that if maybe i took the capsul off and mixed it in with apple sauce like the pamphlet i got with it said i could do that i would be just fine and it would kick in. that was a mistake, i went into withdrawls within an hour of ddoing that and had severe pain in my sides and stomach till i could get to the hospital and they gave me a morphine shot. i recomend NOT to do what i did if you are taking this medicine.
