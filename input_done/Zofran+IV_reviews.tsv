Nausea and Vomiting	donjack10, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	10/14/2009 2:44:36 PM	I was given Zofran IV in the ER of my local hospital (which I consider state-of-the-art and I am also an RN (that said for informatory purposes only)).  This drug had absolutely no effect on my nausea and vomiting. The RN who gave it to me assured me that it was used alot and that symptoms usually subsided within ten minutes.  I found this not to be the case at all.

Prevent Nausea and Vomiting from Cancer Chemotherapy	jackdaddysjill!@aol.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	6/18/2009 3:10:03 PM	Although I did not have much nausea, I had resultant lack of peristalsis, causing an ileus for up to four days after chemo  administration, with horrible distention relieved only with enemas and laxatives, a clear liquid diet and application of heat to the abdomen. Very misreable experience, indeed!!!   I choose to not have the pre-medication of Zofran with my subsequent  chemo tx, feeling I would rather experience the vomiting and diarrhea than the above listed symptoms!!  I had a Rx for compazine at home.

Come to find out I had a Pottasium defficiency which was making me to feel as though I was burning up and very shaky and nausea. I am so glad I was given this in the ER immediatly stopped my vomiting literally within 1-2 minutes.
