Muscle Spasm	Danesgrammy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	7/30/2012 7:57:47 PM	I have been taking Norflex for almost 30 years for muscles spasms in my neck/back due to degeneration of my cervical spine.  Norflex helps keep it under control so that I have been able to avoid surgery for many years.
Muscle Spasm	Sally, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	4/18/2012 10:53:27 PM	Took it for severe back spasms.  I was able to tolerate it and function accordingly, but the muscle twitching has been disrupting.  All over muscle twitching, that I never had; prior to the start of the medication.  Took the medicine for 5-6 days.  No longer taking it.  I hope the twitching resolves soon!

Muscle Spasm	65-74 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	3/17/2011 10:07:05 PM	I have a genetic disorder in my lower back often causing pain there and in my left leg and ankle when I over exert myself.  I take this at night and sleep restfully and wake up without any stiffness.  I usually only need to take this once a day for just two or three days and then I go about my business.

Muscle Spasm	Painerella, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/28/2010 5:05:49 PM	Being a person who suffers from multiple, chronic mild to severe pain problems, many meds. have been prescribed to me.  In conjunction w/pain meds., Flexeril has been prescribed and works VERY WELL, however, while years ago it used to not make me tired, it now does. Norflex works wonderfully and does not make me tired!!  As with each individual (and all medications), results will vary.  Unfortunately, we have to be guinea pigs to find out what works, what doesn't and what's going to send us into side effect land.  Norflex works great for me!  Good luck to anyone and everyone who has to take medication and i hope you feel better.
Muscle Spasm	Wiblet, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	35-44	5/19/2010 7:24:11 PM	I was taking for severe muscle stiffness and pain in back and neck.  By the 3rd day I started feeling very confused.  By the 5th day, I had severe tremors and muscle twitching all over my body.  I could not stay still..my heart was racing and even trying to relax my legs and arms would literally jump.  After trip to ER I was told this was a side effect and even after only taking it for less than a week, it could take up to 3-4 weeks for the side effects to go away.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  But there are other posts on here where it has worked for other people.  Every one obviously reacts differently.  But it was a very scary side effect and I usually can handle taking meds with out any major side effects.

It seems gentler than other relaxants i've used.. no problems with it.  I also have muscle tightness/burning, where i have disk problems in my neck and it appears to help with that also. No side effects except i have had burning pain in my stomach for a few weeks, which may or may not be related.

Muscle Spasm	Tikiman100, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/24/2009 1:45:13 AM	After Back Surgery (1 1/2 Years ago) I started developing a really bad muscle spasm (Charlie Horse) in my lower back. I've been through the Facet Injections, Trigger Point injections and continued to be in pain.While I DID fall asleep at nights, I never felt like I actually got into that deep sleep, so I was always exhausted when I woke up.The first evening I took this drug (NORFLEX) I actually felt like I was able to sleep, and I wasn't tired.Then the next morning (12 Hrs since last dose) I took my second pill. I was able to efficiently complete all my tasks that day with NO signs of being tired or dizzy.I hate taking ANY medication, and especially medications that make you tired. I was really happy to find this muscle relaxer.Good Luck!&quot;Finally out of pain, in Florida&quot;

It is working well for me. I was taking flexaril and felt like a zombie all the time I was awake. I slept more than I was awake with the flexaril. With the norflex I am awake and can function normally. I have no side effects with this drug.  I have also noticed a difference in my joint pain. I have no cartalidge in my knees. I was having a lot of pain in them. With the norflex  I find I am a lot more mobile than before. I wish I had been given this drug a long time ago.

I take 1 100mg dose at bedtime &amp; have had zero side effects &amp; NO MORE cramps!  I also have fibromyalgia and have had no flareups.

Almost immediately I noticed that my vision without my reading glasses is worse and I have some balance issues when I get up from my desk for the first few hours after taking it. I will give it another week, but if it doesn't work, I'll have to go back to Flexaril or something else.

My doctor switched me to this medication and I found that it was a great substitute for Robaxin. Now my doctor and I have two drugs that I can use to fight my chronic bad back.  He is switching me to Norflex and in three months will switch me back to Robaxin.

Norflex is not quite helping either but I just started taking and 1 positive side effect is I take 2 100mg before bed and it makes me sleep better.
