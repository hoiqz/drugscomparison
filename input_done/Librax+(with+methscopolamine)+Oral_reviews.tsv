Irritable Colon	ibs pain , 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	2/9/2012 3:58:21 PM	I have had a hard time finding Librax, had to use several generics, each time they changed companies, the generic becomes less and less effective.  This is the only drug that has helped me, why is it so hard to find?

Most days are good, the key is understanding my symptoms and knowing when to take two a day. Most days I'm good with one.  Biggest benefit is cutting down on spasms.

The only problem is the expence and it does make me drowsy,but it is worth it.I wonder why medicare does not cover this medication?
Irritable Colon	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	9/5/2010 10:18:01 PM	I have been suffering with IBS since I was 7 and I am now 25 it has not been an easy road. I have been on different medicines thru-out the years and sometimes they help and sometimes they dont. Librax has helped me more times then it hasn't. Overall it is pretty good. I take this and Bentyl.

Irritable Colon	75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		2/13/2010 12:19:55 PM	This was wonderful for me.  Then my company stopped handling it because it is no longer Medicare D approved.  It is known as a Desi drug...(non-effect).  It may be for some, but I have been suffering since I can't get it.

I am told by the Doctor that this is not a long term medication I can take, so now I will have to go back on Bentyl.  I feel that the Librax controls my IBS better than the Bentyl.  I want to know if Librax can only be used for short term periods, or is it just when you have a flare up with the IBS again?

Only the chlorazipoxide-clidinium (also Librax) works for me and worked for years and does not have all those side effects of this drug.  Will not take this drug again - only the chlorazipoxide-clidinium.

Side effect:dry mouth. Long term use: memory problems. However, if you are in pain, I would still rec. it. Tried Levbid &amp; had double vision!
Irritable Colon	payshunt, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	8/8/2009 1:45:19 PM	This drug was used in a clinical trial that I was involved in about 20 years ago. The drug didn't do anything to change my IBS-constipation predominance, but it made me not care because I had relatively no pain. I chose not to remain on the drug, as it only worked as a pain reliever for me.

Irritable Colon	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/8/2009 1:41:52 PM	I was diagnosed with IBS in 1994. I started taking Librax a couple months after that. I do not take it daily because I don't want my body to get immune to it. I have taken it just as needed since 1994, and it has always worked very well for me. I wouldn't want to take anything else.
