Nausea and Vomiting	Brenda.Truzzi, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	9/16/2010 4:30:57 PM	I am taking several meds for a long time without any noticeable side effects until about a month ago. I started taking this drug for severe nausea and vomiting. It wasn't until I read about some of the side effects. Please let me know by voting if you suffer any of these side effects. Blurry Vision, Sore Red Tongue, A feeling I can't explain well but it's like not feeling. If anyone has taken Klonopin and either forgot a few doses, or just stopped taking it. If you don't know what that is it's given for anxiety, seizures, etc...This is the newest drug I have started taking.Thank you for your help.

Nausea and Vomiting	TatorTot, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/14/2009 10:25:53 AM	I've been taking this for about a month now for nausea/vomiting. I have yet to get a diagnosis but my doctor told me to take this in the meantime. I've had no side effects at all.&#160; This was truly a lifesaver. My nausea/vomiting is completely gone when I take 1 dose (10mg) of this once a day. I can now function like a normal person instead of living in fear of possibly vomiting in public or at work which I was doing before taking this medication. I guess I do have 1 side effect &amp; that is constipation but if you take Senna, you should be fine. I also do not know the difference between Edisylate &amp; Maleate for this medication so I'm documenting this comment under both. My prescription bottle just has the abbreviation of Prochlorper &amp; that's it. Otherwise, I would totally recommend this to people having the same issues as I was.

Nausea and Vomiting caused by Cancer Drugs	Gil, 65-74 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1		65-74	9/3/2009 10:00:15 PM	Did make me sicker that the chemotherapy. Also found out that can be deadly.&quot;Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10 week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death)&quot; 
Nausea and Vomiting	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	5/16/2009 11:03:11 AM	My sister takes this drug and I'm horrified at the involuntary tongue movements.  Her tongue constantly darts in and out of her mouth, making her look like she's crazy.  I've talked her into asking her Dr for a different drug.  Her own Dr is the one that took note of the problem and yet did nothing till she asked for a different rx.  She's also experienced high anxiety, dizziness and restlessness.  I wouldn't take this drug, no matter what!

I take 600 mg of neurontin (an extra dose) with it and it works ok, otherwise I'm a mess with arms and legs flailing around.
