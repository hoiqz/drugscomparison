This is the only pain medication that lasts long enough for me to be able to work a FT job, and not to have to re-dose and re-dose multiple times a day.

It is the only thing that gives me relief from the pain. After 3 back surgeries and over 100 procedures I have some sort of life. With everything there are good days and not so good days but no bad days anymore
