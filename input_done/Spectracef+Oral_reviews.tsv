Other	kim, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	45-54	7/16/2010 3:46:21 PM	I was prescribed Spectracef for 30 days for a persistent sinus infection that other antibiotics couldn't cure. I took it for 12 days then started to have the most horrific diarrhea I've ever had. Turns out I had clostridium difficile. Unless you know for a fact that you don't have c. diff, this should be a drug of last resort - as it was for me. It improved my sinuses but I wouldn't say they are cured.

Bacterial Infection with Chronic Bronchitis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	8/13/2009 10:40:51 PM	I have asthma and chronic brinchitis.  Allergic to many antibiotics and often have trouble finding antibiotic that will work.  This drug was new, Im not allergic to it, and within 2 doses I felt so much better it was like &quot;waking up.&quot; Highly recommend if you tend to have chronic infections.
