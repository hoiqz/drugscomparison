I was diagnosed with ET at the age of 35. So far I have been feeling good with that beside fast heart beat. If you have ET, please feel free to join my support facebook group that I have created. http://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/249857971708809/

My doctor switched me to Agrylin which I have been using for about 8 years. I do have rapid heartbeats and some hair loss but nothing I can't live with. I take .5mg 4 times a day. My platelet count has come down from 1.5mg to 400,000mg.

Elevated Platelets with Rapid Growth of Bone Marrow	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	55-64	1/23/2011 6:56:40 PM	I have been taking this for about 15 years. It controls my platelets. 8 years ago I had a bloody nose that would not stop and I was in the hospital for 5 dyas. Since then I stopped taking aspirin since I feel it causes bleeding in combo with agrlyn. I now have lyme disease that has become chronic and my immune system numbers are very low even when I do not feel too bad. I read somewhere that lyme disease does not mix well with the spleen. I wonder if anyone else has had this experience. Before I took this medicine I took hydroxea which made very very tired. Agrlyn makes me tired and my fingers tingle when cold. I do not take it with caffeine and I take it after meals and well before bedtime to decrease the plapitations.     
Other	rhenac, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	45-54	12/27/2010 9:16:11 AM	I am a 46 year old female who was recently diagnosed with ET, I started taking the Agryln about 3 weeks ago, I am very sick at my stomach frequently and have back pain constantly.  But, it appears to be lowering my counts, so I hope the sickness goes away soon.  I will continue this review as it progresses.  Does anyone else around my age have this disease?  I would really like some input.  
Other	energo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	10/31/2010 9:03:34 AM	In 1998 I have been diagnosed with polycythemia vera, a blood disorder that results in production of excess red blood cells. Agrylin along with regular phlebotomy helped keep my hematocrit level under control since then. It took me several months to adjust to the drug, one side effect was palpitation. Not knowing the severity of my condition, I was fighting the treatment, skipping doses, etc. But after few months I adjusted. Also I started coumadin treatment to thin the blood and been on it since 2000. Initially I was taking two 0.5 mg. pills per day, morning/night, but around the time when I switched to generic the doctor had to increase my dosage to two 1.0 mg. pills per day. I have no side effects and feeling good. Cardiologist recommended metoprolol for palpitation, which I take rarely, but it is fare to say that these are caused by the stress in my life rather than side effects of the agrylin. I exercise a little in most days (yoga, walking), and I have good energy. The drug has been working well for me. It would be interesting to see results after 20+ years. At the time when I was diagnosed, patients with polycythemia were given 15 years to live after the diagnostic, due to high risk in blood clots, but these medicine are keeping it under control, so I have high hopes that this will not be a cause of death for me. Good luck everyone out there!   
Elevated Platelets with Rapid Growth of Bone Marrow	happyone, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	6/14/2010 10:49:35 AM	I have been taking Agrylin for 12 years.  Side effects of palpitations and shortness of breath are tolerable. I take propanolol as needed for the rapid heart beat.  I am surprised to read about 1 patient on this site who said she is taking 6 x .5mg twice a day.  Read the Dosage Instructions.  I believe the maximum dosage at one time is 2.5mg.  I find that a dosage of 1mg at a time dramatically reduces the side effects.

I have rapid heart rate after each dose, lasting about 30min. I take 3 -.5mg/day. I am tired a lot, but feel better than I did at 1.4million. I exercise several times a week and this has had an effect on my platelets also. So, taking my rx, asprin a day &amp; exercise have helped me stay between 600 to 650,000.
Elevated Platelets with Rapid Growth of Bone Marrow		4	4	4			3/25/2010 3:52:00 PM	I have been taking this drug for 10-12 years. Lately I have been experiencing rapid heart beats 140, with no physical activity or side effects other than weakness.

Since than, I had a sensitive pain on my left side on my spleen, which I was fearing that I may had to go for surgery, luckily I started to watch my diet intake and it healed. Now 2010, My knee, hip and wrist and fingers hurts, like if I had arthritis. I take 6 capsules of 0.5 in the morning and 6 at night with meals each time. Now my oncologist is telling me he feels that I should take less of Agrylin because I will develop with some kind of bone disease. I am wondering if anyone lived at least 25 years with this kind of disease and if I can die by it even if I do take care of myself. I believe watching what you eat, taking protien/creatine/other suppements will help me and alot of exercise will beat this disease. So far, this is what I do. 
Other	hrivney, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	1/14/2010 4:07:50 PM	Been taking since January of 2005, first two days were awful headaches, then zero other noticable side effects ever since.  Have Essential Thrombocythemia, platelets went from 700/dc to 300/dc. See oncologist, not hematologist, take 0.5 mg twice a day. I test every 3 months and visit 2 x per year. No hypertension, headaches, abnormal organ function - don't know of other options or would discuss with Doc to make sure we select best options.

My platelet count was 1,600,000 when first diagnosed and today it's about 700,000. I was fortunate enough to be in a case study at Yale (given agrylin before it was approved by the FDA and have been on it since then). The biggest side effect that I have experienced is a rapid heart rate and palpitations. I also feel fatigued alot of the time.  I have learned to live with the side effects because some of the other treatments available for ET have been known to cause cancer with prolonged use.

But...the doctor had to up the dosage to 6 - 1mg. per day.  Most days I feel yuck, some days have some diarreah.  Could this be from the agrylin?

I have heart palpitations and get pains in the area where my spleen is.taking it 4 times a day is a real drain for me.I'd like to start taking 2 tabs 2 times a day. but not sure if that applies to anyone on the drug?? my platelets are very well regulated. and feel overall healthy.

When I went on them my platelets wereover 900,000, but in two weeks they were down to 618,000.  I had no side effects.

It does a good job of keeping my platlet count down, but I have the side effect of rapid heart beat.  I have been to a cardiologist who has said my heart is fine and not damaged.  I also feel extremely tired even though my lab results do not show abnormal results.  Lately my gall bladder/liver area has been giving me pain, which I am about to have checked out.  I don't know if these are connected to this medication or not.
Elevated Platelets with Rapid Growth of Bone Marrow	cammitoo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	2/6/2009 3:45:15 PM	Have used Agrylin for ET for nearly 10 years.  Do have the usual dosage adjustments now and then, but it has been effective in controlling platelet levels.  HOWEVER, within past couple of years, issues have arisen with elevated white cells, chronic severe anemia and poor lab results re: calcium, etc.  Is it related to long term use of Agrylin?  Is it just a progression of the genetic mutations?  Who knows?  Sadly, no one seems to be interested in researching this rare phenomenon.

However, everything I have read and the experience of my husband taking this drug, I am surprised it's still on the market.  My husband had a massive stroke. When life flighted to UC Davis the Hem. doctor told me he should have never been placed on this drug.  It was probably the cause of his bleed.  When I looked it up on the internet, it showed that during an Agrylin study of 89 people, 57% of the people dropped out due to serious complications.  This was on WebMd dated July 5, 2005. In fact, it stated that their findings were so astonishing that they halted their study to publish the results. I continued my search and found that several doctors have found that Agrylin is not a suitable choice for ET.  I continue to research it and continue to find more and more.  I have contacted the FDA and have received no response other than they would check into it.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	55-64	2/19/2008 2:50:30 PM	This medication was prescribed for the treatment of thrombocytosis.  It replaced the drug hydroxyurea when that drug began to decline in effectiveness.  After taking Agrylin for about two years, I was diagnosed with hypertension.  Hemotologist treating me did not attribute the high blood pressure to the drug but after getting a second opinion was told that it does in fact cause hypertension.  When I switched back to hydrea, my high blood pressure went back to normal.  In addition to the hypertension, I had irregular heart beats, severe headaches, and swelling of my ankles.  Feel much better since I was taken off and returned to hydrea which began to work again after being off for two years.
