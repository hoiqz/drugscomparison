Epileptic Seizure	pdwags, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5		55-64	7/20/2012 4:33:43 PM	I've been taking Dilantin for 50 years. As long as I don't forget to take meds (and stay away from the generic version!), its been 100% effective. No side effect other than diminished bone density, which I've been able to compensate for via calcium &amp; magnesium supplements.

Hooked to IV bag and some kind of monitor device on my neck. DILANTIN and VIMPAT. Yes, seizures stopped and so did I. Sleepy, living in my jammies, cannot remember yesterday. No sleep. Stomach hurts; knees hurt; back hurts; dizzy;can't remember the names of the few peeps I do see. Been at home almost alone for almost a year. Dilantin ruining my gums and 5 teeth have to be pulled--so I need to buy a bridge. Old crowns are fine, but the tooth under is rotting. 5 teeth are greyish/blackish. More dental surgery. Yikes. DILANTIN SUCKS.

I have trouble with what I think and what I say, they do not correspond.  Also, I cannot think of the proper words when talking or trying to write a sentence.  Trouble with thought process in relation to spelling, math, etc.  I had two seizures after knee surgery and had never had seizures before.  I am told that there are other anti-seizure meds that do not have the side effects I am experiencing; however, the Neurologist is not comfortable in changing my meds at this time.

Well tolerated once the dose was dialed in.  Has completely controlled seizures, but have been having internal tremors lately that neurologist feels is a reaction to the drug.  Long term side effects are scary and we are talking moving to Keppra.  But the reviews of that drug are horrendous.

However I do have problems with memory, confusion (so frustrating!!)and tremors.  Also I find that I randomly &quot;tip&quot; when walking and drop/knock things over, such as a glass of  milk, etc.  Kind of like parts of me are coming apart.  Originally I had a ton of bone pain in the long bones, but my doctor switched me from phenytoin to brand name Dilantin and it made a world of difference.  We've also added Calcium and vitamin D supplements. I would love to have my concentration back....

I have the sleeping issues, and gum bleeding/swelling that goes along with it. It also seems to be weakening the enamel on my teeth. I take daily Vitamin D supplements to help and also use Pronamel Toothpaste which seems to be helping in the enamel loss. Other than these light side effects i have been having no problems, and more importantly no seizures.For the gentleman stating the dizziness etc side effects, you need to see your doctor. If you are having these side effects one of two things may be the case. Either Dilatin is not right for you, or your dosage is too high. Are they doing regular blood levels for you? I was on Keppra for a time and i had those side effects, but never have had them with Dilatin.

Convulsive Seizures	Black Diamonds, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/7/2011 12:46:06 AM	Dilantin (Phenytoin); this I speak of is the original drug before it was modified or revamped. Had been on this for nearly 30 decades, while Doctors disregarded the blood levels (which often was beyond toxicity range but due to being mitochondrial, they went by my chemistry and hematology in the lab work itself).Eventually, after so many years of being on this medication - one of its side effects is its toll on the dental issues. I had to cease from this medication for that reason; this medication had always been my &quot;baby&quot; even though other medications had been tried, but they always returned back to Dilantin / Phenytoin (the original).I cannot speak of the new &quot;Dilantin&quot; which I hear so much of, for that reason I do apologize.

I have been on the pump now since 2005 and would like some help in being weened from this medicine, I know going off all at one would not be plausible, but having my doctor state his opinion and not consider my having to live with these continuous crappy side effects is very frustrating and angers me quite a bit.

I have been dealing with extreme anger fits.  Also a head ache that comes out of nowhere and is worse then any migraine I have ever had.  I lose my balance randomly that can result in falling.  I have slurred speech that comes and goes along with a slight stagger when I walk that has been described to me like I had been drinking.  It has seemed to diminish the amount of seizures but not completely  stopped them.  Can anyone tell me it gets better on these meds.

Few months after starting had to add another med (gabapentin).  Everything wasn't 100% but I still felt better than I had in the past 2-3 months before I started taking it, so I stuck with it.Now, 3 weeks ago, my serum shot up from 13 (on 350mg dilantin) to 25 (same dose). With no change in meds or diet!Now I take 325 and level won't get past 8, my ammonia is high and I feel like crap.Love this med, but for some reason it's not as effective as it used to be.  I heard this drug was really stong maybe I built up a resistance! :-(

I occasionally feel I have petit mal but Dilantin does the job and keeps everything under control as it is designed to do.  I may have an overall weakness, sweating and general shakiness but only lasts for 2 - 3 minutes.  I have been taking for 15 years and while warned of numerous side effects but none have occurred to date.  I take 460 mg divided into 230 mg morning and evening.  My concern is my levels are rising, 34 in last test and normally maintain a 25 - 28 level but I hesitate to change dosage since all seems in order.'

I am now 53 and have gone through menapause. I've questioned the effectiveness of any hormone therapy since having been on dilantin. Tiny print on medicine pamphlet says, dilantine interfers with the absorption of estrogen. I personally believe that it blocks the effects of hormone therapy. So finding relief from nights sweats/sleeplessness has been difficult.

I was on Dilantin for over 35 years with only partial/seizures, blank spells, but only 2 grand mal back 3 decades ago.  I told my neurologist I was having numbness or change in feeling in my feet and legs, ie peripherial neuropathy.  This was accredited to taking Dilantin for so many years and nerve covering damage.  He replaced it with Lyrica with Mysoline and the neuropathy has not progressed.  Two neuro doctors felt this was due to the Dilantin long time use, and once the &quot;offending drug&quot; was removed, I would be better.  I have now been on Lyrica 300mg/day with the above dosage on Mysoline and have continued to be grand mal seizure free.  Do keep your doctor informed if any nerve feeling changes in any part of your body...

I took the drug Lamictal for a couple years but asked my neurologist to put me back on Dilantin because it controlled my seizures well and was low enough in cost that I could manage to buy it without insurance which I did not have at the time.  I am concerned about the effect that it has had on my teeth and gums.  Some of which was my fault but was accelerated by dilantin use.  I am also concerned with the higher risk level for osteoporosis at a young age.

It's effect on my gums has been painful and horrendous looking, regardless of care attempted. I have had confusion on certain occaisions, and sometimes memory loss is terrible; I've been a residential painter for ten years, and recently could not remember one day if paint is supposed to be applied to outdoor wood thickly or thinly.  Also, until two weeks ago I played guitar 2-3 hours every day, and now I'm finding myself looking up 60-70% of the songs I want to play and still forgetting the chords in the middle of playing.While this drug seems to do a pretty good job of controlling my seizures (at least when I remember to take it often enough to keep my levels up), it's side effects are terrible; it is a dirty drug.  It's great for someone who wears dentures and doesn't ever have to worry about work or normal life outside of the home, but if you want to carry on a normal life without appearing to be a doofus, I wouldn't reccommend it.

I have been on Tegretol, but I was far too drowsy to go about my daily life.  I have been on Dilantin for 15 yrs and have been fine. If I miss 1-2 doses I will have a seizure.  I missed about 4 days this week because I had a bad stomach virus.  Yesterday I had a Grand Mal seizsure!!! I have never had this type of seizure.  I honestly thought I was going to meet God yesterday. I found out that Dilantin as rectal suppositories. I am also on the non generic Dilantin which has also made a huge difference. I will NEVER miss a dose again. My gums are just fine. I just keep up with good oral hygiene
Simple Partial Seizures	Derek, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	2/15/2010 6:54:18 PM	I have been taking 300mg daily of this medication for the past 30 yrs, and it has proven 100% effective in managing my seizures. However, because it causes your gums to receded, you have to be extral diligent in your dental care. Because it also causes a reduction in Vitamin D by the liver, which leads to osteoporosis, I tried to change to lamictal a couple of weeks ago, and it made me REALLY sick. So much so that I switched back to dilantin on my own. Just saw the Dr today and now he wants to try Keppra. I hate the thought of changing medications as it has taken me 30yrs to compensate for the side effects of dilantin. But it really has proven to be &quot;old faithful&quot; for me.
Other	Kyla, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	65-74	2/3/2010 3:45:40 PM	I had a seizure in Nov, 2009, was in the hospital for 9 days, and put on Dilantin, which is a horrible med, IMO. I can't sleep, it reacts with other meds I'm raking.I have osteoarthritis and when I passed out,I hit my head on my nightststand.I rehurt my knees. I get vivid dreams, panic attacks, sweating, memory loss, mood swings, chills, hot slashes, everything but swelling of lips and tongue. I hate this drug, but the options are worse. My Dr wanted to try me on something else, but I'm too scared to try it.Bless your hearts and take care.

I still have seizures on this medication both grand and petite mal, and i take 500mg/day of dilantin. I just found out that taking the dilantin has given me gingival hypertrophy (an overgrowth in the gums) and several mood problems and memory loss. I would encourage anyone prescribed to this medication to see if there is anything else available for you. THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE HORRIBLE and I really think that the doctors DON'T take them into account most of the time.......

Convulsive Seizures	Wylene, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5		55-64	1/14/2010 12:15:36 AM	I have taken this medication for about 45 years now. I have had to increase the dosage 2 times during this amount of time. I have the gran-mal type seizures and it is not good time after time to awake on my head in a bathtub,laying in the floor or hospital wandering where I am or where my family is. Don't be afraid to try this medication even with the side affects. I do have to think things through a little slower and take better care of my mouth and gums. They are nothing compared to having a seizure and having my family or anyone see me having seizures.

I had 3 grand mal seizures before I took this medicine and I haven't had any since. I still have my partial seizures though when it's that time of the month. My doctor wants me to start taking Topomax but I am so scared.  I read about a lot of side effects. I really don't like taking 2 drugs.

I have not had a seizure in over 4 years now and love it. I do have the swollen gums that i take care of and some memory lag but its better than having a seizure and falling down a flight of stairs or braking my nose(happened 3 times in the past) and the best part i am able to take care of my 2 children with out having this disorder affect them or have them seem have a seizure!!!!

I have black spots on my brain from having a tumor in my heart,some pieces broke off and went to my brain which caused me to have 3 strokes. The spots cause me to have little seizures. Dilantin has helped a lot! I still have the seizures but they are very minimal compared to before dilantin. I do have some side effects that I didn't realize are probably from the dilantin. I am tired ALL the time I have had some weight gain and my joints are sore and I definitly have short-term memory loss. A little long term but I would think that is from the strokes. Thanks for your comments it made me realize I probably have some questions for my Doctor.

But you need to know that there is a possibilty for long term users...that you will develop perphial nueropathy.(sp)( yes , the same thing that is usally linked to diabetes) Believe me...it is no fun ..the nueropthy!It is a good treatment...just stay on top of it...and change meds if possible..should you develop nueropathy.  Of course, never do this without the aid of your dr.

I am very dependant upon it in some psychological way. recently I have been diagnosed as not having epilepsy but am unsure of stopping the drug'my doctor says to try another drug to get off of dilantin and then weaning me from that. However' I fear not having the dilantin as it has saved me from the &quot;horrors&quot;. My seizures always started from severe stomach pain which i now attribute to gluten sensitivity. also I've had a lot of trouble with my teeth and gums. I've been hospitalized a number of times with what I thought were heart attacks but was told that it was seizures. Eventually , I received stints after being told that I had 100% blockage in an artery, the blockage had been there so long that my body had rerouted a thin artery around the blockage.

I also take other medicine with this one now.But,being new to seizure medication,I would suggest giving this one a try at least.

Got put on 1-300mg Dilantin a day. My next seizure was at the age of-18. Then the age of-22. Then at the age of 25, course I was then up to 1-500mg of Dilantin a day. At 28 yrs. old, get yanked off of Dilantin. I was told anytime I felt weird, to grab a &quot;candy-bar @ a coke.&quot; I was told my seizures were caused by, &quot;stress, low blood sugar levels. And mostly by &quot;water in the back of my head- caused by a blow to the head when I was really young.&quot; And I was fine for awhile, actually felt great too. Hopefully at least one of ya'll is still awake. I sure enjoyed writing this &quot;brief description.&quot;

What I see is, he is very sleepy all the time, has loss of memory and problems with walking. 
Epileptic Seizure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	5/2/2009 7:58:10 AM	I have been taking Dilantin for about a year now.  I have had a few side effects from this medication.  Since being on this medication my dreams are crazy and very vivid.  I have the same dreams a lot.  I have also experienced memory loss, which is very frustuting.  Before starting this medication I could remember anything.  Now I can't even remember if I've taken my medication, so I started checking it off on the calander.  Overall, Dilantin has been very helpful.  I missed a few doses a few months ago and I went into three seizures, one right after the other, my dilantin level had dropped.  My advice would be to take this medication as prescribed and if you have memory loss and can't remember it, write down when you're supposed to take it and check it off.

I stopped taking Dilantin once for about 6 months and then had another seizure in February 2009. It has even treated my so-called &quot;anxiety attacks&quot; (I still call them that as they don't feel like seizures at all! It's more like dazing off staring in a deja vouz moment.) I urge anyone who thinks they have these and believe they are only anxiety, if you have gone to a therapist of any sort, go to a NEUROLOGIST! I had been going to a therapist about it for months and he could never figure it out. I decided to just deal with it and then a year or so later, mentioned something about anxiety to my neurologist, and when I explained them, and as soon as I said deja vouz he said &quot;no that sounds like a seizure.&quot; As much as I didn't want to hear that, I was happy that I had finally found something to really help me!!

I had 3 more seizures in a one week period until my doc discovered there was not enough in my system so I was placed on 3 a day.  I have not had any since then but the medication keeps me wide awake 24/7 so i was also placed on xanax. The dilantin has caused me severe vomiting on very hit and miss occasions.  I have only been on it since Jan 31, 2009 and just went for my EEG yesterday (3-23-09). We are still exploring what is causing these episodes as I was a very normal, healthy 26 yr. old. Would like to hear from others with similar side effects so I knoe\w there is hope out there. Thank you everyone!

About 3 years ago my Neurologist put me on Phenytek. this is more of a timed release version of Dilantin. it seems my metabolism had changes and was absorbing the Dilantin too quickly. I've had great success with Phenytek.  I take 300 mg. 2X a day

However, as of late (approx. the last 3 weeks) i have again begun having small seizures.  This has lead my doctor to believe that there are other contributing health issues.  Therefore, today I begin a small series of testing to find out.

I don't feel as though I can think as clearly, feel somewhat lethargic and my bones ache.  Not the joints, just the long bones of the arms and legs.  I developed a problem with Vitamin D absorption and have to take 2400IU/day for the level to reach the &quot;normal&quot; range.  Bone density tests came out fine, so my doctor's satisfied with keeping me on Dilantin.  I like being seizure-free, but I'd also like it if my bones didn't hurt and if I could feel like my mind wasn't leaving me.

I've read alot of reviews about the negative side effects but everyone needs to relize that they all seem to have the same side effects. They just effect different people differently.

Since then, I have only taken the name brand.While it has been very effective for my seizures, it also makes me clumsy,  interferes with any kind of concentration, and makes me spend a lot of time wondering what I was looking for, and what I meant to do next.

I am very happy with it and I have not had problems with teeth. Last seizure about 10 years ago. They were lowering my dose. That won't happen again. I am more lethargic and am prone to naps. If that is my trade off I am blessed.

No other ill effects. Overall...it is a great drug...as long as you follow directions.  I have had over 15 yrs with no seizures as a result of taking my meds daily! Can't over emphasize the importance of NOT missing any dose!!!!

It comes in many forms(pills to shots, so just about everyone can use it. It's only disadvantage is that it can cause you to gain wieght and fast.
Epileptic Seizure	Dudleyroo, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	5/28/2008 12:32:51 PM	I have had seizures for 35 years and been on every medication available. You name it, I've tried it... (Liquid, Capsule, Etc.)I have basically been on Dilantin for 27 years. Dilantin is the ONLY medication that really keeps my &quot;petite mal&quot; seizures under control which are usually the most difficuly to control. (from what I have been told by neurologists around the USA.)It does cause unusual gum tissue growth so I have to have my gum tissue trimmed back every 10 years or so but it is well worth it to not have seizures.I tried the generic and it too controled the seizures and I do not think it caused the gum growth...or if it did, it grew slower in comparison when on Dilantin.Bad news about generic was it really began discolaring the &quot;whites&quot; of my eyes, turning them more and more yellow which is why I decided to switch back to the Dilantin. While the yellowing of the eyes and gum growth is supposed to be a possible side affect for BOTH medications, I decided my eyes are more important to me than my gums. In the 20+ years I took the real brand name &quot;Dilantin&quot; I NEVER noticed my eyes turning yellow. While it is not cheap and certainly not pleasant, I can handle getting my gums trimmed every 10 years or so, but I only have the two eyes.Anyways, while rather expensive, Dilantin is a good drug and does a job that no other drug can do. Control my seizure condition which was caused by a &quot;tubor&quot; (a benign, non-malignant, non-life threatening, tumor)in my &quot;corpus colosum&quot; of my brain.

They should be made to tell you and not leave it up to you to find out your self. also dilantion decreases the absortion of folic acid and b-12.

There was another thing that my new doctor told me that all of my doctors have not tol me ever since I was put on this drug at the age of eight years old. The part of your brain that is small and is conected to your spinal cord after long term use of this drug can make it smaller. I was intrested in woundering why would she ask such a question. She said that it can cause your equalibrium (balance) to be off because of the classifier drug that it is. That is something to think about that a lot of people don't know. Although the benifits for me outweigh the risks but it is good to know all of the risks associated with the drug.

I cannot believe these side effects are not made known, short term emergency use is fine, not at all a long term medication, I learned that one the hard way!  I would like some kind of response to this one please

Epileptic Seizure	19-24 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	3/6/2008 12:09:25 AM	I have been taking Dilantin for about 7 years now and have to say I am satisfied for the most part. It took a while for the doctors to get my levels straight and in the process I experienced a few grand and petit mal seizures. I am currently taking 600mg daily and have experienced some of the side effects. It has caused some problems with both my long term and short term memory. Also, I have trouble concentrating and sometimes lose track of my thoughts. A small price to pay for being seizure free for over 3 years. I experienced some trouble after trying to cut down on the dosage, so the doctors say that I may have to be on it from now on. Not looking forward to some of the long term side effects that I have heard of.

I had a head injury when I was a kid and the seizures started after i gave birth to my first child. My doctor tried me on other meds then but dilantin worked the best. I haven't had a seizure in 19 years.

These seizures normally occur during sleep. I am now on Dilantin (6 years now). It causes slight memory loss, and lathargy (FUZZINESS in thinking). But, for the most part, if my levels are kept up (600mg/day) I don't have seizures.

BUT....long term use of this drug can result in periphial neuropathy.( Hope that is correct spelling.)  A change in meds is due. But I am NOT looking forward to that. The one time I did try to change...well let's put it this way...it was not good!If you have been taking this med for years...this is long term side effect is something to talk over with your doctor!!  Make sure he gives you all the details!

I have changed to others several times due to the severe headaches it causes. My Dr. either did not read my labs correct or something, but he had increased my dosage from 300 mg to 600 mg daily. I could not walk or see for several weeks and assumed I had a stroke, after falling and going to the hospital, it was discovered that my level was 49. Normal levels are 10-20. My vision still isn't fully correct. If your Dr. attempts to increase your dosage based on your levels, ask for a second level before increasing it. Make sure your Dr treats you and your symptoms and not your Dilantin level. Some people do fine with a lower level. This is a very good medication for seizures, but also a very dangerous one.

Epileptic Seizure	45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5		45-54	11/21/2007 2:54:42 AM	I started having seizures when I was 13 yrs old, I am now 52 yrs old. I have taken dilantin since the beginning and it has worked great for me. I went from having siezures refularly to, at first, only having one every 3-6 months. Then, it was a year between and now they are controlled. I have had VERY few bad effects from it. Once in a while my gums swell but that is usually when the blood levels are high. I had heard a LOT of negative things that &quot;COULD&quot; happen due to dilantin. When I asked ANY doctor if they could say that any other seizure medication would not have the same effects, they all had to say no...as Dilantin has been used and studied the most of all seizure medication. I have had 2 kids, neither had seizures. For people with epilrpsy, I would highly recommend at least trying dilantin to help controlling them.

I tried several medications and went to 32 neurologists before I found someone who could diagnose the problem.  In 1995 I went to Houston, 8 very good doctors located the problem through extensive testing and operated to take the injured part of the brain off (you only use 62% of your brain) and it has been 13 years since the surgery.  I have taken Dilanton 100 mg every day and it has been very effective.  I still take the medication, not because I have seizures anymore but because I don't want to rock the boat and start having them again.

Epileptic Seizure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	3	1	Female	45-54	10/31/2007 3:31:02 PM	My Father took Dilantin for a little over a month in 2004. We were warned that he could develop a &quot;rash.&quot; He was going through Chemo and radiation at the time, so I thought his burning was side effects from the cancer treatments. In less than a month his face started to look like someone had taken a torch to it. His neck was oozing and the skin just sloughing off. He ended up in the hospital for 11 weeks with about 8 doctors trying ot figure it out. After the first 2 weeks in ICU, I talked the doctor into taking him off all seizure medicines. I didn't think he needed them to start with. Finally a doctor asked me if anyone had suggested &quot;Stephens Johnson Syndrome&quot; I had never heard of it but went online and checked it out. I firmly believe he had it and with God's grace survived DILANTIN!!!
