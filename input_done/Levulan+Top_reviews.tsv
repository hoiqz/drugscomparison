My Doc &amp; his team are great, I was well prepared. Medication left on for 1 hr. followed by 16 min.s of Blu lite. 2nd day moderate swelling, pretty bad red - BAD sunburn look. today the peeling has started. I will do three treatments in three consecutive months. I'll let you know the end results, but as of now I'm pleased &amp; will continue.

I had my first Levulan PDT treatment 1 week ago. My face was cleansed with acetone then the Levulan was applied, after 1 hour I was exposed to the BLU-U blue lite.  The first 2 minutes were tolerable but then it felt like my face was on fire.  I was given a spray bottle with cold water and a fan which helped althought I wasn't sure I would make it through the full 16.5 minutes.  After the I washed my face and applied the sunblock that was supplied.  Unfortunately I didn't realize that it was a brand that I have had allergic reactions to which have required steriod treatment.  I notified my Doctor who immediatly had me wash my face again and use another sunblock.  I drove 2 hrs with a hat, sunglasses and a scarf completely over my face and didn't leave the house for 3 days.  1st day was red &amp; swollen, 2nd day worse, 3rd day no improvement swelling worse, 4th day slight flaking but still red and swollen, 5th day called the Dr and emailed a photo.  She was very concerned had never seen anyone respond this way.  Starting antibodics for 24 hrs, no improvement.  Started steriods and within 12 hrs swelling was reduced, within 24 no swelling and 48 hrs only slightly pink but able to return to work.  Although my reaction was upsetting (which I feel was due to the sunblock) the results are wonderful!  My face is smooth and more even toned.  I will consider future treatment if necessary although I will bring my own sun block.

I had mohs surgery for squamous and they applied the Levulan after they bandaged me.  They left the drug on all of my face, except the bandaged area,for 5 1/2 hours and had me return to use the light. In just 3 minutes I was yelling for help.  They turned off the light and said that my reaction to the chemical so quickly was unlike anything they had seen. Even though the light was only on me for 3 minutes, I was swollen, bright red and now I am peeling viciously. I can't imagine what would have happened in 16 minutes. Hopefully, my skin will recover and show improvement.  It has been very frightening.
Skin Lesions that are Not Thick due to Sun Exposure	Dora, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/5/2012 10:15:34 PM	I had a Levulan Kerastic application followed by Blu U for treatment of a pre cancerous lesion on my face.  The Levulan was applied to my face after it was cleansed with acetone and I was asked to wait one hour before undergoing the Blu U treatment.  The Levulan is a clear product, so I was able to leave the dermatologist office for the one hour period.  I was placed under the Blu U light for 16 minutes which resulted in mild discomfort.  The following day, my face was bright red and felt tight, like a horrible sunburn.  This appearance was consistent for 4 days following the treatment.  On the 5th-7th days, my face began to peel.  I did some mild exfoliating, although the dermatologist recommends that your skin peel naturally, without assistance.  My skin still had a pink color.  By day 10 post treatment, most of the pinkness had disappeared and my skin looked amazing.  Even skin tone.  Sun spots gone.  I've invested a fortune in skin cream, facials, microdermabrasion, ipl treatments, and mild peels - this treatment resulted in by far the BEST results I have experienced.  Two weeks post treatment, my skin was completely healed and looks AMAZING.  The process is long and scary (think the WORST sunburn that you have ever experienced) but the results are worth it.  Be patient and enjoy the results!
Skin Lesions that are Not Thick due to Sun Exposure	Bill P., 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	55-64	3/3/2012 10:56:06 PM	Just had my second treatment.  Last April was my first after having a few lesions--one cancerous--removed. The second was when I found more damaged skin becoming noticeable in the same area.  The first time I had the Levulan on for an hour, washed it off then had the light.  Two weeks ago, for the the second treatment, it was two hours before the light treatment.  Both times I washed the chemical off before the light treatment and both times they covered my face with Lidocaine gel before the light treatment to ease my discomfort during the light treatment.  Both times I used aloe after the treatment for relief of the burning.  The second time I stopped the aloe after day 3 and just used a water based moisturizer.  It seemed to work better.  The first time was the more painful of the two, and took about 3 weeks for my face to clear up.  This time, @ two weeks post procedure,I have just a bit of dryness and some scaling dead skin.  I'll do it again in a heartbeat...well, in about 6-8 months, probably.  It beats having the damaged cells mature into something that will harm me more.  Overall, for me it's more inconvenient than painful. It might be significant that I was treated by a doctor who specializes in skin cancers, not a dermatologist, though my care will now be transferred to a dermatologist.   
Other	John, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	11/17/2011 11:51:52 PM	I had my treatment with Levulan Kerastick about 11 months ago. I had some pre cancerous legions. This therapy was effective in eliminating them. The procedure resulted in me having to endure one week of appearing to have a severe sunburn. I gently washed my face twice a day and applied a store bought vaseline cream lotion. I was careful to avoid sunlight and bright light. I had no blisters and pain was minimal and lasted no more than 48 hours. I did look &quot;burnt&quot; for about one week to ten days after being treated. But there was an unexpected pleasant surprise with this treatment. A few months after the treatment, a number of people commented on how good my skin looked. A lot of sun related damage on my face disappeared when the new skin matured. I did the treatment to get rid of cancerous growths so the cosmetic benefits were unexpected. I would recommend that you make sure that your doctor is experienced in this procedure. I also recommend that you carefully follow all post precedure recommendations, especially the ones about avoiding sunlight and brioght light. I did not experience the problems others noted in this forum. If needed, I would readily undergo this procedure again.  
Skin Lesions that are Not Thick due to Sun Exposure	Marianne, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	11/16/2011 9:01:42 PM	I had my first treatment in May 2011.  Day 1 I had redness, felt like a sunburn in certain areas of my face, used frozen peas and cool cloths along with a moisturizer that I purchased at the doctor's offie.  I was told no light other than a 60 watt bulb.  We put two towels over my face for the 45 minute drive home following the treatment.  I had minimal swelling and on Day 2 there was none at all.  The heat/sunburn feeling was minimal on day 2 also and we discontinued using the frozen peas (still in a bag) and the cool cloths.  Day 3 I remained indoors with the blinds drawn and minimal lighting.On Day 4, in the evening after the sun had gone down, I was still very red, but we ventured out for ice cream (drive thru).Each day the redness faded a bit and on Day 10 I was able to fly home with no redness at all.  Skin looked and felt great. I had the Blu-U treatment for squamous cell skin cancer and Actinic keratosis -- precancerous areas on my face.  I will have a second treatment later this year.  I think the key to a good outcome with little pain or swelling is to stay &quot;in the dark&quot; for the first 72 hours following the treatment.  That was stressed by the nurse and the doctor prior to me having it.My skin looks great -- just a small patch of scaly skin left in one area.  They also prescribed a skin care reginmen that I am following religously.  I live in Florida and I golf so I am out in the sun, but I wear a hat, use a high SPF sunscreen and makeup that has sunscreen in it also. 
Skin Lesions that are Not Thick due to Sun Exposure	Thulerose, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	6/23/2011 2:38:22 PM	I had a Levulan treatment two days ago. My dermatologist initially suggested it for the especially sun-exposed area around my nose. (The damage she detected was invisible to me.) I liked the doctor very much, but she told me very little about the treatment- just that medication would be applied and then I would sit under blue light for a time and might have some slight redness.                                                                                When I arrived for my appointment two weeks later, the nurse handed me a list of side effects and had me sign a release. Some were alarming. By this time I had driven two hours for my appointment so went ahead with it. She did my entire face- not only across the bridge of my nose. She didn't ask about recent sun exposure. The treatment was so uncomfortable I didn't think I'd make it through the 16.5 minutes. It burned as if habanero pepper juice had been applied to my skin.                                           I've been in pain ever since- bright red all over within minutes, and by morning my face had swelled like a pumpkin. It's now completely covered with brown, red and purple blotches. Discomfort alternates between extreme tightness, burning and intense itching. I called the doctor's office and after the fact was told any place I had sun damage would react this way. I was also told that my two hour drive home intensified the reaction. I was wearing sunscreen and a hat.                                                                                     I'm feeling incapacitated and bummed about the treatment. I slept most of the day yesterday. I wish I had a better picture up front about what I could have expected based on my own skin history. I'm using vaseline, bag balm, aloe, moisturizers (and discovering which ones burn), prednisone, ibuprofen, antihistamines and lots of ice. I haven't left my house since the treatment. I so regret opting to do this. I hope something positive comes of it.

Light applied approx. 1 hr after Levulan head &amp; face. 3 hrs after applied to arms. Fairly strong discomfort, but intolerable. From what I've read, the Levulan is washed off AFTER the light....in my case it was washed off before?????? Still too early to tell whether the treatment has been effective. Has anyone else had this same experience? lmsm427@aol.com
Skin Lesions that are Not Thick due to Sun Exposure	SUCCESS, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	55-64	11/12/2010 3:46:18 PM	I had the levulan with blu light on Wed. Tech applied, waited 2 hrs. then underwent blu light. 1st day, burning and tingling alleviated by cold washclothes (kept in refrig) and cold water then appliciation of vaseline while face wet.  (also kept in refrig.) 2nd day. more of the same but less. 3rd day red splotches just areas of minimal stinging. Important to note my treatment was for acticnic keroteses, unknown if treatment differs for acne. Entire face treated not just specific areas. Tip: also keep vaseline on lips from start as tech advised lips are sensitive to this. Overall I have minimal redness and I contribute all to strictly adhering to guidelines. NO BRIGHT LIGHT INCLUDES FLOURESCENTS AND DEFINITELY NO SUNLIGHT AS THAT CONTINUES TO ACTIVATE!! I can't wait for the end results and will post again. One reason I decided to post is I can not find any info on what to do after the stringent 48 hours?????? Any tips?

The crusty little spots that I've had taken off several times before seem to be gone! It was uncomfortable, red and peeling for 2 days but I will happily do the next treatment.  If this is all it takes to keep the basil cell at bay it's worth it.
Other	Annet, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	10/30/2010 11:33:44 AM	I'm glad I didn't read these reviews before I had my first treatment 2 days ago.  Most important, choose a doctor and his staff carefully so you are comfortable and trust them. I had a basis cell removed from my forehead and more spots that would come and go, they think these treatments will take care of all of them before they become serious. The topical solution was applied and I sat in the waiting room for 1 hour then under the lights for 16 minutes.  There was a bit of tingling, but no serious pain.  I'm on day 2 and look like I've been on the beach with my baby oil and iodine, talk about full circle.It's uncomfortable, and I don't want to go out yet but there is no pain and just a tiny bit of swelling.  Will post more in a couple of days.  So far, so good.

It has been very painful.  I am extreamly red.  I started to peel yesterday (day4) the skin is bleeding when some of the scabs come off   before I started to peel on day 4 I woke up with bloody scabs all over my chin.  I am not sleeping but a few hours at a time because of the pain, I am taking aleve &amp; Ibprofin.  Every 3 to 4 hours I smear my face with a thick layer of vaseline, It helps with pain and the tightening of the skin.

They have been on my back, face, entire chest, &amp; leg. I had Levulan with PDT in fall, 07, on chest &amp; face. Very painful &amp; ugly for 3-4 weeks. Took 3 months for insurance to pay, kept saying it was cosmetic. No, it's red hair, blue eyes, &amp; yrs baking in the sun out of ignorance. Finally, they paid. Was very happy with results til about 6 months ago when the AK's came back, just as many as ever, maybe more, too many to count on entire upper chest. One week ago had treatment for 2nd time. It hurts terribly still. Very swollen &amp; red from shoulder to shoulder, neck to breasts. Hope pain eases soon, see derm in 3 weeks. Ins didn't even question the coverage this time, paying all of it. Avoid the sun always, wear sunscreen, &amp; don't even sit in the shade during summer. These cancers are horrible. Only wish I had known as a child &amp; teenager.

It was painful like bee stings all on my face.  The next day was bhorrible.  Eyes swollen shut and miserable. 3-4 days later, starting to peel and very painful. I am on my 6th day and it is getting a little better.  I was told toput sunscreen with zinc.  The sunscreen made my eyes sting and water continuously.  I finally figured out it was the sunscreen that was to irritating to my eyes.  I have been using petroleum jelly on my face and it feels somewhat better.  It has been absolutely miserable for me.  Make sure when you have this done you have all your errands done, because trust me, you will not want to go anywhere looking like this.  It is just pure hell.  I hope the results will be worth it.I will probably be stuck in my house for 3-4 weeks.

According to the dermatologist, this will pass and I should not have future problems with actenic keritosis

My skin looks clear and smooth. I would do it again when and if necessary. My biggest objection is that my insurance company would not cover the treatment.

The first treatment I experienced redness and minimal swelling and the feeling of a significant sunburn for about three days. The second treatment has left me more red and with significant swelling - my eyes are nearly swollen shut every morning. I am waiting for the swelling to go away and the peeling to begin. The peeling and flaking lasted a few days with the first treatment and then my new skin emerged and looked much better - better than before. During the redness and swelling, it can be very discouraging and feel like the skin is never going to be the same but it just takes time.  I will report back when I am finished with the treatment.
