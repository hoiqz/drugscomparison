Pain	Mel B, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/22/2011 5:54:55 PM	I have extremely painful endometriosis and have tried many different pain management options over the last 8 years. This is the third time I've been prescribed vicodin and each time it has been effective to manage my breakthrough pain. I also take an extended release ultram and cymbalta  daily to help with pain. If addiction is something you're concerned about, I would recommend doing some of your own research and talking to your doctor. There is such a thing as being dependent on a medication and it is not the same thing as being an addict. There is a really great article on this website about long term pain management and addiction that could help a lot of the misinformed out there. I have had a few side effects from the vicoden including itching and constipation. I take psyllium husks powder daily and it has just about eliminated the constipation. Overall, vicoden has been an excellent treatment for my pain, though it doesn't always take away my pain for the full 4-6 hours between doses.

Pain	browne57, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	4	3	Male	45-54	1/28/2011 1:38:16 AM	My Rheumatology Dr has prescribed Vicodin 5/500 as a first time pain management drug and have been taking it for two months now. constipation and sweating bouts that come at odd times daily are the only side effects so far. I get good relief from joint pain over the daily routine of activity taking 3 times daily as prescirbed.It allows me to walk and do general life activities which were eluding me before. The FDA is making drug manufacturers reduce the tylenol amounts in these drugs soon i.e Vicodin,percocet,etc and a good idea for those that need pain relief but don't tolerate tylenol or it's effectiveness in these combinations.I recommend trying the Fentanyl patch 25mcg evey 72 hrs if other pain meds become ineffective as it gives good long acting relief without all the tylenol.

I'm on 7.5/750 every 6 hours. I've noticed that I don't pee as much as I used to when I'm taking it. I have a nice overall feeling when taking it. It makes me feel quite calm and at times a little sleepy. No itching or hives or headaches. I do think I'm constipated though. I haven't gone in a few days. Overall I'm happy with this drug. I wish it would take the tooth pain away completely but it's okay, the edge is off of the pain.

After a physical therapist did more harm than good and pain blocks that stopped working; I started taking Vicodin for the pain.  That was 4 years ago.  I also have three neck disc's. in the 3rd. stage of degeneration. Vicodin (500mg - 2 or 3 times a day) does not take my pain completely away but it does enable me to function on a daily basis.Yes, it is addicting.  I'm not sure if it's the drug itself or just the idea of being in pain if I stop.  I beleive this drug also gives you somewhat of a false sense of security because it does take away pain.  So don't over-do-it and end up needing a higher dose.  Take care of yourself.

Pain	USAFSGT, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	7/8/2010 11:38:43 AM	I was prescribed this drug approx. 5 years ago. I use it for breakthrough pain. I take morphine SR 30mg q12h for my chronic, severe, pain as a result of breaking my neck and damaging my spinal cord. The Vicodin is used q6-8 hrs as needed for pain above and beyond my chronic suffering. I was a medic in the USAF prior to my injury so I know a bit about the pharmacology of this drug. If you use it post surgically or for an acute (short term) injury you need to exercise caution. If you suffer from chronic pain the addiction potential is minimal. Addiction occurs by the drug reaching the &quot;pleasure centers&quot; of the brain. In chronic pain it never, or extremely rarely reaches those centers. It is diverted to the source of the pain instead. You should not be afraid to take it as prescribed and needed. You must ry to stay ahead of pain. Once the pain has arisen it is somewhat futile to chase it trying to get relief.

I recommend watching for mental changes with Vicodin, Norco etc.

I can function fairly well without wanting to sleep all the time. I have been on 10/500 for over 4 years now, and personally I think the addiction in dependent on the person.  I can go without it. In fact I was without them cause I didn't have insurance at the time and I didn't have withdrawl symptoms at all, just a lot of pain.

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	8/27/2009 8:44:06 PM	I was prescribed this medication to treat my pain after having my wisdom teeth extracted. I was a bit nervous to touch something that had the reputation of being so addictive (and that I had seen my own family members become addicted to). I am only supposed to be taking 1 pill every 6 hours, which I'm sticking to faithfully, but unfortunately, after about three hours I'm in terrible pain again (even 3 days after the procedure), not to mention I get very dizzy and lightheaded for about a half hour after taking it. I've been taking 800mg of ibuprofen to supplement at the oral surgeon's advice.

I have been on it for about a year now &amp; am noticing that sometimes my feet,ankles, &amp; calves swell up a little but not always. What is this &amp; can vicodin cause this? Is it dangerous? Keep in mind that I am about 55pds. overweight which may also have something to do with it since I just recently gained this weight within the past 6 months. Can someone please tell me what this is, what is causing it, &amp; could it just be that I am overweight or a combination of both? Thank you.

After brief experience with requip,leva dopa, and mrypex failed, hydrocodone has worked well with the fact its habit forming, which doesn't matter when condition does not subside and loss of sleep becomes an issue. Worth trying everything else first to eliminate whats most effective. Moderation is needed with this med, or should not touch.

I am now on it again and I'm on a stronger dose (7.5/750) for a nerve that is bad in one of my teeth. It has worked wonderful so far. I only need to take 2 or 3 pills a day versus the maximum daily dose of 6.

One pill did not help, so about six hours later I took two pills, before going to sleep.  I awoke, after about one and a half hours, in a deep sweat.  My hair was completely soaked and dripping moisture.  My body was wet with sweat.  I did not take Vicodin, again, and have not had a repeat occurance of the sweating.

Pain	annie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	11/18/2008 10:28:03 PM	Took first after dental work, and worked well. Tried it for migraines,and it works fairly well alone...diminishes migraine pain within 2 hours if I sit up the whole time, but if I add 2 acetominophen/aspirin/caffeine tabs (OTC) I get effective relief of migraine within 30-45 min. With very severe migraine, sometimes take alprazolam (prescribed for me) also, for anxiety about pain.  So far, no side effects. Best treatment for my migraines I've found...after battling them for over 40 years, with dozens of meds.  They are less frequent with my taking verapamil prophylactically for several years, but when I have one, it's a doozie! 72 hours long,until I stumbled on this combo.

One condition at a time. Later, within the same week, becomes less effective when taken as prescribed. If the pain is moderate to severe it's fine for the first week to month.

I have had 2 MRI's I have bulging disc's at L/4-L/5-S/1 with sciatica flare up's. The buldging rains from 3 milameters to 7 milameters. Also suffer from muscle spasms &amp; sharp pain down my left leg to my foot. I have been on the same dosage for 8 year's. To me it seem's it just is not working as well as it did at 1st. I feel I need my meds. up graded to a stronger strength I truely believe my tolerance has raised to the effect of the med &amp; I need a stronger dose.?? My Dr. is trying to put off lower back surgery as long as possible. I have had 5 epideral steriod injection's in the past. I just really feel I need a stronger dosage to help to relieve the chronic pain. I am in pain daily on a scale of 1 to 10. I live with about a pain scale of 5 daily &amp; when I have a flare up it jump's right to a 10. I really feel I need the vicoden es or something stronger.? I can't seem to understand why my Dr. or other Dr.'s just don't seem to want to give a stronger dosage or med to relieve the pain &amp; I have 2 MRI.'s to prove the back problems. It just seem's it is harder for a mid aged male to get the pain meds.? Also 1 year ago I lost my best friend &amp; hero my Dad a 37 year City Captain of our Fire Dept. I was a live in caregiver &amp; Dad was a big man, I have done alot of heavy lifting to help out Dad which I know cannot be good on my lower back.? I would gladly accept any solutions anyone has to offer.!!

It has been most effective in easing the pain and stiffness associated with atrophy from late term multiple sclerosis (relapsing-remitting). I take 2 of the 7.5mg  tablets a day and have found it works faster on an empty stomach, lifting the tight squeezing pain from the joints in my legs and hands within 20-30 minutes. I have tried Percocet and Ultram as well but neither were  as fast or as effective as Hydrocodone. I do not drink alcoholic beverages, but use caution if you do (or stop entirely) if your doctor prescribes this as it can be dangerous.

Not that dependency is neccesarily a bad thing but the patient will soon turn to purchasing the drug on the street and the abuse of the drug will increase.  Why is it ok to be addicted to coffee or cigarettes but not ok to be addicted to an opiode based drug??  
Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	35-44	3/22/2008 4:00:16 PM	After having a ventral hernia surgery I was prescribed Lortab for the pain 1 pill every 3 hours or as needed I found that this made me constipated to the point that I thought I was going to die.  Having experienced using vicodin for pain relief before hand for a abscess tooth I asked to be put on the Vicodin ES Brand Name Not (generic Im allergic to the fillers, it caused a itchy rash) which worked surprisingly better.  took the pain away and left me able to function normally. I only noticed two side effects while on this medication mood swings and hyperactivity which kept me from sleeping a full eight hours every single night.  I took this product for one month and had no addiction or withdrawls to the medication. I was able to sleep a full 8 hours every night.  a month after that the hernia mysteriously came back, Surprise Surprise Surprise, I had to go through three months of tests to be told the hernia recurred and vicodin ES got me through pain.  Two weeks ago I had my second surgery to remove the Bard ventralex patch that failed after only two months and was probably implanted inncorrectly from the beginning. Post surgery: I was again prescribed lortab even though I protested this medication and explained to the nurse that that medication does not work for me.  She said it is the same product as the vicodin ES and despite my argumentative state and resistance to accepting the prescription, I was sent home to start my recovery.  for two days I took the lortab every three hours as prescribed. I had  very little pain relief and and within two days again I had constipation that I thought was going to kill me.  I called and had the doctor write a prescription for the vicodin and from the first hour after I took the medication I started getting some relief.  Although the sleeplesness has returned I am able to function and get thourgh my days almost painfree,  but not mood swing free.  Allways a negative for the positive but in this case I would rather be pain free.

Pain	captfire555, 65-74 Male  (Patient) 	3	5	4	Male	65-74	1/27/2008 6:10:53 AM	Severe arthritis pain which does not respond to any OTC painkillers.  Vicodin ES does not stop the pain--however it does make it possible to get to sleep !  No OTC remedys do anything for my pain.  I assume the cause is my body.

However, I have continued it due to chronic daily headaches and it works very well for me at work all day. I only take 1-2 per day and it really helps me.

One thing is the pain intensifies when the medication wears off. It has helped and no I am not addicted as it can be habit forming. it has casued a fatty liver and mood swings as well as stomach pain. it is best to use this medication very infequently and not long term. You can build up a resistance quickly.

Pain	 (Patient) 	3	5	2			12/13/2007 7:51:52 PM	I've taken this for anything from my migranes to my c-sections.  It has only helped take the edge off any pain I had...which I attribute to the failure of acetemophen (sp) and my body system...tylenol doesn't do squat for me as a pain killer to begin with.

Pain	lasvegasgeek, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	45-54	10/12/2007 7:39:03 AM	Very effective. However, it is very addictive. Do not take this for longer than 1 month or you WILL become addicted to this drug. Also tolerance builds rather quickly. 
Pain		3	5	3			10/10/2007 4:33:40 PM	For some people this medicine can cause a stomach ache, I felt that a little bit but if you're going to take this drug I reccommend that you basically stay home and relax so that you don't endanger yourself or others.
