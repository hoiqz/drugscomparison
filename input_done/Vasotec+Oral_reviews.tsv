High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/11/2009 8:01:25 PM	I have been taking Vasotec for over 12 years and it has been very effective and I feel great.  When the generic came out my doctor had me try it and I felt terrible and went back on Vasotec.  Now my insurance isn't going to cover the Vasotec and I'm not sure what I am going to do.  The insurance finally said they would cover it starting in Jan. 2010  for one year but I'm not sure what I am going to do in the meantime.  Can't afford the over $100 for the Vasotec for a month.

High Blood Pressure	shannon, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	11/24/2008 9:44:40 AM	I was on a generic for this drug: Enalapril.  Took it at bedtime.  Middle of night had swelling of lip and tongue first day.  But continued and had some minor stomach gas/bloating and sometimes feeling of rapid heart beat.  On the eleventh day I had swelling of tongue, lip and closing of throat due to allergic reaction to it.  2 Benedryl dissolving tabs took care of it. But now am off.  Too bad I had this reaction because my BP went from 160/95 to 118/80.  If you aren't allergic to it, I think it generally would be helpful.
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	10/30/2008 10:27:27 AM	I was put on this medication for high blood pressure.  The morning after taking the first dose of this medication I woke up with the left side of my lip and cheek swollen (which is a side effect of this medicine).  I was immediately taken off and put on another medication.  I was really disappointed in this development because with this medicine I did not feel drugged and tired like I was on the first medication.  Also my blood pressure was fantastic.

High Blood Pressure	mlbaker, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	65-74	10/10/2008 11:33:36 AM	My pressure fluctuates, and I can't seem to get it to stabilize.  The upper number is often 145-155, and the lower stays around 75-85.  While this is not terribly high, there are times when both numbers will &quot;skyrocket&quot; for awhile.  Fortunately, the medication seems to be helping with that situation.
Other	cindy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/9/2008 8:05:13 AM	I take it for a heart murmer-i have strange sensations in my right face-feels like it is drooping or numb but in reality it is not, i can feel cold,heat, and touch and no physical signs of change in my face, new very tolerable headache in my temples and my right hand gets really cold if i dont wear long sleeves, i also have a lot of stomach upset, but i had it in a milder form before starting the medication-i dont feel these are bad enough to make me stop the medication and all of my labs are perfect. I am hoping when i loose weight to be able to go off of it. my blood pressure for the past 2 years has been borderline high, now its where it was when i was a teen ager.

I believe that a side effect may be hives. However the brief experiences of that have been worth the benefits. I found hydrocortisine (sp?) cream helped relieve the welts.

Has anyone ever heard of this while taking Vasotec?
