I was put on 10mg of Dexedrine and I was immediately better. I first noticed the medication was working when I was talking to my employer and for the first time I was able to look him in the eye. The sense of clarity was overwhelming. I've experienced very little side effects aside from weight loss (which I'm not complaining about!). All in all this drug is phenomenal.

Why can't anyone advocate for adults with ADD. I hate living my last few years with this pain. Let Galaxo start manufacturing the product so that the effects and safety is monitored. Stop outsourcing or removing medications with a positive record.

I talk to people for a living and often find myself daydreaming in the middle of conversations and my procrastination factor has been totally cut in half.  I am tacking tasks that I usually &quot;save until tomorrow&quot; and that tomorrow never comes.  I think things are only going to get better when I start therapy.  It's too bad that adult ADHD has become so controversial.  I started to figure it out in my late 20's and before I had some sort of learning disability but was just higher functioning.  Why did it always take me double or triple the house to complete a paper in school when it took my best friend the &quot;normal&quot; amount of time?  Ha.  Feels good to not feel so crazy anymore and to have some confirmation.  Thank you to my provider for going out on a limb and giving it a chance when I was only asking for Wellbutrin! :-)

I was given the diagnosis during 1994 at age 45. The 1st 3 yrs I took Ritalin 20mg x 3 tabs per day. Methylphenidate changed my life for the positive, but, the necessary timing, to take the tabs daily, became a hassle, and, switching to Dexedrine Spansule 15mg in the AM hours, and, having the Dexedrine Sulfate 5 mg instant release, for after 5 PM dosing, was the perfect combination. Unfortunately, GlaxoSmithKline removed the Dexedrine 5 mg tabs off of the USA market in 2009, thus, I now take Adderall 12.5 mg when the early AM dose of pure Dexedrine Spansule wears off. The Dexedrine I/R 5 mg I liked better, for 3 to 4 hrs of focusing ability, than, the current, Adderall or generic Adderall instant release. My deepest regret is not getting the ADHD diagnosis until age 45, because I had crystal clear symptoms since at least age 7, thus, I lost 38 yrs of my life, including blotched interpersonal relationships, job firings, job mismatches, 7 yrs to complete a 4 year Bachelors Degree, etc. Thus I am damaged merchandise, due to resentments. Individual Psychotherapy, Group Psychotherapy, one dozen books written by M.D's &amp; Ph.D's have helped, along, with attendance to some national ADDA conventions. Drug trials with any other form of Ritalin/Methylphenidate, tri-cycle anti-depressants, Wellbutrin, SSRI's, SNRI's, have not measured up to brand name Dexedrine. I also prefer the brand name Dexedrine Sulfate, or Dexedrine Spansule, or Adderall instant release, due to the FDA's non regulation of the bioavailability (breakdown of the med in the body) with generic firms...as regulation of the bioequivalence, is not enought for me, just my 2 cents worth.  The price of the generics vs. the brand name &quot;borders highway robbery&quot;, in my humble opinion.

Although skeptical at first, I soon discovered I had almost every symptom...even relating to my early childhood years. Started with Ritalin which is the Devil, then tried Adderall which wasn't much better, then Dexedrine. Finally I feel &quot;complete&quot; no longer dis-jointed, unorganized and &quot;lost&quot;.  Too bad it took over 12 Drs. and 37 yrs to finally get my diagnosis right.

I have been on this medication for over two years. Before I started to take it I was in bed by 8, slept till 9 a.m.; had a 3-4 nap one to two times a day.  I was unable to function which increased the severity of my other condtions.The side effects have been severe in some areas - but the ability to stay awake, not having to nap my life away.  I am concerned about the long term affects on my mind and body, as both are taking a &quot;beating&quot;.  I take over 700 pills a month - about 25 a day.  Plus I take an acute pain med and ativan 2 mg when I begin to have the tics.I am very careful with this med as it has a lot of side effects; especially if I do not know if the effects are from the drug or the disorder.I hope that my information has helped. I cannot stress enough how important it is to journal and/or track how you are doing so you can ensure your Doctor knows everything.Take CareLive, Love &amp; Laugh

I have been off adderall for 2 years, was hesitant to get on another med, but found it neccessary, thought id try everything but adderall. It does help a little bit. Can read better get some mediocre level of productivity as apposed to NONE. Nothing dramatic. Less side effects, less mood swings/irritability/sleeping problems, so its nice not to have all those side effects but on the other hand I was hoping it would help with not only with my ADD but with my over eating and rediculous appetite. Adderall helped with that alot, so I think Ill try something else that can do both. Mine as well, if Im going to be taking a narcotic stimulant.. right?

My doctor and I are still trying to find the best medication and dosage to treat me, but so far I have found the Dex to be the most effective.  I have found that the Dex evens out my thinking and my energy level and controls my hyperactive impulses so that I am in control of my own behavior.  Currently, I am taking 3 doses of Dex (7.5 mg each) per day, about 4-5 hours apart.  One of the reasons I like the Dex is that I have experienced very few side effects with this medication.  Due to a sensitive digestive system, for me, nausea is often a side effect of medications, but I have avoided this with the Dex by always taking it with food.  I also found that (for me) taking the medication with a caffeinated beverage causes intense headaches.  The only remaining effects I have found to be bothersome is that the medication begins to wear off after about 3 hours.  At that time, two things happen: First, I get very drowsy and second, the medication stops controlling my hyperactivity.  Unfortunately, these two effects do not cancel themselves out, but rather leave me sprawled sleepily in a chair while my fingers drum and my mind races!  For me, lower dosages have no effect and higher dosages make me so drowsy that any positive effects are negated.  Other ADHD medications I have tried (and rejected) include Strattera and Ritalin.

I tried Ritalin to start and if was awful so did not think I was ADHD so went down other paths.  Finally came back to ADHD and put me on 10 mg Dexredrine capsule.  The first significant positive difference.  Now I went up to 20 mg a day (in morning), and now 30 mg ( 20 in morning and 10 at Noon).  I feel more focused when on to 30mg but I am covered for only 8 hours.  How do you know the optimal dosage for you? Also, how do you know which psycho-stimulant is the better for your personal condition?

To be completely honest, I never write reviews like this, however, I know I wouldn't be the successful ivy league graduate I am today without dexedrine. I take a low dose- 5 mg twice a day - which has made an enormous difference.  Dexedrine makes me feel refreshed, focused, and efficient. I have never felt any side effects, besides occasional loss of appetite. I also easily discontinue use on weekends, with no withdrawal symptoms (I do not have an addictive personality though).  I have taken my sister's concerta before, and felt as though it was not comparable to dexedrine.  My only issue with dexedrine is the difficulty in obtaining prescriptions.  Doctors require psychological evaluations every 3 years and pharmacies require a new doctor's prescription every time you need to refill (and often ID you). Regardless, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks a hundred times over.
