I tried to take it for a month before my doctor had to change me to a prenatal vitamin that she found to have less of an impact on those suffering from extreme first trimester nausea.

Pregnancy	Georgia, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	12/20/2010 11:21:49 PM	I got a free sample of this prenatal. The first night I was bloated and in severe pain. I assume it was what I ate for dinner. The second night I had the same severe abdominal pain. I've been taking prenatals for a year and this is my first experience like this. I will never take this prenatal again. The pain is intense for me.

Pregnancy	foster3, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/29/2010 11:57:58 AM	I have been trying to conceive for about 6 months. My OB recommended this prenatal. I love it. Some of the others I tried were so big that they would make me throw up because of the size. This one doesn't, however I take it at night so I don't throw up in the morning.

I have been on concept DHA for 2 months, and I LOVE it. I have taken multivitamins for years and I can honestly say I feel the best when taking these. I love there is only 1 pill a day! It is not expensive ($18.00 a month on my insurance plan). My only complaint is that i get a terrible fishy aftertaste after swallowing, and fishy tasting burps every once in a while. I usually get frequent colds/flu and other illnesses, but since taking this I have had one cold and it was very mild. I think this is just an overall optimal supplement!
