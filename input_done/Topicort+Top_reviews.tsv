Skin Rash that Becomes Thick &amp;amp; Discolored From Rubbing It	Trini, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/26/2012 12:32:38 PM	This medication I have been using for some time now.  Recently, I have become the caregiver of my elderly parent and my nerves flared up my condition real bad like never before.  Used the topicort, and in three days my skin has noticeably started to clear, showing my natural complexion.  Although the area of the medication is dry, I just use pure vaseline, a thin layer to keep it moist.  I love this cream, and have had no side effects.
