Vocal Cord Swelling	momtotwointhelou, 0-2 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	2	Female	0-2	6/7/2011 4:13:43 PM	My 19 month old son has been on Orapred for two days now for croup. It has stopped his cough almost immediately in its tracks, but not without side effects. He cries unconsolably for hours, obsessively rubs his eyes, nose, ears and head, and is generally distressed. He's normally a very happy little guy. I'm glad this is only a 3 day course of medicine.
Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis - Fungal Infection	naguilar00, 0-2 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	3	1	Female	0-2	5/30/2010 7:36:10 PM	My 18 month old daughter tooks 1/2tsp twice daily for five days.  She was extremely hyper and thirsty while on the med.  After completing the cycle, she is exhibiting some withdrawal symptoms: tiredness, restlessness, thirst, mood changes.  She is still too young to tell me, but she may be having other side effects too.  To be honest, I am not even sure why she was put on such a strong steriod.  We have been fighting a strong recurrent cough since she was 8 months with no difinitive diagnose except GERD, which meds aren't aleviating.

I would not use this drug again.  One night he was up until 5am unable to sleep.

I noticed when he takes the Orapred by itself he is not bouncing off the walls like he does with Albuterol. He does sweat a lot more with an increased appetitie and becoming more thirsty. Overall though I am very happy with the medication because it seems as if he becomes a lot more focused and not hyper.

I really don't know how anyone would expect a 7 month old to swallow 3/4 of a teaspoon. It might be effective if I could get him to keep it down. I'm calling to get a script for Veripred tomorrow! I only struggled w/this drug because unfortunately we started it on Friday night and had to go through the weekend.
Rash	3-6 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	2	Female	3-6	11/29/2009 11:08:59 PM	My 6 year old got into poison ivy, this medicine made her very hyper and hallucinate about bugs being all over her bed. Even though it got rid of the poison ivy, I would not recommend it for children.
Asthma	3-6 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	4	1	Female	3-6	10/18/2009 12:52:16 AM	My son was on orapred for 5 days not only were his moods extremely erratic but he would vomit in the evening only. could the vomiting be another side effect? I know nausea but vomiting too?
Asthma	Katzeyezzz , 7-12 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	4	1	Male	7-12	8/11/2009 10:33:14 PM	My son has ADHD and asthma. When he is taking orapred for his asthma, his ADHD is just about uncontrolable. He is on medication ( focalin) for ADHD and I wonder if these two drugs together create this type of reaction in other children.

Asthma	piemom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	2	4	Female	25-34	10/29/2008 2:22:35 PM	My son has been on Orapred for 2 days now to help him recover from severe asthma attack. It's much more difficult to give him the syrup than the meds with the nebulizer as the taste must be pretty awful. He's normally good with taking medicines.  As a side effect he's been extremely hyper, has reduced appetite and diarrhea, but this could be due to combination with Albuterol and Pulmicort. 
Blistering Skin Diseases	charter17, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Male	55-64	9/28/2007 9:39:02 PM	Seems like efficacy could be better, faster. The nurse actually gave me a script,left the nroom and suggested I return if the problem did not improve. Bad science and bad P.R!
