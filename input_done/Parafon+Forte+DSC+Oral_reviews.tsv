My husband was given this and had to go to ER with stroke-like symptoms and SEVERE HALLUCINATIONS that went on for 3 days!
Muscle Spasm	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	4/18/2011 2:29:42 PM	This drug helped me quickly. I have had back surgery in 08 but muscle spasms continue to the point I am in constant pain bed ridden most of time. Cannot sleep well as spasms never stop. This is the only real help I have had.

This has given me complete relief! I sleep better as well. Flexeril had stopped working for me after years of taking it...so I am thankful I discussed that with my doc, &amp; he put me on this!
Muscle Spasm	Pacco, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	4/17/2010 12:47:57 PM	I had very strong muscle spasms in my upper back. This medecinf, along with another anti-inflamatory prescription, helped it relax and go away. My mother was prescribed this drug for hip pains. I suspect the dr believed her pain was from muscles not joints. It helps her daily.

It knocked me out for a few hours but while easing the stiffness didn't really take the pain away even when taken with OTC ibuprofen.
