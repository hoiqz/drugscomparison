Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	3/10/2010 7:06:32 PM	It helped me get to sleep instead of having to take Ambien all the time. Great OTC pill.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Izewdeopen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	3/2/2010 5:16:42 PM	These work great for getting and keeping me to sleep. I am concerned about side-effects though, especially liver damage. These are not suppose to be taken long-term and I was not aware of that. I am going to use &quot;Moondrops&quot; because they are not harmful and they work. I do have to take three or four of them though because they are not as strong as lab drugs. I want to be able to fall asleep as naturally as possible and not have to worry about liver damage.

I could tell it wasn't real but my body was going through the motions of sleepiness. I went down for the count an hour or so later, slept like I haven't slept in years.  I woke up feeling refreshed.  No side effects for me at all.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Katherine, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/9/2008 3:12:35 PM	I'm a chronic insomniac and I've tried every trick in the book to fall asleep, but nothing worked. I took two of the &quot;Simply Sleep&quot; pills and was out cold in an hour. No grogginess the next morning... the only side effect I experienced was bad cottonmouth, but that went away after drinking a glass of water.
