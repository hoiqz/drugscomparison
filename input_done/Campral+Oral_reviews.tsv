I was feeling very depressed and crying a lot.  I was also thinking about alcohol again and wanting to drink (angry about having to stop).  I started taking it again about two weeks ago and I think I feel better.  I still need to go to AA but do have a doctor who monitors my meds.

I have been on campral for 10 weeks and still drinking every few days. Going to ask my doc for something else since this is not working for me.

I was a liter a day vodka drinker 24/7.  I immediately asked my Doctor to prescribe it for me because I knew that the detox was not enough for me because I had to leave a day early due to a family emergency.  Campral worked for me sooner than what the literature said and was a lifesaver.  I had no side affects and wished I could take it forever but there comes a time when you have to put the drug down and fight for your life without this wonderful aid.  It is a miracle drug and I recommend it to anyone wanting to quit drinking.  I also recommend AA and outpatient counseling along with the Campral because not only do you need to stop drinking, you need to admit you are an alcoholic, find out what your triggers are and resolve the issues that make you as an alcoholic relapse.You also need to learn that it is a disease and it is not your fault, but it is your fault if you do not seek help and learn how to stop drinking.  My favorite slogan in AA which I highly recommend for learning the tools is &quot;Move a muscle, change a thought&quot;.  That was   what I had to keep in mind.  Another is, if you do have an urge, rat yourself out to someone before you drink because it will help the urge pass.  Good luck to all you who pursue this journey, it is a hard journey but well worth the effort!  Godspeed!

For darn near 35 years, I have started drinking beer at 4-4:30 and did not stop until @ 7.  As many as I could pack in (up to 12) because for the most part I tried to hide my drinking.  Tried to quit at least 100 times and had some success years ago w/antabuse then AA only.   I started full doses of Revia and Campral and had horrible side effects (one reviewer called it like a bad acid trip).  So I stopped after 3 days.  My Dr. told me to half my doses and ever since (3 + weeks) my cravings have all but gone away.  I really can not believe it.... I have continued to drink (because.... that's what I do), but I can only get down 2-3 beers. I am in a therapy program and I am bipolar, BUT - I can see the light finally at the end of the tunnel. I feel better ALL OVER, and I foresee being alcohol free very soon. It just does not do for me what it once did.....

I checked myself in to a hospital with a rehab unit and stayed there for 7 days, without any kind of withdrawal symptons, amazingly.  On the last day, the doctor asked me if I would like to try campral; I think it was relatively new at that time.  I started taking campral and haven't had a drink in five years and don't even crave it.  All my friends and my doctor can't believe that I was able to do it!  Thank God for campral and the doctor who prescribed it!

I binge drank every night for over a year. Only side effect that I have noticed, that doesn't seem to be listed is, it makes me sleepy. It's awesome at night when I take my last dose, because it helps me sleep, but during the day it's kind of annoying. Has anyone else experienced that? I think I might actually be able to kick the habit with this. :-)

Campral was suggested to me at a wholistic rehab center.  I did not take it then, but when I did not conquer the fight by myself, I asked my dr for it.  Campral, along with AA is the answer.  YOU DO NEED TO SOP DRINKING WHEN YOU START CAMPRAL.  It will help you with the cravings immediately.  if you try to drink AND take Campral at the same time, you will not get the maximum positive benefit.  I'm not sure about any side effects as I am taking other Rx, but I also take ample vitamns and supplements that also help. Take a B-complex and amino acids!

Zero side effects.  And although the thought crosses my mind to drink, it doesn't hook me like it used to.  Once the thought was impossible to resist and I would have an inner debate until I just finally give in.  I love the freedom this drug has given me and how much happier I am being me.

Drinking all my life to the point that I cannot go an our without booze. I used to be able to function, but for the past two years I have been a stumble-bum drunk.Until, I took Campral. I started 3 months ago. I take 3 pills per day ( 150 mg). I no longer have any craving for alcohol. It is truly a miracle. I only hope it does not lose effectiveness.I have slipped twice. Once at a party, once when alone in a different city. But I would classify those instances as pure selfishness. I did not crave alcohol, I merely missed the habit of &quot;relaxing&quot; with a drink.  That is mental, not chemical, and I believe I can avoid, or minimize, those instances.Campral is a miracle drug that every alcoholic should take. It absolutely works!I had no side effects ( no gas, bowel problems, aches, pains or ear-ringing.) However, I would not quit the drug even if I had them.Further, do not miss a pill-taking! Even one missed dose brings back the craving big-time. I also take an extra pill before attending parties where I know alcohol will be served,

As an after thought and reading a review that a side affect was ringing in the ear, I thought I should write again. I had ringing in the ear from using Lasix a diuretic in the hospital. This may sound like an oxymoron, but since useing Campral my ringing went away. It's true, don't know why and don't care.

If you drink over it, it will stop working and you will crave Al -- but a five-day relapse is better than a 15-year relapse.  It quiets the hamster cage.

Of course, you have to want to stop drinking, somewhat, but it does take away the cravings. I took it for 3 weeks while still drinking, and it did not help, but then I stopped drinking, and at around day 5 to 7 I realized my cravings were gone!! It repairs your brain, also, so you can &quot;think through the drink.&quot; I cannot say enough good things about this. Only bad side effects are some loose stools and gas, but I just adjust when I take the three doses. It is better than getting drunk again!! Sober 46 days.

I started on this drug but didn't stop drinking right away. I gradually shifted from hard liquor, to wine, to wine spritzers that became mostly club soda after a while. Within a year, I discovered that I was no longer ABLE to get intoxicated. More than two drinks puts me right to sleep. I now take one campral a day as a maintanance dose, and drink no more than 2-3 beers per WEEK. I know you're supposed to stop drinking when using this drug, and not everyone would be willing to wait for the gradual full effect I experienced the way I did it. Talk to your doctor and do what works for YOU. But I know I never would have been able to become a &quot;normal&quot; drinker again without this pill. I'm proof you can indeed unpickle a pickle. It's really a miracle.

Campral will get you out of the hole, but AA will keep you out. We suffer from a disease of body, mind, and spirit. Campral worked during my &quot;white-knuckle&quot; days of recovery to ease my mental obsession with alcohol. Once the physical craving was gone (about 5 days after last drink) I believe this drug calmed obsession, moodswing and discontent. I still take Cymbalta, but only used Campral for 30 days. By turning my will over to God, asking Him to remove my obsession, WORKING the 12 steps of AA, and getting a sponsor, I have achieved the longest period of sobriety ever. Whatever works for you is wonderful. I HATE this damn disease and hope everyone can find serenity. Campral and most importantly, Alcoholics Anonymous has worked for me.

Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	1/31/2010 6:50:43 AM	This drug is great! Drank for years, night's and all weekend. Did 4 days of detox and started Campral. 2 tablets 3 times a day. No cravings, no desire to drink. Changed my habits, got my life back. Started to decrease my dose 3 weeks ago and now I am off. Still no desire, You have to want to stop drinking. The only side effect while on it was sore joints, around the evening time and early in the morning. I would highly recommend this to someone who wants to stop drinking, not just because they were put on it. It takes will power, the drug will help, not do miracles. I also took paxel before and after, with no side effects. I still have joint pain, hoping it will go away as the drug disapates out of my system. The joint pain was well worth the out come. Highly recomended.

I have not felt any benefits from this drug.  I do attend my AA meetings EVERY DAY, sometimes more than one a day. This helps me tremendously!  The &quot;counseling&quot; there is free and it's with people who have &quot;experience&quot; with this disease and how to recover from it.  I strongly recommend throwing this medicine in the trash and getting to the closest AA meeting as soon as possible!  There is hope for you...without a bunch of drugs! I mean, haven't we been polluting our bodies long enough with drugs and alcohol?  My best wishes to all of you...Blessings!

While I have drank for over a decade my drinking lead to a dependency that this prescription will not help. It WILL help with cravings and I guess with urges to drink. What it WILL NOT do: help with sleeplessness, anxiety, mood swings(may even INCREASE them), it is bothersome to take 6-8 pills a day, the dosage oddly is &quot;666&quot;mg, hence it will not substitute for any medication to relieve the insanity you will feel ...but there is hope.&quot;A.A.&quot; on line forum at finnious5478 on utube and/or start your own. it will help with the long night... specially not that we have more time to think about not drinking.

I'm a 25 year drinker who has had 3 to 4 Scotches per night for years, More on week ends.  Drinking to this point has not had a negative effect on my life. I just no that I must quit because it can't be good to drink that much!!! I started Campral on Wed. and Thursday because I work 12 hour days and figured that by the time Friday night rolled around that I have 9 doses in me. It has been over a week now and I havn't had one drop. Sunday was diffacult for me as I'm off the hole day and thaught about drinking often. This drug has helped me a lot. The only side effect was some dizzyness the first couple of days.  I'm also taking prozak and if anything they mix well together!! Hope that this rating halps someone!!!

Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	soberati, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	55-64	8/11/2009 4:15:34 PM	I started taking the full dose of Campral 3 weeks ago. It definitely reduced cravings, but I still slipped a few times mostly because I missed the lifestyle not alcohol itself.After the first full week I became nauseous and vomited a few times plus diarrhea and related GI symptoms. The doc cut the dose in half and that eliminated most of the symptoms except watery stools. I began to crave a normal BM in the second week and stopped it entirely intending to go back on once my stomach cleared up. The cravings came back right away and I slipped. I do go to meetings and outpatient rehab. Had a really bad problem with getting drunk. Went back on it before having a real satisfying solid BM and within the first dose noticed a reduction in cravings. Haven't drank since. I wish there was an alternative that didn't give me these side effects or a dietary way of counteracting them, but until I find one or the other its worth it to be so utterly relieved of cravings. Not everyone experiences side effects so don't be alarmed by my experience if you are reading this in order to decide if you want to try it.

I was like a new person -- not drinking, calm, happy.  Unfortunately, I fall into the 1-2% that could not continue to take it due to severe diarrhea.
Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/30/2009 1:08:00 PM	I missed a dose at lunch the other day and could tell very quickly--cravings started and I went home from work and took my meds and was okay in about 30 minutes.  I am in therapy and going to AA every nite.  The meetings also help....This medicine will not work if you cannot control the mental wanting of the alcohol!  The wanting to escape your daily life.

Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/21/2008 6:58:22 PM	After 20+ years of drinking, 10 years of passing out almost every night, I went through treatment and go to AA and supplement with Campral.  The difference this time is Campral took away my cravings.

It is as if that piece of my brain that motivated me to drink has been shut off.  I remember the feelings of wanting to drink, but cannot &quot;feel&quot; them anymore--kind of like remembering what it is like to be hungry but not feeling hungry. Only hassle is having to take it 3x day--mid-day dose is easy to forget.

It makes her grumpy, dizzy, and sleepy.  She seems to be just as drunk on this drug as when she was drinking.  She did report that she had very few cravings, but I would only recommend this as a last resort because the patient will still seem to be drunk.

Have fallen off wagon twice.  Don't have strong cravings anymore unless I'm in a situation surrounded by alcohol and other drinkers.  However, I am not seeing a councelor and may need to to get the full benefit of the drug. Haven't noticed any side effects.

I got on here to see if side effects included joint pain, because my joints are killing me!

Campral is such a great help in early recovery. Cravings are eliminated which seems impossible. What a miracle. I was able to begin counseling and AA without the nagging cravings. I'm two years sober and highly recommend this drug!

Im not sure but I think this drug helps best with the physical side effects of alcoholism. My addiction is more the mental and emotional craving for mental numbness. I have used it to self medicate my depression for years.

But it worked great.  I drank constantly for 16 years, now I haven't had a drop for 3 weeks.  That's amazing.
Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	11/4/2007 9:08:15 AM	Campral has worked very well in eliminating the cravings of alcohol. This will be a very good tool for those that also use A.A. to abstain from alcohol. I do have joint pain as a side effect, but thats better than jail, court, divorce, ect.
Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	55-64	10/29/2007 1:56:06 PM	I find it very effective in reducing cravings. If I even TRY to fantisize my old thoughts, there is no interest any longer. Somewhat difficult for me to remember to take it at the same time every day.
