My blood pressur has gone from 166/100 to anywhere from 81/53 to 115/68. I am loving the result.But yesterday when I visited my Dr. She had to take me off the medication do to very bad swelling in both feet, toes, ankles and halfway to my knees and had gotten to the point of being painfull even to touch and I have a high threshhold for pain. I have had the swelling for a little over a month. I thought, maybe something else was causeing this untill I had my doctor see it on my regular every 3 month evaluation check-up. I had been on the meication for at least 6 months until yesterday.Needless to say I am very sorry to be taken off the meds. because it worked so well to get my blood pressure down. I will be visiting my Dr. again in a month to see how my BP is doing and the swelling as well and if need be, she will put me on another med. to help with the BP. :(

High Blood Pressure	aqypoz, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	4/16/2010 5:47:47 PM	I reported to my Dr. that the previous medication I was on gave me extreme headaches, since I been taking Nifediac the headaches have gone. I am beginning to get some numbness at the tips of my fingers and sometimes my toes, which I have not experienced before.  Also for some reason since I have been taking Nifediac my hair is  falling out, dull and lifeless and is not growing, however my fingers and eyebrows continue to grow quickly as usually.

My lower legs were hot, swollen, and it hurt to walk.  Later my joints all began to ache making it painful to go about my day.  My doc prescribed a diuretic which helps some, but I still feel to swollen, sore, and tired to continue my regular exercise routine (3 times per week cardio).  My BP was barely elevated (140 / 85) before I started this med and I would rather take my chances on a stroke than continue with these side effects.  I will discontinue this medication with or without medical supervision.

I have 10 times less attacks than i normally do but i still get migraines from time to time which still isn't so great because i dont like when my head feels like it will fall off. Lol! It's worth it.
