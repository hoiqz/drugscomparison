Tension Headache	Kathleen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/14/2011 11:17:46 AM	I was having terrible headaches that also brought on ocular headaches.  It got so bad that I shut myself up in my apartment for days trying to overcome the sensitivity to light and sound.  My doctor gave me a sample of Cephadyn and  I no longer suffer.  If you take this at the first sign of a headache you are OK within 20 minutes.  This is a miracle drug for me.  I'm told by walgreens that this is being discontinued. I found this on the internet and it's not discontinued so if your told it is then go online and you'll find it!!!

I have tried all the migraine meds out there and this is the only thing that helps.
Tension Headache	StacieHedrick77, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/19/2011 1:04:32 AM	This medication has worked wonders for my headaches and has not caused stomach irritation.  I suffer from stomach ulcers and this medication works very well in avoiding any irritation.  I do not feel as though this medication is habit forming.  I rarely take this medication unless I have a severe headache.  I only take it when absolutely necessary and do not feel the need to take it otherwise.

Tension Headache	Stormy7373, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/4/2011 11:08:20 PM	I have been suffering from terrible, debilitating migraines for many years. My Dr prescribed this to me on my last visit so I would have something to help with my headaches until I get in to see the Neurologist. So far it has helped tremendously. The only side effect I have is drowsiness, but I'm hoping that will go away after a while. I suggest taking this immediately upon getting a headache. Waiting makes it not as effective.

I have been getting them more frequently the past 3 months. I normally take Excedrin migraine, but my Doctor gaveme a sample of these to take incase the Excedrin didn't work. I have had a headache the past 2 days and decided to take the sample, and my headache was gone within 15 minutes. I am going to call my Doctor tomorrow to ask for a prescription.

I love it! I was also having trouble sleeping, but it helped with that too. I also feel more relaxed during my day and my headaches are knocked out within 15 minutes of taking cephadyn 100mg.

This medication was given to me by the 2nd nuerologist and the only thing i have noticed is that it makes me loopy and only makes the migraines bearable for a couple hours until it wears off. i'm not impressed.

This is the FIRST medication I have been given that helps. My migrane will occasionally come back after the meds wear off but I am getting relief and it only comes back maybe 10% of the time. I am very pleased and satisfied with my results with this medication!

I have another medication (metaxalone 800mg) that's sort of a pre-headache med.  It treats muscle tension in my neck &amp; shoulders.  If I time things just right the cephadyn &amp; metaxalone are effective.

I have started taking it again, after numerous other meds failed to even put a dent in my headaches.  I am on daily treatment of my migraines so this is helps when Tylenol, Advil, Aspirin, Excerdin or anything else OCT doesn't work.  I've had no side effects since the initial sleeping for 18 hours incident.  My last dose (yesterday) didn't even make me drowsy and helped alot.  My prescription says do not take everyday on it.  So I take it only when absolutely necessary.

Tension Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	1/3/2009 10:38:03 PM	I am a t-8 para. with quadriparesis.This was given to me for tension headaches.It works great IF you take it as directed and at the first sign of that headache. I DO NOT wait and think a hot towel will help. I do the pill then the hot towel and I am doing much better. I have been on this since mid Dec. The pharmacy at first did not fill it but 2 days later I went back to another pharmacy and they sent it through just fine. They said it depended on the code and how the insurance company got it.
