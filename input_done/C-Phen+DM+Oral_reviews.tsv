Cough	JPeezy83, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/16/2011 8:46:19 PM	I finally went to the dr. today, after trying to fight off this &quot;sickness&quot; that I've had. It was one of those &quot;walk in the box&quot; offices, and actually have been to this one before. I was coughing, from my chest mainly, wheezing, having trouble breathing..after a breathing treatment and 1 steriod shot and 1 anti-biotic shot, the dr. wrote me a prescription for an antibiotic and this cough medicine c-phen dm..which she told me was a non-narcotic..I didn't understand why she didn't give me something stronger with a pain killer in, considering my circumstances.. I get bronchitis almost every year if not twice a year..so im fimiliar with what the dr. usually gives..which is an antibiotic and cough syrup with codeine, to help ease the pain and sleep better at night..but i was so ready to leave and didn't ask why she gave me a different cough product..when i got home I took my dose of cough med., and about an hour later, my cough had decreased, my nose wasn't stuffy anymore, and it helped me sleep actually.. i think that's due to the anti-histamine in this product..so no worry's..this medicine does work!

My 7yo has allergies &amp; asthma and takes it for his coughing fits along with his spacer/inhaler.  I give him 0.5 ml before bed and nothing during the day, along with his nasal sprays and humidifier at night and after a few days he's fine.

Runny Nose	Sam I Am, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Male	35-44	3/8/2010 10:41:46 PM	Beware! Went to Doctor and He prescribed my 4 month old this med It didn't do a thing but Knock him out. The next morning I had him on my lap giving him a bottle of Breast milk when he went into a seizure and tremors I was horrified because I turned him around  thinking he was chocking and his little eyes were fixed wide open with no response for about 11 seconds which felt like an eternity when he snapped out of it he felt sleepy, so we rushed him to the emergency room and he was looked over and was released The Dr at the Emergency Room said that he had no buisness taking this med and it was probably the cause because it effects part of the brain. So Beware of this C- Phen! 
Cough	OPmom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	1/29/2010 6:57:17 PM	Personally, I don't understand why on earth a 1, 2 or even 4 year old would be taking this medication, it should be used on kids over 6. My almost 7yo son takes it for his bad coughs.  He has asthma and allergies and it REALLY helps when he has flare ups.  I only use it in the evenings before he goes to bed, and never longer than 2 -3 days.  I don't believe in giving kids a lot of medications, but sometimes you have to.  Once he cough clears up, I'll wait a week or two before I start giving him his allergy meds.  I think that's what's causing the cough.  The child may be turning into a monster from the meds because of overdose on the medication.  I read the pamphlets that comes with the scripts from the drugstore, and in writing says not for kids under 6.  The right measuring cup/spoon makes a huge difference, and you could easily OD your child if you're not careful, and that's what sounds like is happening with the &quot;monster&quot; kid.
Runny Nose	Mother_of_twin_girls, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	12/20/2009 9:09:37 PM	This medication was prescribed to my 8 month old daughter due to her runny nose. The first dose she had was before bed time and she slept very good. Her second and last dose was the following morning. Shortly after taking it red blotches began to appear on her face. She wasn't having trouble breathing and she was in good spirits however, hours later I had to rush her to the ER because the lesions had spread from her face down her arms, stomach, and legs. The ER gave her benedryl and prelone. It is now well over 24 hrs and it looks like the redness is getting worse rather than getting better. New blotches have developed covering her stomach and legs. She is going to follow up with her Dr tomorrow unless we have to make another ER visit tonight. She has been miserable all weekend and I now wish I would have helped her through the runny nose rather then putting her through all this.

It helped her get over the drainage and the coughing.  She is actually back on it and cause she is now having sinus problems again.  This did not change her personality in any way.  She did not complain about her stomach hurting her nor did she become a monster as others state their children did.

Runny Nose	mama,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	2	1	Female		4/15/2009 9:08:51 PM	Monster child as well.  My 21 month old loses his mind on this medication.  I think my pediatrician works for this company, it is what he ALWAYS prescribes.  I refuse to use it ever again because of the effects on my sweet baby,
Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	35-44	3/27/2009 7:21:38 PM	This drug did very little to relieve chest congestion. By about the 3rd day I started having chills and nausea. By the 5th day I stopped taking it because my energy level was zero. I felt like I was going to pass out but I couldn't sleep. Exhausted and vibrating. I poured the rest down the sink and will never use it again.

Cough	mama of 2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	5/14/2008 4:23:47 PM	I have to say that we have had a completly different experience than others who reviewed this drug.  This is the 2nd time I have used this drug.  My almost 2 year old has a upper respitory infection and is draining a lot at night.  She was waking every 2-3 hours with coughing attacks.  Compared to the directions on this box, my daughter is not getting anywhere near the dose that it says.  She is taking 0.5 ml once a day at night to help with her cough.  The box says to give her 1 ml 4 times a day.  I have to say that finally after 6 nights of waking due to the cough she is sleeping again and is finally feeling better. My doctor didn't want her to take it during the day so that she can cough up the phlem and get it out of her system which she is doing.  I have to say for us and a friend of mine, we have had great results with this drug.  We have had no side effects or has my daughter turned into a &quot;monster&quot;.  
Cough	Momma, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	4	1	Female	25-34	3/13/2008 10:54:14 PM	My baby had symptoms that consisted of nasal congestion, bad cough, and sneezing. After 3 days of using this medication, I could not tell that it did my baby any good. In fact, it made my baby's cough and breathing worse.This is the second time that my son's pediatrician has pescribed this medication,and this is the second time that I have been utterly disgusted with it. The next time the Dr. tries to give it, I will not let it happen. 
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	2/24/2008 10:48:14 PM	My Daughter turned into a complete monster on this medication. And it was not as effective as ceron dm -(It did not have the monster child side effect)
Cold Symptoms	Girard Dad, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	25-34	1/17/2008 7:58:52 PM	My son was suffering from severe cold symptoms and we took him to our family doctor and to emergency since our niece had just been diagnosed with viral pneumonia and RSV; C-Phen was prescribed.  I would rather take my chances with the illness.We have now been given C-Phen twice and both times it turned our usually sweet 17 month old into an angry monster.  I would take the monster if it did anything beneficial.  I would NEVER recommend C-Phen to anyone.
Other	lydma1220,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	3	1	Female		10/13/2007 1:52:24 PM	My daughter who is under two, was given this medicine twice as a drooper, when she had a cold and again when she had croup. Both times she had side effects, stomach pains, trouble breathing, and over excitability. The mucus would stay in her chest, and she couldn't cough it up because this medicine is made to inhibit coughing. This is not a good medicine for young children. It only made my daugter cough and breathing worsen. I think any parent who's doctor is going to perscribe this or any other medication should do research before accepting a perscription.
