Other	RachelinAZ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	7/12/2012 5:03:21 PM	I have issues with my muscles, where they &quot;clamp up&quot;. They get HOT and hurt to even touch. I have no idea why this happens.. I wish I had a clue :(  I have gone in for Lidocaine shots, which help a lot!  However, I wish my insurance company would pay for the patches. :( So I would have something when it flares up in the evenings or weekends. I can not always get into my doctor.My lower back, it's been doing this for YEARS. However, it has now moved into my entire back (never all at once) and into my legs.Soma helps, which I LOVE, but it makes me tired. With two children, 4 &amp; 5, I can not take it in the day time. I have not tried to break it in half, on the score line. Any relief would be better than none.Thankfully, this does not happen 24/7!

I came here to check up and see if it was a medicine that needed to built up in your system in order to be completely effective.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	4/26/2012 4:21:16 AM	This medication does work but you have to adjust and adapt to it to make it work for your pains and sufferings.   this midecation worked for me in so many ways.  yes, in the beginning i felt dizzy and sick (vomitting) but after my body got used to it all the sickness and dizziness went away.  BUT for taking it longer then my Doctor should have told me to take it, I know have Liver problems from this mdedication.  I have a disfunctional liver problem and its not from alcohol but from this drug (medication).  Take it but do not abuse it and if your doctor tells you to continue taking it more then you should, i would suggest you stop and ask for a second opinion.  It will damage your liver in the future and it says it on the label if used longer then needed.  This medication does work and help heal the back and side pains but dont take it more then you are supposed to.  Please dont.

Backache	NomorePain07, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/29/2012 2:30:51 PM	I have spinal stenosis with pinched nerves between c-4 and c-5. The arthritic compression has been debilitating for me. I have opted not to have invasive spinal surgery as I am concerned it may make it worse. Due to our wonderful restricted care as doctors seem to be afraid of prescribing real pain medicine where I come from I have only been prescribed nerve pain inhibitors like neurontin(Placebo!), Lortab 7.5's with muscle relaxers. I have tried flexiril with no results aside from wild and uncontrollable spasms on them. Then, Norflex which was a very expensive medication with absolutely NO results. Finally Soma...WOW what a difference! I can function now, with simple pain medication and Soma's I can lead a normal life again. I would have to rate this a miracle cure for my pain considering my experience with other medications with no results. The only side affect I seem to notice is I am more relaxed with a new sense of well being I havent felt in a long, long time!
Other	summer 07, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	1/26/2012 5:23:12 PM	This drug was lethal for me! It got so I couldn't take just one, and then I would be slurring my words, staggering, etc. I had gone to the dentist and had &quot;Nitrous&quot; during my procedure. I have major anxiety with dentists, due to back luck with several dental procedures. After my root-canal recently, I took 2 Soma to relax, since I was so tense while having the root-canal, even with the Nitrous-Oxide! After about 10 minutes, I could barely function. I'm lucky to have been able to drive back to work. My co-workers had me lie down, and then called the dentist, and my husband to come and pick me up. It was very embarassing, as I seemed drunk, but haven't had any alcohol for over 15 years. I later found that, even after taking this medication for over a year, I'd become allergic to it.  In addition, I've heard that this is a &quot;dirty&quot; drug, often ending up on the streets, for dealers to sell to untreated alcoholics and kids.  Please use EXTREME CAUTION if taking Soma; or better still, ask your Dr. to prescribe something else. It has become dangerously poisonous to me, and I will/can NEVER injest it again. I think it should be taken off the market, and if nothing else, be in the &quot;Controlled Substance&quot; class. It's worse than Oxycontin, Vicodin, or any other opiate out there.

Sadly the Dr. Won't precsube them to me anymore as they are worried obout addiction. So sad be because I found something that really helps and can't get them.

My heart is to damaged for the 8-9hr surgery needed. Take Oxycontin 2xdaily and Dr. said add this. After 2 months I was losing all strength in legs and could only stand for a minute. My balance left also, couldn't close eyes and stand or try to turn at normal speed. It took quite awhile to figure out what the problem. I'm out 3days after stopping and legs are slowly coming back, dizziness is still bad but slowly improving. Feel like I have flu symptoms, foggy head &amp; eyesight, sensitive to light. I thought at first it was my back getting worse, then knew it was much more serious. Hope to alert people of these symptoms.

Muscle Spasm	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/16/2011 4:07:04 AM	Have DDD, including cervical stenosis/spondylosis, disc protrusions and bone spurs at C5-7, facet disease at T2-3 and leftward torticollis. This has been coming on gradually over the past 10 years but have only recently (past 18 months) received any medical diagnosis or treatment. I started taking Soma on my own almost 2 years ago and it has been a miracle drug. It is the only drug that relaxes my muscles in my neck, shoulders and uppper back wile giving me pain relief at the samne time. Doc had me try gabapentin (no pain relief), then tramadol (some pain relief first couple weeks but had to keep increasing dose to max, which then caused serious side effects and had to withdraw slowly), physical therapy (no help), back to gabapentin at a slightly higher dose (helps a little...allows me to reduce tylenol and ibuprofen daily doses), and then finally received my first cervical epidural steroid injection. I will continue taking Soma as long as needed. It helps so much with pain and muscle spasms, and also allows me to sleep better. I wish docs were not so afraid to rx carisoprodol. I am immune to all opiates, from morphine down to vicoden, and muscle relaxers seem to be the only drug helpful with my condition.

Muscle Spasm	lilydark, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/29/2011 9:19:18 AM	I have been on Soma for 18 years now for muscle spasms as a result of an assault that damaged my sciatic nerve and herniated the L4/L5 disc. After 7 surgeries, two fusions and 6 other procedures the combo of Soma/Vicodin seems to work best. I do not have an addictive personality and only take as prescribed. I have tried other muscle relaxants that were less effective. I have recently started with a new Pain Management Clinic and they were horrified at how long I have been on Soma, freaking out about side effects and warning me about Soma-related brain damage! They told me to Google it and I did. I have so far found nothing that states long-term Soma usage like mine causes brain damage! They have pulled me off Soma with no weaning period and put me on Robaxin. I don't think it works as well but we'll see. I would think after 18 years I would show some signs of damage if Soma was so bad for me but all I can show is pain/spasm relief. On Soma I can have somewhat of a life! It's only day two.

I have Fibromyalgia, had two back surgeries, I also have a ruptured disk right abouve where my spine was fused in my lower back and my neck. Chronic Pain and severe anxiety. I don't know what I would do with out my Soma! I have been taking it on and off for over 27 years now and I must say, this is the only drug that I don't have to take more of because my body has adapted to it. I still only take 1 pill, 4X a day. DON'T DRINK WHILE TAKEING SOMA!!!! VERY BAD, YOU COULD DIE!!!  The only side effect that I have experianced is constipation, that's it. Luckily I have a very compasionate Doctor. I have no problems getting my refills every month and I get 120 pills each time. Blood and Urine test's to go along with it though. Doc want's to make sure I'm not takeing more than I should. I also take Lortab for my pain and Xanax twice a day. You would think that I would be very loopi but because I have been takeing these medications for so long,,, I really have NO side effects. I can't afford Lyrica for my Fibromyalgia medication so Soma and Lortab are the next best thing. Thanx to my Doctor for being so compasionate..

Also, there are no side effects if you have taken it for a while, then break from it for a week .... I tried it.  Only side effect is that you will start having your muscle spasms.  It also works wonderfully for pain.  I have the vertebrae in my neck which are fused, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia... I think it's an ideal drug, but yes, doctors are leery about prescribing it because there are so many people hitting these pain management doctors for drug abuse now.  It's a shame.  You would think that the government would check these pharmacy records and see that people are going to more than one of these type of doctors at a time. 
Muscle Spasm	Cari Soma, 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4		45-54	6/11/2011 3:57:01 PM	Soma is a wonderful muscle relaxant, however it is highly addictive and is basically a worthless medicine. It gets you high and has a synthetic opioid like component. Similar to the old Quaaludes missing the Methaqualone. This medicine had become a controlled substance in many States, and Doctors realize the efficacy of Soma is limited and again HIGHLY addictive!

My Drs and surgeons have put me on every muscle relaxer known to man over the years, but none has been as effective as Soma. I do take it with 10 mg Percocet and between the two it seems to control most of my pain. I know the warnings say that it is addictive, but I have not went through any type of withdrawal when I have went a day or so without taking it. I would highly recommend this medication to anyone having any type of muscle pain or muscle spasm.
Muscle Spasm	Im Not A Drug Addict, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/26/2011 7:56:48 PM	I have been prescribed Soma on several ocassions and find it VERY effective.  I have had two neck surgeries, one knee operated on twice that now needs replacing, and currently 7 bulging disks from my neck to my lumbar which cause incredible pain on some days.  Other days are less painful and I can do without it.  However, it is impossible to get a script for this.  Because of abuse and &quot;selling&quot; of this medication, people like me have to suffer daily.  Even though I have been seeing the same doctor for many, many years, no one in that office will write a script for this medication.  You can get Lortab easier than you can Soma.  Lortab is good for pain but not for muscle spasms.  However, when you have both, the combination is the best around, especially with a Medrol dospak.  Flexaril does not work and after taking another popular muscle relaxer (Tramadol's generic I think), I had to be driven home from work because it made me so sick.  I also take Celebrex daily for arthritis but it does not work on chronic pain and muscle spasms realted to back and/or neck pain.

Muscle Spasm	DevZ, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	1/16/2011 12:52:44 PM	I separated my shoulder, and it kept causing discomfort. A pharmacy friend had me try the coloperahl 350mg. It gave me a body buzz and relief in my shoulder. I did find it addictive, at the end I was getting 60 tablet refills. I stopped taking it when I noticed the drug lowered my inhabitions to the point the pharmacist persuaded me into acts I would never commit with a man his age.

I asked my doctor about them and his remark to me was NO.. to high of a street value,so I took my self out of the GOD COMPLEX and found some one who really wanted to treat my problems and not just pound my liver with Acetametaphine 3000mg's a day that is vicodin 7.0/750 word to the wise there are many people oout there with priviliged upbringing and have acieved an M.D. This does not make them a doctor if you feel like you are speaking and no one else in the room is listening, remove yourself from that room . too high of a street value I tought my health was the concern at two hundered dollars a visit every month. I have never heard of soma until recently boy I wish I would have had my phone on record or did I..... what shall I do. what would you do? Seriously, I am at a moral cross roads is this person overlooking everyone else just like he did me? How about so help here. 
Backache	lillygirl6, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	10/26/2010 4:57:23 AM	I started this after I found that Flexeril did not work at all for me. This helps much better. I have chronic pain from herniated disks in c-spine and lumber spine due to broken vertabrae. I can only take up to two a day, which is plenty and sometimes I don't need it. So as long as you take as directed, it's great. If you take too much, it can cause headaches. I use it in combination with some pain meds as well. It's worked well for me with little to no side-effects.

Muscle spasms associated with this disease are horrible. They keep me up at night &amp; the contractions of the muscles are very painful. My doctors have given me every muscle relaxer known to man,they all love Baclofen, but it does NOTHING! It is so hard to get a script of Soma, but my dr trusts me enough to know that I will not abuse it or sell it. I took it for 5 yrs, a long time ago. So I now have it back, &amp; I'm so happy. I can sleep at night without the contractures &amp; the muscle spasms are at a minimum!  The only muscle relaxer that works for me, and I have to beg to get 30 pills. Thank God I have a wonderful dr, but I feel sorry for the people who don't. All of this contraversy is because so many people get a script and then sell the pills! Thanks! They have now made it impossible for those of us who really need this medication. I think this is a crime in itself!

Took it in the past for muscle spasms in my side.  SO helpful!  Unfortunately, MY EX-BF BECAME ADDICTED TO IT! He was addicted to a number of pain meds which he was on for a while so I think the key is to only use this in the SHORT-TERM.  Also, I have noticed slight weight gain after less than a week.

I hardly ever accomplish anything when on it.  It also gives me an &quot;I don't care&quot; attitude, so I often take another 1/2, then another, etc.  and lose count.  I want to get off it but that's not proving to be easy, given that the drug makes me not really care how many I take.

I need another neck surgery, but am trying to put it off.  This is the only medicine that anyone has tried me on, and I have been on every other muscle relaxant that have, that works on spasms.  Of course it doesn't work as well as it used to I have grown tolerant to it.  But if I didn't have it, I would not be able to sleep at all.  I remember it really knocking me for a loop when I first started taking it, like some of the reviews of this medicine state, but it just takes time to get used to it. Hang in there, it gets better.

Some have complained about a bitter taste- I have not experienced this.  I was in a car accident 3 years ago &amp; sprained my neck.  I have suffered with frequent neck &amp; back pain ever since. Before Soma I tried Flexiril &amp; Zanaflex.  With Flexiril I would sleep at least 12 hours a day &amp; felt like a zombie all the time. Zanaflex put me to sleep within 30 minutes &amp; while I did not wake up groggy it did not provide much pain relief.Soma does make me sleepy if I have taken it for a week straight however if I take it intermittently for pain it does not put me to sleep.  I can carry on normal everyday activity, including work.  I am also a migraine sufferer &amp; this drug helps more than any other migraine medication that I have tried.

And, it never helped with my severe muscle spasms in my back (following a car accident.)  Later, my sister-in-law told me her cousin died during his sleep, from being on Soma.

It def. works for my muscle spasms but I'm totally out of it!  I'm 'drunk' and 'stupid', cannot walk barely can speak and sleep way too much on this medication.  I have also talked on the phone and not remembered it so I wonder what else I've done and don't know it?  If you can take it and just go to bed and STAY THERE, then by all means do it because it works well for the ailment it was prescribed for.  If you have to work the next day take it no later than say 7pm to wake up by 6:30AM..you still may feel too groggy to commute to work.  It's a VERY STRONG muscle relaxer. I wish you well. MM

Soma absolutely helps the best with muscle spasms. Alot of drugs can be addictive if you have addiction issues. If you need to take it, and take it like it is prescribed, you should be ok. It has been wonderful. My muscle spasms and pain was so much worse before beginning this med. Have been on it for a year and a half now. I don't take more than prescribed and have been fortunate not to become addictive. It helps sooo much!!

My muscle spasms before Soma were horendous and quite honestly it took about a week or longer for it to start helping. I have now been on Soma for aproximately three months and soon will stop taking it.

Other	achydude, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	11/12/2009 1:49:53 PM	For the first several weeks, this in addition to NSAIDs really helped relieve severe tension headaches and associated pains in my neck and back. There was also the ant-anxiety side effect that also helped me out (since it may be anxiety that contributed to the headaches in the first place!).However, after about 3 weeks of taking 1 250 mg pill per day, I still got the anti-pain effects, but the anti-anxiety effects wore off, and had more of a side-effect of me getting more impatient and aggressive during the day.Overall, I'd say that if you take this in small amounts for less than a month or so, you should be ok, but be careful of taking it for long periods or in larger doses.

I was on this medication for 5 years and then was taken off of it because the Dr. said it is highly addictive. Now my back pain is extremely painful - have been off of Soma for 2 years even though it is one of the best medications I have ever taken for severe pain relief. Pain sufferers need to stand up for this medication; it works and I want to be prescribed it again.

I need to take enough to get to sleep and relieve the burning and tightness in my back.  It has a problem in that it takes at least 1.5 hours before it &quot;kicks in&quot;.........so it's not a great alternative to pain meds.......and I've tried epidurals and all sorts of pain management docs......currently I'd love to find another muscle relaxant that will work much more quickly and provide reliev

I have a degenerative disc disease of the lower back and so have muscle tightness and spasms that made a good nights sleep difficult.  Not since I have been taking this.  I do not find that I want to overuse it as some precautions claim.  Only two pills at night.  My world is completely different.  I have been trying to find out if at the dosage I am taking will it damage my liver.  However, there seem to have been no long term studies as it is usually only prescribed for 3 weeks at a time.

Doctor prescribed twice a day. As far as pain relief, doesn't work any better than ibuprofen. First couple of days I felt great, after that, the mood swings, insomnia, dizziness, headache. It doesn't even help the back pain that much and is certainly not worth taking for me. I just hate this stuff. It is banned in Europe because it metabolizes into meprobamate (aka Miltown, Equanil) very dangerous substance.
Other	StevenDeRoche, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	1	Male	45-54	7/14/2009 5:22:41 AM	I would like to describe what this drug accomplished to a 37 year old women whose drivers license was revoked and she chose to drive without a license. She was prescribed Soma for a finger infection induced pain. She picked up her prescription and took two pills before leaving the pharmacy parking lot. On the way home she pulled over to pick up a uprooted bush on the side of the road. Placed it in the back seat of her Kia Sportage and proceeded home while the bush rolleded forward in front of her face. She ran thru a three ditches along with three residential lawns leaving tire tracks thru the whole adventure and used a Toyota Tacoma as a stopping point for her vehicle to rest on and impaling her radiator and engine with the equalization hitch with protruding tongue on the rear of the Toyota Tacoma in a residential driveway. A trip to jail was in the making after displaying her prescription to a police personnel but was able to pass a sobriety test. Trying to get her home she couldn't remember where she lived or any phone numbers to call. We had to ask people in her nieghborhood where she resided. Her husband was asleep inside there home while all this took place not knowing she took there only transportation and totaled it. She was unaware that she almost ran over two children who were fast enough to get out of her unintended path. Soma was not used as it should have been prescibed and she was not counseled on how to use it or even took time to read the insert that came with it to determine what the side effects would be. So much for not having a drivers license. Do not drive without a drivers license and ingest Soma.

I took 1 at night. 4 weeks ago I started taking 2 a day (one late afternoon &amp; 1 at bedtime).2 weeks ago I developed severe mussle &amp; joint pain that started in my knees, progressed to arms, hands and neck. Pain was so bad I couldn't walk, bend, kneel or sleep. Was in so much pain I just cried. Went to my Dr. who told me Soma should not cause this. However I see precautions regarding this on this site. I stopped taking it completely. The pain is starting to lessen slowly and I am starting to regain some normal movement in my joints.BEWARE. If you start to develop severe joint pain..stop the medication.I think I may have developed problems due to long term use. Would rather live with the lower back pain then deal with this overall joint pain and limited mobility.

The first time I took Soma it knocked my on my butt and I was afraid to take it again.  But I did and am glad because it has been so much more effective than any other muscle relaxer I have tried.  After the intial experience I have never had another problem with it.  I take morphine 100 mg. tabs, along with moprhine 20 mg per ml for break through pain as well as the Soma for pain and muscle spasms from Secondary Progressive MS, Fibro Myalgia, and other ailments and injuries to my spine.  And even after 10 years it has not lost any of it's effectiveness on me.  Almost like when aspirin was first used, to me Soma is a wonder-drug since I have no problems with taking it, only advantages.  And I don't have any kind of mental impairment from my meds either.  To me, it has been a blessing.

I've needed antibiotics for the damage done to my jaw and teeth. My bite plate helped, but Soma helps me more by stopping me from grinding.

The biggest complaint I guess I have about Soma is it gives me the WORST gas EVER!! and not the kind that comes out of my mouth - sometimes it is so foul I cannot stand to be around myself. I have not added or changed anything in my diet, so I figured it was the Somas by process of elimination. Helps with the muscle spasms and the sleep interuptions (before Soma, I was getting up about 4-5 times a night. Now I only get up 1-2 times) Would advise NOT to drive or do anything dangerous while on this, atleast not for the first couple hours after taking. 
Backache	THamrick, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/24/2008 1:13:31 AM	I have been on medication after medication for my back pain. I finally got an appt with a pain management specialist and he told me to try Soma along with the Percocets that I take already. Efective, but causes extreme drowsiness and memory loss for me. My husband says that I do certain things while on the medication but I don't remember anything that I do while I am on it. I would recommend it for pain, but it really shouldn't be used when you are working or driving. I have actually fallen several times while I was on it due to the drowsiness and dizziness it causes. But it works so it's a toss up to what is more important to each individual's life really.

Doc gave me 350 mg of Soma...scared to take it, so I cut pill in half.  I think it worked for my neck &amp; back.  Didn't know it's addictive as others here said.  Noticed more flexibility, but also mood altering...in a bad way....didn't feel like myself...Doc wants me to take it 3x/day...too scared to do that.  Afraid to take with my vicodin...don't think you're supposed to mix it with other drugs.  Got very rapid heartbeat with it &amp; fuzzy headed feeling, but I think it helped with neck/back pain...dunno for sure, for I've only taken 1/2 pill thus far...makes me feel sluggish.

Soon after he started taking the medicine, he became dependent on them. He started to take 20 to 30 at a time, and it would get to the point where he could not move. When he would run out, his withdrawal was so bad, he would yell and scream and just turn into this monster. The last time he took somas, he ended up in ICU. He didn't die, but he almost did. Thank God his doctor is not in practice anymore. The one thing I have to say to people who get prescribed soma, please don't take it unless you have to. It made my life a living hell.

Muscle Spasm	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	45-54	7/24/2008 6:50:57 PM	Soma is definitely the most effective muscle relaxant ever prescribed for me for tension headaches due to muscle spasms of the neck. It also has a general relaxing, calming effect and helps with sleep. However, it can have unexpected side effects, especially at higher doses, such as drowsiness, feeling/acting &quot;high&quot;, etc. Also, Soma can interact with other medications used to treat tension headaches, such as Fioricet or Phrenilin -- the two should *never* be taken together! I once had a very bad reaction while on Soma, but it may have been due to dehydration. So -- a good, helpful medication, but be careful and follow all guidelines regarding dosage and drug interactions very carefully.

Muscle Spasm	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	6/27/2008 4:52:18 PM	I want to warn anyone that takes this drug to be very careful as it is terribly addictive.  However, you have to have an addictive personality to become addicted.  I began taking Soma for Fibromyalgia and thus began a long journey of addiction, going from doctor to doctor to get more Soma and ultimately legal problems that stemmed from my abuse.  Soma is probably good for short-term use, but even then, I would ask the doctor for a different muscle relaxer.  I took Soma for approximately 10 years.  I hope no one ever goes through the hell I did and ends up in drug induced stupor's which I referred to as the Soma Coma.  I have not taken Soma for several years.  I have taken other muscle relaxers, but none have the same addictive component that Soma has.

It is wonderful. I've clenched my back teeth for years due to stress, and cracked 3 as a result, so we're talking serious clenching, here! (as opposed to grinding/moving teeth around)  With SOMA (RX needed) I stopped my constant, uncontrolable clenching, and the soft buffer of the inexpensive OTC TMJ bite- guard, has given me relief I haven't had in years-I-find the $7.00 Colgate (sold at CVS) biteguard works better than the &quot;wicked&quot; expensive hard one made for me.  You heat it up in hot water, bite into it, and it takes a perfect impression of your bottom teeth.(both types $ and $$$$$$$ are worn over the bottom teeth and are impressions with a flatter top)  Biting into the gel form is so much more comfortable and doesn't transfer the constant pressure through my jaw. Makes a lot of sense, actually.  They should make soft ones for &quot;clenchers&quot;, which buffers constant, hard pressure,  and hard ones for &quot;grinders&quot; who need to be kept in place!  Hope this helps someone-I empathize!

I've had these problems for over 6 years.  This medication is the best I've ever taken.  It even helps me get sleep at night, I dont toss and turn anymore in pain all night.  The only downside to it is after I take it if I eat then it makes me drowsy.  Be careful taking it, sometimes I'd forget that I took it and take it again.  (Just a heads up)

Even with the first dose I took I immediately felt the relaxation and much less sharpness in the pain radiating across my back.  Only issue is it really causes drowsiness, but taken at night it really works a 1-2 punch.  Before the back pain limited me from getting more than an hour at a time of sleep, but this seems to really relax your whole body.

Muscle Spasm	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/25/2008 12:20:46 PM	I have been taking Soma for several years for multiple herniated discs from cervical to sacral areas of my back. Used mostly at night to calm spasms and used along with heat, tens and other meds. No narcotics. If experienceing sleepiness, take a half or a quarter of a pill and it will greatly reduce the spasms of the back you may be having. Helped me to continue on with daily activities and work full time until I developed cervical herniations and then typing was not tolerated. Flexeril was too sedative for me at anytime I tried it when prescribed before Soma and could not take it at work. Soma afforded me the ability to decrease the sleepiness effect. I was lucky to have found this med, otherwise I could not function when in the midst of a bad pain episode.

Have been on Soma since 1st used for chronic pain, etc. about 12 yrs ago. It is a miracle drug for me! I also take Baclofen for deep spasms but can see little relief from it alone. Think I would be invalid without it - seriously. My only problem is that since moving to new state, my Dr.here will not give me enough RX. I previously took 2 3xday and now get only my primary care DR RX gives me 1 3xday, so I have to take only when spasms are very bad. I am not addicted, only find I need more than when I began use. The taste is horrible, but more than worth it. I am trying to find info on max to prescribe so I can try and talk him into giving me enough to stay pain free. It's allowed me to drop the time release oxycontin and percoset and go to Lortab (don't need all the time). Hope this will help people try this drug, believe me it helps so much.

As I am bipolar I with very refractory symptoms, my psychiatrist suggested I try Soma for a month for that purpose.  I have been on it (as well as ritalin) as adjunct therapy to lamictal, cymbalta, and abilify.  It's success, in my opinion, has been remarkable.

Muscle Spasm	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	5	Male	35-44	12/8/2007 3:28:58 PM	For ease of use I gave it a 4 because the pills leave a bitter tase in your mouth.  As for addictive, not at all. I find that after I take this pill, it is impossible to stay awake.  I always fall asleep.  This means I can only take it before bed. I am not the type of person who can just fall asleep anywhere, but this medicine make me fall asleep no matter where I am or what I ma doing, so be careful.  I am not sure if it works as a muscle relaxer, because after i take it I wae up 8 hours later!  It is a good drug and works great, jsut make sure to take it at night at least the first time to see how your body reacts to it.

Unfortunately, I got a new doctor who wanted me to try a new med since, I have been on it for about a year. He gave me methacarb- something that does not help the pain and I am upset. I am now in therapy three times a week since he changed my prescription from soma to this.

Muscle Spasm	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/4/2007 10:50:18 PM	I take Soma for chronic back pain and back spasms and it is the only med that relieves my symptoms and allows me to do my regular daily activities and exercise during a bad flare-up.  I have tried multiple other muscle relaxers, and Soma has helped the most.  It also allows me to sleep through the night as it helps to prevent me from constantly waking up throughout the night due to my back pain.
