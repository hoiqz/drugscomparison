Cough	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/17/2011 10:39:37 AM	I have never been able to tolerate taking liquid cough medicines, they made me very nauseous.  Tessalon is the only drug that has helped to supress my wicked coughing, whether from asthma or a chest cold.  It does make me sleepy, which is a welcome side effect at night.

Cough	pilotmom, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/19/2011 11:51:15 AM	A chest cold gave me the worst asthma attack of my life...actually frightening. Despite asthma treatment, I kept coughing. My doctor prescribed this medicine, and it was like a miracle. I slept through the night on on dose, and have no drowsiness.  Slight bad taste in my mouth, but a small price to pay.

Cough	rupie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/28/2010 12:10:18 PM	I believe they have taken the Tessalon Pearles off the market .That is why no one prescribes them anymore.Thats what happens when you find something that works-they usually quit making it!!! I used it off and on for years.When codeine based cough meds didn't stop my cough ,the tessalon Pearles did!!

Cough	salemite, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/23/2009 9:03:00 AM	I have had all kinds of cough over the years and was prescirbed everything under the sun until one time a PA gave me Tessalon Perles and I think they are great. Who would have ever dreamed that little thing would work like a charm. The big plus is you can't taste it like other cough meds. Why don't doctors prescribe these more often? I would truly like to hear the reasons behind that. 
Cough	PeppermintPatty, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/13/2009 1:08:51 PM	I had a horrible case of bronchitis and was literally coughing my head off. Once I started taking this medicine I immediately stopped coughing. It is a drug that I've never heard of before, but certainly wish I had.  I understand it's been around for quite a while.  I highly recommend it and encourage you to ask your doctor if it is something that would work for you too.
Cough	harrie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	5/6/2009 2:08:51 PM	I'm taking several prescriptions at once, so it is difficult to pinpoint which one has worked or has side effects. But one of these items has made me quite drowsy.

Cough	beadythings, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/17/2009 7:14:04 AM	Both my husband and myself were fighting this new flu that is said to be highly antibiotic resistant...we also had a bad cough with it. I ALSO suffer fom COPD. It started to help my huband after the third dose. It started to help me almost immediately. Along with the other meds I take for the chronic bronchitis and other health problems I have, this was a VERY welcome addition as it alllowed me to cough without the heavy strain and pain on my lungs, and chest wall muscles. As a result, I was able to produce more sputum when I did cough and be able to continue with whatever I was doing, with barely any need to rest after the coughing fits I have. This was prescribed after being treated  for about 3 or so weeks previously with other medications. I am impressed with it veyr much and find its been a big help to my health regimine. 
Cough	nomad747, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	2/25/2009 11:16:53 PM	I have a cough for over 2 months now.  Sometimes I cough so hard I vomit or fall to the floor. MY Doc gave me this stuff and it hasn't worked at all for me. I even take tripple the amount subscribed (600 mg) and it doesn't work. I don't know what to do, I am so worn out from coughing.
Cough	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/22/2009 5:22:35 PM	This is the only medicine that stops my cough.  I request it with Bronchitis and bad coughs

Cough	akamst, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	11/13/2008 12:09:40 PM	the med has been in my system almost 24 hrs and not much, if anything, yet. After reading these reviews, I see it may not work for another 24 hrs. If it does it will be great, otherwise, I'm sure it's a dr's office visit - yikes!
Cough	bobbies43, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	11/5/2008 9:09:44 AM	I got this drug yesterday and it does not work. I cough just as much as I had before. I am calling the doctor today to see if I can get something else.

Cough	TNMOM, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	7/2/2008 11:19:46 AM	I must be immune to any cough medicine ever created.  I have 200mg and they've done nothing for me.  They don't make me drowsy either, which is a good thing.  But, they have not effected my cough at all.    
Cough	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/21/2008 10:16:40 AM	this medication did work but i learned to take one pill(200mg)about 3 hours before i needed it, for some reason it takes that long for me but once it worked i got the best sleep i've had in three days. i would use it again.
Cough	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	3/11/2008 12:07:33 AM	I was coughing so hard that I couldn't stop pissing my pants, underwear, furniture, etc. The codeine syrup didn't touch it.  I was down to my last pair of clothing when I begged for a prescription to be called in.  The doc on call chose the pearls and it totally saved me.  I didn't feel drugged, I still coughed some, but I was able to remain clothed.  The pants stayed dry.  Woo Hoo!  GO PEARLS!
Cough	blessedbairns, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	1/30/2008 2:24:16 PM	This was prescribed for me for an all day, sleep depriving cough associated with a viral flu infection. The cough has lessened somewhat (tessalon's purpose is to relax the muscles that cause cough spasms) but the Dr. finally decided to take me off this and suggested Mucinex to clear the remaining phlegm from my lungs and bronchia. Let the coughing begin! 
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	1/15/2008 7:21:01 AM	I asked my doctor to help me with the cough.  I was up all night coughing.  What a waste of money.  I'd rather have a nasty liquid that works.
Cough	 Male  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male		1/7/2008 8:42:43 AM	I've had a cough for 3 months and my doc prescribed this med. I take 2 pills at a time and it hasn't done a thing to reduce my cough. But then again I've never had any med including the codeine cough syrup that has ever worked for my coughs.
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/1/2008 1:24:20 AM	My Doctor has been nice enough to let me have refills to make sure i have this when I need it. It works great and without the (tiredness) you get with the codine syrups. Also works great for that post nasal drip (tickle) in the back of your throat that can drive yu crazy.That was the orginal reason that doctor gave it to me...worked like nothing else!
Cough	TexasSon, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	12/27/2007 9:39:53 AM	As a nagging cough was making its way around my building, I did my best to avoid it but it caught up to me.  I had it for 2 weeks before visiting my physician, who prescribed me tessalon.  While I thought the cough may simply run its course, it wasn't easing up a bit until after taking the tessalon for two days.  By day three, the cough was practically gone.
Cough	Pat, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/16/2007 11:50:44 AM	I was given this for bronchitis and found it to be the most effective. I have tried the cough syrup with codeine and that works great for bedtime, but the Tessalon for daytime is the greatest. My last bout with bronchitis I was given the cough syrup, but luckily I still had Tessalon in the medicine cabinet. 
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	12/15/2007 7:02:20 PM	I all the times I have been prescribed the pearls they have never worked for me. Ever. I always toss a hissy fit when my doctor writes me a Rx for it. And he always says it works for some people and not for others. Well I'm the one it doesn't work for. 
Cough	DinAZ, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/3/2007 1:48:45 PM	I have the 100mg dose as well - no drowsiness, no side effects. However, I do take them after I've eaten. My doctor said, &quot;breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner&quot; so that's what I do. They're amazing.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	45-54	11/14/2007 2:01:50 AM	This worked very well for me. It did not make me sleepy, or anything  else.
Cough	misphooey, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	11/8/2007 10:04:20 PM	drowsiness for sure, this about knocks me out and i'm only on the 100mg; but it does work for my coughs.  I went from nonstop debiliating coughs to a few coughs.
