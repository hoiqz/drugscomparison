I have been taking 5mg at night for 2 yrs. for neck pain, tension headaches, insomnia,  sore tired muscles. It makes me sleep! Lessons up the tightness in my neck and back. But ive been experiencing confusion, even getting lost in my own neighborhood, forgetful...didn't know it was coming from this drug as an effect til i read these comments! Thank you! I think I will do some homework in my homeopathic books for muscle tightness, since I have relieved a few long term problems with that and absolutely had no side effects.

I felt like I had early onset Altheimers. By the end of the very first week, I was scaring my friend, who is a medical assistent, as she has known me for quite a while and had never heard me repeat things like I was doing, My grand father had altheimers and I was so frightened that is where I was headed at such an early age. I too myself off of these myself and in th same week I understand my cousin had the very same reaction. By the way, I have only talked to my cousin as he lives in another state. We have talked weekly since we found each other. He had surgery and we didnt talk for a couple of weeks. When we did he explained to me his reaction to the same medication that I was having problems with, except he got lost in a neighborhood that he grew up in.

After one dose, I was dopey for 2 days!  I fell asleep during the day and slept as if drugged.  Felt &quot;out of it&quot; for a whole 48 hrs.  Would only take it if i felt it was absolutely necessary.  It was effective for the muscle spasm, however.

I also take Fenanyi 25mcg every 72 hrs and 4mg of Dilaudid every 6hrs for chronic shoulder pain after a shoulder replacement which alleviates the joint pain but the flexeril should alleviate the muscle pain in the muscles surrounding the muscles surrounding the shoulder blade muscles due to overcompensating, hope it works:)

This medication works in that I am able to sleep better when taking it, but I cannot take it during the day. It makes me so tired that I cannot force myself to stay awake. It dulls the pain but does not take it away completely. My doctors have suggested Skelaxin as an alternative.

At one point when my fibromyalgia was severe I was taking 8 at night! Way too many! A year later I am back to 10mg at night. If I didn't take this I would not be able to function because I do not sleep due to alpha intrusion. The worst side effect that. Experience is hair loss. It is a little better now that I am back to a low dose.

Price went up from $8.00 to $ 41.00. On Medicare and once I pay just my monthly pills cant afford it and I get just enough disability to pay part of my bills and too much to qualify for assistance. It is a rip off as this drug does not cost 41.00 for Pharmacys to make.

Ibuprofen is ineffective for me when this condition occurs. Flexeril works very well at quelling the muscle spasms. I usually experience complete relief with this medication. My only complaint is that it quite literally knocks me out or, puts me to sleep. It is a strong medicine, but quite effective.

Even with half, I still am groggy after a 12 hour sleep. It does what it needs to for getting rid of my tension headaches, but after 20 minutes, I'm slurring my words and feel as though I'm intoxicated. A powerful drug for sure

It helps my muscles relax as well as my &quot;brain&quot; which they say is a muscle too.  It shuts down all the pain receptors and finally allows the body to rest and properly get REM sleep.  This medicine has been a life saver for me at times.....

It does absolutely nothing for me, 20mg 2x/day (according to my 3 drs, the highest amount allowed per day). They keep telling me that I'm not giving it enough time.. 2 years is plenty of time and it STILL has done NOTHING at all for me. I still jerk, twitch and have sharp painful spasms. I stopped wasting my money filling the prescription.

Muscle Spasm	marieh9, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	8/23/2011 8:06:18 PM	Flexeril did make me sleep very well. I only took 5 mg at night. It helped quite a lot of muscle spasms for 3 weeks but then I sleep walked in midday and reinjured myself. After the 3 weeks it didn't give me the same muscle spasm relief but I still slept well and it got rid of my night sweats (perimenopasual). A bad side effect occured after taking it for about 9 months I got skipped heart beats , shortness of breath and fatigue. So I guess I am in the &lt;1% that got that bad side effect. I have to off of it tonight and hope the withdrawal isn't too bad. It works good for a short time I would suggest stoping at 3 weeks and starting up when you get reinjuries instead of staying on it. I have myofascial pain syndrome. But, it is too bad I can't stay on it.

Even a half of a dose at night time for me put me in such a deep sleep, that I didn't hear my alarm in the morning and slept in 2 hours longer than I should have. I do not like this medication for the simple fact that I felt as though I wasn't in control of my body! Did ease the neck pain, but for me, the med is just too strong.

I have been taking FLEXERIL for 5+years. Without it I have severe muscle cramps and spasms in my upper and lower legs. Negative - caused extremely dry mouth. Not being aware of how to take care of the dry mouth led to the loss of ALL of my teeth. Teeth had been examined 8 mo.s prior to a small cavity. When the dentist examined my teeth he found that there was not a single tooth that could be saved due to root and internal decay. Sure do not like these false teeth.Tried stopping taking flexeril for 2 days and the leg cramps, etc. was so bad that I will put up with the dry mouth and very dry skin.Wondering of possible effect on my hair. It has become extremely dry??

I have Fibromyalgia, leg pains from Superficial clots and muscle spasms under my ribs that it hurts to breath. I've been on Flexeril now for almost a year and it has been a wonder drug for me! It makes me sleepy ONLY if I'm tired. It will relax your muscles like valium but without the nausea. I also get Massage therapy which helps a LOT. You just feel relaxed. It takes about 15 min to start taking effect. No side effects outside of feeling sleepy.

I was on it for 1 year. I had to be taken off of it as it was becoming ineffective. It is not meant to be taken longer than two weeks due to an increase of muscle deterioration. So, be aware that if your condition persists for longer than two weeks you should not be taking this medicine regularly as it could make the problem worse.

It has worked most of the time very well. In reading some of these reviews people saying that it doesnt help with the pain, thats because if u have pain along with the muscle problems you need a pain killer in conjunction with the flex. Im taking it again for the spazems i have from the cancer I found out that i had last yr. Im getting relly bad spazems from the 2nd round of chemo im on right now I am also on the durigesic patch at 75mcg, and also started taking dilauded for the break thru pain. Using all 3 2gether i have found out works relly well for me, but just remember its gonna work on every1 differently. so dont get discourged. If it doesnt work just keep on your dr. for somthing does work.
Muscle Spasm	akg, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	3/26/2011 7:11:16 PM	I was prescribed this medication (10mg) for spasms in my neck, but I also have 2 bulging discs and disc degeneration in my lower back and suffer extreme tightness and stiffness as well as muscle spasms from that.  I took it for the first time last night and have felt absolutely horrible all day.  My vision was blurred for much of the morning and I have felt so drugged and hung over that despite the pain, I don't think I will ever take it again.  I can't even say that the stiffness in my neck and back was any better this morning.  Diazapam (5mg) knocks me out when I take it too, but if I make sure to take that 8 hours before I want to get up, I'm fine.  Thankfully, I listened to my pharmacist who recommended that I wait until a weekend to try the cyclobenzaprine, because I would never be able to function and take care of my two young children on this medicine had it been a week day.

Have discovered the Flexril should not be used often because it will cause more problems than ease the problem. I think it chills the muscles down to fast and this causes me other problems w/pain.

I woke up with enthusiasm, feeling refreshed, instead of having moaned with pain all night.  The third night I took it, I was drunk.  Unable to walk straight, etc.  Medical tests interrupted my use for the next few nights.  The last 2 nights I have taken it, I have woken up hungover: lethargic, unable to get my body or mind to function in less than 2 hours, no balance to speak of.  Nasty.  I'll be stopping it now and contacting my doctor for something else.  The muscle spasms have been helped by it, but my life sure hasn't.

Muscle Spasm	Wendlynn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	12/18/2010 2:10:09 AM	This medication made my pain 10 times worse. I had Anterior Cervical Diskectomy and fusion C-5 C-6 with plating. Flexeril was perscribed before surgery. I only took the medication two times and that was it I was done. I couldn't handle the extra pain it caused. After surgery my nurse brought me a Flexeril and I refused my doctor then perscribed Skelaxin 800mg 4 times a day. I was very skeptical after my experience with the Flexeril however it has been a blessing and I give this medication a high recomendation. After surgery on the spine it has helped releive some arm pain and spams in the neck and back. I will never take Flexeril again that experience was horrible.

It honestly did nothing for me. I didn't feel any relief and it gave me bad headaches (took for about 2 mos.). I switched to carisporodol (soma), and that works much better for my problem, and less headaches. It just wasn't right for me. My mom also took it, gave her severe cottonmouth, but helped the pain and spasms, however, her doc said it's a dangerous drug for the elderly! She is over 75, so that might be interesting to know or for someone out there to ask their doc about.

Only drawback...it takes around an hr.for it 2 hit u-on a empty stomach-an hr.an a half if u just ate,therefore u have to take this as soon as u feel the 1st spasms comin` on.Best used @P.M. Aside from the fact that it takes an hour or so 2 hit u(which is a good reason to have a painkiller/analgesic as an adjunct while u wait incase pain hits u),this skeletal/muscle relaxer does do the job VERY effectively.Your back will feel aces in the morning!When doing all relaxers,it is important to be in a non-ambulatory situation(ur bed is the best spot)..do`nt plan to &quot;do stuff&quot; while under the influence of Flexeril.

The addition of this drug has significantly lowered my Morphine intake and greatly increased ease of mobility. The only difficulty I've had is with drowsiness. Other than that, I am quite pleased with this drug.
Muscle Spasm	Da Bears, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Male	45-54	8/22/2010 12:33:51 AM	Pretty amazing painkiller. After just a few days on it, (10 mg 3 times a day), I'm already feeling much better. The back pain has greatly sibsided. Dry mouth isn't any fun, but I'll take it over the pain anytime. As for the drowsiness, I think I'm pretty lucky. Yes, I feel pretty mellow when taking it, but don't really feel very drowsy unless I've taken a Vicoden at the same time. (7.5/500). After about a half an hour, WHAM!!! It was the strangest sensation. I was suddenly very groggy, but not real sleepy. But I sleep like a baby evey night that I've taken it, with or without the Vicoden. I have noticed some minor hallucinations also. Generally a phone ringing, or I'll see something with my perephrial vision and when I turn my head, there's nothing there.

Other	Mel, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	8/16/2010 8:57:53 PM	I was prescribed Flexeril to help me sleep.  I find it very helpful, rather mild.  I do sleep better when I take it and I seem to have no &quot;hangover&quot; effect in the AM.  Ambien also works well for me for sleeping but I didn't like the idea of using it for an extended time.  And when I stop the Ambien (after say 5 days of taking it, sleeping in a hotel bed) I can almost be guaranteed a few bad nights sleeping. With Flexeril I don't usually have any problems when I stop for a while.  It's worked for me for this use.

I have had 4 back surgeries, including a fusion. I have been on Flexeril 5.0 and Lortab 7.5 for 4 years. The results are great! I can sleep at night with minimal spasms, and some pain. Before I couldn't sleep at all. I can only take one a day or I have to stay in bed all day. I have to take it early at night to be able to wake up. I have had ringing in the ears, dizziness, fogginess in memory, and now I am having gastrointestinal problems. I am going for an endoscopy and colonoscopy to see if there is another problem. I have had a hard time with reflux and they suspect my esophagus has narrowed. Because of Flexeril? I don't know. The benefits do outweigh the risk. It is much easier to deal with extreme pain in the daytime, if you get a reasonable nights sleep. It is hard to stay focused and finish things I have started. I am ultra sensitive to medications as I have not taken many in my life time. I keep the Lortab between 2 and 3 a day as I am deeply afraid of them.

Stupid new PA-C took me off of it. the man she trained under was great, she's young and doesn't feel any pain. I took it for a very long time. I have spine and back problems, feet problems. Doctors don't listen to patients. They think they know everything, I have been gave meds that I should have never received because they don't read charts. I don't know how they made it through school, the older doctors are more understanding.

I was on it for over 11 years, then I was on it for over 2 years, and some fresh out of school fool, takes it away after my doctor left the practice. Now the practice is canceling me as a patient,for not having a MRI, saying I was non-compliant. Who do these new PA-C's think they are? Then the India doctors think you must be dying of cancer to give one something, I hate them, they need to go back to India. They don't pay any American taxes any way!! Free ride! I want my medicine back!! I can tell you the practices not to go to!!

I started taking 1 at night, then as I got worse 2 a day, 10 mg. I have been diagnosed now with fibromylagia and flexeril increased to 10 mg. 3xday. I take other meds as well for pain but adding this dosage has helped take the edge off the severe pain on some days. Doesn't work every day, but some days I know it helps because when I have missed a dose the pain gets worse.  I have no side effects except excessive thirst. I wouldn't know if I have other side effects anyway because fibro patients have erratic sleep patterns and I haven't felt rested in 6 months. If I do miss a dose, I will wake up almost every hour when I'm sleeping and will then take a flexeril just to get a few hours of sleep straight through. No matter how much I sleep I'm still tired so I don't blame the flexeril for that. On days I take as directed 3xday 10mg, with other pain meds, I do get better pain relief about 50% of the time. For fibro patients my personal feeling is that adding Flexeril is very important as not all pain meds help fibro patients and relief of any kind is welcome even if it's a day here and there. I have considered the options of other meds geared for fibro and the side effects have made me decide to stay on my present regiment which includes the flexeril. I only wish that 30 mg in a 24 hour period helped even more. The sleepy side effects go away after a while but if you have fibro you will be tired anyway. For clarification when my dosage was increased I did sleep more and felt tired a lot more after sleeping but that goes away. Now I know on days I sleep a lot it's the fibro. I've never had an issue with nausea with this medicine.

The only thing is...I think it's effect is waring off because I am beginning to have breakthrough pain and when I have flare-ups I just take it in case stopping it would make my flare-up worse. It doesn't help me sleep anymore (ever since the first couple of times taking it) because I can keep functioning throughout the day just fine after taking it. It no longer makes me drowsy.

I am 5'10&quot;, 180 lbs but even when I was heavy (pushing 300 lbs) it had this same effect. I am very tired, just exhausted for 18-20 hours after my last dose. I can tell when that time passes because I perk right up immediately. I have had days when (after taking a second 20mg dose of the day) I will sleep 20+ hours. It (the fatigue) makes me very irritable too, making this known around my house as my &quot;cranky drug&quot;.

I was also prescibed Percoset to take w/it as needed. When my back did not seem to be really getting better after several months I had an MRI done &amp; found that I have a severely herniated disc in my lower back.  I tried the steriod injections (3 rounds total) w/no relief.  I have remained on the origninal dosage of Flexeril along w/the Percoset as needed and I have noticed if I over do it and don't take the Flexeril at night, I have alot of pain in the morning.  I haven't had to take more than 1 tablet a day in at least 8 months and I am very pleased w/the relief I get from the medication.

Other	GenerallyHealthy, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2		45-54	3/30/2009 6:45:24 PM	I experienced sudden onset low back pain at a specific point just to the right of the spine and just above the pelvis. If I put my finger on the area causing the problem, it is bone &amp; not soft tissue. The cause of the sudden onset pain was uncertain. The direct effect: I could not bend over w/o pain. Soaking in a hot tub for an hour at a time was of little benefit AND I had trouble getting out of the tub. The doc prescribed Flexeril as a two week course of treatment in conjunction with physical therapy. He said he did not &quot;think&quot; I had suffered a ruptured disc. The pills: they are great for sleep &amp; allow me to sleep through the night better than I do on my own. BUT..... I don't see them doing anything for my back. I don't have muscle spasms. I plan to finish the pills just for the sake of following medical instructions. My back is somewhat better after 7 days now with less pain but I still can't bend over easily to tie my shoe laces nor put on socks. I have to help myself stand up by holding onto another fixed object like a chair.  Walking isn't easy &amp; I walk like an old man due to the residual pain in the same spot. My pain is localized to that area and does not radiate anywhere else like down my leg.

It was the only medication I could take orally to ease the discomfort.  Without it, my pain levels would easily reach 10 and I would have to be hospitalized just to manage my pain.  I am now nine months post surgery, and still have the pain under my right rib area, but it is controlled well with flexeril, and my days are quite tolerable.

Other	Skwigelf, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	3/19/2009 6:00:56 PM	I think flexeril is the best muscle relaxant out there on the market besides Amrix. They are both the same drug its just that one is extended release (Amrix) one is not (Flexeril) Im partial to the flexeril because it gets rid of whiplash injury pain (completely)ONLY in combination with Percocet. By itself its pretty weak. It does sedate you but i enjoy the feeling. Plus it helps with other strained muscles too. The only problem I find is that I have to take 4 times a day and the amrix i take only once before bed, but it never seems to last. The Amrix wears off when i wake up and I am left with a terrible headache (from my injury), so i stick to the flexeril. Besides its a hell of a lot cheaper.

Muscle Spasm	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	1/20/2009 3:00:28 PM	I was prescribed generic flexeril 10mg for my neck muscle spasm from an accident last summer. I also suffer from years of insomnia and depression so my doctor decided I should not go on a new sleep med and use this instead, to kill two birds with one stone (I've used OTCs and anti-depressants/anti-anxiety meds before for depression and insomnia simultaneously). Right now I'm taking nothing but Flexeril to determine what combo of medications will be best. First night, I took one 10mg about 30 minutes before bed. Nothing, no drowsiness, no sleepiness. Still up all night long. Though my muscles were slightly eased, which as good. Judging from the initial night, I decided to take 3 (30mg) the next night. STILL NOTHING! No drowsiness at all, still kicking and tossing throughout the night. I expected 30mg would knock me out cold into the next day at least! I've taken 30mg each night for 4 days now and still no drowsiness or good night's sleep. I thought at first that the pharmacy gave me the wrong pills, but they were correct. So I guess I need something a bit stronger for my insomnia but will have to wait until I get this muscle problem under control. I don't want to take a million different medications again and risk not ever feeling fully &quot;here&quot; due to grogginess, amnesia, etc...Antidepressant+Sleep Med+Muscle Relaxant+Pain killers=feeling worse than before. Guess I'm waiting this one out, we'll see...

It does, however, make me drowsy so I only take when I need to and unless I want to/can go to sleep at that time. In order to function, I usually halve the pills.
Muscle Spasm	Redfox, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	1/8/2009 8:51:39 PM	Flexeril has enabled me to finally get a good nights sleep.

Previous experience with this drug told me to take it early evening.  First night I took half the dose.  I felt very loopy.  Was determined to continue using it this time with the second night and going forward not at bad. It did seems to help relax the muscle in the rhomboid and releve the pain and spasms.

Many people report heavy side effects, mine were very mild, but it did seem to reduce the tension in my back muscles, allowing me to stretch and do physical therapy easier and sooner.   In this aspect, it is a very useful drug.   Without additional physical therapy, it would be mucg less effective, but with generally mild side effects.  The important thing to remember is that this drug is a tool to help you get better, not a cure.  Be aware of the potential side effects and implore your family and friends to watch for unusual behavior if you are concerned about the side effects.

I was in agony and nothing seemed to help. Flexeril did make me very sleepy, but it relaxed the muscles enough for me to slowly get back to full movement and strength. If you are taking one and planning to go to work the next day, do not take it after 7PM or so, especially if it's the stronger dose. On that occasion I had been basically incapacitated anyway, so it didn't matter, but one later time I was having spasms I took one in the evening and the following day my legs still felt like jelly.

Chiropractor helped with both but expensive and only a start.  Went to my D.O. who prescribe Flexeril 10mg.  So far I've taken four doses, one each 8 hours I'm awake.  Pain is all gone.  Very strong mouth dryness.  Very sleepy/drowsy.  I will cut the 10mg in half and only take before bed to try to eliminate the side effect and see if I stay pain free. I tried Tylenol Arthritis, Advil, none of them worked.  Flexeril seems to be the answer.

Really helped with sleep but recently noticed multiple symptoms now that seem to be related to Flexeril. They included, tiredness, inablity to walk when first getting up in the am, Left hand then left arm falling asleep during day and recently both arms asleep as I awoke in middle of night, some blurred vision, dizziness, and hand trembles.  All of this was extremly gradual of the years and did not realize how tired and weak muscles/legs/arms had become.  Discontinued use and immediatly noticed increased engergy, much much easier to move and walk in the morning, and no problem with stairs or feeling tired or run down all the time.  Sleeping OK at night, not quite as soundly but well enough.  Hand trembles and other systems have completley stopped.

At first this medication was the only thing that would relax my muscles and help me sleep at night.  Now, three years later, I feel that the only way that I can get true relaxed sleep at night is by continuing to take this medication. It doesn't seem to have the same effectiveness as it did the first few months, but without it I get absolutely no rest.

Other	Brooke, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/15/2008 4:03:35 AM	I was first prescribed flexeril, (10mg), for pleurisy.  My symptoms were typical, (VERY painful, sharp, shooting pains in my chest/ribs, when I would breathe and/or move).  My GP called in a script for antibiotics, (for the infection), flexiril and 800mg ibuprofen.  With the very first dose of the lexiril and ibuprofen, my pain went from a &quot;10&quot; to about a &quot;3.&quot;  I was able to breathe with ease and I slept VERY well.  I have taken other muscle relaxers for ailments and they worked well, but I have found that Flexeril is the BEST by far!  Before I became accustomed to them, they would knock me out and I would sleep as long as 12-14 hours.  *To note:  I have battled depression/anxiety/panic attacks and wretched insomnia for eight years and I take meds for all of the above.  In particular, the benzodiazepines and Ambien have helped with my insomnia, but nothing has given me a more dependable, restful-night's sleep like flexeril.*  Now, I take the flexeril/ibuprofen combo for my monthly menstrual discomfort or when I am having neck or back pain.  I have found that this combination, (taken as directed, of course), has allowed me to be relatively pain free.

Flexeril has eased them - I don't get so many now. Has also been beneficial with my Fibromyalgia. Also find it helpful to take it at night to help get a good night's sleep.

I've been taking flexeril off and on and it eases the pain but never goes away. Therefore I'd recommend seeing a specialist to make the pain go away.

I was just put on this as a prelude to Lyrica in the regiment scale of things to try.  It does help me to sleep through the night, something I've not been able to do for years.  It does ease my RLS symptoms at night as well.  Fibro-fog is a daily event with my condition, so I do not notice more or less 'forgetfullness.'

I awoke irritable and irrational.  I was not alert, very sluggish, could not track my thoughts and fatigued during the day. I cut the 10 mg pill in half per my doctor and the side effects left the next time I used it.  I use 2 or 3 nights a week for severe back muscle spasms.  Works great at 5 mg and I am a large guy 6'1&quot; 270 lbs.

One day, I couldn't even turn my neck because I was in so much pain.  I previously took NSAIDS, but they didn't help much.  I took one tablet (5 mg)of Flexeril that night and I felt so good the next day (I haven't felt good in a few years).  Now I take it whenever I get a really bad lower back spasm.

My experience is that when I do hurt my back (I have had back problem since 1984) my doctor wants to see me before I can get the Flexerill. If there is record of back problems in my medical records why do I have to been seen?

Muscle Spasm	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	6/11/2008 1:45:22 PM	I took this drug and the next week after getting off of it I was in the hospital for Acquired Autoimmune Hemolitic Anemia.  The Doctor that treated me for this condition said that this is a very rare side effect from taking Flexaril.  I ended up staying in the hospital 4 days and having to have a blood tranfusion (2 units).  I was so exausted and weak that I could not walk from my bedroom to the bathroom without having to stop and rest.  Be very cautious when taking this drug, pay attention if you become weak, have dark urine and yellowing of the skin/eyes.  It was 2 months before I could go back to work part time.  Have had to continue seeing my Specialist for 2 years now.

I'm glad so many people find it to be effective, but I had dry mouth, heart palpitations, and stomach aches like crazy.  Its also closely related to tricyclic antidepressants, so if your using any sort of seratonin augmenting medications, stay away from this stuff.  It can be bad news.

For maybe the first four days the pills worked magnificently. After that, there was definitely a sudden change. Flexeril did not hit me at all. Also, the Flexeril was giving me very bad dreams. I stopped taking them within a week.

Taking this dose does not give me a hung over feeling in the morning and I get a good nights rest which makes a huge difference in my muscle spasms the next day.

Flexeril did not make me drowsy, interfere with any other medications I may take, and truthfully eased my discomfort, enabling me to again focus on finding the root of my medical issues and of course in much better shape to enjoy and care for my family and perform well in my line of work.

It also made me very drowsy and blah feeling.  It made it difficult to take care of my little ones.  If you have kids, I would suggest you find something else to take.  It made it hard for me get up and do anything.

Got a lot of symptoms including severe chronic pain, and severe muscle spasms. Flexeril helps with both the pain and the muscle spasms along w/ my other medications

The doctor suggested this medicine and after I started taking it, I have slept all the way through the night for the first time in years.

Flexeril completely prevented the uncontrollable cramps and spasms; so much so, I would stop taking the medication only to find that I had to continue to take regularly for nearly 2 years while my nerve healed. During the last year, I only needed 10mg per day just before going to sleep to control the cramps that came just as I went to sleep. Very excellent medication, did not cause any drowsiness or other side effects.

Muscle Spasm	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/28/2007 12:55:11 AM	I've been taking Flexeril daily for several years. I always take one before bed and only take the other two allowed during the day if my fibro and TMJ pain is really bad. It has helped curb my flareups, allows me to get the sleep I need, and is wonderful!
