Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	25-34	11/10/2010 10:31:10 AM	From weeks 1-7, I had no problem.  But, at 8-12 weeks this prenatal was an absolute nightmare. Still at 18weeks I am having trouble. I have to agree the after taste is yuckie.  Also, I have severe GERD, be very careful that you do not take this on an aboslute empty stomach.

The aftertaste is awful for the this brand name drug but I have since switched to the generic name of &quot;docosavit&quot; and the generic version has a sweet coating to it and no aftertaste of &quot;fish&quot;. This is great especially in the early months of pregnancy when your smell and tastes are hightened! Greatfull for the generic version!

My son is 7 months old and everyone tells me how alert he is and how aware he is of his surrondings.  As of this week, i think i'm pregnant so i had my pharmacy order a new prescription of Tandem DHA for me.  I love this prenatal Vitamin.

When I was pregnant with my first my doctor put me on several other prenatals that made me very sick.  This one not only doesn't make me sick, but I have a lot more energy and my skin, hair, and nails all look great.  My hair has grown very fast and actually looks thicker!  I hope everyone else has the luck I have had.

They are easy to take and have all important DHA which is important for fetal brain development.  I also usually take them before bedtime, but have taken them in the morning without any problems.  These are by far the most tolerable prenatals I've ever taken.  Definitely start taking them once you consider trying to become pregnant!!!
Pregnancy	Lynz, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/10/2009 3:18:27 PM	I tried several different prenatal vitamins during this first part of my pregnancy and these are by far the best! I have not noticed a bit of fish tatse or smell after use. I also take all prenatal vitamins at night. This one was the easiest to swallow, no taste or smell, and they do wonders for your hair and nails. Hope you all have the luck I have had with these!

Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	12/5/2008 9:26:16 AM	I like the level of DHA and EPA, but if I would have known the fish burps would accompany this medication, I'm not sure I would have taken. I have a sensitive gag reflex, especially now that I'm pregnant.

Other	Hopeful!, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	10/14/2008 12:10:33 PM	I just began taking this prenatal vitamin recently, as my hubby and I are beginning to plan a family.  I was encouraged to take it before bed, as I have had numerous difficulty with taking vitamins of any sort in the past.  So far, so good.  I have to say I am suprised . . . thankful, but suprised.  :-)  And , in response to the other comments on here about the fishy taste/smell . . . I don't experience it when I'm awake, that's for sure.  :-)  Blessings to you all!
Other	EvasMommy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/3/2008 3:12:48 PM	I have had both good and horrible days with this vitamin.  I have discovered that you truly need to have a completely empty stomach to not get those disgusting fishy burps.  They are so bad for me if I have anything at all in my stomach, but if I'm totally empty and haven't eaten for a few hours, it's fine with NO side effects.  I can't believe it can be so horrible with food in your stomach and just fine with an empty stomach.  I recommend to anyone to truly take it between meals, more toward your next meal than your last one and if you're like me you should have no problem.

It has been a great experience. Regina, AL 
Pregnancy	Macy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/30/2008 3:38:11 AM	This is the easiest prenatal vitamin that I have ever taken. My previous experiences with Prenatal vitamins were really bad so I was reluctant to try this one when my MD ordered it for me....needless to say....I am really happy that I tried it, I have had no side effects and no belching up that nasty vitamin/fishy taste which was my experience previously. I love it....and the added bonus is that my nails and hair are growing stronger and faster.
Pregnancy		5	5	4			5/19/2008 3:19:58 PM	I used to take fish oil pills for teh Omega 3 fatty aids, plus a prenatal so i am glad that i found one that has it all. i still get fish burps after i take it, but i take it right before bed so i dont deal with the breath or burps anymore. very easy to swallow. i would recommend this vitamin. 
Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	4/8/2008 10:29:30 AM	This was the easiest prenatal to take.  I do not notice any fishy smell or taste, and to only take it once a day makes it so easy to remember.  I tried five different vitamins and found this one to be the best.

Pregnancy	inquisitive, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	3	Female	19-24	2/29/2008 4:11:04 PM	please do understand that this pill might be one of the best out there. its just something fishy about it, literally. the fist day i took i notice a very distinct taste within 5min. after consumption. the next day the same think and it made my stomach turn. the pill really does taste like fish not fried, grilled. fresh out the ocean smell and taste. my doc gave me about 5 different types of prenatals to test out to see which one i prefer these were the second batch. well i have one more dose and trust, it will be crossed of the list for good. yuk fishy
Pregnancy		5	5	5			1/31/2008 10:24:39 AM	Before Tandem DHA I couldn't find a small enough once-daily vitamin, and was pleasently suprised with how small it was! It was much easier to take than the other single doses, and I didn't have any nasty fish breath the others gave me.  I love it!
