At one point, I had an extreme pain in my gastrointestinal system, so bad I had to go to ER. When in ER, then gave me a 25MG/1cc shot, and my pain just disappeared. Morphine is definitely the gold standard painkiller for a reason.

I had told the doctor before that a mophine pump made me hallucinate and was assured that I would not be given this.  My wife stayed with me in the hospital and asked the nurse what she had just injected into my IV and it was Morphine.  My wife went to the nurses station with her power or attorney and told them not to give it to me again.  She went into the restroom for less than 3 minutes and said she walked out and the nurse was injecting it into my IV.  Again she went to the nurse and a supervisor and told them she would have me transferred to another hospital or I would leave AMA if they did not remove the IV and use Oral Loratab (which had worked from a previous surgery).  My wife took the power of attorney again to the nurse and a supervisor attorney and made them the IV immediately.  As soon as the medication wore off (a horrible time) I was put of oral loratab and everything was fine.  This medication (as my wife later told me, made me mean and irrational).  I left the hospital the next day and I was scheduled to stay 3 days.  At home I took the liquid loratab and I was fine.

Pain	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	55-64	4/8/2009 10:41:58 PM	I went to an emergency room for a severe headache. I found out my blood pressure was high and my heart was beating to fast. Iwas given an IV needle in my hand. The nurse then gave me a heavy dosage of Morphine and than nitroglycerin pills for chest pain I was having. I immediately became real naseated and at that time I had was coming to. I had 6 doctors around me. My blood pressure dropped down. They were trying to get it back up(my BP). Iwas also sweating so bad. I guess the nurse shouldn't have mixed the 2 together. C7907@aol.com

Pain	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	5	Male	19-24	2/24/2008 1:25:10 PM	Overall morphine helped my pain quite a bit. And although you may hear it is unlikly to develope an addiction to this, in reality it is very easy. If you are about to be put on injecting morphine be very very careful, and do not increase your dose or use it more frequently without consulting your doctor. If you feel your starting to get more and more dependant, have someone regulate it for you. As far as relieving pain for the first hour or so it works great, but after 2 hours it begins to wear off very quickly, therefore could result in wanting more for your pain. Just work with your doctor until you get the right doseage down.
