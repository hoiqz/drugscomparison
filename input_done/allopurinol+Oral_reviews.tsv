My son develope a mild case of Steven Johnson Syndrome. I would not recommend Allopurinol to anyone, it should be taken off the market.
Gout	miracle cure, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	6/11/2012 4:16:54 PM	This is a miracle cure. Before I was diagnosed my uncontrolled gout was misery - I could barely function. It took about 1 year for the drug to fully take effect. However I'm three years in now with my gout completely controlled and my uric acid is normal. Stick with it - the crystals had a lifetime to build up so it takes a while for the joints to clear themselves. You may have some flare ups during that time.

Gout	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	5/2/2012 8:35:03 PM	I have been using Allopurinol for about 4 years and find very few episodes of gout flare-ups since taking.  I have been told I could reduce the amount being taken by half but within a couple of days found gout activity had picked up significantly and the corresponding pain pushed me back to the full two pills per day I normally take.  I have had gout for about 20 years and this is the closest thing to full relief that I can ever remember.

Gout	rcwheel, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		4/26/2012 6:28:45 PM	I have had gout since my early 30s (now 76).I suffered from a gout attack when I went off allipurinol (1975); went back on -- never left it!  Cut back from 300 mg to 150 mg, but current physician (2010) suggested to go back to 300 mg and cut back on HCT from 25mg daily to 12.5 mg daily and now on 12.5 mg MWF each week. Aetna (Harvard Medical School) suggest I should annually have my PTH,Calcium, and Phosphorus tested?  What are those tests? Min/Max levels?

Dr. built me up -- 100 mg at first, I had an attack, then 200 mg, had another attack..then 300 mg.  No more attacks.  No side effects.  And it's very inexpensive!  It's like a miracle drug.

The cramps go away shortly, but they are severe when they occur.  I will stop taking the med to determine if the cramps subside.  The only other meds I'm on is lisinopril, and prilosec.
Gout	Murman, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/20/2011 9:53:33 PM	I see a few negative reviews for this medication.  I think that the posters of the negative reviews do not understand that this drug is administered to prevent uric acid build up and prevent FUTURE acute gout attacks.  If you are already having an acute attack this medication will be administered after the acute attack has occurred and been treated with an NSAID or similar medication that treats the swelling/Pain and lowers the high uric acid causing your current attack.  If allopurinol is administered during an acute gout attack it can cause the attack to get worse before getting better.  Hence using an NSAID or similar drug during an acute attack. This is a long term drug that your doctor will prescribe based on the frequency/severeness of your acute attacks.  It should be taken until your Dr. tells you to take something as a replacement.  DO NOT stop taking this medication just because you have not had an attack for a while.  The reason you have not had an attack is the Allopurinol.Make sure to have your blood tested yearly at your Yearly Physical exam for Uric Acid, Kidney, Liver Function, and whatever else your Dr. wants to check so he can adjust the dose and make sure you do not have any other underlying problems.I have tried adjusting diet instead of taking allopurinol but both times I have been in bed for a week looking at my swollen aching foot/feet wondering why I would try and eliminate Beer, Red Wine, Red Meat, Shellfish, and all the other great tasting food/beverages instead of just taking allopurinol once a day for the rest of my life.Hope this helps.

Doctor said it was gout due to high uric acid in the blood 11.6mg/dL (3.5-8.5mg/dL normal).  I started taking Allopurinol 2/11/2011 checked it again in 7/1/2011 uric acid level had droped to 4.6mg/dL.  Still slight swelling in elbow.  I will ask the Dr. to drain at next visit.  Allopruniol did lower uric acid levels.  One (1) pill once a day 300mg.  I think it does affect ED.  Stop taking it and in a day or two ED disappears.

I have annual check ups with blood taken to assure there are no problems with my liver. I eat anything I want and enjoy my scotch and beer without any side effects.

At the time, my Euric acid level was above 9. After taking the med daily for a year, my Euric acid level was down around 6. I hadn't had a gout attack for more than a year until recently and I've had 2 within the last couple months. I thought after the first one, it was caused by eating crab meat but my blood was tested for allergies to seafood and found negative. I did have a few beers a couple of days before the attack and had a few beers before this last attack. So, it would appear drinking beer is what is triggering my attacks. So, although the med reduces my chances of getting an attack, it hasn't eliminated them completely.

It was HELL the first 6 months as I was having attack after attack as uric acid needles dissolved and broke apart. Gradually the flair ups became less server and less frequent. If you asked me what I thought of that drug at that time, Id not have wished it on any one. But I have not had a serious flair up in over 10 years. I was tempted to go off this med during the work out phase. Im glad now that I did not. It has been a real life saver.

That was over 20 years ago and I haven't missed a dose since and I haven't had another bout with gout. I'm afraid to stop taking it because of the fear of gout recurring. Gout is the worse thing I've ever had to deal with especially when it went to my knees...I cried like a baby and there was nothing the doctor could do! This is one drug I'll take forever I suppose.

Started with 100mg daily, raised dose to 300mg over first ten months. Could not eat any type of meat other than occasional chicken, asparagus, cauliflower, beans, peanut butter. Finally increased dose to 600mg daily and finally pain free. Can eat normally and walk without pain in toes and feet. Pain in elbows also gone. Could not walk last year at this time, finally at high enough dose to keep me pain free. No issues with medication so far.

Moderate pain in thumb joint and minor pain in the big toes which comes and goes but no full attack.

Blood pressure went dangerously low and I am still on Medrol and Benadryl to treat the reaction. It is slowly moving out my hands and feet but it has left what my Dr. is calling 3rd degree type burns all over my body and I am peeling but still lobster red. I understand that not many people are allergic to this drug but if you start getting nauseated or get a rash that starts out small please seek the advice of your healthcare advisor. I let mine go too long and almost died.

Gout	Meech, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/13/2008 6:00:15 PM	6 years ago, I was having about 1 gout attack a month in my feet and ankles, which would last for up to 2 weeks. The attacks were so bad I would end up on the floor in tears. I've broken many bones and had sprains due to my athletic lifestyle. The gout pain is/was by far was the most painful of anything I've experienced. I started on 100 mg of Allopurinol for 2 months, but the attacks still came. My doctor bumped it up to 300 mg and then about 6 weeks later, I realized my feet and fingers felt great. I have not had a SINGLE attack since. I do, on occasion, feel the beginnings of an attack from time to time. But if I drink a lot of water, about 32 oz in one hour, the pain would slowly go away. That is BY FAR better than a full-blown attack like I used to have. I take the meds religiously during lunch everyday and rarely forget. After experincing the pain I did, I wouldn't dare forget! This drug works great, I think the only real negative side effects I've had is nausea if I take it on an empty stomach or with little food, and a small headache if I don't drink enough water. Water consumption is very important when taking Allopurinol. Luckily for me, I love the taste of water. My advice for those just starting the meds, be patient and drink water constantly. Doesn't have to be a lot of water each time, just enough to wet your whistle each time. There will come the day when you will suddenly say, &quot;Hey! I haven't had an attack since ...&quot; Good luck!

I would at one time stop taking only to have the gout flare up again.  Daily usage has stopped gout flare up

I have been on 300mg of allopurinol once a day ever since and have not had any major flare ups ever since.  Now, I recently had surgery again on the same knee for a different problem and there was no sign of the gout!

Uric Acid Kidney Stones	Meme Kelley,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		3/2/2008 4:17:00 PM	Honestly can't evaluate this med now. Just started this medication on my 6yr old grandson for possible kidney stones on Sat. morning and now on Sunday he is violently throwing up. He has also taking another new medicine but that one was started on Thurs. and now this reaction. Now being the second day on this med has me worried and called his doc and stopped till I find out what's causing this. This is his third time throwing up in the last two hours. I don't know yet if it is this medication causing this reaction. He takes alot of other meds too. A visit to the ER is looking like a good option right now.

I have been on the drug for over 10 years now and have only had one gout attack in that time, which my doctor said was partially caused by excess Vitamin C I was drinking at the time.

My fingers and wrists hurt so badly that I could not use my hands to push myself up.If I did get up, I could not put any pressure on my large toe on either foot.The uric acid crystals were so large in my fingers that the joints looked like they were stuffed with bean bag filler.

Gout	Martimus, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	45-54	10/8/2007 6:47:53 PM	So far so good.  Another comment indicated that Allopurinol was taken off the market.  I do not believe this to be correct!  I received by Allopurinol subscription at least a week after this individual made this comment.
