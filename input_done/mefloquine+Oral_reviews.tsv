Falciparum Malaria Resistant to the Medication Chloroquine	Ammavila, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	9/29/2012 1:06:06 PM	I took Lariam during two different trips to Africa, a month-long trip and a three month trip a year later. I suffered from hallucinations, vivid dreams, and nightmares during which I sat bolt upright in my bed, screamed at the top of my lungs, yet didn't wake up. (My friends witnessed this, lucky them.) I had seizures. I physically attacked a friend who said she didn't have a light for my cigarette. (I was convinced that she was lying). I became so angry that my mind went red, I couldn't think, and I jumped her. I had to be pulled off her. I was in a manic state, couldn't sleep, grandiose thoughts, talking all the time.15 years later, and I still talk in my sleep and have night terrors. I wouldn't wish this drug on my worst enemy. If I had to take it again I fully believe that I would wind up killing myself or someone else. This drug is an instrument of torture. No wonder they use it on prisoners at Guantanamo Bay!

In the fourth week I start to complian from numbness in both hands. I also had an episode of one day flu like symptoms. In the six week I had strange dreams, like I'm watching cartoons. The numbness increased so that one night I jumped from my bed and start screaming, I was hallucinating. It ssems that the drug accumulate in my body. It has many serious drug-drug interactions that the patient should be informed about.

Prevention of Falciparum Malaria that is Resistant to Chloroquine	Anti-mefloquin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	11/30/2009 12:24:10 PM	I post this as a warning to anyone with any history of depression or other mental health issues.  I took this drug as a malaria preventative when I went abroad last year.  Mefloquin literally spun me into a mania that required extensive hospitalization abroad and upon my return for psychiatric issues.  I was hallucinating, couldn't sleep, had racing thoughts, tons of energy, was extremely emotional and out of my head.  Horrifying in every respect.  I missed two months of work.  I now know that I will never again take a quinolone-class antibiotic and have it listed as a drug allergy.

Was on it for almost 3 months. First 3 - 4 weeks I experienced vivid but not overly troubleing dreams.  By 4th week I became very agressive and had difficulty sleeping.  After two months began to experience anxiety and paranoia (thought co workers were &quot;out to get me&quot;). At 9 weeks I experienced &quot;night terrors&quot; the night I took my dose.  Anxiety became worse and I started to feel alternating anger and depression.  The day of my last dose I felt like I was shot with methadrine for the entire day. I finally realized the symptoms were worst on days I took this medicine. I did not realize how badly this drug was effecting my disposition and behavior. After the last dose I sought out medical treatment and was switched to doxycycline and given ambien to aid in sleeping over the next week.  Have people around you who are aware of possible side effects if you are using this medication.

I started with Doxycycline. Doxycycline make me vomit after 5 days of continous use no matter if I took it with food, after meals or on a empty stomach.But!!!   I had strange dreams, and suffered from depression and mania.  I will take it again but also have mild anti-depressents to go along with it.  It worked well with little or no side effects when taken with remeron and effexor.
Preventive Treatment of Vivax Malaria	19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4		19-24	9/15/2008 5:46:37 AM	I have been fortunate enough not to have any side effects during the 11 weeks I took this pill...well besides the first week when I had extreme nausea (from taking the pill on an empty stomach). I did not have any of the dreams or any other side effect. Where I went in Uganda Malaria has been very prevalent and I was bitten by mosquitos a lot of times but I never got sick from malaria. My experience was positive
Preventive Treatment of Vivax Malaria	usmale, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	1/27/2008 5:55:15 PM	After taking the second dose of this drug I noticed that I was having an irregular heart beat when I was resting or going to sleep, as you really notice things like that at that time. My daughter is a nurse so I contacted her and she advised me to stop the drug, which I have done. Needless to say I will not take this grug again! What is troubling is that the 1/2 life of this drug is 2 to 4 weeks, so I can look forward to a &quot;jumpy&quot; heart beat for some time!
Preventive Treatment of Vivax Malaria		4	3	1			12/30/2007 8:05:08 PM	I had to take this drug to prevent malaria.  The first couple of weeks taking it was fine.  I did not feel any symptoms or side effects.  The last 2 weeks of treatment, I was plagued with feelings of anxiety and irritability.  I stopped taking the medication.  After I got home from my trip, I suffered panic attacks and anxiety for months.  I will never take this medication again.  Needless to say, I didn't get malaria, but there are other medications that you can take to prevent malaria.
