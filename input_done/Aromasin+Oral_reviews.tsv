Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer After Adjuvant Tamoxifen	Mts.Mac, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	65-74	9/2/2012 1:12:23 AM	After almost 5 years on Aromasin (after mascetomy, 6 chemos and 30 radiations) and many side effects that have left me with permanent foot pain, a knee blowout, significant hair loss, weight gain, joint pain,bone loss, skin problems etc. I am sorry to report I have a reocurrence in my other breast.  No sense in preserving the breast tissue on this side since I am afraid of another issue down the line so I will be having another mascetomy. I am very disppointed but resigned to the surgery.  I am 72 years old now and got through the worst of the temporary side effects and thought it was worth dealing with the rest in lieu of cancer.  So the damage to my body has been done and I don't think stopping the drug will result in any significant &quot;bouncing back&quot; but I'm hoping to feel a little better.  I stopped taking it today!!  I do believe that it is probably a worthwhile treatment and I wish it had worked for me.

No lymph node affected. Had mastectomy of left breast. I was originally on Arimidex for 12 months and felt absolutely horrible. Switched to Armosasin and am able to tolerate it better but still have soreness in my knees. It's better than Arimidex but I'd rather not have to take anything.

I had been on Arimidex and could not tolerate it. I am having trouble with the Aromasin also. Cannot think, depressed, extreme hot flashes. I am 61 and had stage 1 breast cancer, not in my lympnoids, I am wondering if I should even take this medication.  I feel so much better without it. Just not sure!

I am on Aromacin for 2 yrs now and I have so many &quot;power surges&quot; during the night I can't sleep.  I have so much pain in my joints and my bones.  I had arthritis before I started this med, but now it is alot worse.  I am afraid of not taking the medication because I don't want the Cancer to come back.  I want to thank all the women who have written about their experience with this drug...I thought I was going nuts.  I walk and try to do the same things all my friends do even if I am in pain.  I refuse to let this bring me down.

My oncologist switched me from Tamoxifin because I could hardly walk after being stationary for 30 minutes or longer. Aromisin side effects aren't as severe. I work out three days a week and walk 30 -60 minutes per day. It seems to help the joint pain, sleeplessness and weight gain, but the stiffness remains. Recently I developed a burning in one knee and a sharp pain in the other foot. It feels as if my achilles tendon could snap if pulled in the wrong direction! My knee feels as if something has torn and has begun unravelling? Has anyone experienced damaged tendons or ligaments? My Dr. thinks this is unrelated, but my trainer is a BC survivor and she has had major issues with her knee and achilles tendon (surgery) after being on these drugs. I'm not a die-hard bodybuilder, just a mom wanting to feel well enough to keep up with my kids!

It came back Stage 4 approximately 6 months out of treatment.  I have been on every bc drug for ER+ cancer.  Now, I am on Aromasin.  I've been on it for almost 2 years now &amp; have terrible side effects.  I'm 37 &amp; walk like a 70 year old due to severe foot &amp; leg pain (in addition to neuropathy from chemo &amp; arthritis that has gotten worse with chemo &amp; Aromasin).  I have a foggy brain -- memory is cloudy &amp; concentration is difficult.  Hot flashes are always happening, however, this is a good thing because the drug is doing it's job.  Insomnia from time to time, I use Melatonin for it.  Nausea from the drug makes eating difficult, however, I've put on 80 pounds in 2 years from this drug.  I'm mentally sound &amp; overall happy, physically miserable, but I'm alive &amp; blessed!

I thought the effects were from every 3 week infusion of Herceptin but Dr office thinks is from Aromasin. Have been advised to take ibuprofen and Osteo Biflex. Hope it helps. I am supposed to go back to work soon when short term disability ends. May not be possible but I hate all the paperwork for disability. Yes depression lurks in the dark of night and sometimes in the light of day. First hormone drug tried gave headaches, chemo brain does not let me remember what I was on. Will keep fighting and will WIN! Never give up, no matter what!

Had a dose of sinus infection, sore throat, worse coughing just before Christmas.  Chose to let my immunity fight it off instead of antibiotics.  Took 3-4 weeks to get over it, but I did it on my own.  (would have went to the dr. had I really needed to). Still have the cough.  Tried arimidix first-made my hands, feet and face swell.  Satified with aromasin except for cough.  Really, don't want to switch to something else.  Keep taking your meds!

Never taking tamoxifen, was prescribed Femara for 2 months and then switched over to Aromasin following the chemo and radiation therapies.It has been 6 months since taking Femara and Aromasin. First experienced severe back and knee pains then had hand surgery for my Carpel Tunnel syndrome and now the pains has extended to all bones and joints, mostly in my hands and wrists. Memory loss and attention deficit is getting obvious. Hot flashes and insomnia is concerned. Without having daily walk and exercise and Melatonin Plus for sleep support, I would be miserable with all the side effects from the drugs. I have been on Alendronate sodium (Fosamax)for 4 months used to prevent from Osteoporosis, was wondering it has made it worse.

I switched to aromasin and have found it easier to tolerate if I take meds for the side effects. I take ambien to sleep, percocet for pain, wellbutrin for depression.  It's either treat the side effects or i have a 70% chance of cancer recourrence.  I will give it six months because sometimes the side effects do get better and I don't want to die at age 63. But there does come a point when quality of life wins out==however short it may be.

I was 61 yrs old when I had my mastectomy.    My oncologist placed me on Femara in 01/07/2011.  I suffered so much side affects (as he warned me abt) such as joint/muscle aches and pain, poor memory, severe hot flashes, depression/anxiety, cried frequently,  walked and moved around like an feebled 80 yrs old.  No weight gain but lowers my HBP from previous 130-140 down to 90's-101.   I can only functon in the morning hours by mid-afternoon I have to reclined for the rest of the day/night til next morning again.  I complained and my oncologist removed me from Femara 04/1/1011 thru 04/30/2011.  My dr. prescribed Aromasin beginning 05/01/2011 and I am still on it.  All the above side affects disappeared  2 weeks after I got off Femara. I started my walking regime of 45 minutes 4-5 days/wk and felt much better with much energy 60 days after taking it.  However, after 60 days (7/5/11-present), I am experiencing now severe cramps (charlie horse) from my upper thighs down to my toes that paralyzed me for a minute (or it appears that long).  This is occuring sometimes 3 times at night.  During its legs down to my toes.  I noticed though that this occurs whenever I am on my feet for more than 1 hr and sometimes I am on feet from 3-8 hrs daily.  I live in Hawaii (Big Island) and my husb and I own a coffee farm/landscaping nursery that since I am feeling much energy tried doing physical activities.  Now as of today (08/10/11), I will no longer spend more than 1 hr on my feet to see if this severe cramps will stop.  Is anyone out there experiencing leg/body cramps?  Your response will be greatly appreciated.  Aloha!

I don't plan on going off it, unless my onocologist says I have to.  I do not want to get cancer again.  I have had no problems, except lately I do have some knee and hip pain.  But I am going to be sixty, and I know lots of 60+ plus women who have aches and pains and are not on aromasin.  We all have to do weight bearing exercises.  I have not done them for about two months.  I realize I have to get on track and start doing these exercises again.  I golf twice - three times a week and I walk.  I am a twice breast cancer survivor and a few aches and pains is far worth not getting cancer again, as I am going to be a grandma.  I did not gain weight but my memory is not the greatest.  Once again is that the drug or my age???  Hang in there everyone, as the drug is keeping us alive.  Get out and exercise, eat properly and get the sleep you require.  I do take melatolin at night.  It is not a drug.

Right breast  mastectomy. No Chemo. My oncologist started me on Femara 2.5. I took it for one month when my thoughts became very foggy. I was depressed &amp; had a lot of foot pain &amp; HOT FLASHES! Now I'm on Aromasin for 5 1/2 months. I'm meds for my depression &amp; I'm having new health issues with my thyroid. The hot flashes are worst now. Blood pressure is low @ times. I've lost 20 pounds.  These medications don't for me. It's getting even more sick.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	6/17/2011 2:13:34 PM	Stage 111 BC, double mastectomy/lymph nodes removed. Chemo for 6 monthe before surgery and for another 5 months after surgery. After the chemo started on the aromatase inhibitors.  Was told it would be for 5 years minimum.  Femara caused joint pain, nausea staph infections and suicidal thoughts. Stopped for 2 weeks and restarted. The side effects were worse.  Quit.  Switched to Aromasin and struggled for 11 months. My life was hell: hot flushes that were causing me to black out, insomnia, brain fog, nausea, joint pain and muscle stiffness, blood pressure issues and severe eye issues. Quit for 1 month.  By week 3 off of the drug the difference in how I felt was astonishing.  I have restarted Aromasin but take it every 2 days.  Better than not takeing it at all.  My Oncologist is horrified.   Now I can get out of a chair, work full time, walk the dog and clean my house. I will take my chances of a reoccourance in order to have a higher quality of life!

I have constant headaches, ringing ears, diahrea, blurred vision, anxiety, slight swelling in my throat, clogged sinuses, swelling ankles, joint pain, you name it I've got it.  I'm 61 and don't want to spend the rest of my life like this.  My husband is 15 yrs younger than me and doesn't understand why I don't want to continue the med.  My memory is gone too.  I think quality is better than quantity.

Was on Femara first (Jan to April 2009) and did terribly.  I was already taking Prozac antidepressant /anxiety to help cope.  Then Oncologist had me go off Femara to clear out my system and I felt so so much better during that off 5-6 week period that I didn't want to go back on anything.  But oncologist insisted I try the Aromasin.  Basically all the same problem/side effects came back, (except for the heel pain) the fatigue, aching, (particularly arms), back and shoulder pain, headaches, practically daily when waking up a.m., along with that brain fatigue /fog. and extreme effort just to concentrate on any tasks, also waking up all during night.   I will be on the Aromasin 2 years this June 2011 when I see oncologist and I don't know if I can put up with taking Aromasin for another 3 years plus.  I'm torn between taking it to keep the cancer from coming back or taking my chances and stop Aromasin and just continue taking my vitamins supplements (Centrum Silver Multi, Caltate Calcium plus D formula with minerals, Omega Fish oil capsule, Glucosamine Condroitin Complex (seems to help knees, feet).As information the patents just expired in 4/2011 for Aromasin brand also Femara with generic versions now being dispensed unless your doctor fights for you inforcing do not substitute.  Who knows what additional side effects problems generics might give despite that we are told they are the same.  Also copay for the brand went up from $90 to $200 for same quantity.

Left with very bad foot pain, knees are shot, stiffness, weight gain, hair loss, and add stomach pain from calc. supplments.  3 years into it and I can't walk down steps normally (I have to sidestep one foot at a time).  Age now 70 (cancer age 67).  Dr. says I should stay on about 7 years due to tumor size but each   patient will be evaluated individually.  He  says it is very effective and while he does not want me to be a balding, fat, cancer-free cripple, he does encourage me to stay with it.  I'm trying!  Now diagnosed with pre-diabetes.  Anybody else finding this to be so?

I now have severe joint aches.(knees,elbows, wrists, shoulders)  If I sit for any length of time my ankles and feet ache so much it is hard to get moving.  I hate this drug.  My Oncologist will not let me change. I also have monthly bladder infections due to the pooling of the drug in my urinary tract.  My MD has now placed me on a small dose antibiotic to assist with that issue.  I hate taking drugs to begin with.  Is this really a necessary deterrant?

I had lumpectomy or radiation option,but had bilateral mastectomies (negative nodes)at my request,instead. I guess if I don't feel any worse, which is bad enough, I'll try to ride out the aromasin. 
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer After Adjuvant Tamoxifen	RuthDV, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	2/25/2011 1:25:14 AM	Diagnosed with stage 1 bilateral BC (estrogen receptor positive), April 2010 (Lobular AND ductal carcinoma.) Double Mastectomy, reconstruction, hysterectomy ... all last year. Onc. put me on Tamoxifen in June ... TERRIBLE side-effects including severe depression. Tried Femara in the fall, but same side-effects. Switched to Aromasin in Dec., so am going on my 3rd month now. Side effects have been milder until now, but I am starting to have terrible problems with hand/finger numbness. Joint pain isn't as severe as with other drugs, but is still bad enough, so I wonder if I can take this for 5 years. Weight-gain and hot-flashes are terrible too, and I suddenly developed heel-bone-spurs shortly after starting all this medication ... my feet still hurt so badly, I can't walk without pain, so naturally, I have gained a lot of weight. But my biggest question is:  Will the damage done to my joints due to this medication be permanent, even after the 5 years are over with? If so, I can't afford that risk. I'm a fine artist, and fear the total loss of feeling in my hands someday, as well as finger joints that no longer function! There was NO CANCER in my lymph-nodes and my tumors were small ... so why do I even need this? My Mom is a 19-yr. BC survivor now (stage 1, single mastectomy), and never had ANY of this medication! (Also ... how do you respond to others' comments on here, and can other people respond to my comment?? I can't figure out how to do that ... so I question whether or not there is even a way to get answers from others.) I really am trying to hang in there ... but I'm only 50, and feel 90. My frequent comment to others is &quot;they take the cancer out of you ... and remove body parts ... and then they try to KILL you with the medication!&quot; I'm usually a very positive, happy person ... but this is ruining my life, and my outlook.

I just don`t want to feel like that, because it is really hard for me.  I am due back at my oncologist dr. in early Feb. for more blood work so I will see what he says for me then.  I am staying off till I see him. I did have to have Chemo, just 6 weeks of radiation, alongwith the breast surgery, there wasnt any cancer in the lymps, or tumors anywhere. But I just cant take these anticancer pills, the side affects are dreadfull for me. Thanks for listening. Bonnie

Hoping that when i see the Doctor she will change the medication. My resricted movement is spoiling my life.

Did not associate these side effects with the Aromasin, but now I will talk to my oncologist about them.  But I only have another few months to go, have been on tamoxifen, arimidex and couldn't tolerate any of them as well as I did the aromasin. My 5 yrs. will be up in Feb. 2011. I do hope all the side effects will become less severe than they have been.  But I am just thankful to be here today.  The Lord has helped me to overcome.

Lumpectomies, chemo and radiation. Twelve years later...it's back. In 2009 double mastectomy w/tram flap reconstruction. On Femara for one year, terrible muscle and joint pain. Switched to Aromasin and after 6 months have severe knee pain, at times I can't walk. Terrible hot flashes and sweating also a problem, now I realize the &quot;brain fog&quot; is a possible side effect! I stopped taking it yesterday and the knee pain is already better. I will see my oncologist in a month, I truly think I want to go the all natural way. No more drugs....I want to feel good and enjoy life at 55.

Took Tamoxafin for 1 year then switched to Aromocin after moving and new Drs. 1 year later developed Dequervanes Tenocinitis in both wrists after struggling to figure out what it was. Had successful surgery for both wrists. Some trouble sleeping but no other major complaints.I have some concerns about taking with osteopenia but my Oncol wants me to stay on for 5 years minimum. I have just a few more months to go! One strange symtom I don't believe is related but wanted to ask - I have lost my sense of smell. Has that happened to anyone else?

I have suffered  memory loss, brain fog, painful joints  knees. It is intolerable . I'd rather take my &quot;chances&quot; drug free than go on like this. I have quit for 2 weeks now feel 1000% better. These comments are very helpful. 
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer After Adjuvant Tamoxifen	Tina Marie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	45-54	8/3/2010 11:05:47 AM	Dx- Stage 1, DCIS, ER/PR+, premenopausal Tx- Mastectomy, Sentinal node biopsy, TRAM Flap reconstruction in Feb, 2006. Started on Tamoxifin with hellish hot flashes/night sweats, took for one year with drug holidays. Had ovaries removed Jan,2007 started Aromasin in the fall. Oncologist prescribed Aromasin first because I have pre-existing chronic pain condition and Aromasin has lower pain profile.  Hot flashes not as bad as when on Tamoxifen and are controlled with Gabepentin and diet- very little refined sugars, no alcohol.  I can tell when I drink a sugared soft drink, especially soda, have hot flashes within less than an hour. Increase in pain is troublesome and interferes greatly with quality of life.  But my oncologist, physiatrist and primary care provider are working together to help control the pain with medication. I do my part by pushing myself to stay active - walking, water aerobics, Wii Sports, or any non-weightbearing exercise as well as mind-body work. The exercise is so, so important.  Helps me feel like I have at least some control over my condition and side effects of treatment. It is giving me the chance to try to stick out the entire 5 years on the Aromasin.

Had lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy (nodes neg. for cancer)followed by 31 rx's w/radiation. Took Femara for 6 hellish months, told my Oncologist that it was sucking out the quality of my life; and she had me come off it for about 5 wks to clear it out of my system. I was given the choice of not taking anything (which I thought was a huge risk) or filling the prescription she gave me for Aromasin, which I eventually did. During the time i took no drugs, I did feel much improved; but it may have been more psychological, rather than physical. Now after being on Aromasin for 2 months, all the familiar symptoms have returned, including swollen joint in my R.big toe which my GP diagnosed as Gout...NOT! When the bloodwork results came in my uric acid level was well w/in normal range. After 2 1/2 wks. all the imflammation and swelling went away and I can walk normal again. I'm not sure what to do from here, I hate that the drugs seem to hasten the aging process, along with all the other symptoms many of you have already mentioned; but I am not considering going down that surgery/radiation road again and want to do all I can to prevent cancer reoccuring. BTW, I have found 5-HTP helpful in holding off depression. It is a natural mood elevator that boosts seratonin levels and can be found in most healthfood stores. I am also on a good vit/min regimen that does much to strengthen my immune system. There really is much one can do beside relying heavily on just the prescribed drugs.

He said the meds do not cure or keep the cancer from returning if you are going to get a re-occurance it only slows the progress of it. I have quit taking the meds and I feel so much better and decided if the cancer returns I will deal with it then but for now I am feeling great, the pain and fatigue, etc has gone away so am very pleased.  I decided feeling good and enjoying my family now is worth the chance. The Dr agreed with me.

Because I had 1 positive lymphnode my oncologist put me on tamoxofen for 5 yrs, then aromasin.  It has been 10 yrs &amp; they still have me on the aromasin.  One the one hand, I'm afraid to stop for fear I will have a recurrence, but on the other hand, I have all the symptoms I am reading about from others on the drug: terrible trouble sleeping, extreme lethargy, such pain in my shoulders it wakes me when I turn over in the night, swollen joints in some of my toes so that I can't wear a lot of my shoes, brain in a fog and depression.  I was beating myself up and thinking I must be crazy before I read these posts!  Is the joint pain due to cartilege being destroyed by the drug? Why don't they tell you any of this when they prescribe the drug?!  The last thing any bc survivor needs is to feel like she is imagining all these problems!!!

Joint pain, fatigue,flu like symptoms, bone pain.  Doc. allowed me to stop taking the drug, as he wanted to see if it was the aromasin, or just my own body.  After I stopped taking...Miracle!  Two months now and no pain.  However, I don't think he'll (doc) will set me free from these estroblock drugs.  At least now I know it's the drug and not my own body failing me.

I was on Femara for 3 mos. and had terrible muscle/joint pain, especially feet, legs, and back.  Then I took Aromasin for 3 mos. having all the same symptoms, plus more hair loss.  Now I'm on Tamoxifen, aching isn't as bad, but still no more hair and you can see my scalp.  I've been on it 2 mos.  So far, Tamoxifen is the better choice for me.  I wouldn't want to go back on Femara or Aromasin again!!

Reoccurance of BaCa 4/2009 followed by more chemo. Now in remission and on aromasin. Still in pain. Taking viccodin during the day and duladid at night. Mega doses of B-6 worked first time around, but not this time. Can only imagine what all the pain killers are doing to my liver and kidneys. Constant joint pain, numb hands and toes, sometimes it feels like I have a broken bone on the top of my foot and can hardly walk, on and on and tired. Headaches! What can I take to feel like me again?

I had so much joint pain, I thought I was 90 years old.  Oncologist put me on Aromasin.  Within 3 months I had the same joint pain.  I started experimenting taking the drug every other day.  Taking it this way allowed me to function with little to no joint pain.  My Oncologist didn't like the idea, but after running some tests to determine that my hormone levels were where he wanted them, I have continued for 5 years taking it every other day.  I have some numbness in my fingers especially on very hot humid days, or very cold days.  I too have experienced the depression, but since taking a Super B-Complex vitamin and 4000 IU's of vitamin D every day, we seem to have gotten that under control.  I've also experienced the hot flashes, but have managed to get them under control by limiting the amount of sugar in my diet.  If I eat a bunch of sugary things like cake and cookies etc. I know to expect the hot flashes.  If I eat healthy foods, I do not experience hot flashes.  My struggle with this drug is a total lack of sexual desire.  This has put a huge strain on my marriage.

They seem to have calm down a little. My feet has been giving me so much trouble I can't even hardly walk at times. And now I am beginning to have really bad knee problems. I hope all this don't last the hole 5 years but I am very thankful for still having life! Surgery and radation was bad and hope I will never have to experience it again. This medicine is rough but with the help of God I will be able to manage the pain and hurt.

At first I was on Arimidex.  Joint pain, hot flashes, night sweats made my life miserable.  I did not take anything for 3 weeks(life was wonderful) then was put on Aromasin.  I have been on this drug since July of 2008.  At first the joint pain was bad, but has seemed to level off somewhat the last few months.  I try to walk every day or every other day and keep busy.  I would love to be able to wear my rings again and be able to walk normal after sitting for a while.  Also the night sweats are annoying.  All in all not a good experience taking these drugs,  but they do seem to be working so far.  Stick with it if you can!!

I still have some joint pain, thinning hair, sweating, sleeplessness, some forgetfulness and I am tired. On the positive side, I am alive, I have strong faith in God,  in relatively good health, go to work daily with a smile on my face.

Unfortunately, my oncologist found that I am one of the 10% of women who do not metabolize tamoxifen, so it is ineffective (this is a relatively new test, but all women taking tamoxifen should ask their doctor about it!!).  I took arrimidex for five months and in addition to hot flashes I experienced severe aching in my joints and limbs.  I switched to aromasin, and after ten months, the stiffness in my joints forced me to stop that, too.  If I sat for 1/2 hour watching TV, my hips got so stiff I would hobble around for 15 minutes afterwards.  I did yoga 2x a week which helped a little, but I was too stiff and tired to do more strenuous exercise.  I also developed 3 trigger fingers which I believe was related to fluid retention caused by the drug, and a marked decrease in bone density.  My cholestoral went up so that I now am on Lipitor.  My doctor felt I was so stressed from the side effects it was better to take nothing.  (The constipation goes without saying when you're on this many meds, and I was already depressed &amp; on effexor before cancer so I can't blame that on the drugs.(

I have tollerated the side effects as long as I can.  I am 54 years old and feel like I am 80.  The fatigue, joint pain,brain fog,depression,sleeplessness have notdiminished like my oncologist said it probably would.  I also have a new problem that I am certain is related to taking aromasin. I am developing hard lumps on the joins of most of my fingers.  Has anyone else had this happen and if so would appreciate your input on that.

I have very bad leg pain and also knee joint pain which is partly due to arthritis.  I do have a question however.  The doctor has put me on 2000 mg of Calcium, 400mg of Magnesium and 1000mg of Vitamin D.  I wonder whether this also is contributing to the pain. Any ideas?

But also created many new ones. Joint pain is sometimes unbearable, however the alternative is worse.  I do exercise regularly and it helps.  Got 1 and 1/2 year to go........I will survice

Had a lot of joint pain in my hands and feet.  Also had trigger finger in my thumb.  I talked to my oncologist and he switched me to Aromasin.  I've been on it one month.  My hands and feet are better and my trigger finger is going away.  However, I got the flu during the changeover period and I am so tired I don't even comb my hair.  I can't function with this fatigue and my family doesn't understand how tired I am.  I don't know if I can do this....

Came off drug for one month, much to family and medical professionals objections, now back on - to save my life? Consultant suggested I try rose hip capsules to help with pain, only started on them a week ago and back on my drug today.  He also suggested accupuncture, I have booked in at the penny Brohn Cancer Care centre nr Bristol for 4 sessions in Dec. Can I put up with this for another 3 and half years!! Still going to the gym nearly every day, if I stop for too long my body ceases up!  Difficult for friends and family to understand how I feel as I look ok and going to the gym.  Life is a nightmare. Watch comedy videos, go to gym, meditate, yoga, tai chi, go to bed early, I live on my own and its mighty hard. Wake in morning and think oh no not another day to get through. Normally, I am a very positive person, full of beans and very happy.  I will maybe live for another 40 years so I am hoping that I can stick with this drug.  Any body any ideas how to help?  If I benefit from the rose hip/accupuncture I will let you know. Best of luck to you all x

I switched to Aromasin which has given me just about all the side effects to one degree or another.  The onco nurse twice told me that the more side effects one has, the better the drug is working, but she had no hard facts for it.  I find that difficult to believe or understand, especially when I found 2 opposite studies on the internet (and, of course, the internet is always factual!).  Nevertheless, I hate this drug because it makes me feel like &quot;you-know-what&quot;.  I have to talk myself through each day.  My arthritis has been nicely controlled for 15 years, and now, suddenly, I had extreme knee pain and I now have no more cartilege which equals 2 knee replacements. The Radiology onco said it was due to chemo--maybe like a little PacMan eating up all the cartilege?  I don't know, but strange that everything went down hill just after I started the Femara. Altogether I have been on the aromatase inhibitors for just over 6 months.  My concern is the long-term effects on my body, particularly what it is doing to my adrenal glands.

My Oncologist prepared me for these side effects.  I was placed on Femara first and had an allergic reaction, that included itching all over, rash and hives that resolved when Femara was discontinued.  I have only been on the Aromasin slightly over a month.  First 2-3 weeks I felt tired but the other side effects did not occur until the end of 3rd and 4th week. I suspect that is when the medication was becoming effective in decreasing the amount of estrogen the body makes and helps to slow or reverse the growth of these breast cancers.Obviously, I am hoping that as time goes on I will not continue to have as many hot flashes, not sweat as much, etc. Only time will tell. 5 years seems a long time to have the severity and frequency of the side effects.  I continue to work full time but the enjoyment from my work has certainly dipped while experiencing these side effects.

I had some joint pains but they were manageable. I have short term memmory loss which is very disconcerting. I have a well balanced healthy diet and excercise. I am 72 years old, not overweight and have a positive attitude. I receive yearly infusions of Reclast to prevent bone loss, a side effect of aromatase inhibitors. The result this year showed a 10% increase in my spine.I suffred from mild depression and am on 50mg of Zoloft which seems to help. At this point my quality of life is not effectet so much as to discontinue the medication.

Have not had a problem with weight gain or depression, so overall, I've been lucky with this. As I was at risk for osteoporosis before taking it &amp; a dexascan a year after beginning it showed more bone loss, I've been taking Fosamax with good results.

At 42 had double mastectomy and refused any chemo. At 46 had breast ca with mets to both lungs.  Started with arimidix for 18 months and switched to aromasin because of joint pain.  had a lot of hot flashes as well.  I have been on aromasin for about 6 months and have been in complete remission since starting the arimidix.  I have increased facial hair growth that is getting worse and is very upsetting.  I do deal with depression but do have other family problems that contribute to my overall condition.  I was so scared when diagnosed with lung ca I thought that was it for me.  So both these meds along with lupron depot every three months have saved me.  My kids still have a mother and my husband with many health issues of his own still has a wife. My mother still has a daughter... Its still scary but I ll take the good and the bad with these meds.  I still have much to do.

Had chemo, surgury, chemo, and radiation.  Went on Tamoxifin for 1 year, than switched to Aromasin. Was originally given 60% chance of reoccurance.  It is going on 5 years on Aromasin and no reoccurance.  Side affects, sweats, weight gain, sleep issues, and blood pressure changes.  I am more than willing to deal with the side affects if it keeps the cancer from reoccuring.  I will continue taking it until my doctor decides otherwise.  Hope my comments help someone to deal with the side affects.

Nothing intolerable, but annoying if I could actually feel better not taking it.  The thought of going thru BC treatment again isn't appealing, so am biting the bullet so to speak.

It had it's side effects, so I asked to switch to Aromasin.  I started it in Dec. 2008 and have been on it since.  I am 48 yrs. old and feel 90!My side affects: I have gained 25 lbs., loss of energy to do any exercising. I am constantly tired (sleepness nights).  My joints ache, particularly the feet, wrists and elbows, knees, too. I am trying to stay on this for 2 yrs. Everyday, though, I try to decide, &quot;quality of life&quot; or &quot;take this for 5 yrs. and feel miserable.??&quot; I keep trying to do all my &quot;normal&quot; activites...trying to walk, play tennis, biking, etc., but it hurts.  I am taking some 200 mg. of Motrin to help with the pain.  I guess I have to be thankful I'm alive.

I wonder if it means the drug is working? Only been three months and I am miserable and very sad to even complain. Afterall it is supposed to help me, right? I know it is not like Chemotherapy, and am grateful not to have had that treatment..but how can I exercise when I can barely get up and walk? Five years of having a fever and aches and pains from that little pill? I sure hope it works.

Went onto Aromasin and am at 5 years on it after 5 years on Tamoxiphen.  No reoccurance of Lobular Cancer so I feel lucky. Plenty of aches and pains of joints, depression but Chemo of Taxol had much worse side effects.  To keep the cancer away, you can make it.  For sweats, Effexor works.  I took it with Tamoxiphen.  I had cancer at age 58 and am now 69.  Ten years is well worth the aches and pains.  Exercise regularly and that helps.  Taking Naproxen also for arthritis. The Brain fog isn't as bad on Aromasin and its hard to say if it is the medicine or just aging. People without cancer have memory loss at 69 also I find. If my feet (which are numb from the Taxol) were better and I had better balance, I could do fine.  When I go off the Aromasin in May, we will see what happens.  Good luck to all. Everyone who &quot;stays&quot; on the medicine clears the way for improvements.

I began having very bad headaches like migraines but they would not respond to any medications including my migraine medication.  After 3 months I stopped and started on the Aromasin.  After only 3 doses of this I started having the really bad headaches again so my doctor told me to stop this also.  Now they are trying to decide what to try me on next.  Five years is just too long to deal with the really bad headaches.

Took Tamoxifen for 2 years, and Aromasin for the past 4 years.  Have experienced stiff joints, weak wrists, hand swelling, lethargy, depression, vision blurryness and most troubling--memory loss and general &quot;brain fog&quot;.  It has affected my ability to do my job, and my family quit expecting me to remember anything a long time ago!  I've thought all this time that it was a side effect of the chemo, but now I know there is hope that I can feel better after reading all these comments.  Wish I had found this web site sooner.  Saw my Oncologist yesterday, and plan to stop Aromasin right away.  I don't see the value of living longer, if I'm in a fog for the rest of my life.  Thanks for your comments!

I have had two mastectomies, 6 rounds of CAT, 3 rounds of FUMEP (Mitomycin C, Cisplatin, CF/5-FU and VP-16), 7 weeks of radiation and 12 weeks of Herceptin/Navelbine.  I have been taking Aromasin for over 5 years with no major problems.  I do suffer from tinnitus (ringing and fullness in ears), but my minere's disease causes these sumptoms also.  These symptoms could be related to the Aromasin tablets also.  I just can't be sure  without halting the Aromasin----which I do not plan to do.  My oncologist is allowing his patients to stay on the Aromasin longer than the  5 years.  The test results only span the 5 year period----so I guess there is a risk of the unknown in continuing.  I also think there is a risk of the unknown in halting----I have been cancer free for years and don't want to change anything at this point. Good luck to each of you survivors-----my prayers are with you.

For the first 4 months the side effects were minimal.  However I am now in the 10th month and have joint pain, weak wrist, depression, lethargic, no energy not even to do my exercise that I have always enjoyed.  The biggest problem for me though is my blood pressure has gone up and I can't seem to get it under control.  I have had to change my blood pressure medication twice and nothing is working for me.  I am 67 years old and seriously thinking about stopping the medication and just taking my chances.  I can't see myself living like this for the rest of my life....there is no joy anymore.

Thank you all for your reviews.  I cried because I know your pain.  Extreme joint pain.  Now I understand the depression.  Still cancer free though.  I've always had weight issues.

Doc changed me to Aromasin, which seemed more tolerable, but after six weeks I had joint pain, fatigue, weight gain and then exploded in a horrible lumpy, itchy rash of a drug reaction.  It will take three weeks to flush that out of my system and I don't want to even think what a &quot;next trial&quot; pill might do, so I think I will just take my risks and try to have some quality of life while I can.

I took it for six weeks.  Could not tolerate side effects and was almost in a week chair.Then went on Femara.  Four months later same side effects but worse.  Just took longer to get there.Have been on aromasin since August, 2007.  Fairly tolerable but have gained weight with mild hot flashes or power surges.  Recently I have been starting to have problems with my vision getting blurry.  This past weekend, my left eye is far more blurry and my left eyelid is drooping.  No other symptoms of problems.  I do know that aromasin has a steriod base and also has a warning on the label.  None of the other AIs have that warning.  I also have become more depressed and more tearful in the past month.  I also started a blood pressure medication this past month also and wonder if this could be an interaction problem with the two meds.
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer After Adjuvant Tamoxifen	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	7/9/2008 11:03:34 PM	After 2 1/2 years on Tamoxifen, I have been on Aromasin for 3 years with plans to stay on a full five.  I have a definite weight gain but after the misery of hot flashes, etc. with Tamoxifen, this is great.  I too have fatigue at times and some joint discomfort, but I am alive to feel it and  that is the bottom line for me. 
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer After Adjuvant Tamoxifen	dsmith, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	6/26/2008 2:51:18 PM	Has it worked? Yes, no recurrance; is it easy to use? Yes, one little pill a day; overall satisfaction? dissapointing. I am at the end of the 5 yr therapy, and have endured pain and fatigue the entire time. The past 6 months have revealed now that I have some severe short-term memory loss (to the point of forgetting that my daughter-in-law was pregnant!), confusion, and I've been wondering if the Effexor is even working. Will see a neurologist to see if progression can be stopped. Congrats to all the survivors out there, and thanks for sharing - I wasn't aware of the many serious side effects and literally thought I might be going crazy. My oncologist has taken me off it immediately, since in my case, the side effects DON'T outweigh the risks!

With Arimidex I had horrible hot flashes almost constantly and bad joint pain and stiffness with weight gain.  On Aromasin the hot flashes are fewer and the joint pain and stiffness is not as severe.

I do not know if it has been effective or not, I have no signs of a recurrence.  What I have developed in the last 6 months is severe depression, which has not been helped by medications.  Also am experiencing severe anxiety and hot flashes that are more frequent than while taking Tamoxifen.  Depression has been treated with Wellbutrin with Cymbalta, then Wellbutrin 200 mg twice a day with some anxiety meds also.  Nothing is stopping me from crying every day.  My oncologist just shakes her head, like this is all normal.  I tend to disagree as I was always an upbeat person before this.  I can't imagine why it is so much worse in the past 6 months.

Joint pain was localized in both ankles.  The pain did not restrict my work-outs, but certainly added to my discomfort.  I then moved to Arimidex.  The joint pain is now in my wrists and appreciably reduced in my feet and ankles.

I was also pregnant.  After chemo, I was placed on Tamoxifen.  After one year of Tamoxifen I still had no side effects.  With no menopausal side effects my doctor felt that it may not be working for me so he suggested I have my ovaries removed.  I have now been on Aromasin for about 2 months.  I do not seem to have any side effects from it.  I have some hot flashes but they are very mild.  I hope that things continue this well.
