Recurrent Infection caused by Herpes Simplex Virus	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	8/6/2012 10:36:51 AM	Horrible drug. Immediatly gave me the worst depression . Was taking it 3x a day 500 mg each, and towards the last few hours of each dose, it gave me extreme anxiety and adrenalin rushes. Will not take this drug again. did not help me one bit. :o(
Shingles	cheryl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	7/11/2012 9:45:40 PM	Second time of having shingles.  First time, didn't know what I had, so shingles had progressed pretty far.  This time.  I knew that itching, sharp needle feeling, and down right pain.  So I decided to go see my doctor asap.  I definitely believe early treatment is the answer.  I did notice frequent urination, and my bp seemed to elevate.  However, it certainly helped with the spread, blisters, and keeping them from totally coming out.  It did make me sleepy though.  Also used benadryl as a topical ointment.  Oxycodone helped with pain, but could only tolerate at night, due to basically knocking me out. 
Shingles	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	1/24/2012 6:11:57 PM	I had shingles on my neck, head, and ear. Took this and it stopped me from getting any new ones. One side effect. Maybe it was shingles, BUT this medicine made me really tired at 500 mg three times a day. Though at night, wide awake.

Genital Herpes	thinman, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	5	Male	65-74	9/19/2011 9:05:54 AM	I have had this genital herpes since the 70s. Occational outbreak every 4-5 years until I turned 65. I take 250mg doses I soon I notice the tingling associated with an outbreak. Very effective. Also take when I am sick or during high stress periods.

Cold Sore	ColdSoreCarl, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	1/2/2011 8:35:22 PM	I have been taking Famciclovir for over 3 years for cold sores.  I get them when I get stressed.  When I know or feel stress is coming, I take Famciclovir and I do not get any signs of cold sores.  When I do start to get a cold sore bump, redness, and tingling, taking Famciclovir really stops it all very quickly.  I do get a rapid heartbeat for about 2 hours upon taking 1200mg (three doses) all at once.  My doctor takes it as well for cold sores and his recommendation is to just take the 1500 mg, be aware of the rapid heart beat occuring, and get it done.Famciclovir has made a tremendous difference in my life and I very highly recommend it.
Cold Sore	missladybug, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	12/10/2010 11:46:11 PM	I woke up on Tuesday with just a bump on my lip, by Tuesday night major swelling and leision, by Thursday I was still swollen and my lip was horrible looking so I called the doctor and this is what they gave me 1500mg in one dose...withing hour I could feel and slightly see some healing it was amazing. The medicine did give me a rapid heart beat that I was not to fond of and made me tired but after a nap the rapid heart beat was gone and the swelling was decreasing. It's Friday and much difference but still a little swollen and scabbed and Ive had tingling all day like a new set of cold sores in the same area but they dont seem to be swelling but healing I think.
Cold Sore	merin75, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	12/6/2010 3:43:09 PM	Everytime I take this I get a pounding, skipping heart beat for about 30 minutes, and I feel weak. It does seem to help with cold sores if I take it right away.
Genital Herpes	333, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	10/20/2010 8:08:38 PM	After a week of my first outbreak, my doctors told me they have never seen a case this intense because I had a yeast infection and a urinary tract infection at the beginning of the outbreak. After about 3 days of taking this medication, my sores were at the worst of the outbreak. From there on out, the sores slowly started to disappear. My very first outbreak ended about a week after I started taking this. It worked rapidly on me and I would recommend this to anyone.
Herpes Simplex Infection of Skin and Mucous Membranes	headachenotgone, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	9/14/2010 9:59:35 AM	My Dermatologist perscribed this Medicine after an outbreak on my forehead appeared and not shingles but herpes from a kiss on forehead.  Worked fine the first time I had the outbreak. I have been taking on and off for 3 weeks now and still redness and tenderness in area.  On a dosage of 4pills 2 every 12 hrs.  My main concern is I have had a massive headache for 3 weeks now that just won't let up at all.

I have noticed a noticeable difference in urination since starting this medication. it has me a bit concerned. The itching has subsided somewhat. However, the rash has continued to spread. I still have 5 more days in this prescription, we'll see what happens.

I didn't have any noticeable side effects at all.

Cold Sore	ClosetLiberal, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	11/12/2009 9:57:11 PM	I have suffered from many severe outbreaks for over twenty years.  Doc perscribed this 1500mg at first sign of pending outbreak (itch, swelling...  you get to know when it is about to start...) and it is a freakin' miracle!  Only thing is doc had to write the perscript different than what he actually told me so the %^&amp;*!@ insurance would cover it.  God I hope we can do SOMETHING about health care in the US in my life time!
Cold Sore	gagirlnhawaii@hawaii.rr.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	10/22/2009 9:46:02 PM	My daughter was given this medication at urgent care because she got sun poisoning on her lips and blistered up.  After a few days of taking it, she began to have panic attacks and was in a total state of confusion.  Luckliy she was not taking the pills every 8 hours.  Instead she was taking it only two times a day at most.  I came here and read the side effects and instantly took her off the meds. I would never think an antibiotic would have such horrible side effects.
Shingles	LN, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/26/2009 5:20:28 PM	I woke up in the mid of the night with intense soreness in my upper left gum area and my upper left lip was extreme sensitive even a gentle breeze could send tingling and burning sensation.  At first I thought this might be casued by my hay fever.  On the third day I went to the ER for extreme pain and a visible track of redness from my upper lip towards to the side of the nose and then to my cheek and then to my temple. I found out I had shingles on my facial nerves. I was given this antiviral medication and pills for pain. I found taking the antiviral did help to stop the spread, minimized the blisters sizes and numbers.  It also helped in controlling the pain and cut down the time of infection.  After completing the 7 days course, my scabs were all heal up well without scarring.  In controlling the pain, ice pack had worked wonder for me, much better than the strong pain medication that was given to me.Drawing from my own experience seeing the doctor on the first sign of shingles and take the antiviral medication did cut short the time of infection and control the pain.  
Genital Herpes	bernie, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	8/22/2009 2:12:59 PM	I have had genital herpes for 30 years. This product works for me.

Shingles	don't know it, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	55-64	8/4/2009 10:01:01 PM	Not ever having had a shingles outbreak before, I didn't know how long it would take the drug to work.  I thought 5 days was much too long... guess that was due to the overall misery of the disease.  Sudden sharp (and deep) pain, severe stinging, some burning, and lots of itching.  I was crying for relief.  Thankfully, the doctor also put me on Prednisone and Vicodin.  These definitely helped.  To prevent a recurrence, I'm getting the Zostavax shot.  
Shingles	IRENE, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	65-74	8/1/2009 5:32:23 PM	I TOOK THIS DRUG FOR A FEW DAYS BUT HAD TO STOP BECAUSE IT CAUSED A RAPID HEART BEAT, I ALSO FELT WEAK.
Cold Sore	DGumm@aol.com, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	6/13/2009 12:51:01 AM	I had been taking Valtrex for years and found it very effective if taken immediately when I felt the &quot;tingle sensation&quot; in my lip.  However, I changed doctors and he prescribed Famciclovir.  Although skeptical, I was very pleased with the results. My lesions had already started to form and did crack open so I used the topical Abreva as well.  Usually once they form and crack it's automatically ten days before lesions are gone again.  I could tell a huge difference in 48 hours after taking Famciclovir.  The burning and pain disappeared and you could really see the lesions healing more quickly.  The full blown lesions were gone in five days.
Shingles	Giz, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	4/14/2009 2:30:12 PM	Once again, I take this for my Shingles.  It seems to be working better in conjunction with the hydroxyzine and prednisone.  I havent had to take any Lortab at this point.  I think I caught the onset before he had a chance to take over.  Maybe this will be my magic cocktail.  For those of you that have suffered through out the years maybe this cocktail will help you out also. But you have to catch it before the physical symptoms flair up.

Shingles	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	3	Female	25-34	2/22/2009 10:51:51 AM	I have shingles in my ear and was put on this medication along with a pain pill.  It has made me tremendously sick.  After 3 days of being sick, I was reading more on it, and people with glactose or glacose-galactose absorbtion problems should not use.  I am lactose intolerant and it has severly effected me.  I was never asked if I had these issues by the doctor or the pharmacist.

That in turn allowed a mild form of herpes virus to be active so my oncologist precribed Famciclovir. The only problem is that it is VERY EXPENSIVE. $165 for one week supply.

Shingles	kaylamay, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	1	Female	45-54	11/8/2007 8:57:25 PM	My husband took this medicine and is now in the hospital with Pancreatitis, which I belive is directly related to taking this medicine. It may have helped with the Shingles, but the side effects are definitely not worth it.
