My neurologist has also used it as a monthly pulse to prevent relapses which has also been effective. I'm am currently recovering from a relapse and used a 3 day treatment of 1000 mg of Solu-Medrol which seems to have quickly brought my symptoms under control. Because of frequent relapses - 3 in the past 6 months my neurologist has recommended using pulses of SM monthly along with Rebif to try to prevent the relapses.
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	Pate, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	65-74	5/10/2012 10:19:25 PM	I received an injection in my pulmonary doctors office.  I have COPD and had caught a cold.  I was very congested and wheezing.  After a treatment with Atrovent and Albuterol by nebulization, I was still in a bit of distress.  The iv injection helped a lot. I was able to go home and take care of myself rather than to the hospital.  
Multiple Sclerosis	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	1/12/2012 4:20:21 PM	I avoid this medication at all costs.  The only reason I will take it is if I risk being on my back for several weeks.  I have too many of the side effects and the medicine doesn't seem to work so well for me.  I understand people think this is a great medicine, but for me it has only been a disappointment.
Multiple Sclerosis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	12/14/2011 2:25:48 PM	Very effective.  I did experience side effects such as high blood pressure and high glucose levels.  But overall I would use it again.

Multiple Sclerosis	steammachinist@yahoo.com,  Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	5	Male		10/2/2011 10:42:23 PM	I am male 63 yrs. old. first dx'd at 60. was told it was r&amp;r. Stanford Med Center (2nd opinion) said 90%+ is prog. when dx'd. in later yrs.There are no meds. for prog. MS. I found a nes nuro and am very pleased. asfar as the drug is concerned it appears to make things a little better, not hard to deal with and I don't have bad reactions to it. just lucky. the solu-med. is more of a exprement, it seemed to have a postive effect the first time 3 yrs. ago. so no harm trying now. the only thing I can say with any certainty is that this is very powerful stuff follow your doctors orders to the letter and notify them of ANY adverse reactions.I know that living with MS can/is a bitch.I am lucky my caregiver is the best! Ythis may be more important than anything else.All in all if no adverse recations in the past it may not hurt to try again, especially with progressive.Good luck and best wishes. the ONLY thing we can do is fight it all the way to the end. atleast that is my plan!! 
Asthma	Gollygoober, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	45-54	5/10/2011 6:03:26 PM	Ever since my son died in Oct 2010, i have been having anxiety attacks along with extreme asthma attacks.  I have been to the hospital 6 times in the last six months for about 2 weeks at a time.  The whole time I have been on Solu-medrol IV for most of that time.  When not on IV, I was on prednisone.  The side effects have been tremors in my body and terrible stomach pain.  i am agitated and i feel terrible.  I am depressed and think i am losing my mind.  I lost my job, my son was killed in an accident and i am in the process of losing my house.  Is there something i can do to get this medicine out of my body?

They believe it does help maintain the MS as a proflactic course and I totally agree.  IT HAS WORKED FOR ME FOR YEARS NOW.
Inflammation of Skin and Muscles All Over the Body	Kev, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	4	Male	25-34	5/26/2010 9:53:50 PM	About 5 months ago i was diagnosed with polymyositis which an inflammatory disease of the muscles.  I causes your CPK or muscles enzyme levels to bee extremely high, which makes your muscles all over your body ache and hurt so bad and have no energy.  I had a muscle biopsy on left biceps to confirm it, over the next 2 1/2 month span i was given 10 IV treatments of Medrol at 1000mg each.  The first 4 treatments went fairly easy the next 6 was extremely painful.  I started to have memory lose ( i have blank spots in the months of feb and march), extreme change in mood like anger and depression.  Would become so fatigued everyday chores were so hard, had extreme trouble sleeping.  But now have been off of it for almost 2 months and all the misery was well worth it.  My muscles are beginning to recover and become strong again.  I beg that anyone who has any of these problems please check with your Dr and have them check ur CPK levels and if the are extremely high, go to a neurologist and have them perform a EMG test for that which can the be diagnosed and start treatment.  I say all of this because i went through all this for over 9 months before it was finely figured out and by then i had lost 45 lbs and was in so much pain.  If anyone has anything simular or sounds like this please email me at kevsample@hotmail.com and i would love to give details of symptoms to look for.  I would respond to ever email cause i am that serious about what i went through and would love to help anyone lessen what i had to go through.  Im also diagnosed with anklyosing spondylitis and just started Simponi so wish me luck
Other	ham3559, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	5/20/2010 9:16:34 PM	I have lupus and the treatment has brought me out of a near comotose state.  My pain was so unbearable that my husband had to help me in and out of bed.  I have had my third of three treatments today and am 80% better so none of the side effects are that troubling to me.  The 80% effect lasts for about 4 days and them a retreat to about 50% positive.  I am very worried that the effects will not last.  I drive 9 hours to Atlanta for treatment and am really afraid to go back home.  Does anyone know how long the treatment could last?  Are there any Lupus patients out there that have had long term results?  By the way, I have taken oral prednisone for 20 years and can no longer take it.Overall this, so far, has pulled me out of a horrible situation.

Multiple Sclerosis	snlnmartinez, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	3/10/2010 10:30:38 PM	I have had this treatment seven (7) times in ten (10) years and it does help with the relapses. It's worth the four (4) days of I.V.'s for eighteen (18) months of somewhat normalcy. Would I reccommened this to others with MS, YES I would. The side effeccts change with each dose but are manageable and worth the the down time.
Other	cloflin, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	13-18	12/11/2009 11:53:06 PM	I was given a 50mg Nubain injection with along with a 25mg Phenergan injection on 12/08/09 for a migraine that I have had for three weeks, this medication did nothing, but casue me to be a little drowsy.I went back on 12/10/09 for another treatment this time I was given a 50mg Nubain injection, a 25mg Phenergan ijection, and a 1000mg dose of Solu-Medrol thru an IV. The second treatment did nothing, but cause me to have a dry mouth, it caused my mouth to taste like pure metal, it also caused my face and chest to be flushed, and it caused me to be a little drowsy. I went back today (12/11/09) for the third treatment, this time I was given a 50mg Nubain ijection, a 50mg Phenergan injection, and a 1000mg dose of Solu-Medrol thru an IV, this time the medication caused me to be drowsy, it did not take the pain away, but caused me to have a dry mouth, it caused my mouth to taste like pure metal, it also caused my face and chest to be flushed, and it caused me to be a little drowsy.  The combination of these medications did cause me to fall asleep for about an hour. I am very dissatisfied with this medication. I am supposed to go back on Monday (12/14/09) for a fourth treatment, but who knows?
Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	1	1	Male	35-44	11/16/2009 7:53:08 PM	My husband was given this medication the day after being stung by a bee because his hand was swollen.  An hour later he went into cardiac arrest and passed away.  He was only 43 with no prior heart problems.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	11/10/2009 1:39:48 PM	After reading why everyone else was given this drug I am stunned that I was given it for a migraine.  I don't have any idea what the attending doctor was thinking, but I certainly intend to find out.

Disorder of the Connective Tissue	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/7/2009 2:12:39 AM	That paticular flare up imobilized and confined me to bed, when I needed to return home from visiting family.  I was too fatigued, stiff, sick to get myself home.  Went to emergency room and the physician knew exactly what was needed after hearing my history and administer 80 mg of this medication along with a littled ativan and the next morning I was up packed drove 7 hours home was completly free of pain, and my body moved with maximum fluidity. When I got home  I was doing house work, laundry, etc. and the benefit lingered for about 14 days with gradual leveling off the initial thereputic effect. IV Cortisone for cronic pain from autoimmune disease that require long term daily use of anagelsics is a miracle drug far more effective than any therapy or medications.  It is a crime that this hormone has not been somehow modified to eliminate the dangers associated with its use. Every drug used to treat these conditions are poisionous in some way and have left me with added diseases and conditions that are as bad or worse as this therapy. Why is it villanized so harshly?  It saved my life from dying from untreatable Chrohn's and an unbreakable 104 fever.  COULD IT BE THAT IT IS ONE OF THE LOWEST COST MEDICATIONS ON EARTH AND SIMPLE TO ADMINISTER? i ADMIT TO BEING JADED AFTER 35 YEARS OF DISAPPOINTING RESULTS. My current Rheumatologist refuses to use this treatment even with and infusion suite in his practice. This even after having Remicade, orencia, etc.
Other	sickgurliecantbreath, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	9/11/2009 4:21:46 AM	For starters, I have COPD!  I had to go onto this medication while in the hospital due to lung issues.  At first it was not working so they had to increase the amount!  After a couple of days it started to help, BUT, now I am starting to show signs of becoming a diabetic!  The doctor pretty much told me my choice is get my lungs to work and become one, or don't take and don't become one, BUT, then my lungs would not improve and in the condition I was in that was not a choice!  I would suggest this medication only as a last choice!  I has helped, but, has put me at risk for other things!  Now I am having to take insulin every now and then which is a whole new problem I didn't need, but, atleast I can start to breath again!
Multiple Sclerosis	verron, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	3	3	4	Female	45-54	9/2/2009 5:07:15 AM	I have relapsing remitting MS. Was given this drug only twice throughout 30 years.  Both times were due to new non active lesions appearing. I perceived a metalic taste in my mouth only after the first ten minutes. That went away very shortly after.I had more energy for days after the IV drip. Did not seem to see water weight gain as I only had this treatement 1 tx per mo. for 6 mo.  For me the Solu Medrol made my sleep restless if at all. I took a sleep aid but it only worked for the first 4 hours of sleep.
