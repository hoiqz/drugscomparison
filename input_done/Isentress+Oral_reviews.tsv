HIV	Newb, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male	35-44	8/29/2012 11:08:15 AM	I have no other medications to compare this one to. It amazes me that there are some docs that don't do their homework. I have had HORRIBLE insomnia. Fortunetly, Tylenol PM helps about 80%. Have an appt next with a NEW (3rd) ID doctor and will request a stronger sleeping aid. My sleep is far to too crucial to me. I also find taking this drug at dinner time or as early in the evening around 5 or 6 helps to sleep better too.
HIV	Vangeisen895, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	5	Male	35-44	7/24/2012 9:02:57 PM	I suppose I have been one of the very fortunate ones to be able to take just about any drug that has been given to me with zero side effects.  I started out on Sustiva 11 years ago and the only issue I had with it was that I had the crazy dreams that interrupted my sleep, but I could manage that.  I switched to Kaletra/Viread/Combivir and was on that combo for 9 years.  I just started taking Isentress in combo with my Viread and my Combivir and have had no issues whatsoever. 
HIV	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	7/2/2012 10:35:27 PM	Upon my very first dosage, I experienced severe muscle aches and joint pain. My doctor told me to stick with it and that these were normal but temporary side effects. 7 months later I had to abandon this drug, because these symptoms grew worse, leading my doctors to put me on Vicodin then Oxycontin, rather than give-up on Isentress. It wasn't worth it, i had to switch meds anyways, and then wean myself off the opioids on top of that. I understand that each persons' physiology is different. I am speaking only from personal experience.
HIV	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/6/2012 2:43:50 PM	I have been on Isentress with no side effects and I feel great! I have energy to do my daily tasks, I sleep very well and awake refreshed. The fact that I take it twice a day and if I miss my am dose I can double it with the pm makes this a God send for me.
HIV	rob32801, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/1/2011 8:10:05 PM	I'm surprised at the number of side effects that people are reporting in these reviews. I did a clinical study for treatment naive paitents for 2 years with Isentress and Epzicom. When I started I had 254 cd4 and 156,000 viral load. I was undetectable after 3 weeks and cd4 shot up to over 600. It's 3 years later, still undetectable and 1050 cd4. Side effects minor in the beginning, was very tired and stomach issues but that passed quickly. My immune system recovered very fast and I had a series of minor bacterial infections and skin issues for a few months, but that all passed. I had a blip in viral load, went up to 55, but quickly back to undetectable. These drugs do make me EAT! I had trouble maintaining weight for awhile, up and down 20 lbs quickly. I have to eat 3500+ calories/day to keep weight on but about four months ago my weight started gaining a few pounds per week. I went from 135lbs to 170lbs today in a few months. I feel fine, sleep well but do have weird dreams sometimes, and my blood work has been fine. Doc and I can't explain the sudden weight gain, nothing changed in the numbers during that period. I have found that I have little tolerance for alcohol now. Overall, very happy with Isentress and my treatment.
HIV	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	7/28/2011 8:56:38 PM	My VL has been undetectable two years into treatment with this drug.  CD4 is slowly rising, but not sckyrocketing.  I take truvada in conjunction with this.  No major side effects like when I took Sustiva, but I do have problems sleeping still.  First Dr I had before I moved said it ws the med and had me on sleeping pills to help.  Current Dr refuses to admit that its the drug and wont prescribe any.  
HIV	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	45-54	7/26/2011 2:01:19 PM	Since starting this medication I have no energy. I am so exhausted that I can hardly do my daily exercise. I've been having to take three hour naps everyday, something that I never did before. I have the craziest dreams I have ever had. I'm depressed and edgy all the time now. I will discuss a different medication option at my next physician appointment and hope to come up with a better choice.
HIV	kemitch, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/16/2011 2:11:35 PM	I have been taking this drug for several years and in comparison to AZT, 3TC, Viramune, Zerit and Invirase, a few of the other HIV  drugs I have taken before, this one works very well. I haven't had any of the usual sideaffects.  I don't have trouble sleeping or vivid dreams which I was afraid I would, had I opted for Sustiva instead.  My cd4 came up for the first time in years and my VL has remained undetectible.  The only problem I have are occasional headaches from Truvada but have learned to take it at night and sleep through them.
HIV	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	3/17/2011 1:46:33 PM	I was fatally allergic, broke down my immune system, and almost died twice from horrible case of PCP. I had been asynptomatic for 23 years with great counts, t-cells up near 800,etc. This med almost kiked me.My Dr. did no tests before or monitoring after.I am allergic to pennicilin family.72 days in hospital, and I have three more weeks of rehab as I lost 55 pounds, and the ability to do anything for myself.................................

HIV	Stillhere, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	45-54	10/20/2010 11:33:49 AM	I have been living with HIV for 24 years and have been on most of the medications that are available.  This is second medication I have taken that has interfered with my sleep (Sustiva being the first medication).  All in all I find this medication tolerable once I got past the diarrhea, however, I have been taking it for 20 weeks now and am still having trouble sleeping.  At its worst point I was getting maybe two hours of sleep a night.  I tried sleeping aids but did not like the side effects.  My current management plan it to have a structured day, get out of bed at the same time each day, go to bed at the same time, excursive in the morning, and no matter what stay in bed even if I have trouble sleeping.  Practicing relaxation techniques has helped as well as going to weekly acupuncture treatments for insomnia.  Currently I am getting five to six hours of sleep a night but still find that difficult to manage being fatigued with a full time job and classes.  
HIV	Sean, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/6/2010 6:31:28 PM	I had a CD4 count of 7 and the infectious disease doctors told my family I would die, my General Practitioner put me on this medication when I have became resistant to so many other medications.  This has made my CD4 count come up to 463 the highest it has ever been!! This medication truly saved my life!!
HIV	Carl,  Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	3	Male		10/5/2010 3:27:43 AM	After about two months on the drug, I have trouble sleeping (napping during the day and up and down at night), adding to that dizziness, and worst of all severe knee joint pain which has put stress on my back.
HIV	Wild Mike, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	9/27/2010 2:03:05 PM	I have been on this drug and truvada for only one month.  I have found that I have severe insomnia and vivid dreams.  Does the insomnia get better?  Over all it is the best regimin I have been on in over 10 years.  I just wished I could sleep. I told my doctor yesterday about the insomnia and he told me that there is no way that it would be caused by this drug. Really!!! Do these doctors do any research on the crap the have us on?
HIV	designboy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Male	35-44	9/11/2010 10:55:52 PM	I am happy that I found this website. I thought I was going crazy with strange dreams and insomnia. Been on this med for about one month. I do ask...Has anyone's side effect esp. the dreams/insomnia gotten better? This scares me and has been troubling.
HIV	sdtredneck, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/2/2010 8:39:53 PM	I was diagnosed with HIV in 2005. I got pregnant in 2007- started meds, had a healthy HIV- baby. After my pregnancy, my meds were switched from Norvir/Truvada to Isentress/Truvada. The only side effect I have is itchiness, which is quite tolerable considering my viral load has been undetectable since a few weeks after I started taking it. My T-Cells are above 700 and I am a little tired- but I have a 2 1/2 yr old...lol. It's a great drug- I'm just worried that there will be long term effects that we don't know about yet. I hope not!

He came back with a Dr. &amp; a pharmacist. Dr.stated this wasn't possible, pharmacist stated it was a problem, started me on Hydroxyzine 25mg.2tabs2xdy.when my Dr. returned he &amp; pharmacist placed me on Loratadine 10mg.1 tab am. Then was sent to a allergist, placed on Singular,Gabapentin,Ketotifen.Then removed from drugs  placed me on Ketotifen 1mg. 2tabs2xdy.on Mar. 9 2010 to go back on Apr.16/10. Itching has decreased but extremely worse in am when I wake up.
HIV	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	45-54	4/1/2010 12:35:50 AM	I switched to Isentress after a bad experience with Atripla.  Except for the occassional crazy dream, the drug seems to be side effect free for me.
HIV	tosha, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	35-44	3/17/2010 9:01:31 PM	I have been on this medicine for 3 and 1/2 months and half my hair has fallen out, all my muscles hurt and just lifting my legs i feel like i'm picking up 50lb logs and having to take naps. I've also started having irregular heart beats again (this is why i switched i was on Invirase and it causes heart problems. I'm also have a real rough time getting going in the morning because i feel out of it and have now gotten to the point i don't feel like going to work. My doctor wants to keep me on Isentress, Norvir, and Viread becaue i am drug resistant to alot of the drugs. But i wonder how much more i can take of this. Is it worth all the side effects to keep vl undetectable? I have a huge decision to make at my next doctors appt.  
HIV	LUCKYONE, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	3	Male	45-54	1/16/2010 7:15:06 PM	I HAVE JUST STARTED TAKING INSENTRESS 5 DAYS AGO. I WILL NOT KNOW THE EFFECTS ON MY NUMBERS TILL I GO FOR LABS IN 30 DAYS. I DID NOT READ ANY SIDE EFFECT UNTIL DAY 5.  I HAVE BEEN HAVING VERY STRANGE DREAMS. VIVID,AND DISTURBING. DRY MOUTH, FEEL HUNGRY BUT DO'T FEEL LIKE EATING, AND TIRED MORE THAN I AM ALREADY WITH MY DEPRESSION I HAVE ADD, SO ANY JITTERY FEELINGS OR ANXIETY, I MAY NOT FEEL AS MUCH FROM THIS MED. THE REASON I STARTED THIS NEW REGEMENT WAS BECAUSE I COULD NOT SWALLOW THE NORVIR PILL. I HAVE BEEN DEALING DEPRESISON FOR THE LAST 3 YEARS. I LIKE THE FACT I ONLY TAKE 2 HIV PILLS IN THE MORNING AND 1 AT NIGHT. ISENTRESS IS AM/PM.  OVERALL USE CONVIENTANT. GAVE A LOW SCORE FOR EFFECTIVENESS ONLY BECAUSE HAVE NOT DONE LAB WORK YET.  I'M SURE IT WILL BE GOOD. MY NUMBERS CURRENTLY ARE 450 FOR T-CELLS, AND 20,000 FOR VIRAL. BEEN HIV SINCE 1986. I'VE BEEN ON A DRUG VACATION FOR 10 YEARS, AND JUST DECIDED WITH MY DR.'S INPUT OF STARTED AGAIN AS OF SEPT. 09, WITH NORVIR, PLU OTHERS. I HOPE I CAN STAY ON THIS ONE AND IT GIVE ME RESULTS.
HIV	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	35-44	11/24/2009 11:19:04 PM	I started taking this medicine about a year ago.  I am on combination of Intelence, insentress, norvir, and lexiva.  I am having the typical side effects: trouble sleeping, sometimes go into deep long sleeps, itching skin.  But this has been best this combination I've used and I've tried so many drugs and couldn't take them.  My t-cell count has increased signficantly, and I have remained undetachable.  It's working great so I am enduring any of the side effects.  I am just thankful for solid numbers.
HIV	goldiger, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	45-54	10/23/2009 11:04:25 AM	used it only 2 1/2 month. It made me too sleepy,exhausted. I was taking 3 naps a day, did not want to work any more, felt intoxicated. I love what Kathleen calls it: &quot;JITTERY&quot;Sorry but at this point I am not willing to live like a Zombie and feel miserable just so my Vireal load is undetectable...Off that med and feeling normal again = energetic.

HIV	jonrm, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	45-54	7/31/2009 6:09:02 PM	I have only been taking this drug for two weeks as a replacement for Videx which is taking a toll on my liver (apparantly).  It's effectiveness I am sure will be good, but I wanted to look into the side effects more, since I am having strange dreams and insomnia.  It also makes me very restless.  I have started taking it right at bedtime so it hits me after I have already been asleep.  I hope that this side effect will diminish, as some of the other drug side effects have in the past.
HIV	Saintseattle, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	10/13/2008 6:23:56 PM	I have had an AIDS diagnosis for many years. While I've been able to keep my viral load undectable using Fuzeon, my T-Cells have always remained under 200. With my doctor's urging, I dropped the Fuzeon and switched to this drug. I was very scared, but for no reason. My viral load remains undectable and my T-Cells are rising. PLUS, I don't have to inject myself twice per day.
