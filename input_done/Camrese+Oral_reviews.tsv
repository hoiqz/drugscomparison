Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	9/15/2012 12:17:59 PM	I had been taking Seasonique for years, but once the generic Camrese came on the market, my pharmacy has not had Seasonique in stock on multiple occasions, forcing me to take Camrese instead.  Camrese has been effective for birth control, but after two weeks on it I get spotting that does not stop for the rest of the pill pack. For this reason I would not recommend it. 
Other	Mon2, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	13-18	9/5/2012 10:07:57 PM	I wanted to take Camrese to decrease my periods and lessen my PMS symtoms. I take my pill at 10 o'clock every night. I have never been late taking it.1st week: I was sick with a cold, so I don't know if it caused me headaches or not. Towards the end of the 1st week, many of my pores were clogged and I had a few pimples.I think I might have also been a bit emotional.2nd week: More pimples. Mid-second week, I felt horny at times. My breasts were really sore and grew a bit.3rd week: nothing new4th week: More pimples and clogged pores. My PMS symptoms surfaced, but they were not as bad as they would be without the pill. I began to spot a little.End of 4th week-5th week: Lots of nausea. Mostly mild, it would get worse if I thought about the nausea I was feeling. Gradual increase of spotting over the 2 weeks.I took the placebo (yellow) pills on my 6th week. My actual period started on the 2nd or 3rd day. My blood was thicker than normal (which is supposed to happen because estrogen thickens the blood).My period flow varied from light-heavy.I experienced mild cramps the first day, but then had bad cramps most of my 3rd or 4th day. Morning was the worst.4th or 5th day on my period, I had cramps when i woke up just like on my 3rd or 4th day (very bad).7th week: Breakouts and spotting stopped.8th week and on: Pimples came back and I keep getting more.General experiences:Regarding mood changes, I think I'm more emotional on the pills. I feel negative (sad/mad) more, but I do not know if it's because of all these pimples or not.Before the pill, I didn't get pimples often, but I didn't rarely get them either. My skin was normally at its worst 2 weeks before my period (when I PMS).I'm not totally satisfied with Camrese, but the reported side effects aren't as bad as some other BC pills. I'm probably going to switch to another brand because my face breaks out way too much now. If you never had a problem with pimples, I suggest trying Camrese out.
Birth Control	Steff, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	9/5/2012 11:12:09 AM	I've been on Camrese for about 9 months now. The first three months were great, and I loved having a period once every blue moon. I also felt like it might have increased my sex drive. However, the next pack I started breakthrough bleeding the first week of the third month, and it didn't stop until I went off for the month. I decided to give it one more go, and the same exact thing is now happening. On top of that, my sex drive has taken a nose dive. It may just be my body, so I would recommend still trying it. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	n/a, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	8/31/2012 1:31:32 AM	I started on this pill because of heavy uncomfortable periods that interrupted my life. At first it was great! I lost weight, was happier and felt it was a huge gift. But in recent months I have been feeling crazy. My moods are so intense (not my usual self). I feel like I can't handle little things. I am drinving my boyfriend crazy. Also note to all taking this pill. You have to be consistent. Take it at the same time every day. I will immediately spot if I am off scheduel. Also I traveled to a different time zone and it was nearly impossible to get in sync. 
Birth Control	ladyemeraldeyes, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	8/5/2012 10:23:43 AM	I started Camrese after coming off of Depo Provera, which stopped my periods for three months when it wore off. So far Camrese has lowered the count and size of my ovarian cysts, which is wonderful, and has been an effective form of birth control for me. The only negative thing I have to say is that I have had a definite increase in body acne and body hair since I started it, but it's more of a nuisance than a real problem. I have also gained about five pounds, but that's easily fixed. One thing though - I forgot to take it for two days in week 7 and I ended up starting a 12-day period despite taking them normally from then on out. I haven't reached placebo week yet (I just started week 10) but so far I would definitely recommend this birth control to anyone who asked me about it. It's great for women who are looking for a simple birth control option that they can stop at any time and will cause minimum side effects.

I am fine for the first 6 weeks then in week 7 I get VERY emotional, experience panic attacks, cry all the time, and feel very depressed. I am thinking of switching back to a monthly pill.
Birth Control	lea8199, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/26/2012 2:34:17 PM	I saw the bad reviews and i was weary about taking this pill, but surprisingly i had no side effects and its worked wonderful.  We must remember that medication works different on everyone. Not because someone had a bad reaction it means everyone else will. Try it and see for yourself.
Birth Control	Lex8, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	6/22/2012 8:26:17 PM	I was on seasonique for about a year, then switched due to insurance reasons. I spotted in the beginning but haven't had an issue in over 9 months.  Camrese is definitely day/time sensitive, but that just comes down to me being responsible about it. The only thing I do note is that I feel when I do get my period my hormones are in overdrive. Sorry to be blunt, but it's caused my libido to go into overdrive and I've become hyper sensitive to orgasms. I have gained 5-10 lbs and my acne is a little more frequent than I'd like, but overall, no major complaints. 
Birth Control	corporealism, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	5/11/2012 3:45:23 PM	I was previously taking seasonique for two years but switched two camrese because my insurance would no longer cover seasonique. I've been on camrese for three months now and since I began the new pills I started developing acne as well as spots of melasma on my face. I am confused to why I would be having these side effects when my pharmacist explained to me that camrese is &quot;identical&quot; to seasonique and I never had these effects while taking seasonique. I am unsure to whether I should pay the extra money to take seasonique again or switch to a whole new type of birth control?
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	5/7/2012 1:18:55 PM	I have been on the non generic version of this (seasonique) for over 6 years.  My insurance company switched me to this about 6 months ago, and I have had non stop breakthru bleeding on and off, but most recently for the last 4 weeks straight. I NEVER had this problem with Seasonique. This generic is CRAP!  I dont care how much they want to say its the same, it is not.  I had essure done and take this soley to only have 4 periods a year.  I am done with camrese, the fillers must be made with cat $hit or something, because it sucks!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	5/2/2012 12:03:32 AM	In addition to birth control, I also take Camrese for migraine treatment, and it's worked very well for both of those issues. I MAY have bloating and weight gain, and I MAY have clearer skin but who knows if Camrese is really the cause.
Birth Control	Tay93, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	13-18	3/25/2012 1:37:00 AM	I've been on this pill for about a month and a week because my previous pill had me spotting 4 over a month but im still spotting everyday. Its so annoying but it works. My breasts are sore a lot but im use to it. I feel like I have mood swings sometimes but idk 
Painful Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	3/21/2012 5:06:03 AM	An hour after I took it I was extremely nauseous and got the shakes , got very cold too.  I also experienced dizziness. This was kind of scarry because it happened so quickly.
Other	lam2lab, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	45-54	3/12/2012 4:11:29 PM	I had been using brandname Seasonique for years and had no problems with spotting at all.  When generic AMETHIA came out I used it for 9 months and had no problems at all.  My pharmacy gave me CAMRESE generic this time - spotted for one week but now it's as heavy as a full blown period for almost 2 weeks now! 
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	35-44	3/6/2012 12:14:12 PM	Started using this medication in December ...started off great..now first of March.. started spotting, week later still on my period... was not supposed to start until 1st week of April... this is becoming more of a nuisance than it is to help.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	2/26/2012 8:02:18 PM	I switched from seasonique to camrese basically bc health insurance forced me to. From there my anxiety level sky rocketed, hematuria, and cause insomnia. I had to go to the ER where they took me off this drug, since then been feeling better. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female		2/23/2012 8:24:00 PM	I have been taking it for 6 days and every afternoon I get dizzy, nauseated, and have stomach and abdominal cramping. Doc told me to stop for 3 days and seeif symptoms get better.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	2/20/2012 12:00:02 AM	Really not a bad pill. Helped to clear up my skin. I didn't notice some weight gain in month 2, but that could very well be a result of my lifestyle. I have found that only having a period once every three months is having an adverse on my body. But again, this may or may not have anything to do with the pill. I have spotted, but very little. Overall is served its purpose effectively.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	1/16/2012 5:06:37 PM	I switched from seasonique for two years to camrese 2 1/2 months ago because of the copay. Camrese has been nothing but trouble for me. Headaches, bloating and worst of all I've been spotting for almost two whole months. I'm about to go batty! Like I said, seasonique never gave me this issue in two years. I called my obgyn and she said this is a common issue with camrese even though it is identical to seasonique. She wasn't sure why but said its been seen quite often in most of the women who take it. Going back to seasonique ASAP!

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	wishiwereaboy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	1/6/2012 2:39:08 AM	I am on my first pack of Camrese. I have never been sexually active but always had heavy periods and am unable to use tampons, so my Dr. suggested using it so that i would have lighter and less frequent periods. I started on the Sunday of my period and it ended on that Wednesday. I was fine until the middle of week 4 and I started spotting. I know that is normal so I said ok maybe this will go away in time. Well, I am now on week 10 and still spotting. I take the pill every time each night, I am going insane. It is doing the exact opposite of the reason I started taking it. I have 3 weeks to go including the low dose at the end of the pack. I saw a diff Dr. and he told me to finish the pack normally and start a new one. Honestly, I do not see the bleeding ever stopping, it went from only seeing it when I wiped for two days, to filling a panty liner, to having to use regular pads. I'm not sure if this med just isn't strong enough for me or what but I will be so happy if I ever stop bleeding. 43 days is waay too long I'd say. so far, I absolutely hate this med...
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	12/16/2011 1:55:19 PM	I was recently switched to Camrese from Seasonique.  Since I've been on it (5 months), I've experience spotting for 2 weeks prior to my period, weight gain, constant bloating, gas and mood swings.  I never had any of these side effects while taking Seasonique.  This generic medication is no good!
Other	lmount1, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	13-18	11/21/2011 11:38:48 PM	I just got switched to Camrese from Seasonique. I use Seasonique to treat migraine headaches that occur on my menstrual cycle. I hate Camrese! I feel different in my personality and in my body. I ended up in the ER the first week of taking Camrese for intense vaginal bleeding that didn't have to do with my period. I want nothing to do with Camrese it freaks me out. I have gotten four migraine headaches in the month I've been on it instead of usually one every three months. I have headaches almost everyday. I have to say this is the worst generic drug I have ever experienced. I am in the process of switching back to Seasonique or to something else entirely.
