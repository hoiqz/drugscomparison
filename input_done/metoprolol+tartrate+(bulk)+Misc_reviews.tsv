I ended up on 100mg a day and it about killed me. The doctors just added more till I finally got clear headed enough to realize it was this making me sick. Have weaned myself down to 25mg a day and still I feel lousy. It makes me dizzy and have almost passed out, and I am going to get off this stuff.

It started adding beats and going too fast making me dizzy and on the edge of fainting.  I've been on it and it my heart isn't as bad, but now I'm pregnant and scared it well hurt my baby, but the Fetal doctor said it's just going to slow the growth and well not hurt it.  I take 25mg of Metoprol TAR.  I pray that my baby is going to be fine...anyone in the same thing?

However, I'm taking 50mg twice a day and it has only lowered my blood pressure minimally. My Dr. is prescribing Diovan in addition to this med, but I'm not sure I want to spend $54 a month for that!!
