Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	8/28/2012 3:51:05 PM	Since I started talking this pill 4mths ago I've gained over 35lbs and have a constant hunger, have trouble sleeping, yawn at all hours of the day, I'm mean as heck when I drink and have horrible mood swings. It's not that I don't reccommend this pill to others, it just didn't work for me. I only asked my Dr to get on an anti depressant bc I felt withdrawn from my life and became a home body, did that mean I needed a pill or needed a hobby?! I still feel the same way about wanting to chill at home...so I don't believe this pill has worked at all for me...nor do I think I needed it.

But for a long time (2-3 months) it put me into a severe state of depression and I would sleep 14 hours a day. I was extremely tired and irritable at first. Now, I take it before bed and it keeps me up for a while, but puts me in a deep sleep. It is a good medication, but I wouldn't suggest it for people with Manic Bipolar.

But after awhile, the drowsiness was really hard to deal with.  I also gained alot of weight while on this but mainly because it increased my appetite so I ate.  Probably doesn't make everyone tired so would recommend trying it.  Withdrawal wasn't a problem even though doing it cold turkey isn't recommended.

Prior to to taking the Prozac I was never suicidal, now I am so depressed, it is a chore to not wanting to face another day.Horrible medicine that should be taken off the market

Upped to 60 mg. &amp; eventually to 80 mg. which I have been on for nearly a year. I could tell each time that I needed a little more to keep in check. It makes me feel normal &amp; not ready to cry at the drop of a hat. For me, personally, it's been a life changer.

I had told my problem to my gyne, my psychiatrist (prescribing doc), and my internest and none of them linked the  problem with orgasm to the drug!

Panic Disorder	Berrie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/18/2012 8:16:55 PM	I have had depression and general anxiety after quitting heavy smoking 11 yrs ago.  I have taken Xanax 3xday (for 11 yrs) and began Prozac 1 1/2 yrs ago.  As I withdrew from Xanax I would increase the Prozac, beginning with 10ml, 20ml,and up to 60ml.  Last month I was in lock down for taking all of my Xanax because I needed help to get off the Xanax,(being an addict I of course took a total of 90 pills) even though my Prozac was working great.  Now it has been 3 weeks since my DETOX and I have been GOING CRAZY WITH CONSTANT ANXIETY. I increased the amount of Prozac to 70ml, 2 weeks ago (from Dr.) and guess what????  TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME since detoxing from Xanax, my level of anxiety is so ok...the Prozac is working!!! Gosh, how did I ever doubt that this long process would not work for me. Thank you God for making all the men and women who produced this medicine for people like us.

I attribute it to being peri-menopausal.My Doctor tried to put me on Welbutrin but I sincerely didn't feel like I was depressed.  In fact, I'm happy 99% of the time - I was just crying so easily!  I tried Welbutrin once (literally, one tablet) and felt like a zombie.  I told my Doctor &quot;never again!&quot;  After another year of crying, I finally agreed to try Prozac.  I could tell the difference the first day.   What a relief!  I'm back to my old normal self and don't feel any side effects.  The first 2 weeks she had me on 10 mg / day, then raised me up to 20 mg / day.  I had mild side effects the first two weeks (a little jittery, diarrhea, feeling like I needed a nap in the middle of the day) so I was worried about taking the higher dosage - but strange thing was, as soon as I started the higher dose, I stopped having the side effects.  So stick with it, give it at least a month and if it's not doing what you need it to do, try another type of medication.

It worked wonders, I do not believe I would have made it through without it or have been able to contain my thoughts of helplessness and suicide.  I would take it again if I was ever faced with depression again.  I felt a little groggy the first week but was lucky to have no other side effects at all.

Depression	TeeLady, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	4/11/2012 1:16:49 PM	I have used this med for over 20 years. I was at a point of being suicidal at the time but I recommend counseling along with any antidepressnt drug if your situation is serious.  Mine was. I was so depressed for so long that it was hard for my body to let go and be less depressed, but after a few weeks along with conseling I realized I was beginning to do better. Over the years, circumstances got better, so I began taking 10 mg every other day because its half life is longer than most of the other meds.  I now take none and am maintaining pretty good at present because life circumstances got better.  I've looked at other antidepressants but I will probably use Prozac again should I need it. I still suggest seeing a pshycologist or pshychiatrist for evaluation before starting any antidepressant.  Depression is caused by a lot of different things and one pill by itself may not fix the problem. You must peel the layers off of depression like the layers of an onion to heal. Good luck.

Depression	Przacsucks, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	3/28/2012 6:48:15 PM	I wouldn&#180;t touch this stuff with a ten foot pole if I had to do it over again.  I wouldn&#180;t wish this stuff on my worst enemy.  At first it made me feel good but that didn&#180;t last after about four years I was nervous all the time, witdrawn and began to have severe anxiety.  I have tried to stop many times but am so adicted to the drug that I have to take some form of S.S.R.I.  Prozac completely ruined my life.  I use to be able to function.  I use to have confidence in myself and be fairly normal.  Now I question everything.  My advice is don&#180;t touch this stuff.  It is psychologically addictive and physically addictive and if you ever decide you want to get off it can be too late as it has made your anxiety go through the roof, your depression worsen, and you are now completely physically addicted.  Taking drugs to cope with life is not natural and just because a doctor perscribes it and they say it is meant to treat a certain condition doesn&#180;t mean you are not taking a drug and falling into the escapism and perils of taking any other drug.  Once cocaine was considered the miracle drug until it became clear what it did to people.  I think Doctors who perscribe anti depressants are incompetant and I think the pharmaseutical industry is a billion dollar industry focused on making billions no matter what the human cost.  I hate Prozac and know that is is very bad news.  Don&#180;t even think of taking anti depressants.

The only drawback is mild anxiety and less sex drive.  While I regret side effects, to feel joyous in my day rather than hostile is worth it. I have been taking 20mg for two months.  I plan to use for a year, then gradually stop and see what happens. As a family man, I really need to be the best I can be, and I am amazed at what Prozac has done for me in such a short time.

Depression	K5750B, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	2/28/2012 2:23:44 PM	I am a 21 year old female who has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety several times since age 12. Every time I noticed a correlation between the depression and anxiety and the changing seasons and also noticed the symptoms started the day of ovulation and ceased the day menstruation began. These are concerns I discussed with my doctor and each time I was ignored and these &quot;coincidences&quot; were brushed off. Each time I was diagnosed I was given a prescription for an anti depressant without discussion of alternatives. On my most recent visit two months ago I was prescribed Prozac and took it out of desperation for about a month and a half with no results. I was still having horrible premenstrual depression. After doing research on PMS and depression I realized my symptoms may be due to low progesterone levels. After reading a few books I started using natural progesterone cream from the day of ovulation until menses and got relief from my symptoms immediately. If you are a woman who suffers from depression PLEASE do yourself a favor and read books by Dr. John Lee, including &quot;Hormone Balance Made Simple&quot;, &amp; &quot;What Your Dr. May Not Tell You About Premenopause&quot;. It will change your life and help you return to your natural happy self. I also suggest reading into alternative treatments for depression such as 5HTP &amp; Sam-e, which are two supplements that are as effective if not more so than pharmaceutical anti depressant medication. Please read WebMD reviews on 5HTP from the link below, it will give those of you with mild to severe depression hope http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredi entreview-794-5-HTP.aspx?drugid=794&amp;drugname= 5-HTP&amp;pageIndex=8&amp;sortby=3&amp;conditionF ilter=-500
Depression	joshappypets, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	2/27/2012 7:55:08 PM	Prozac needs to be carefully monitored by your treating physician, as it can, sometimes, cause rapid weight gain and tissue swelling (ankles, hands, feet, etc.). It also can affect your sleep patterns. This happened with me within the first two weeks of treatment. Needless to say, I have asked to be placed on another medication.

Bipolar Depression	bolu34, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/21/2012 10:04:43 PM	I just started taking this medication last week and I already feel better. I was diagnosed with depression in 2008 and recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the winter of 2011. I have struggled with depression and finding the right medications for close to 4 years and I can honestly say that I feel a difference. Since taking the medication, I feel like I can get out of bed, am not overwhelmed by life, overtly depressed, and don't feel dead inside anymore. I don't know if I'm experiencing a hypomania, but I feel amazing. Even if it is hypomania, it feels a lot better than severe depression.  I would highly recommend this medication to everyone for depression. I don't know if the other medications I'm on have a hand in me feel better, but I'm also taking a anti-psychotic as a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder.

Worked Excellent to Alleviate my depression and Inability to focus at work. However, I did stop taking the Med Since it Caused EXTREME AGITATION and CONFRONTATION with others. Almost was fired from my Job when I disageed with a coworker over the workload. Ended up throwing a chair and looking to fight with him . This behavior is Foreign to me since I was very mild mannered and even alittle passive before Prozac. Now in Therapy without Meds and beginning to feel depression coming back without the meds.

Very successful, Have a wonderful life; great wife , great kids, no financial concers etc. But always had GAD (general anxiety disorder). Makes me feel crappy, very anxious and connects to depression. Recently it got much worse for no discernable reason; especially in the mornings. Suffered with it for about a month. It was very unpleasant. Started prozac generic at 20mg. Now up to 60 and at 60, it helps about 90%. Main side effect is low sex drive and 100% ED. But it is worth it for now. Anything is better than bad GAD.. 
Depression	leelee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	2/7/2012 1:21:31 PM	I have been on prozac for 6 years now.  It just helps me get up and go to work and not fall apart completely.  My personal life however suffers the most because I no longer like to socialize with other people, I seem to have lost my emotions and my ability to respond to issues with sincerity or compassion.  Instead, feel distant when hearing of loved ones problems or losses.  Not sure if this is the prozac, but I sure wish I felt like the person I used to be, more motivated, more outgoing and personable and not avoiding all negative issues.

I have been taking this medicine since july 6th 2011. This medicine has helped me so much along with cognative behavioral therapy. I would recommend this medicine to EVERYONE. I still have somedays were I relapse a bit, but NEVER like I used to before. I am confinent in saying that Prozac saved my life. If I would have never have taken it, I might not be here today. At only 14, this was very stressful, and still is. Taking this medicine is the easiest thing you'll ever do. My side effects were, sleepy about 4 hours after taking it (I take it in the morning with breakfast), being wide awake at night, and feeling nausous sometimes. But these symptoms went away after about 3 weeks. I, my mom, and my doctor decided that the 10 mg I was taking was not enough, so we uped it to 20mg. I only had reoccuring side effects for about 3 days after changing the dose. If you are reading this, I seriously think you should talk to your doctor about Prozac, it saved me life, and can save yours too. I hope this review was helpful! Best of luck to you! &lt;3

I think the drug is great, I just don't feel buried with all the depressing things that happen. The depression doesn't cling to me anymore, I just move forward, way better than mirtazapine, no bad dreams, not foggy in the morning. Might work to well, just can't get angry and really don't care too. I was a mess before, a stage 4 cancer survivor I had some real anxiety. This stuff really helped.

While I've only been taking 20mg daily, I'm trying to find out if it's the cause for my low sex drive, or is it just because I'm getting older?
Depression	Taylore, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/19/2012 8:14:11 PM	First let me say I have been on Effelxor,Wellbutrin,Zoloft,Pristiq, Seroqual, Ambilify,Lexapro,Celexa, and Cymbalta. With all I had side effects. I am very sensitive to medications. On prozac just under a month. I have only had the side effect of tiredness.Do not judge a medication or read to much into others. You are likely to have things happen because you read about it. The mind is our most powerful tool. Remembering even Asprin has side effects. I am on 20mg a day in the am, and Xanax .25mg 2 X a day. This is good for me. I know many who have had success with some of the drugs I couldn't use. Don't give up you will find the one too. Also there are some people who will bash a medication 50+ times, as someone has done for Prozac. One more thing I find no difference from brand to generic, possible another mind issue for others.

I still do, but if I didn't take it, I wouldn't be alive today, considering I've had very severe episodes. Side effects are minimal... Though sometimes it helps, it doesn't prevent every psych. break. But it's better than being off the pill. At least now I can recover within a day from a bad experience instead of suffering for longer.

I had severe mood swings and very bad physical symptoms before starting. Prozac helped tremendously for my PMDD symptoms. Although this medication worked, it has some huge drawbacks. After taking this for almost a year I had a non-existant sex drive. It went from a 180 in the department which then caused relationship issues. Another drawback - tiredness.. ALL THE TIME! I felt drained 24/7 no matter what I tried. (Getting rest, exercise, vitamins, etc). Nothing helped. So - I'm now switching to Wellbutrin SR. Lets hope that works.

Depression	13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	13-18	12/14/2011 8:53:23 PM	After 3 years of battling depression, I found something that works for me. Okay, it's not a cure, I still have anxiety and symptoms of depression. But after about a month of taking Prozac (and hydroxyzine as needed for anxiety) I have the urge to get off my lazy you know what and actually do something instead of sleeping every day away. I still feel sad a lot, I still have suicidal thoughts (no intentions though), and I still suffer from my generalized anxiety disorder. But on a scale of 1-10 10 being the worst, I was a 10. This has brought it down to a 6. I took Prozac before and it didn't seem to do much so then I switched to Effexor 75mg per day, then I switched to 50mg of Zoloft, then I went to a combo of 20mg of Lexapro and 150mg of Wellbutrin. I wanted to try Prozac again and instead of starting at 10mg for the first week then going to 20, I started at 20 and went to 40. Effexor, Zoloft, Lexapro, and Wellbutrin were prescribed from a psychiatrist as well was the first run with Prozac. So after 2 months being off the Lexapro and Wellbutrin combo, I talked to my regular doctor and she gladly prescribed Prozac and just increased the dose. It's ridiculous how the psychiatrist had my brain switching from med to med when all I needed was a simple increase in my Prozac. And another thing, you hear so much negative, but there is positive to Prozac. For some it can destroy a family, and for others it may rebuild one.

Panic Disorder	TJM91, 19-24 Male  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	12/13/2011 12:46:53 AM	I have panic attacks out of nowhere, and they started when I was 16, I also took Adderall XR (would have panic attacks with or without the Adderall). I was first given Paxil and I hated that crap. I felt all zombie-ish. Not to mention the horrible withdrawal, excuse me, discontinuation syndrome.  So I stopped antidepressants for about two years, until I was 19 in community college and was having bad agoraphobia. I stopped Adderall and everything. So I went to a shrink and she brought me to a reasonable dose of Adderall and then 5 mg Prozac for a week, 10 for another week, then 20 mg. I felt okay, like panic attacks had receded a little bit. However, I still had them regardless. So, we bumped up Prozac to 30 mg, added on Klonopin (0-2 mg) as needed for days I feel keyed up. I tried the combo of Adderall XR, Prozac, and Klonopin. It worked great. I still have the occasional breakthrough panic attack but she prescribed 0-2 mg Xanax depending on severity.Overall the combo for ADHD, anxiety, and panic disorder has worked well. Plus tablet splitting saves money with the Xanax and Klonopin.**NOTE: A work on Xanax and Klonopin, I do NOT take these every single day. Xanax is for the panic that breaks through suddenly and I usually take 1 mg. The Klonopin is if I am feeling a bit too &quot;keyed-up&quot; or anxious in the morning, noon, or evening. Klonopin comes on more subtlety than Xanax, which is like a wipe-out of total panic.This combination works great!

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/23/2011 1:26:39 AM	This medication has been life-changing for me. I am currently taking 40mg. It was prescribed for my anxiety, depression, and obsessive thoughts. It took me awhile to figure out that I needed to take the Brand name because I got bad side effects/less effective when I switched to Generic, but now I've been back on the brand name and its a dramatic difference. My depression is so much better and I feel like a cloud has lifted. Everything is pretty much better, but I still have my ups and downs. No pill is a &quot;miracle.&quot; I may need to up my dose when I see my psychiatrist next week because I've recently been having a more difficult time coping w/my life. However, overall, this med is a great choice for me. Only side effects: stomach discomfort/indigestion intermittently, and hyperactivity (but that is much preferred to my anxiety &amp; depression). Thank you Prozac! I do believe antidepressants are overprescribed, but for me it is a necessity. I've learned the hard way that I decompensate without an antidepressant. Prozac is the one that has really worked for me. Oh, and in case you are wondering, it actually has NOT badly impacted my sex drive! I am still very much active w/my fiance;) So SSRIs don't always have a bad effect on your libido. Give it a try! It may work for you!

My job is not where it should be and the pressure of not retiring until 70 is overwhelming. My body aches with stiffness and pain from arthritis. Prozac made life better I hope it continues to work until I get my control back on my own.
Panic Disorder	Newbie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	11/15/2011 2:13:56 PM	Just started taking this about 5 days ago. First two days i had no side effects then on the 3rd day i started to feel extremely anxious. Dr gave me ativan 1mg every 4-6 hours to help with the anxiety. that helped. dr said that a side effect of prozac is anxiety and that it would eventually go away once the body is used to the medication. i cannot wait until that happens. i do notice that when i take prozac i get drowsy, probably going to switch to taking at night. also, i am having light sensitivity problems.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	xbrando7, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	13-18	11/5/2011 9:27:25 PM	For a teenager with OCD concerning harm, sexuality, and religion, like me, this is an excellent medication. Previously I took Zoloft, which made my associated depression significantly worse. This medicine does a great job of reducing obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges. I would say overall that my OCD is at about 25% of the untreated (freaking out constantly) level. Even when I am faced with obsessions or anxiety, they are much easier to deal with. Overall, I would say that it doesn't have some of the typical anti-depressant side-effects, like weight gain, sleepiness, or emotional indifference. There are some side-effects, however. At 60 mg it can cause hyperactivity and sleep disturbances, like waking up at inconvenient times and very vivid dreams. For these reasons, I am thinking about going back down to 40 mg later.

I had a hysterectomy (Salpingo Oophorectomy) 5 yrs ago and its been downhill ever since I went off hormone therapy 3 yrs ago. the weight gain alone from a size 8 to 16 is unbearable, throw in the instant 'crying jags' and the inability to deal with the day to day pressures. during my Well Woman exam, my DR instantly prescribed 10mg a day gradually going into 20mg in 2 weeks and promised me better days ahead. She said it would be the catalyst I need to attack my weight problem to get me motivated to begin a weight loss program. I will be back to review in about a month's time!

Therafter started feeling better  . constipation can be easily maintained by taking ISBGOL. For initial 10 days better to take alprazolam in night to avoid side effects. overall Fluoxetine very helpfull

Other	KW, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/7/2011 9:50:54 AM	I was put on Prozac (10 mg. once a day) 10 years ago for Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  Prior to taking Prozac, I would have 'sessions' of IBS that would cause me to lie in bed for 3 hours or more, then I was useless the remainder of the day.  I had getting relief through improving my diet and exercise and taking other anti-spasmodics, but those gave me no relief.  Prozac is the only thing that has allowed me to function normally over these years.

I took it for a little over a year and it was wonderful! It made me happy and feel positive about life. I stopped all suicidal thoughts and everything was great. People could scream in my face and it wouldn't even effect me. It was awesome. The downside was that I had absolutely no sex drive and my husband didn't like that. I also couldn't feel super happy or passionate about anything. All in all I had a good experience with this medication as it saved my life.

Accomplished 500 miles in 5 weeks which was a major improvement from my no energy in bed exsistance before Prozac.  I have also lost 20 lbs. The only really side effect I have experienced is diarrhea everyday and bruising.  Also sometimes I have a hard time sleeping and my sex drive has really decreased.  But I am stable and feel 100% better.

This is fine but you should NEVER EVER stop Celexa cold turkey.  Some people like myself should be weaned off it even more slowly than others.  Definitely go through a psychiatrist not a regulary practitioner.  This is serious business trust me Celexa withdrawals are horrible if not done correctly!

I went back to my Doctor and he put me on Prozac. I went CRAZY within the first few days. my husband and I have never had a huge fight and rarely ever argued. Until that week. The first few days i was just really mean as he put it. opinionated, argumentative, and just had a bad attitude. It got so bad that we had our first BIG fight and I started yelling and got so angry that I tried to jump out of the car while moving. The next day I stopped taking the medicine and once I felt better I talked to my husband about the fight and I had no idea what it was even about. I have since switched to Zoloft and so far I feel like myself.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/5/2011 12:28:29 PM	First, I would like to say that it is crucial to find the right medicine for you by working with a doctor you trust. Prozac works for me, but may not work for you. Don't give up, and most importantly, don't wait to get help. Make an appointment as soon as you have questions or concerns about your mind and/or body.For me, personally, Prozac has been great. I suffered from depression during most of my twenties, but was resistant to taking medicine. I was worried about side effects. I tried Zoloft, which did not work for me - made me jittery (which might have been the dosage, or just the med). I've also taken ADD meds for ADD and had symptoms of paranoia with the two that I tried on separate occasions. I find that the Prozac helps a little with ADD. I've come to just accept my ADD also - I felt like a different person when I was medicated for it.Prozac has helped my depression significantly. I don't have major side effects. I have had weight gain, but I don't know if I can blame the medicine. It is harder to achieve an orgasm (I'm a woman) but I can still get there. The sexual side effects have been frustrating sometimes, but I wouldn't trade the feelings of well being I have when I take my 20 mg day as prescribed(I went off of it once cold turkey and the depression came back).Again, hang in there, best wishes, and find a doctor who listens to you and is knowledgeable in their field.

Have been on it fofr 2 years now.  It absolutely works for PMDD &amp; I have been symptom free for 2 years.  When I first started for the 1st two weeks I had an unusually high amount of energy &amp; was extremely happy.  Then things went back to normal with out the PMDD.  I once went through a small depression with a personal relationship &amp; asked my doctor to higher it from the minimal dose of 20 mil.  He upped it to 40 mil &amp; after a few weeks I kept feeling weird all the time with 'zaps'.  If you don't know what zaps are it's hard to explain- but it feels like your brain is being electrified by tiny little electrical circuits &amp; is really annoying &amp; a little painful but most of all distracting to everyday functions &amp; life.  So I went back down to my 20 mil &amp; have been there ever since.  I can honestly say that it changed my life because PMDD no longer controls my emotions and life- I do.  I still have emotions like every one else, a sex drive, orgasms, happiness &amp; sadness.  I just don't have PMDD what so ever anymore &amp; that alone has changed &amp; saved my life!  I strongly recommend for PMDD!

I will take it as long as I feel I need help coping with depression. I also see a counselor which I believe is the only thing to help cure depression.

Went in for refill of Zoloft, said I was kinda depressed. Dr. would not left me explain it was situaton. I refused Prozac, taken it before got adverse reaction.Dr. would not listen to me.Bulled me into taking it....Got bad reaction on 15mg, per Dr, lower to 10mg, Boom came the anxiety..I have had PERMANENT Anxiety since 5/10.

Head went crazy on 5/20/10.lowered to 10mg then anxiety hit..It is permanent.It is 6/5/11. Zolft would not work again. got anxiety then killer headaches. Stopped Zoloft. THen came severe anxiety. New shrink-5mg ativan/day. no help.  I resorted to Cymbalta. Did't work, I am screwed. New Shrink has me on Lamictal, Depakote,Klonpin, Ambien..I am taking so many pills. Living in pajamas since 9/10. Can't funtion at all. I don't think I  will ever feel normal, like I did on Zoloft. I am scared to death I will live like this forever. BTY, I am not Bipolar. Straight up depression and anxiety . It all just seems hopeless and I have given up the idea of ever being normal again. WHat right did Shrink have to bully me into medication I told her I can't take.(Prozac)

Depression	Cindy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	6/26/2011 12:41:54 PM	I was taking Zoloft and I never had a wisper of anxiety..And I was functional again..Even when I ran out of it for 2 months, no anxiety, just got depressed again. My SHRINK bullied me into Prozac. She did not tell me it can cause ANXIETY, a listed side-effect on webmd. It made my head go crazy at 15mg, she said reduce to 10mg and BOOM, the ANxiety hit bad..THen I got back on Zoloft and it gave me anxiety and then killer headaches. Had to as &quot;severe&quot;..I had to take 5mg Ativan/day and was still going crazy from anxiety..ready to kill myself..finally submitted to Cymbalta, my last resort. at 30mg it greatly reduced the anxiety, but could not tolerate 40mg..I have been screwed up with anxiety and depression ever since PROZAC. Shrink did not tell me the side-effect of anxiety..It has been over 1 year and I have been a prisoner in my house.Debilitaded and can't function. I told the SHrink &quot;No I don't want Prozc, I am afraid Of it, It will make my head go crazy&quot; BAM - she ambused me for 10 minutes going on Prozac...help other patients..WHen she was done with me I was speechless, could not think straight, I finally started taking it. Prozac ruined my LIFE..Have new Shrink..so far Lamictal not helping..and making anxious, anxiety,nervous and stressed. I feel there is no hope..ALL because Shrink bulled me ito Prozac. I just want to die.

Depression	momRN, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	2	2	1	Female	13-18	6/18/2011 1:18:09 AM	My daughter (16yrs old) was diagnosed with depression in October 2010. Over the course of her treatment of 10-20mg, she was more engaged with normal activites, However, as the months went on, she started showing signs of phychosis and getting very hyperactive. Her sleep patterns were erratic. Her mental status started getting so bad to the point where she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for 3 weeks in may-june. I would not recommend this medication for teens. Everyone's body responds differently to prozac and she is no longer going to take this medication. Her psychiatrist put her on a couple of mood stab. and one antipsychotic. She is more calm now, and the doc plans to when her off to a lower dose of all the meds.

Panic Disorder	terrytizzib,  Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female		5/25/2011 3:52:52 PM	Without it I can be in a familiar place when suddenly I'm lost with no idea where I am or how to get where I'm going.This is frightening and leads to panic and tendency to not go out alone.With the drug, I may still get lost, usually in the very same place every time, but I don't panic or cry. I stay on course and soon everything starts spinning around and then falls into place and I am no longer lost or confused. If I stop the drug, I'm ok for 30 days then the panic returns. I have taken 20 mg per day for over 2o yrs.

Is that depression? I like being by myself, play games on the computer, watch a little TV, sleep, eat and go to church. Is that depression? I'm in my late 50s, so I've done everything just about under the sun. I don't have a husband or partner or pet. I feel like I don't have to go outside except to get the mail, buy some food, pay my rent, and that's all. Oh yeah, and go to the doctors. I have NO sex drive, so I don't have to worry about that.

Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	4	4	2	Female	13-18	5/2/2011 7:53:21 PM	I originally started this for depression treatment and some minor panic attacks and nervousness. I lost a lot of weight and I was feeling really good for maybe three months but then when school started, I developed extreme panic attacks to the point when I made myself vomit. My dose was going up and down between 10-20mg and I just felt awful no matter what. Now I'm over a month free of Prozac and I still feel awful. Lots of withdrawl side effects including stomach cramping, hot flashes, constant crying, unusual agitation, and I'm constantly analyzing my body. It was great at first but I kinda wish I shouldve found the right therapist before I rushed into drugs.

I returned from from a tour in Iraq about three months ago and my symptoms kept getting worse and worse. I've been taking Prozac for about a week now and I'm already feeling relief from it. It's like all the problems are still there, they just dont get to me like they used to. It's been very helpful so far.

Bipolar Depression	dawn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	4/21/2011 2:26:45 PM	Prozac was the first anti-depressive I ever used about 10 years ago. It worked. Since then I've been treated for drug resistant depression and drug resistant bipolar I. After trying what was likely 15 other ADs but felt like 1000s, I asked my head doc if we could use prozac. He was surprised to hear it had worked best for me of everything I'd ever taken. I've been on it for about a year not. It isn't my miracle drug, but it does help more than than the other newer, fancier, way more expensive drugs. Remember, newer isn't always better. Prozac is well tried and the effects are well know. This isn't true of brand new drugs.

Also after a year or so I felt as if the effects were decreasing. I also took Ativan for a year bc I was still having panic attacks. Then they switched my dose to 60mg a day and now I still take Xanax almost everyday bc I am still having panic attacks while taking my Prozac. I am really frustrated with the whole process and I will probably start down a new path to try and stop my panic attacks and awful emotional mood changes due to PMS. So it is not working well for me, but it might help someone with a different type of anxiety / mood dissorder very well.

Effectiveness has been good, I do not bear the same depressive mood swings I had become accustomed to. My reasons for the 3 star Satisfaction rating are: 1)I do not get enough sleep. Was resting 8 hours per day, now lucky to get 4. And 2) I find myself clammy and sometimes even sweaty in normal temperatures and overall conditions. I am hoping to find another medication that will give me the positive results, but without the side effects.

Also, I am not married and I plan on saving myself for marriage, but for some reason, this has had the opposite effect on me. It has increased a sex drive which is hard to deal with because I'm not married. I have had a tough time dealing with while on this, I feel more clingy and wanting my boyfriend more. It has also caused some headaches. I think I'm going to stop taking it soon.

I went to an OB/GYN thinking I was in menopause, but she checked my hormone levels and said I was not, it was the Prozac!  I tried to get off of it and my Dr. was out of town so the doctors on call, told me to reduce the dose, skip days etc. Nothing helped.  When my Dr. returned, I promptly had her switch me to Zoloft.  Why would I want to go through menopause twice?

I look forward to waking up every morning to see what each day brings - no more hangovers, anxiety or depression spells - my outlook toward everything is positive and focused. My family, friends and children say I have never been this good. Thank God for Prozac - at only 20mg too. You just need to find a drug that works for you, after trying Lexapro and Celexa - Prozac was my perfect fit. 
Depression	bclark, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	65-74	2/13/2011 10:42:28 PM	I took Prozac many years ago and all I remember is a weird urge to yawn followed by a feeling of relief.  I went back on Prozac about 18 mo. ago.  No more yawning.  I felt really good at first, lots of energy. Then I began having a slight feeling of restlessness, but not enough to stop.  I haven't gained weight.  Now my insurance won't pay for it, and I am going back on Celexa.  I am a nurse and have been on almost every antidepressant out there.  None are perfect, all have something good and bad, some worse or better than others.  Just have to be patient and try till you find one that works.  Have to stay on them long enough to work.
Depression	bree, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/13/2011 1:01:24 AM	I became depressed actually after childbirth, at age 21,in 1970, but didn't realize it. In 1995, I was prescribed Prozac, 20mg, and took it for around 12 years. I thought I could get off it because I didn't want to rely on a drug the rest of my life. After about a year, I wasn't successful. In September 2010, I was prescribed 40 mg and have done very well since. I am 62 years old. I've always said &quot;Thank God and Prozac.&quot;

Panic Disorder	jessikachu, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	2/6/2011 7:45:17 PM	I am actually commenting to find out about this drug. I will be switching over to 20mg of Prozac within the next week. I have been taking 20-40mg of Celexa for 7 months for severe generalized anxiety disorder. The Celexa worked wonders for me as far as curing my physical and mental anxiety symptoms. The only reason I am switching is because Celexa caused me to gain 35lbs. My doctor told me that it was very unusual and excessive weight gain considering I exercise 6-7 days a week and consume less than 1600 calories a day. My doctor hopes that this drug will work for my anxiety and also aid me to lose 20-25lbs. I would really like to know if anyone thinks this will work for me...???

I have mixed feelings about the drug. It certainly calms down much of my anxiety and allows me to function in an every day setting, i have also completely stopped binge eating. However, my sucidal thoughts are just as frequent as before i went on the drug. Many of my friends and family have complained that i am now vacant, as if the real me has been lost. I feel numb. Yet this prognosis is surely preferable to being unable to function at times.

I have to say from day one I was a brand new person! This drug changed my life!!! It did wonders for me! I started at 10MG and then slowly went up to 40mg and stayed there for about a year and half then went up to 60MG and stayed there for about a year... After taking the 50 and 60mg I felt the same as I did at 40mg. After spending about a year on the 60MG Prozac started to slowly but surely stop working... My anxiety started to come back and I started to get depressed. Stopped talking to all the friends I made... People would always ask if I was ok because I seemed so &quot;out of it&quot; and not myself. My doctor really didn't want to take me off of it because I did so well. I went all the way up to 80MG and then we decided it was time for a different drug. Prozac worked so well for me! but I wish it would have lasted a little longer...
Depression	concerned , 35-44 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	3	5	1		35-44	12/28/2010 6:30:57 PM	A friend of mine suffered from depression and addiction issues.  As a young teen he had suffered from untreated Spinal Meningitis. I've read that this kind of nerve/serotonin damage when combined with Prozac can cause suicidal tendencies in adults.  He took his life when he was 35 years old after several unsuccessful attempts.

Dont get me wrong it works great for my depression but the side effects have now gotten way out of control.The shakes were bad enough. But the nausea has increased along with bouts of acid reflux. Im now sick every day from about 4pm til wee hours of the morning. Cant sleep either.And the hot flashes are incrfeasing as well. They comne and go ALL day. Its embarrasing to say the least. Its Christmas Eve and I cant function right now.This is one of the worst reaction days...Im not taking it tomorrow,it would be like walking to a firing squad.

Depression	MamaNurse, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/4/2010 12:38:20 PM	Prozac is a miracle drug for me.  It keeps me calm and in control of my emotions.  No more embarrassing outbursts like before around family and friends.  However, it has increased my appetite - but I'd rather be a few pounds overweight than to drive my loved ones away with my emotions!  Have also tried Wellbutrin, but it might as well been a placebo.  Will probably be on Prozac the rest of my life.

I don't know if its the surgery or the drug that I am severly dry from head to toe, losing hair and sensitive.  My coloring has changed and veins are bulging.  Also, my teeth have yellowed and decayed.  I am looking forward to eliminating this.  Was on lexapro prior and it did not help.

Prozac gave me a new life.  Within a week of taking it, I began to feel better and more in control of my emotions.  By the second week, I felt like a near-sighted person who puts  corrective glasses on for the first time: &quot;So this is what a normal life is like&quot;, I thought. Now, I have more energy and drive than when in my teens.  I have not experienced any negative side effects. This medication works great for me!

I have always slept horrible since a kid but this seemed to give me nightmares.
Bipolar Depression	GRATEFUL, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	11/20/2010 9:27:37 PM	I was at the bottom, almost ready to do something final to my self. Went to my shrink and was put on prozac. Within 3 days of starting I was feeling level. All thoughts of suicide were gone and I felt more energetic. Can't thank the makers of this drug enough. Doctors say prozac works very rapidly with bipolar disorder. It sure did for me.My doctor said that the depression was an easily treatable condition. Coming from the depths of despair it was hard to believe, but the little ray of hope was something to hold on to. If you're reading this you are curious about prozac or are already taking it. Whatever you do, just keep on your meds and don't miss a dose. Either this is going to work for you or you'll have to try another med. There is hope, your brain chemistry is just a little off...but manageable on the right meds.People have also suggested group therepy so that you can discuss you disease with likeminded people. You might even find some new friends. GOOD LUCK, HANG IN THERE, AND TRUST IN YOUR HIGHER POWER. LOTS  OF LOVE.

Bipolar Depression	Ace, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	10/26/2010 4:06:21 PM	I have been taking prozac for 17 years all that time I was depressed suicidal and have now developed a tremor. I ahve now come off the medication (under supervision) and it has taken over one and a half years, with some pretty nasty withdrawal symptoms. For the 1st time in 17 years I feel happy and don't want to die any more. However I still have the tremor. I am not suggesting people stop taking prozac just that they are monitored while on the drug, it is a very good drug for some people but not so great for others like most medication. Don't think that just because you have been on it for a long time you will not be affected by the side effects. Have your Dr monitor you on a regular basis.

I was prescribed to Effexor XR which caused suicidal thoughts. I was also prescribed to Lexapro and I saw no results.

I also notice that I always have to move my legs when I am sitting down.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	10/11/2010 8:48:44 PM	10.5 yrs ago I was told by MotheRisk at Sick Kids in Toronto that this was safe to take during pregnancy. When my son was born he suffered from seizures, frequent (unexplained) crying episodes &amp; has respiratory issues. I discovered 2-3 yrs later that it was NOT recommended to use during pregnancy &amp; that what my son experienced was withdrawal symptoms. It only worked for a period of just over a year &amp; then I developed side effects of increased irritability &amp; it was not longer effective at treating my depression. If I could go back &amp; try something else, I would. I am now on something different that works much better.If you are planning on having a baby, I would NOT recommend this anti-depressant if it can be helped. (depression, especially during/afer pregnancy is not to be ignored &amp; can be extremely serious .. in some cases, the benefits outweigh the risks, so the decision of which medication to take can only be decided by you &amp; your dr)

I didn't want to resort to meds, but therapy alone was not helping me.  I tried Zoloft, but it gave me insomnia, tremors &amp; headaches.  I've been taking Prozac for over a month &amp; it has been a life saver- literally.  No side effects &amp; my quality of life has improved tremendously.

But most sadly the EXCESSIVE SWEATING became intolerable. It kind of snuck up on me...I had the sweating a long long time before realizing it was the drug. Had complained about it to several different MD's and none of them made the link. Finally something told me to look up the drug and I discovered that the sweatig is a side effect. Went of, the seating stopped. But I cannot take any of the SSRI's and most other antidepressant's now.

And I have tried to go off medication several times. It is something I know I will have to take the rest of my life. It is so worth it to me. It is the quality of life and the enjoyment I treasure the most. I thas changed my quality of life....

But overall works very well, you almost literally cannot think of committing suicide, it's almost as if those thoughts are &quot;blocked&quot; and you cannot think them anymore. I used to think and talk out loud of any situation I encountered, I don't do that anymore. My road rage has decreased and I can control my video game rage better.

I had to reduce to 25mg eventually due to week long dizzy spell on 50mg that came out of the blue..on 25mg I was still functional, felt good and no more dizzy spells or getting spaced out..  ..DID not want to switch..I said NO to my DR...She emotionally and mentally beat me down to taking it..I was so confused by the time she was done with me..I did not realalize how confused I was..Prozac was a disaster for me..Due to being on it for 7 weeks..(at 15mg it made my head go crazy) when I went back to ZOLOFT..it NEVEr worked and made my head hurt something awful..I Have NEVER been right since..DR have no right to beat the patient down into so much confusion that they cont't think straight..got a new Dr..put me on paxil..reaction in 3 days..Got another new DR..he is not sure what the problem is yet..possibly &quot;seratonin syndrome &quot;..I hate my origial treating doctor..I said NO, I do not to try prozac..I have been non-funtional since 6/2010 and feel horrible every day..So upset and miserable every day I can barely take it. I am NOW freightened to death of these antidepressants!! no wonder..If she had not FORCED the switch to Prozac I would be fine with now..(I 1st tried Celexa, got headaches, then Zoloft..somehow same Dr talked me into tryng Lexapro..got off it in a week due to side effects and went back to Zoloft w/ no problem..WHY force patient to swithcing again when patient says NO...they play GOD with our lives..BAd doctor..Presently my life is ruined..can't drive, shower, cant't do anthing..You bet I am afraid to try cymbalta..weight gain, fatigue.nightmare withrawal. I am now I destroyed person who cannot function and suffer every day because a DR wanted to play GOD w/ my life..REactions to 2 SSRI (celexa, lexapro)shoud have been enough..I have problems with SSRI..except Zoloft...

Depression	Christina, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/15/2010 10:24:05 AM	Prozac (40 mg) is a miracle drug for me. It stops my suicidal thoughts when I'm really down.  I was molested at 2 1/2 yrs old and for years, I thought I was crazy. I was on 20 mg for 10 years and a couple of years ago, my doctor increased to 40 mg.  No real side effects either. My doctor said I will probably be on this drug for rest of my life and I've accepted that.  I've also tried Lexipro and Cymbalta with not as much success. 
Depression	shellee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/11/2010 7:46:55 PM	I've been on Prozac 10mg for a little over a year. For me it has made me feel more balanced,I'm not on a roller coaster ride any more. I still have normal emotions(happy,sad,mad)it's just now things don't bother me as much, I get over things alot quicker now. I have gained some weight and the heat seems to bother me more, but I think that's small price to pay to feel better. Also I like that I don't feel like a zombie, I finally feel like me. What a relief...

My doctor is switching me to Celexa to see if that will help, but if my depression comes back, ill definately choose to go back on Prozac.

I taking many different medications and nothing seems to work. I had not seen a Dr. for my bipolar in over 3 years and it began to get out of control, i felt crazy at times. I started taking prozac almost 2 wks ago and i can tell a difference in my mood. Situations that would normally set me off, have not. I hope this medication keeps working for me so i can be my old self and acctually feel normal again.
Depression	katyarina, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	13-18	9/4/2010 4:23:06 AM	I had to start taking 10mg at first (breaking it in half) it tastes very nasty so you have to take it with food VERY QUICKLY! After about 3 weeks I really noticed a difference and I really liked the results. I didn't care about what anyone thought of me. I lost my appetite but I was still healthy. Before I hated talking to people and I had suicidal thoughts. My mom took me off them right away because she thought I was &quot;addicted&quot; (the pills weren't magically disappearing.) now I have extreme head aches and dizzyness. So careful when you stop! Cut your pill in half and start decreasing slowly
Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	9/2/2010 9:56:47 PM	I have been taking this medication for some time now and I love the way my mind stays clear.  Recently I ran out and I notice my mind is starting to cloud up once more.  Feeling uncomfortable thinking bad thoughts.  Having hard time renewing med through VA, not going to see my doctor for another 3 weeks.  With meds things go great, without meds things get confusing.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	9/1/2010 2:54:00 PM	 I took this medication for over a year as prescribed by my doctor to help treat severe depression. After about 2 wks of taking it I felt a big difference and improvement in my depression, but after just a few months I began to gain weight and I was putting on the pounds rapidly. Diet and excercise did nothing to help. I gained over 30 pounds in a few months time and was even more depressed than when I started taking the medication.

I recently started taking it again after the birth of my 5 month old and it has done nothing but actually make my depression worse. I am more suicidal now than I was before I started taking it. My mood swings are horrible and I get angry at EVERYTHING and then stay angry no matter what people do to help cheer me up.

I was on Prozac for about 18 months.  Although the drug was effective on my depression after about a month of taking Prozac, I had a very bad withdrawal from the drug.  I don't think I was informed of the risks of withdrawal when I started the drug.  Withdrawal was a very difficult process and resulted in several weeks of &quot;detox&quot; and a long period of recovery.

I was on 20mg, and felt like a zombie all the time. I never laughed, smiles, felt good, but I never felt bad, depressed, or suicidal either. Within a week it totally killed my sex drive. I would cringe if my husband even came near me. Then the migraines, insomnia, and sweating started. There were a couple times when my anxiety OUT OF CONTROL. But it wasn't often. Overall I hated this drug, but it did keep me from wanting to throw myself off of a cliff. I take Wellburtin and Celexa now and don't have the side effects.

Still very anxious.  Increased stomach acid and nausea.  Trouble sleeping yet sleepy during the day.  When my doc prescribed Prozac, he said if it doesn't work at first, we'll double the dosage.  No way am I agreeing to do that.  I know we are supposed to be patient with these drugs but I need to see some improvement over the next week or it's time to have another talk with the doctor.

They all fell in one of the two categories: 1) did not work; 2) had severe side effects - anger, drowsiness, insomnia, dizziness, high blood pressure (of course each med had a different annoying side effect.I have taken Prozac 2 years ago while taking Cymbalta and that did not work. Recently, I was diagnosed with OCPD (obssessive compulsive personality disorder) and I want to give Prozac yet another chance. I just had nightmare withdrawal symptoms from Cymbalta and never want to go back to it again because of the extreme hypertension it caused me.

Woke up at 2:00AM with increase heartrate, very sour stomach/intestines and feeling lightheaded.  Could not get back to sleep.  Maybe I'll try using every other day for the first week and see what happens.  Ugh, my stomach/intestines are still raw.

I finally got up the nerve to see a doctor about this and he proscribed 20mg of prozac. Within 2 weeks I lost all sense of being depressed and was myself again. I have now used it for almost a year with the same results. My doctor did tell me to try 40mg but that gave me spuractic bursts of anziety so I cut back down to only 20mg. I wish I would have taken this med over 15 years ago I would have avoided many problems that developed due to the depression.

About 3 weeks into the dosage,I had a feeling of wellness,a feeling of the weight of the world taken off me.It was a wonderful sensation.I will take this medication til my last day.

THe Zoloft helped with anxiety as well...Switch to Prozac was a miserable failure..caused massive anxiety attacks..then switched back to Zoloft, 25mg and in 3 days got massive anxiety attacks..No Zoloft on Mon, 6/7/2010. Decided to try taking 12.5mg 2x/day. (Not 25mg Zoloft at once.) Ok yesterday, ok so far today. HOPE this plan works till get to Psychiatrist Friday 6/28....and can start taking 25mg Zoloft in one dose by Monday 6/14 w/no anxiety atacks.(By Monday all the Prozac shoud be out of my system, takes 2 weeks per Dr.) Presently experiencing uncomfortabel level of low anxiety, wake up tense, easily agitaged. Have to take .50mg Ativan every 4 hours NOW. . Hope this works out and I get comfortable again, no raging anxiety attacks..and the Zoloft starts working and helping me again like it did before switch to Prozac..Before it kept me level, even, 80% functional. WIth the (1) .50mg Ativan, did not experience any anxiety discomfort since 2007..till switch to Prozac..I do keep light beer in frig. due to the fear of anxiety attack. It helps till the next needed .50mg Ativan kicks in..WHat a mess.

Dr. switched me to PROZAC. 23 days 10mg, no side effects. THEN 10 days alternating 15mg, then 10mg etc. THEN 15mg/day. Day 6 on 15mg..almost went CRAZY..THAT WAS my WARNING. Reduced to 10mg 2 days.no anxiety issues. Dr. told me to alternate 15mg, then 10mg etc. During the next 5 days, ANXIETY escalated Out of Control..(also take .50mg Ativan, anxiety was overriding the Ativan,had to take more) Still anxiety raged on me. Never had this much anxiety since 2/2007 while on Zoloft..POINT..LISTEN to your body..if you go crazy on an increase of Prozac..it is not the right med for you!!! Dr. switched me back to ZOLOFT 25mg/day (lowest dose) within 2 days my Anxiety started to rage out of control again..Culprit was the Prozac. MY WARNING. Had no side effects till 15mg/day Prozac..you body is telling you this is not the right med for you..LISTEN to your body. If you don't..you will screw up your body..NOW after 7 days 25mg Zoloft..anxiety raged out of control again..DUE to switch to Prozac..Since 2007 on Zoloft, NEVER had raging ANXIETY. Stopped taking 25mg Zoloft due to anxiety..THE PROZAC screwed up my system big time. Also, per DR. Prozac stays in system for 2 weeks..HOPE I can resume Zoloft w/no anxiety issues next week..UNTIl I switched to Prozac, after 3 years on Zoloft, NEVER had any raging anxiety issues...NOW I do..BE careful..IF YOU get an adverse effect from Prozac..stop taking it or go to lowest dosage (5mg) till get to DR. YOUR BODY is telling you it is not tolerating the Prozac..I am now in very bad shape..raging anxiety..had to take 1mg Ativan yesterday to prevent it from raging..NEVER had this problem taking Zoloft 2007 till now.
Depression	High Desert Patient, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/8/2010 12:59:31 AM	Prozac was perscribed as a secondary drug to Wellbutrin, when increasing it gave me stomach  and chest pain. I was being treated for panic attachs, insominia, anxiety, along with depression. Prozac worked fast for me and I would feel happy for hours afterwards. This enabled me to get things done that would take me forever. I became the energizer bunny, unfortunatly when I changed medical insurance my new doctor told me that Prozac was an old drug and would only give me Wellbutrin after that. Now I am back to being in the middle, no ups or downs now. But I still have problems with anxiety and sleeplessness.

It has been approximately two weeks and the symptoms of deep, unexplained depression are back with avengeance.  What choice do I have but continue taking this drug, despite my concerns regarding its affect on my health.  I do not think I could cope without it.

Other	DASIV, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	4	1	Male	45-54	6/1/2010 4:03:49 PM	I have only been on this Med for less than two weeks. Too soon to determine effectiveness or sexual side effects. However, I noticed right away that when I go to sleep, I startle myself awake several times before I actually sleep soundly. I wake up gasping and yelling after just nodding off. Almost like sleep apthia (Cant spell it). I wonder if anyone else has had this.

Advise: Take it in the morning.  It has really helped with my depression and increased in energy level.  I am very sensitive to medication, the pros have out weighed the side effects. It does take a little longer to get in the &quot;mood&quot;.  Over all I am happy to have finally found a depression medication that works with my Seroqual.

Panic Disorder	loveit, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/30/2010 8:19:04 AM	I started getting panic attacks when I was a very little kid (I can remember having them as young as age 7).  Finally, at age 40, I gave up trying to &quot;be macho&quot; about it and went to see a psychiatrist.  This was very difficult for me because I always related &quot;psychiatrist&quot; with &quot;inability to cope&quot; and I've always prided myself on being able to deal with anything (even managing my panic attacks for 30+ years).  The reality is, I wasn't really dealing with panic as much as I would just avoid putting myself in situations that might cause panic.  (Those of us that suffer from general panic disorder know that's not easy--sometimes it comes out of nowhere!)  I finally got sick and tired of always having &quot;will this cause a panic attack?&quot; in the back of my mind.  I've been on 20mg for three years now.  WOW!  What a difference!  It absolutely has changed my life!  It's so nice to feel normal (i.e. &quot;panic free&quot;) even in stressful situations.  I'm so thankful for this drug!  I'm just mad that I spent many years equating &quot;seeking help&quot; with &quot;weakness&quot; or &quot;going crazy/can't deal with things&quot;.  I'm perfectly sane and rational--my body just chemically did strange things.  Not anymore!  Prozac made a world of difference for me.
Depression	Cindy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	5/29/2010 3:55:40 PM	I would go so far as to say PROZAC RUINED MY LIFE. (7) weeks starting at 10 mg..Major bad reaction at 15mg..thought I would go crazy..reduced to 15/10mg ev. other day last week...MAJOR increase in ANXIETY. It was getting out of control..Took .50mg Ativan for anxiety..needed .50mg 4 hrs later..wished I had never switched from ZOLOFT, which I start again in 2 days. Presently feel HORRIBLE..withdraw..5mg today, no Prozac tomorrow..had to take .50mg Klonopin am today to prevent major anxiety attack..it's holding..7.5 hrs later took .50 Ativan (anti-anxiety med) to make sure this anxiety stays down. A nightmare..Expect to have a rough transition to the Zoloft 1st month..Prozac stays in system 2 wks after stopping..maybe longer..who knows...PRAY the Zoloft works again...You never know. WHat a mistake FOR ME to try PROZAC.

It helps with my ability to think clearly, but im not sure if its working lately, maybe im just too stressed.

THEN, increase to 15mg 1 day, 10mg next day, etc. for 10 days. THEN, increase to 15mg/day.Day 7 I got an adverse reaction..head felt wierd, thought I was going to go crazy...NOW, my DR. wants me to take 15mg 1 day, 10 mg, next day, ect. for 4 weeks. THAT would make total 3 month on this Prozac to see if it is helping. THEN go 15mg/day...I am now worse and unable to function at all since adverse affect and I am irritable, anxious and upset with all of this..IF get an adverse reaction at 15mg again..that's it for me...I am miserable and scared...going to DR. this Friday to talk about this..I am suffering

In conjunction with weekly therapy, Prozac has made such a difference in my life. I am very sensitive to new medications, and did not experience the typical rough transition the first few weeks. The only side effects I can complain about are frequent nightmares and an increased appetite, but I will gladly deal with those for the peace of mind I've finally achieved.
Depression	Marybelle23, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	5/20/2010 3:54:28 PM	I took Prozac (Fluoxetine) for Depression/Bipolar and bulimia for 2 years. At first it worked like a miracle. It was like I drove out of a hurricane into a clear, beautiful day and all I could see in my rearview mirror was a storm I never wanted to go back to. Had a strong craving for sweets, I practically only ate Twizzlers, and lost a significant amount of weight. I had no more racing thoughts, I was reasonable and clear-headed, etc. But after about a year and a half, the honeymoon ended and I guess my body got used to it and all of a sudden all of my old symptoms came back, EXCEPT for my binge eating. If Prozac did one thing it stopped my Bulimia altogether. Prozac was great for me, while it lasted.

Depression	Tessemasgirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	5/17/2010 6:35:43 PM	I took this medication for two years. I was living in an extremely abusive environment with my mom and i honestly believe that if it hadn't been for this medication, I would have given up on life. The good thing is this medicine made me not be able to really &quot;feel&quot; my emotions. This was great for when I was sad. People could yell at me and it wouldnt even phase me. On the other hand it also 'numbed' out the good in life so I could never really ENJOY a fun/great moment. It was almost like I was a robot. It also messes with your sex life. It makes it very difficult to get in the mood. This medicine has been around a long time so all the side effects are known which was great. If I had to take this again, I would.

Depression	sunnygirl83, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/15/2010 4:23:38 PM	This is the only antidepressant that has worked for me. I have tried most of the others with very bad reactions. The most well known antidepressants caused severe mood swings, weight gain, loss of sex drive, loss of hair, fatigue, anxiousnes...I could go on. The prozac really helped level me out. I finally feel like me again. My skin doesnt crawl. I have more energy. I get out of bed with a spring in my step. I have started excercising again. And my sex life has made a dramatic improvement. Overall, this is the one for me. 
Depression	JoJuice, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	5/15/2010 12:58:48 PM	I have been on and off this drug 3 times andnow I'm going for a 4th time.  The drugs helps me quite a bit, but the side effects become the next problem.  It takes about 6 weeks to work and I need to go up to 40mgs. As you feel better you focus on the negative effects of the drug.  The better mood you take for granted.  For me the sexual side effect cause me great fustration and then I just can't sleep.  This time around I'm gong to take just 20mgs with remeron and see how that goes. Oh, and don't give up on God.  Be well.

Still taking Wellbutrin w/Prozac. Have experienced extremely stressful events in last year.  Found myself sleeping away the day, not wanted to do anything. Had to force myself to do the basics each day.  Unable to work due to all this emotional trauma.  The side effects I have are: extreme nasuated, more depressed and more anxious.  I have lost 10 lbs in 2 wks. because I have no appetite. (only positive, though not healthy) Started today with horrible acid reflux and pain in my stomach. Should have contacted my Dr. today, but figured I would give it a few more days--don't think this is the one for me.  Unable to do anything and really don't care about anything.  Does seem to make me jittery &amp; I have been having to take Ativant because of heart palpitations, even though I am on heart meds. for those they have increased since being this. Will be calling the Dr. first thing Monday morning!

Depression	Cindy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	55-64	5/13/2010 12:01:41 PM	Day 31 on &quot;generic&quot; Prozac. 10mg, 5mg 2x/day.

Lack of motivation...do not laugh....cn't read  book..can't make decisions...DR. appointment tomorrow..will report later..probably will get dosage increased...no side effects that I am aware of... hoping for better beneifts with increaed dosage...I do think it takes 6 to 8 weeks to really work.

Depression	sandy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	55-64	5/12/2010 10:21:50 AM	I just started this med.  Has anyone experienced dizziness or light-headedness when first starting prozac?  I'm hoping it will go away because I do think I feel better.  My anxiety seems to be a little less and I am experiencing fewer episodes of &quot;imagined&quot; aches and pains.  Please respond if you've had nausea or dizziness.  Your response will be appreciated.  Thanks!
Panic Disorder	spunky, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/11/2010 8:19:39 PM	Was previously on capsule Prozac for years.  It stopped working so I weaned myself off of it.  In about 6 months I became VERY ill...Constant panic..felt like my adrenaline was constantly going through my body...couldn't sleep..afraid, could not eat, lost 40 pounds in a period of 3 weeks.  Went back to Dr. and she put me on Generic Prozac tablets. It took me awhile to increase to 20 mg because I have a &quot;pill phobia&quot;, which goes along with my panic/depression symptoms.  It took at least 6-8 weeks to start feeling at least to 75% better.  I have noticed I feel tired more now and my sex drive is good, but it is difficult to orgasm.  I will never go off of this medication again, because I truly feel that if I had not started back on it I would have died...I could not eat at all or sleep.     I have never been so sick in my life and afraid.  I was offered other medications to try but I will stick with the Prozac.  Keep in mind that it may not work the same with all people, my dad and my sister can not take it.  It made them worse because they were bipolar.

Bipolar Depression	Becky Lawson, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	5/11/2010 1:12:39 PM	I used Prozac for many years, and never had a problem with it. I had to change Doctors because mine was going int research. New Doctor new medication. I tried to tell them Prozac worked, but they always had their own plans. So I haven't been able to take it for a long time, but it is an excellent drug for Bi-Polar treatment.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	5/10/2010 11:46:40 AM	Took this years ago with great results, this time though I am having morning shakes and anxiety and bouts of yawning. I am less tired though and a bit less depressed.  My sex drive has increased, which is great. I think I need to wait longer to see the full effects of this medication.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/5/2010 8:20:33 PM	I suffer from Unipolar depression/Major depressive disorder. Went thru 1 yr. w/ a terrible Dr. I was completely disabled. Most days I could only lay in bed and sob uncontrolably. I slept about 16 hrs a day. Felt worthless, guilty, hopeless. Thought about suicide alot. Cut myself frequently. Had social anxiety. Couldn't concentrate on anything. Had trouble making even the smallest decisions. Got confused easily. Had anxiety for no reason. Didn't bathe, brush my teeth, or get dressed every day. Stopped going food shopping, did nothing. Had to force myself to do even the smallest tasks. Lost my job over all this. Finally, my husband made me go to a new Dr. and she put me on Prozac. It took about 6 to 8 wks to work for me. Once it did I started feeling better. Eventually I got up to 80mg per day. Then I felt like I was at about 80%, which was great compared to the way I had felt. Had to go off the prozac b/c my husband wanted a baby. I'm in my 7th month now n I'm kind of ok. I'm coping. Can't wait to get back on the prozac though.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	4/22/2010 12:09:44 PM	For as long as I can remember I've had depression issues and mood disorders as well as an anger problem, etc. I've been taking fluox. for 3 years now and it definitely helped with my anger. That was the most effective part, something that normally would make me so angry inside wouldnt &amp; I would be able to assess the situation. However, I still felt depressed quite a lot, like not wanting to get up &amp; go outside for days. So the Prozac/Fluoxetine was 50/50 for me. Good for anger issues, not so good for a mood elevator.

I haven't had any suicidal thoughts and no other side effects.  It has helped with my anxiety problems and insomnia. Combined with talk therapy, Prozac has really helped me.

Able to get to gym in afternoon. It hard to get out the door, once out I get to gym. THen I eat dinner and go to bed and wath TV. tired. SO far it is not making any difference, no side effects, able to tolerate, maybe a little jittery in morning. Oh please, this has got to work by end of 4 weeks. the waiting is so hard. I am hopeful, sort of.

At first my low dosage did nothing for me. Now I take 40 mg and feel so great. I'd be up and down all day, sleeping all the time and having god awful panic attacks for no reason. The only downside is my wicked heartburn. Other than that I love it. My libido is up and my moods and anxiety are super steady now.

I take one 10mg pill a day and can take two if necessary.  No side effects at all.

I had horrible panic attacks, tired all the time, yawning non-stop. Not to mention anxious, nervous, and not myself at all. The last day I took this I was a total zombie out of it completely. I stopped taking it and will not take this medication ever again.
Depression	davbrok, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	35-44	4/10/2010 11:13:35 AM	Taking this for anxiety and depression. This isnt really a reveiw, but a question if anyone can answer. I don't have the loss of intrest i sex. But for some reason, I'm unable to ejaculate during sex. Trust me, the lasting a long time is great. But It may start to cause problems eventually w pressure and the concerns of my partner feeling inadiquate. I keep reaffirming its ok. But still is a question.

Insomnia was worst side effect.

Since then he has threaten suicide publicly and spent 5 days in inpatient care.  He returned home with a larger dose of prozac and two weeks later he swollowed a whole bottle of pills and walked into the woods.  We found him but he is hospitalized once again.  He is legally an adult so we have no say in his health care.  He is very mad that we interrupted his attempted suicide and will not allow us in to see him. This is not my son...it is the prozac acting.  Just my experience and thoughts.

Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	3/25/2010 10:27:11 AM	It took a long time to find the right dose and have this fully kick in (10 weeks), but ultimately it helped a lot with depression, energy, and concentration. The sexual side effects were annoying at first but went away after about 7 weeks. It isn't a miracle cure, but it's been very helpful as one component of my treatment plan. I also feel less irritable, which is nice for me and the people around me (!).

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	3/23/2010 5:03:32 PM	I was started at 20mg and had it increased to 40mg after one week.  Before starting the med, I was suicidal at times, but became more suicidal once I started Prozac.  It made me think more clearly about my plan to kill myself.  If my husband had not intervened and called the cops, I would have killed myself.  I was not myself - angry, swearing, and insisting the world would be better without me.  Luckily, I was hospitalized before I could harm myself and am now on Pristiq.

It made no difference at all. I couldn't even tell I was taking it. Dr upped the dose to 40 mg. Same thing. Could see no difference in night sweats or hot flashes at all. Still wasn't sleeping very well at night either. The Dr finally put me on 80 mg. I tried that for over a month. I decided to just stop taking the Prozac. I didn't even have to wean myself off. I just stopped. I didn't notice any difference after stopping the Prozac either. Like taking jelly beans.

I've been experiencing all my normal signs of moodiness and anxiety only way worse.  The side effects are unbearable. I am tired all the time, yet can't sleep at night, I have headaches constantly, a strange taste in my mouth, feel paranoid, have heartburn, want to sleep the day away and wake up wanting to sleep more.  I've only been on it for 5 days, but I'm considering going off and back to Ativan as needed instead.  I don't like the Prozac at all.

I have suffered from Bipolar disorder for as long as I can remember. I have gotten better and didn't think I needed it anymore and stopped taking it several times. I usually have to have my husband remind me that I am not functioning very well without it.  I just went through a horrible time with depression so bad I was thinking I'd be better off dead.  I went back on and am taking 80 mgs.  I will never go off of it again.  The world is a better and brighter place when I have this demon in control.

Prior to taking the med, I had severe hot flashes daily, and at night, the sweats, keeping me awake. I was tired all the time as a result. Could only wear sleeveless tops to school (teacher). Suffered with these premenopausal symptoms for nearly two years before asking for help. DR could not prescribe hormone therapy due to family history of heart disease. She asked if I would like to try this med, and I was ready to try anything at that point! I was only 54 years old, feeling like 65. Took a couple of weeks, but noticed reduced hot flashes immediately. No more sweats at night. Sleeping better as a result. Hot flashes occur, but not as frequent nor as intense. Much more manageable. I can even wear a sweater from time to time! I'd recommend this drug to any woman experiencing premenopausal hot flashes. Don't know how it works, but it does! Energy level increased! Feel like a 35 year old instead of a 56 year old now!!
Depression	trinity1956, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	2/27/2010 6:17:37 PM	I've been taking Prozac (20mg.) for 3 wks., along with strattera (80mg.) which I've been taking for 10 months for depression &amp; anxiety.  Isn't helping the depression or anxiety plus I'm laughing hysterically one min. and very angry the next for no reason.  Anger isn't my normal personality.  My whole body feels strange like it's somewhere else &amp; my head &amp; face feel like slight electrical charges with a swishing sound, which is driving me crazy.  I've been on Zoloft, Paxil, strattera, buspirone &amp; visteral, none have worked &amp; most made me feel worse, not to mention soooooo tired all the time.  Can't they come up with something that actually works right?  Oh yeah, can't seem to stop eating either &amp; I'm already way overweight, not good for my health, that's for sure.

Got rid of depression, but not panic attacks. Prozac increased my appetite about 100 % &amp; resulted in unwanted weigh gain.  Switched to Celexa, which works much better for both panic&amp; depression with no side effects, no weight gain.  Remember to use the lowest effective dosage.

Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	Iris, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	2/23/2010 10:52:15 PM	When I was on a low dose I started to feel good. I was crying all the time and I could not stop. Prozac helped me stop crying and I could actually feel the difference in my brain. When the dose was increased I noticed that my senses where hightened and then I started to have funny thoughts that I have never had before. I wanted to cut myself and I was thinking of a way to kill myself and I was actually making plans. I wanted to hang myself and then I thought of bleeding myself out. I caught that in time and just in time. I was taken of the Prozac immediately and unfortunately that drug did work for the depression. I wonder if the dose had not been increased would that have been a safe drug for me. I do not think that I would be willing to take that risk.
Depression	drwow, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	2/22/2010 2:19:52 AM	Was on Wellbutrin. Loved it initially, then plateaued. Started Prozac - 8 days of 20 mg was all I could take. I felt like I had horrible jetlag 24/7!  I'm now 2 weeks off it and still feel horrible - my sleep patterns are terrible. I wake up sometimes at 3am and can't fall back asleep but I'm too tired to get up.  I'm tired all the time it seems, which is odd because this is the best shape I've been in for years (I go to the gym 5 times a week and love it - except for not going recently because of prozac).  So I hate this drug with a passion. It's been horrible and I just pray these side effects stop soon!

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	2/19/2010 11:56:40 AM	This medication takes at least a month to take full effect. The first week I would wake up with nausea during the night. By the second week, I felt numb to most emotions. Both of these symptoms suck, but they go away. Without this medication, I don't think I would be able to function. It really worked for me while I was on it for about 7 months, I came off of it for a couple months, and the depression and anxiety came back, so I'm going back on it. The medication alone will most likely not cure anything, as I have learned, but combined with counseling, I'm hoping to heal myself.

I have jsut started my third week at 20 mg of the generic version. The first week I felt somewhat level, was less angry and got out of bed on the weekend. The second week I experienced more anxiety and daily headaches. I am hopin ghtat the anxiety and headaches dissipate over time, so my rating might change. I am going to see it through for at least another 4 weeks. Holding out hope...

I have no side effects...many people complain of libedo loss...never happend to me; at 67 years old I still enjoy intense, multiples.  I take the generic and have no complaints...happy to feel reasonably content most of the time...living alone has greatly enhanced my serenity for the last 13 years; a positive attitude, strong faith in God &amp; retirement have also helped.

When PTSD hit me, I was taken off it and put on something else - Effexor. Now I am up to 4 psych meds and nothing works. I believe my brain has been damaged by being put on large doses of meds and then taken off abruptly. I have gone through screaming hell and told by doctors I was imagining it. Now, of course, everyone knows. I believe they damaged my brain permanently as nothing now works that used to.

I went from Celexa to this because the side-effects from Celexa were getting hard to deal with. I took my first pill at work and that was the biggest mistake I have ever made. Within 20 minutes I emotionally flat-lined. I didn't want to do anything at work and while I was on my lunch I started crying uncontrollably. I cried for an hour and a half without being able to stop. My emotions were all over the place. I ended up being fired after the president of the law firm I worked for saw me break down in the hallway. I lost my job because of this stupid medication.

On 20mg daily, generic and my OCD symptoms are almost non- existent anymore.  I also no longer long live each day with the anxiety from repetitive thoughts worrying about mistakes I've made, what I said, etc.  No problems with my sex drive, I sleep well (because I'm not always worrying or doing 'routines') and I have actually lost weight.  It's like I have more control over real life and not the pretend life I was leading.  I also attend therapy with a psychologist.  The combination of Prozac and therapy is working really well for me.

Trazedone made me tired, zoloft was like taking a sugar pill- even after the doctor quadrupled my dose, xanax made me feel like a half-asleep zombie, and valium messed me up. Prozac has worked for me for the past 3 months. It has been like a complete miracle drug. I have no side effects, and I haven't had a suicide thought/attempt, or a panic attack since i started taking it.

Depression	N, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	1/10/2010 2:19:05 AM	This is a really bad drug. If I would have continued using it I would have committed suicide. I had a friend in England who took it and he commited suicide and so did his mother.....This drug should be off the market.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/7/2010 9:53:11 PM	I love this site: &quot;should not be taken with anti-epileptic meds&quot;.  I got diagnosed with major depressive disorder while getting side-effects from 1 of my epileptic meds (I took 4 different types daily).  Rather than take me off the med that was causing the side-effects they decided to prescribe Prozac.  Within a week I was looking for a gun (luckily it is much harder to find one in NZ than in USA).  I was completely homicidal/suicidal.  My son was going to get the first bullet because I decided he would be worse off without me - duh, with me killing myself afterwards.  The idea of being a 'clock tower sniper' appealed to me so much I took myself to the doctor b4 I did something about it!!!  Horrible drug, anti-depressant my a**e.

Panic Disorder	bellavita, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/4/2010 11:52:06 AM	I was suffering from panic/anxiety attacks after my husband and I had separated a few months ago. The scariest part was that I felt I had a 50lb weight on my chest and I couldn't breathe. And when I began to have suicidal thoughts is when I reached out for help. I was very skeptical that Prozac could help me. After 2 weeks, I began to notice a difference. I've now been on it for 2 months and I now have my life back!!!!! My advice to people out there who are suffering with depression, panic or anxiety.....get help. You are not alone, you deserve to be happy. Pick your head up and demand your life and happiness back!
Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/4/2010 4:34:26 AM	I've taken many anti-depressants for my anxiety/panic disorder for over 10 years. It took me long enough to find Prozac . I've been on it for over 3 years now and it has worked amazingly for me. Of course, no pill will ever heal me completely, but prozac has made me break old habits, go out of my comfort zone, etc. so much easier. Along with xanax, it's a great combination. People need to keep in mind that everyones bodies react to medications differently, so this may or may not be the right med for you, but it is for me!

Prescribed to my wife after her mothers death she started to get more distant and now we are separated and everything seems fine to her, I would say emotionless now. She says she is very happy to be by herself, family and friends are shocked as I. As I learned about the drug on my own I find she has been having severe reactions. I wrote the prescribing doctor a letter outlining the problems and they are going to at least taking her off this drug. Her bizarre behaviour I thought was just me but now find other family members wondering what is wrong with her. My only goal now is to get her off this stuff and in time, maybe, just maybe we can save our marriage. I do not want this woman back but maybe in time my wife will return.Please beware if you or any family members are on or starting this drug. Understand the possible severe side effects that go along with it.

I had the unfortunate side affect of losing massive amounts of hair each time i would shower (I would say my hair is 40% thinner now.) My doctor changed my prescription to lexapro today d/t hair loss. I have not taken prozac for 4 days and already my aches  and pains have returned to my body which are very unbearable.  I wish their was a way to continue taking prozac without losing my hair.

All was ok until they uppped th 20mg to 40mg. I am also on Dextroamphetamine 10mg ER 3x daily, and Alprazolam 2 mg 3x daily.When on the 40mg Prozac, combined with the others, I was unable to do much and stare at a Monitor. Xanax and Prozac cancelled the Dexedrine (even at 15mg ER). I am currently taking generic Prozac 20mg (one daily), generic Dexedrine 10mg ER (3x daily), and generic Xanax (No more than 1.25 mg 2-3x daily)and it has made a WORLD of diffrence. I am focused, anxiety well under control, barely notice Prozac, and the Dexedrine is for ADHD, and also fits this mix well at the 10mg ER dose rather than the 15mg dose. I feel alive, aware, normal, active and can focus. Be careful about taking ANY of these in high doses! I plan on weaning to lower dosage on all 3 within 2 months. My aim is to be chemical free sometime next year, or the BARE MINIMUM of what I need. I managed 45 years without Prozac or Dex, and have moved up the ranks in almost all jobs I had. The brain adapts, and should not be a chem lab for psychiatrists! Raed adverse reactions or discuss with your doctor before taking ONE Prozac! Hope this helps.

It works effectively for my depression with a minimum of side effects. My ususal dose was 20mg, which I would take either day or night.

I hate the idea of having to possibly switch to something else.

Over the years, my doctor has tried 9 different anti depressants anlong with prozac and it didnt help much...UNTIL... the new drug ABILIFY was prescribed in addition to prozac. Prozac , zoloft, celexa, cymbalta, etc. doesnt work for me. Prozac AND Abilify together have been wonderful! Take my advice and dont quit using Prozac...just ask your doctor to prescribe Abilify to take along with it!

Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/24/2009 2:20:38 AM	Started taking this drug when full panic attacks starting taking over my days due to stress which then turned into sever depression,.  I felt so bad that I felt like I was literally going to loose my mind.  Saw the Dr. and he prescribed Prozac in conjunction with Xanax for sleep and the panic attacks.  After a couple of days, I no longer needed the Xanax; the Prozac put me back in a mood I could handle.  It may not work for everyone but I do highly recommend it!
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	10/23/2009 12:31:20 PM	Prozac worked great for me for about four months on 20 but then it seemed not to be doing much.  My doctor upped it to 40, but still no effect.  I still have depression and ptsd pretty bad.  I hope to go off this medication and try celexa or pristiq asap with my doctor's approval.  This medication was good in that it also did not make me tired as others had and it reduced my appetite enough that I lost 15 lbs which was good for me.  I can't say I had any bad effects, I just don't feel it is helping anymore.

It's made me the person that I used to be, I can get out of bed in the morning and function like everyone else can.  It's made vast imporvments to my home, social and school life.  
Depression	smiling_gal, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/21/2009 11:48:23 AM	I have been on Prozac for at least 15 yrs. I have tried several different anti-dpressants to no avail. Prozac works the best for me! But, that doesn't mean it will work the same for everyone, my son tried and it and he couldn't take it, made him feel worse, as with my sister, neither could she, so, it doesn't mean its going to react with everyone the same.

Depression	abbysmom40, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3		45-54	10/16/2009 9:46:37 PM	I have had a great deal of nausea, so, I am keeping something in my stomach, or I am miserable. I feel better mentally, as I have suffered chronic depression for years, and have been medicated since 1995.  I have tried several medications, always reluctant to take prozac because of &quot;hearsay&quot;. Sleeping, has been a big issue too, not sleeping too well, but I am not feeling tired during the day.   I am hoping these side effects will pass.  I do, however, think 20mg's is not enough, and may need a higher dose.  
Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	10/16/2009 8:16:15 PM	My body has a habit of rejecting medication after about 9 weeks but so far i have been okay with this medication and have been stable for the first time in 2 years.
Panic Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	19-24	10/15/2009 7:26:00 PM	I've been on the generic brand for a while now and I am able to see a difference, however there are strange side effects.  About 30 min. after I take it I get very drowsy but I can't sit still long enough to go to sleep.  When I take fluoxetine at night I wake up in the middle of the night feeling restless and can't sit still.  When I forget to take it, I have horrible acid reflux because my stomach is in knots.  I haven't really decided if the pros out weigh the cons.

I find myself getting excited about silly things again, and overall it has been a good experience. I'm in it for the long haul...and I'm @ peace with that. Depression is a miserable experience. I've got myself back. Thank you!!!

I stopped eating for comfort and felt confident.  I did notice side effects, loss of sex drive, jitters, sleepiness.  The longer I took it the more normal I felt.  My sex drive did return, the weight did not.  I do notice that my response to alcohol has changed since taking prozac.  I blackout from drinking very easily and feel worse mentally after drinking.  The doctor said that is common because prozac and alcohol work against each other.  Prozac is the best drug I have ever taken.  My dose was increased to 40mg this summer.  I haven't noticed a big difference but still feel great.

I didn't feel that I could chance HTR so I had really suffered with sever hot flashes, mood swings, anxiety, some depression and feelings of &quot;cracking up&quot; for about 5 years. I've been on 20 mg of prozac for 7 months. . . it made me nausious for about 1 month. . .that passed and now I feel much calmer and able to cope with hot flashes. I also am able to sleep better. I lost about 10 pounds of my menepause weight gain. I feel a bit unmotivated now, but I'm retired and can handle that. My husband likes to be around me now, but I have no sex drive. . . although, it was always low for me.  I'm wondering if I could do as well with a lower dose. . . anyone out there who has tried that?

I took Prozac 10mg daily for about 2 months. I absolutely loved how this worked for me. My husband and I stopped fighting all the time, I felt happy, little things didn't bother me anymore. I did have some insomnia, but not a big deal. Didn't really effect my sex drive which is a huge plus. Unfortunately, I had to stop taking it because for some reason I was breaking out with a red rash all over my face. It looked like first to second degree burns. Really weird. And I'm one that can't be away from the sun, I love it too much. So forget that. When I stopped taking it, my face healed fine. Now I'm on Paxil, and I hate how tired it makes me and I have no sex drive. Need to find something else. I'm at a loss. I've tried Lexapro and Effexor XR too, which did nothing.

Depression	SpecialK, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	9/21/2009 11:17:54 AM	Well, I've only been on the generic version (fluoxetine) for 7 days. the past 3 doses I took caused awful gastrointestinal problems. I took the medicine before bed, and 20 minutes later, it felt like a ball of acid was churning in my stomach. It was awful. it almost made me vomit. After about two hours the burning sensation lessened but at least I was able to sleep. I tried taking the dose with dinner and although the severe burning-acid feeling was gone, it still caused discomfort in the GI tract. Because it's only been a week, I haven't had a chance to experience any mood changes.

I unfortunately got PPD again with my 2nd son 3 years later and started with 10mg of Prozac again and stopped after 8 days. I constantly had bowel movements for those 8 days and it added to my depressive and anxious state. Since stopping, I feel much better and my excess bowels have stopped.

This drug is wonderful - it took about a month to get in my system - but now I am able to handle all the horrors that life throws at me. I am able to sort things out and think rationally and take charge. I've lost weight, put things in order and am so thankful for my doctor's decision to put me on Prozac.

Depression	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	9/7/2009 6:30:30 PM	Prozac has helped me a lot. No other anti- depressant has worked for me. I take 20mg every other day. It has worked but I have not felt like my formal self since I got ill. It has made it so I can function and have some good times. So what I'm saying is it is not a cure all for me but I don't know what I would do without it. ONE QUESTION. It I take the brand name I'm ok. But the generic's don't seem to work for me or thats the way I see it. One generic by a certain manufacturer seems to work fairly well but I get mixed up if it is working or not. Of course the prices between the main brand and generic's is quite a bit. Has anyone else had this problem?? Thanks.

It helped to level my mood and lesson anxiety as well which was a nice bonus.  There were two side effects that bothered me however.  One was a racing heart, the other was more sexual related.  Either way, I'd like to find a med with the positive attributes without the side effects.
Depression	billybob, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	25-34	9/2/2009 11:28:46 PM	Took this after a divorce. I was curled up in a ball in my house and couldn't move. It worked for a good few years and then it didn't. Just stopped. I also noticed then that I was having the &quot;shock&quot; sensations. Then when I 1st tried to get off of it, the shock sensations really increased. It took several attempts and about a year to ween off of it. The shocks lasted for several years after that. I have been diagnosed with &quot;essential trmors&quot; and I am convinced that the years of Paxil use caused it. I say if you do take this drug to only take it short term.

In those eight months it's side effects nearly ruined my academic career.  I had terrible yawning episodes and felt tired (and literally would blackout for 10 minutes at a stretch while I was in class) all of the time. I could barely read a page without falling asleep and would forget what I read within five minutes.  Do not take if you have vision problems  as it causes them to get worse!  In short.....taking this drug can be disasterous for a college student!
Depression	Spot, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/30/2009 10:01:17 PM	Prozac worked for me, the first time I tried it, in only a few days. I stopped crying 24/7,&amp; realized how I had abandoned housekeeping &amp; personal hygeine totally. If I'm I miss taking my Prozac on schedule and under under severe stress, I still have some suicidal thougts, but NO actual plans or preparations for suicide, which I've done with other medications. The important thing for me is to remember to take the Prozac in the morning because it does lift my mood &amp; if I take it at night, I don't sleep at all. You must NOT exceed your doctor's prescribed dosage or instructions for any reason. Make a chart or use a calendar &amp; mark off each day after, not before, you take your Prozac. Don't be shy about telling your doctor everything you feel or think while you're taking Prozac. He can't regulate your dosage properly or know if it's the right medication for you, or if you need tests...if you don't give him the full facts and the truth. Besides Prozac, find someone, anyone, to tell your problems to. Don't hide from the world and think things will magically get better. They won't. Been there, tried that. Good luck to you. Spot
Depression	Gazboy53, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	55-64	8/30/2009 9:38:41 PM	I began taking 10 mgs of Prozac around 3 weeks ago. I noticed that many things that used to make me crazy no longer do so or not as much as they used to. However, in the past week I've noticed that I am unable to reach orgasm and climax and am also completely uninterested in having sex nor do I miss it. I do NOT want to be this way and it's causing me a lot of frustration. I don't know what to do. I don't want to stop taking the Prozac, NOR do I never want to have sex again or feel arousal, etc.

However, after a short while I began to experience attacks of awful stomach pain, like waves of pain you get with a bad stomach bug. It was a while before I began to suspect it could be the prozac causing it, but when I realized I stopped taking it and the attacks of pain disappeared. I am too afraid to take it again.

However, it makes me droopy and completely sex-less. I have been prescribed other anti-depressants but I heard some noise everytime I moved my head. I could NOT live with that...!

Depression	NovemberSparrow, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	35-44	8/19/2009 12:57:40 PM	I started Prozac about 3 wks ago.  I took it in the morning, as directed by my doctor, but felt dizzy, lightheaded, etc &amp; sleepy.  I started taking it @ night, but the next day, I'm nauseous.  Then, I started taking it with dinner (a bit earlier than bedtime).  When I wake up the next morning, I still feel like crap, no motivation &amp; after I've been up for a couple of hours, I'm sick to my stomach ALL day until evening.  I definitely don't FEEL any better, emotionally.

Stress accellerates the symptoms and overall pain. The Prozac helps relieve the stress in order to function daily. I hate having to rely on meds to feel better but I sure can tell a difference if I don't take it!
Depression	crazynurse, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/19/2009 3:56:09 AM	I started taking Prozac 15 years ago due to family situations, depression, and not being able to &quot;cope with life&quot; in general. I was started out on 10 mg daily in the beginning. As of now, I take 80-100 mg depending on the time of the year. I lost both my mom and dad within the last 8 years and have found by increasing my dose around holidays that I get through those times better. NO ONE should adjust their own medication without consulting a physcian first. And believe me, I have tried every other antidepressant out there and it took alot of conviencing for my physician to agree to the increasing of my dose. Today I feel happy, well adjusted, &quot;normal&quot;, and able to cope with any thing that comes my way.

It has slowed my thinking process where I can make rational decisions and not overreact to stressful situations. My PMS has quieted down and I sleep better. It has also cut back my midnight food consumption.
Depression	shellee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/16/2009 9:25:55 PM	I have been taking 10mg of prozac since the end of June for depression due to the death of a loved one and stress at work. I feel like a weight has been taken off my chest. I still have all my emotions good and bad, but I'm able to get over things easier. I sleep better at night and have more energy and feel more alert. If I forget to take it,I feel really tired and have no get up and go. One thing that I don't like is that I sweat more. I guess that is a price to pay to feel better. I finally feel normal, what a relief. :)

I found that after a while of being on 40mg that it began to do nothing for my OCD, it also made my anxiety worse. The real topper was that it made me completely impotent, no interest in sex, loss of caring about anything really. I would not recommend this drug to anybody, trust me there are so many others out there.

Obsessive over cleanliness. Some symptoms have been sleep loss, and slight depression.

I was put on Prozac weekly and it was life transforming! I lost the 45 pounds I had gained, the mood swings stopped, I was still able to &quot;feel&quot;! I stayed on this medication for approximately a year and a half and when I went off it, I was able to simply stop taking it, no weaning! It was truly a life changing gift that I will be forever grateful for.

Depression	SuzyQ, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	8/3/2009 7:11:04 PM	I was diagnosed with major depression at age 17 and have been taking antidepressants for the past 12 years. When I first started taking Prozac and had fantastic results --- depression symptoms decreased, no more suicidal thoughts, could actually get out of bed.  I started out at 20 mg and my doctor eventually increased my dosage to 40 mg.  This dosage worked fine for about two years.  Then I started to have signficant worsening of my depression symptoms.  The doctor then added Elavil in addition to Prozac.  Also tried Pamelor with the Prozac - both worked very well, but fatigue was extreme (and side effects were horrible). I don't mind mild side effects if it means the depression is gone.  I tried Remeron, Wellbutrin, and Celexa before returning to Prozac.  None of these worked as well as Prozac had initially.  I went back to 40 mg Prozac and did well.  My dosage was eventually decreased to 20 mg which I have been on for about 8 years.  My depression symptoms have been well-controlled with this &quot;maintenance dose&quot;.  I have been having more symptoms the past few months.  My doctor wants me to try Pristiq (which I will start tomorrow).  Overall, Prozac worked wonders when is was working.  I definitely developed a tolerance to this medication over time.  Side effects were pretty mild.  I definitely sweat more than most people and I have experienced some sexual side effects.  Overall, this drug saved my life but lost its effectiveness over time.  I wish it still worked as well for me as it did initially.  Definitely worth a try.    
Depression	hhrace, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	8/3/2009 6:55:59 PM	I have been on Prozac 20mg for about 2 months now, this is in addition to 300mg of Wellbutrin.  The Prozac was added because the Wellbutrin was not doing anymore. Prozac has helped with the depression, however I am always tired.  I feel like I can not get enough sleep and am constantly yawning. At work I have noticed that I am in a daze, I go through the motions but can't recall what I just did. At first I noticed an increase in  sexual arousal, which caused me some concern, however it is very hard to have an orgasm. I can not handle being so tired, I am going to call the doctor tomorrow and see about stopping the Provac.
Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	8/3/2009 2:33:12 AM	lack of energy, barely any change in my mood swings
Depression	six, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/2/2009 4:43:50 PM	I was prescribed 10mg once a day at my appointment last week, the same does I was on when I took several years ago. Doctors seem to find this the treatment of choice for those of us who suffer from chronic pain. Chronic pain is enough to trigger severe depression in anyone. I planed to go out this weekend and have a few drinks because you cant mix Prozac or the other medication I need to take for pain with alcohol, alcohol is a depressant so thats done and my plan was to start Prozac on Monday but I took my first does at 2:30 a.m., Sunday because I cant sleep (anxiety) I would like to go to bed. Prozac will make you sleepy; once your body is fully adjusted that sleepy feeling will pass. Take it at the same time every day; if the sleepy feeling is a problem take it at night before bed. Im taking my second dose at 8:00 p.m. tonight so I can sleep and I will stay on that schedule. I dont know why some people report weight gain and others loss, I think its the difference in how depression effects different people. In my case I warned my friends and family that I was starting this medication and that I will drop about 10 lbs in the first month. Thats what happened the first time I took it; I didnt want anyone to worry. I am already small and itll be quite noticeable. I never had side effects before but still told my friends and family what could happen. I have a great support system and they will watch me closely for red flag side effects while I get adjusted. Prozac takes a few weeks before the full effects are felt even if you start feeling the benefits right away. If you cant stay on this medication for the first month then you havent given it a chance. If you are having problems, talk with your doctor, they may need to adjust the dosage; if you cant talk with your doctor about your concerns then you have the wrong doctor, find one you can talk to. And what ever you do dont just stop taking it; you have to wean yourself off of it. Ill be back in a month 
Depression	missyr, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/1/2009 11:22:18 AM	well it's me again about prozac, i can say my life is normal now i mean the way i feel, but i am having the sweating side effect. overall i'm not stressing about things i used to get so worried about money and my kids like my son who is driveing i litterally used to have panic attacks about him driving, now i worry yes but i'm not thinking of excuses of why he can't drive the car. and the bills, yes i think about it but you know what we have always found away and thats not going to change, my husband and i have reconnected i don't look at him anymore and want to kill him(i know thats horrible to say) but that's the way i felt for over a year, but i have realized he's all i need him and the kids, it's like it was when we first met, i look forward to seeing him i don't dread it anymore. over all i am a much happier person and i hope other people who are suffering from depression can feel the way i am right now.  after my grandfather passsed away in 1993 that's pretty much when it all started then i became a drug addict for 10 years, i have been sober for 5 months now and have never felt better, but at the time i thought the drugs made me feel better the only thing that did was create distance with my kids, husband , my mom my sister and brothers, but now i feel like i am starting my life over, i wish everyone luck and i hope you all find what you need in life, missy

Panic Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	35-44	7/30/2009 11:34:57 AM	I started taking Prozac 20mg is January, 09 and it didnt help the panic attacks I was having so my doctor increased the dosage to 40mg. I have found relief from the Panic attacks, but I believe that I am experiencing severe reactions to the increased dosage such as, muscle twitching, nausea, tiredness, inability to sleep, and tremors. I am in the process of seeing a neurologist to make sure that there is nothing else going on and if not then I will have to try a different medicene. Not having the attacks anymore has been great but the side effects are miserable. I recommend to try a diffrent medication before trying Prozac, it may save you alot of trouble and money!
Depression	lt999, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	7/29/2009 1:40:35 AM	I was suicidal and depressed, and this did nothing but take away my energy to do any harm to myself. In fact, I was still depressed, and gained 35 pounds. I was in a terrible fog, and felt even more depressed, just less motivated. I felt like a tranquilized animal. Which now, years later I discovered the doctor had medicated me very wrongly, and treated me falsely all along. He did not answer my questions about the drug and would just increase the dosage when I begged for answers. I left his 'care' after 3 years of being prescribed a crap drug. Thank God for second opinions, otherwise I would have been stuck in depression longer. She adjusted my care. I don't know if THAT is effective in a review, but I will report that any extreme exercise regiment or diet I was put on did nothing. Prozac keeps the 35 lbs. of extra weight on you until you are weaned off of it. Then, like magic I lost all that weight.

I took it long ago for a bout of depression and it worked then, too.  When menopause kicked in, I needed something to help me and tried Effexor.  It was only &quot;OK&quot;.  Then I remembered the good results I had from Prozac and asked my physician to switch me.  It has been a life saver for me.  The only downside for me has been that my libido is almost nil.

Depression	missy robinson, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/24/2009 12:56:47 PM	i can't rave about prozac enough, i have been just a mom and a wife for the past 17 years of my life and i'm only 36 years old, at some point i lost myself, i forgot who i was and what i like, and slowly i am finding myself again. i do get tired at aroud 9 pm but i do get up at 5 am. over all i am enjoying my life more i can spend time with my kids without getting annoyed and anxious. i am still having problems with my marriage i feel i have been so distant from my husband for so long i just don;t know if we can find eachother again, or if i'm just ready to start allover with my own path in life. i feel alot of guilt over the seperation that has come between us but now atleast i am able to cope with the stress, i can concentrate at work and about the important things in life with my kids. i feel i have made so many mistakes while depressed like forgetting things feild trip permission slips, bagged lunches, important occasions, i didn't even go to my sisters baby shower because i just did't want to be around people and i just regret it so much. if you are suffering from depression try prozac i might work or you might have to try a few different ones to get the result you need, but prozac is my lifesaver!! it is worth a try i forgot what it was like to feel happy, just to have a smile on the inside instead of faking it on the outside to everyone. i am happy to wake up in the morning and have my morning cup of coffee it's not a bother for me to ake dinner anymore , it has made me come alive again.

Depression	gcc2380, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	7/20/2009 5:12:30 PM	My doc. prescribed me this after I quit my job &amp; had no insurance.  Before that I was taking effexor but hit a wall.  I have no energy, don't really want to be around alot of people, and have gained 20 pounds.  Don't know if it's related, but a month ago had a gall bladder attack and now have terrible indigestion &amp; have to be on Aciphex until we can figure out if I need to have it taken out.  I just feel like I'm in the dumps all the time.  I am nervous after reading some reviews, but I want to try Pristiq.  At this point I just I just need some relief.  The weight gain alone makes all the other symptoms worse!

When I tried the generic, I had side effects and was switched back to name brand.  Prozac has made such a difference in my depression. The small stuff doesn't bother me anymore. I stay calm in most cases. I have fibromyalgia, was tried on Cymbalta,and it didn't help me. There is nothing like Prozac!

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	7/16/2009 11:36:59 AM	I was prescribed 20mg of Prozac per day for depression and OCD.

It has helped my depression, but I am tired all the time.  I feel like I'm dragging my body through the day. When I am off work I sleep about 12 hours and a 2 or 3 hour nap during the day.  When I'm at work I'm thinking about how many hours till I can go to sleep. After work I feel like I'm useless at home, not having enough energy to do anything. Although I'm happy and back to my old self again, I wish I wasn't tired .
Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	19-24	7/12/2009 11:04:15 PM	After losing my job in 2007 I started showing signs of depression. Even after finding a new job the low feelings continued. After speaking with my doctor he suggested a 20 mg daily dose of Prozac. Since my insurance only covers generic prescriptions I was put on a generic Prozac. Before starting the scripts I read some of the reviews of different anti-depressants and was a little hesitant to try them. I've been on this for about a month now and couldn't be happier. Little things no longer upset me, I have more energy and am actually happy to wake up in the mornings just to get things done, no more sleeping until noon. The only thing that worries me is the fact that nothing really upsets me anymore, and that can be good and bad. Another thing is my sex drive is the same but it takes a lot longer for me to have an orgasm, which my girlfriend loves. So I guess it's good all around, happy woman=happy me!   
Depression	midiansgoddess, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	7/12/2009 8:40:12 AM	I was misdiagnosed as having Bi-polar over 12yrs ago. I was a guinea pig on countless meds that never worked and only put major weight on me. Thank God I've found a great doctor. He correctly diagnosed me with Chronic General Anxiety Disorder w/ Depression. He put me on 1mg of Klonopin 3x's a day and 20mg of Prozac in the morning. I can't say I am 100%..but I feel better than I have ever felt before. The prozac instantly took that blah feeling away and the suicidal thoughts. I do have more energy now due to the prozac as well. The Klonopin helps to ease my anxiety and makes me a little drowsy..but I will take drowsy over anxiety any day..lol I have just started these meds a week ago. I hope as my body adjusts I find more benefits 
Panic Disorder	atsf17, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	7/9/2009 2:35:58 PM	I recently started using this medication for General Anxiety and Panic Disorder (GAD). I am 62 and sadly I have been living with GAD most of my life. In the last two years the episodes became more frequent and severe. My therapist prescribed Prozac and since I have using this medication I have not had a single episode. For the first time in over 40 years I have been able to live without the emotional turmoil I endured on a monthly and more recently daily basis. Anyway, so far it works for me. The only side effects I have experienced are nausea, problems sleeping and having very weird dreams during the first week of use. I started out with 10mg for the first two weeks and I am now on 20mg.

Only probalem and it can be a big one if it causes my delayed ejaculation. No ED at all but takes way too long and it frustrates the heck out of me. Does anybody know of any SSRI's that have had the fewest side effects which include a slight loss of libido? Remeron puts in weight and won't do that one. Please help! Thanks

It takes me so long to ejaculate and libido is hampered somewhat. I tried other SSRI's and the same thing happens. Great for my partner but it's hard to come and frustrating at times. Does any one have any suggestions for me? Thanks, Jimmy

I was given cymbalta because my doctor knew I was scared of gaining weight - I GAINED 30 POUNDS!! I quit taking meds for a couple of years but my OCD was out of control so about 6 months ago my doctor gave me celexa and it worked but made me so sleepy and I was only taking 10 mg and I gained 15 pounds. I asked for it to be changedandhe gave me Prozac. I have been taking it for 5 days. I have had no side effects but i can tell i feel better already. They said it was gonna take two weeks or longer but I think its working well already --I just hope it dont cause me to gain weight

My doctor increased my dose and I began having panic attacks.  ater 2-3 weeks I realized Prozac was making my anxiety much worse and quit taking it.  Terrible experience!  I now take Cymbalta with minimal side effects.

Premenstrual Disorder with a State of Unhappiness	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	6/28/2009 7:07:52 PM	Switched from Celexa to Prozac after complaining to my (new) doctor about CONSTANT fatigue.  Started at 20mg and am still there couple of months later.  Effective for me; the fatigue is lessened but I am not sure whether other factors are involved w/that. Side effects are an occasional unexplained red itchy rash on my right forearm (goes away), and VERY VIVID dreams, not always nightmares but a LOT of recurrent dreams.  But I always had vivid dreaming anyway. Celexa had deadened my dreams so maybe they have just come back. Overall I am satisfied so far; oh, the PMDD is virtually gone and that is why my dr. originally Rx'd me antidepressants! I would actually think (in an abstract way) of ending my life during the depths of some of the months w/PMDD.  It DOES affect your sex drive like they say though, and when I see my dr. again I am going to mention this first off b/c it really bothers me the lack of desire I have now.

Has anybody else experienced this.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	6/26/2009 4:33:42 PM	Before i started taking this medication I could barely get out of bed in the morning i was so sad. Every day was a drag and very tough to get through. I would come home and sleep for hours after getting off work, and was always very exhausted. After being on the medication for about two weeks I have started to notice a big difference. While I am still pretty sleepy (side effect) I feel like I have more to look forward to and am excited for a new day. This medication has deffinitely given me my social life back and for that I am very greatful. I now wake up every morning thankful that I am alive and prepared to face the days new challenges with a positive attitude. I know everyone reacts differently to medication, but I would deffinitely advise anyone to atleast try it.  (Fluoxetine 20mg is what I am on right now-4 stars b/c I think i may need a higher dosage) Good Luck!

I tried to get back on and something went completely wrong...I had a very bad allergic reaction, so my doctor put me on something else.

Depression	Ryan Rosskamp, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	19-24	6/19/2009 1:50:17 PM	I was originally switched to prozac from paxil because of the effects paxil had on me. Prozac did help my depression for the most part. It also made me become angry more easily about things than normal. Like paxil it did also make me quite tired, and hungry frequently.I gained weight while on prozac also. I finally researched wellbutrin, and had my doctor try me on it. That was a good switch for me, I have been on that for over six months now. I do like to share medication stories, and offer advice to others where I can. I am a big believer in herbal remedies.

Since taking I feel mellow.. I actually feel sort of blah.. Almost no emotion, not happy, not sad, not much anger..   What realy bothers me is I have no sex drive at all..

The first 6 months on prozac improved my life immensely. However, after that, it seemed as though my body had developed a tolerance to it and it was no longer very useful. This drug seemed to be good for immediate results, but gradually lost its effects. The only side effect I noticed was a kind of constant drowsiness.
Depression	rosebud, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	6/11/2009 12:34:13 PM	This medication gave me the worst headache of my life. I hid in the tightest corner in my closet to get away from the light. My head was pounding so hard that the nurse said it was actually rocking with the pounding! I had a smile on my face constantly but want to kill everyone who spoke to me. I became very homicidle and forgot about how depressed I was. I took it for about 6 weeks and then tried to overdose on over 600mg of it along with a bottle of tylenol and a bottle of nodoz. This may work for others, but it did not work for me. Be careful!

I have been on it for almost 17yrs only stopping (with Dr.s direction) during my 2 pregnancies and quickly starting back on them after their births. Both of my kids are beautiful,smart and healthy.(TIPS) Do not stop taking the med abruptly, try not to miss doses/or take more than prescribed, and inform your Dr. if you have any unusual side effects...I have had only positive experiences with Prozac by following the direction by my Dr. and on the bottle...but I will add...over the 17yrs I have broke one of the &quot;No's&quot; and had alcoholic beverages on occasion without experiencing any side effects (but every one's body is different) I have not had any of the sexual dysfunctions reported with SSRI's either. I hope this helps.

Loss of contact with co-workers and a feeling I had no reason to get out of bed.  I felt angry with the mundane routine of daily activities.  After taking Prozac, I have noticed that prozac has &quot;taken the edge off&quot; of my feelings of anger and agression at the smallest of irritations.

I have been on every med you can think of and finally came full circle, back to the &quot;granddaddy&quot; of them all, Prozac. It has been a miracle drug for me. It started working almost immediately and it is like a veil has been lifted from my mind--I can even see (physically)clearer! I hope it works this well for everyone!
Depression	gabsndogs, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/25/2009 9:29:45 PM	Been on it 3 wks.  Have lost 10 lbs. in that time from decreased appetite (I consider it a good thing, I can afford to lose 60# and am very happy with that side effect).  No headaches, nausea, or other side effects; am happy.  No suicidal thoughts, am happier &amp; friendlier, no anger issues, no panic attacks, really nothing but positive about it.  I suppose I might eventually have to switch if I do lose enough weight.

This drug saved y life.  I don't have nightmares and moodswings anymore. I feel leveled out all day long.  I CAN feel the difference when I forget to take them for sa couple of days.  Only drawback is that if I take them late in the day I have problems sleeping and my sex drive is subdued which is okay because I'm single and not looking.....lol

I was on and off it , trying all other meds ( as we do..right)..and prozac at 40mg did not continue to be affective after about 6 months..back to square one, frustrated and lost hope may times..it is very inexpensive, tho.I gave up many times..going to the doc today for another adjustment!What a life!

I was subject to towering bouts of irrational fury and uncontrollable crying jags that had made me unable to function AT ALL in normal life to the point where at a certain time of the month I would literally sequester myself to avoid being ashamed of my behavior and alienating my friends and family. I had to increase dosage after the first six months, and then the following year, and now am experiencing a lessening in the effects after three years. I may have to increase again, or look into a different formula.

I have suffered from depression, panic disorder which led to agoraphobia for a brief time, mild ocd and just had a total hysterectomy. My Dr. put me back on the Prozac before surgery, 40 mg. and one .5 mg. Xanax in PM and I feel normal and healthy. No more moodiness, crying, anxiety and constant worry,sleep disruptions and relationship problems at home/work. I am able to cope and don't feel like a zombie.Prozac has the most and longest research and I highly recommend it as a solution for anyone with just one of my symptoms. The old stand by is the best!!

Depression	roni, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	5/3/2009 12:51:28 PM	I have been on prozac for over 10 years, it has been a lifesaver for me &amp; my family. I started with 10mg &amp; am now on 80mg. Plus I'm on 300mg generic Welbutrin &amp; low thyroid meds. I have learned to take my Prozac at night, before bed &amp; sleep very well. I don't think it is working as well as it did in the past, I am tired all the time, but that is probably due to my lack of exercise, bad eating habits over the winter &amp; huge amount of stress over the past 8 months. Thanks for the reviews, it's great to be able to see what others are experiencing in my age group. I know now I'm not alone. I'm going to push myself to exercise more often &amp; be more alert to the foods I'm eating.

The postpartum depression 17 years ago never lifted. I was on 20-40 mg for nine years from 1992 to 2001. I could function minimally but I was so grateful for that. I could at least go to work and do a few things around the house. Before I couldn't even get out of bed, or take care of myself. It eventually stopped working, but nothing since that has even come close. I was not completely without any depression--people have to understand that no drug in the world will alleviate all depression--but I was able to go on living. It was a struggle and still is a struggle everyday, but this drug worked the best. It's now 8 years later, I've tried every med/combo, some would not work at all or maybe work for a year or two. I tried Prozac again during those years but it was not effective. Finally last year I was diagnosed correctly with bipolar 1. The only other drug which has kept me alive has been the patch Emsam. I have been hospitalized 3 times and in desperation finally agreed to ECT last fall. Even that only relieved the depression a bit for only 2 months. I am grateful the Prozac worked as long as it did. I never had any of the side effects listed (not even the sexual ones.) It also helped greatly with anxiety. No other med has relieved the anxiety as well. I hope you find something that works for you...I will try, try, try again! Never give up!

Risperdal worked well short term but gave him dystonia and so was discontinued. The Prozac gave him his life back and he is functioning pretty well on 40 mg/day. His anxiety is presently increasing and we're investigating supplementing with another med...maybe Abilify but it looks as scary as the Risperdal.

Panic Disorder	tjsteeler2, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	4/1/2009 10:59:20 PM	Been on this med for 3 months.  Haven't experienced much improvement in mood or panic attack frequentcy.  Panic attacks are less severe though.  I'm tired more and sweat much more than I did before taking it... especially at night.  Sex drive has decreased substantially. :(  My wife is frustrated and not very happy w/ this side effect.
Depression	many ouches, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	4/1/2009 9:03:08 PM	I was rather reluctant about using this medication and my prescription sat on the shelve for a year. Later, I was going through a very rough patch and began using Nortriptyline with the intent to use Prozac along with it for my fibromyalgia and migraines. Side effects(heart palpitations) caused me to discontinue the Nortriptyline before starting the Prozac. Then I tried Doxepin. Great stuff for depression and anxiety, but causes lots of sleepiness and heart palpitations. I was finally ready to start the Prozac 10mg. It has been 6 months now and I have had very good results. I am still on the same dose with very few side effects.I take only the Prozac now, since the Doxepin had many undesirable effects on me.I am sleepy at times and my appetite is good, but no weight gain like with the Doxepin. No sexual problems either like the latter drug gave me. I will be increasing to 20 mg soon. My only problem is that I am scared to take my migraine meds(Imitrex) due to sertonin syndrome.

I have been trying to loose weight for quite awhile but to no avail.  I have joined a gym and nothing seems to work. Help!  I am thinking of getting off of this medication and tryig something new.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	35-44	3/22/2009 12:28:36 PM	In October my Dr. decided to up my dosage from 20mg to 40mg, 2 weeks later while working at a hospital I suffered a seizure, heart dysrythmia, open and closed head injury, and still suffering from memory loss, mood swings,nerve damage, unsteady gait,stumbling, inverted foot and don't know when or if I get to go back to work. They think the blow I took to my head during the seizure has caused a brain tumor.Not to mention the minor side effects like bleeding sores on my back and shoulders. THANK YOU PROZAC! The wonder drug. I could not get off this junk fast enough after I researched myself and figured out it was the prozac. Look at drugs.com/prozac for a real eye opener.
Panic Disorder	beary001, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	4	5	4	Female	55-64	3/21/2009 12:57:59 PM	I have been on this for about 1 year and had to lower the dosage from 40 mg to 30 mg because of GERD. I feel great and am comfortble in my own skin. I like me better on this drug. However I have weight gain. I have gained around 10 lbs. since I began. I am so hungry I cannot eat fast enough sometimes although I really don't eat that much. I want to lose weight but as long as I'm on Prozac am I wasting my time?

Depression	45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1		45-54	3/18/2009 11:28:50 AM	I tried Prozac for three days in Dec. and then just recently decided to give it another try.  Each time I start out feeling OK, but as the days go on I get more and more anxious and nervous and can't eat. I had to stop taking it after one week. I felt like I was going crasy. I still feel bad and it's been over a week since I stopped taking it. I read that it takes a long time to get out of your system.

Panic Disorder	LaurieS46, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	3/16/2009 2:52:22 AM	Have been on Prozac over 15 years for panic attacks.  It kept the panic attacks under control very well, however I noticed a HUGE decrease in sex drive.  Also a lack of emotion, such as I didn't even cry at my parents funerals.  I have been off Prozac for 2 months now with no recurrance of panic attacks.  PLUS I have rediscovered my emotions- I can even cry at movies!  I would say it definitely helped me overcome the panic attacks for many years, but perhaps I simply &quot;outgrew&quot; my need for it.
Depression	williehazel, 65-74 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		65-74	3/15/2009 12:48:24 AM	Have been taking prozac for none years.  It took about three months for my body to adjust to it.  I don't think the Drs. warn patients enough about how one will feel when first introduced to the drug.  In the long run it has been wonderful for my depression, panic/anxiety disorder.

Until just recently, I work at a Hospital,and in the last two months have had two Panic Attacks.  I had a very high blood pressure,had a seziure,nad have not felt vey good since.

Tried several other medicines to no pro vale In fact they made me worse. I don't think it was the Prozac more than the surroundings my wife having two cases of cancer in 5 years. The economy taking a crapper and losing half my income. I don't think pills are always the answer but their to help cope. I find talking to someone more than just my doctor helps. Family support makes a huge difference not feeling alone makes a world of difference.

I only took it for four days, and then I through the bottle in the trash. Prozac made me crazy!!! I didn't what to be at work when I was there, then when I would get into the car to go home I was scared driving home, when I got home, I didn't want to be there either. When I was home I would ball up against a wall with something to eat and tell my boyfriend (now hubby)to leave me the **** alone or I would kill him. So after four days of that I through the Prozac in the trash and said never again. Zoloft works for me.

I had severe insomnia, i slept 2 hours a night if I was lucky. I started taking it during the end of the school year around finals and it really screwed me up. I could not focus, had more anxiety, was tired (obviously) and i had loss of appetite. I was told to wait it out as it would take over a month for the drug to actually work. I did that and it made my life come crashing down. I could hardly leave my house I was so messed up. It affected my work performance and concentration, I almost lost my job. My boss asked confronted me about my performance issues. Prozac did not work for me at all. I got put on a new drug right away and it works great.

Have just started Buspirone, and will be giving it a few+ weeks. If doesn't work well, then back to prozac with a timing regimine. My PMDD is 3+ weeks/month, so getting control of those symptoms is very important to me and my family.

I ended up blurting out every thought I had, to the point where it was embarrassing. Looking back, I think my dosage was way too high. I've been on a dozen different SSRIs, and Lexapro is the best, but you do build up an immunity over time, so combining with another drug like Wellbutrin provides a good balance (plus, it helps with the sexual side effects of all the SSRIs). Low doses of Prozac have helped my friends who suffer from PMS and post-partum depression.

Panic Disorder	Postbemo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	2/3/2009 11:56:24 PM	I was having panic atacks. I was always thinking I was having heart atacks or just the overall feeling something was physically wrong with me or I was going to die. My doctor put on 40mg prozac. Made me jittery. He added .5mg xanax time release that helped the jitters. After 6 months I was still having the same thoughts but could calm myself down by breathing techniques which helped me relax. Told my doctor and he bumped me up to 60mg prozac and 1mg xanax time release. I am doing great. I have also discovered that I am more open to people even strangers I talk alot more and not afraid of what people think. I used to be very quiet and not outspoken but that has changed and I love it. I am 51 and seemed to have lost my sex drive. Hard to get an erection (no pun intended). Don't know if it is the drugs or old age.(LOL)

I was on Prozac for 13 years. Eventually it stopped working for me. But it was a lifesaver for a long time.Once I topped out on dosage level my doctor took me off and am now on Effexor doing fine.
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	5	5	Male	25-34	2/1/2009 12:30:01 PM	I started with 10mg and gradually worked my way up to 60mg, which is what I am currrently taking.  In the beginning I had nausea, some bad dreams, and even a couple of panic attacks.  I am going on the third month and now have NO side effects aside from slight tremors in my fingers.  The anxiety and non-stop obsseive thoughts have decreased about 80%.  I also can relax and live in the moment instead of worrying.  
Other	Gail, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/1/2009 9:40:44 AM	I took this in a study for Illness Concern.  It gave me illness.  Nobody should take this. I dropped out after a week at 40mg after five weeks at 20mg.  It hurts your digestion and brain.  Headaches Brain Zaps this stuff is dangerous.  The doctor never even took my blood pressure after giving me the pills.  Do not trust doctors.  It is all about making money for the drug companies.  I wish that I never did it.  It made me very angry.

I told my then psychologist who brushed it off.  I wish I had read up on the drug and its side effect (most of which I have personally experienced) My new Dr. is presently weaning me off; it is a difficult and tedious process for me.  I am experiencing daily, lingering headaches as a result and sever mood swings.  Personally, whilst being on Prozac the reasons for doing so did not reduce in any significant/satisfactoral amount to either of us.  My tendency to shop did not decrease which was the main cause did not decrease to any great percentage to my chagrin, I wish it had so at least being on it would be worth coming off it.This was and is My personal journey with Prozac...

My doctor decided to try this.  It was working fine i was on 20 mg and then 40 mg but having strange heart palpitations.  Since they were sporatic I ignored it.  The doc dropped it down to 20 i was doing better then i was having a rough patch and pushed it up again.  The panic was unbearable my heart would palpitate for hours on end i stopped the medication and i would say it has been over 2 weeks and today is the first day i did not have heart palpitations.  I am currently also on Lamictal 250 mg which works well but I seem to just need a little antidepressant.  I really would not recommend this drug after what i have been through.  But i do know it helps people but i have suffered greatly because of it.

I take 10 mg a day, but still feel side effects. I feel disoriented and weak in the mornings and it takes me a long time to get to sleep at night. I am hungrier, but when I start to eat, I get nauseated and stop, so I have lost weight while on Prozac.

Why give something used to treat bulimia to someone who's anorexic? It did help me to be less miserable, though after awhile whenever I took it, it would horribly burn my throat. I was tired all the time as well... Was on it for 2 years then switched to Lexapro and am now much happier, and have since lost weight.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	1/20/2009 5:50:34 PM	I've been taking Prozac for 3 months now (20mg). I suffered with depression/anxiety for a year until I got help. I suffered mild side effects the first 1-2 weeks including problems focusing and feeling shaky. Since then I have no side effects except for some weight loss. Overall I feel like myself again. I would suggest combining medication with talk therapy. Prozac didn't cure my depression it just put me in a place where I could figure out my problems with a counselor.

My docs tried, zoloft, wellbutrin, lexapro, paxil...none of it worked too good and then I suggested Prozac....one reason is not really expensive. which is another reason for some of my depression... I started w/ 20mg and just moved up to 40mg.  It works really great but over time you may have to get the doc to up your dosage.  It's almost like you get immune to that dose.  I was starting to get really angry really quickly and so far so good!  I LOVE PROZAC!!!!

This med is in the SSRI category as well.  I have had the SAME side effects with this med as with all other SSRIs (zoloft, paxil, lexapro, etc). My side effects include: severe insomnia, headache, mood swings, fatigue, lack of interest &amp; irritability. Though tolerable, I would be okay with the side effects if the Prozac actually worked.  I still have slight depression and anxiety, so, along with the side effects I have decided to ask my Doc for a SNRI med instead.  Do your research on these anti-depressants to find what is right for you.

Not sure yet if I can live with the weight gain - this is my first med may have to try something else.

Prozac certainly stopped the depression - in less than 2wks I was completely homicidal! If I'd had the means I would have been a clock-tower sniper!  PROZAC IS DANGEROUS!!!! Needless to say, I was taken off the drug immediately - put into respite and lost my son until 'I' could prove that I was sane.  Thanks Prozac.  
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	12/31/2008 6:46:44 AM	My doctor put me on Prozac 20mg. after being on Wellbutrin for a couple years. The Wellbutrin just wasn't cutting it anymore. I felt angry all the time and felt like all I did was yell at my kids, and the anger was intense. My doctor said I could just stop the Wellbutrin and start the Prozac. Not a good idea! I started having flu-like symptoms and realized it was from stopping the Wellbutrin (flu-like symptoms are part of Wellbutrin withdrawal). It lasted about two weeks. Now I'm feeling fine, and the Prozac has helped me immensely. The major side effect, for me, is the inability to have an orgasm. It sucks, but I'd rather deal with that than have my children remember me as a raging lunatic! Sometimes you have to take the bad with the good.

I am withdrawing from it ASAP! I think that this drug should only be used if EXTREME need be, and even then, only temporarily! It really does give me great grief. Today, I had a panic attack after months of not having any. I guess it totally depends on the person, but as I mentioned before, I am terminating my &quot;relationship&quot; with Prozac ASAP!

Depression	dramaqueen68, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/24/2008 8:05:09 AM	I was recently going thru a period of depression that was affecting my whole life, work everything...I just didnt feel like myself anymore, and I couldnt shake the feeling off..I was so tired all the time, my body hurt, I had racing thoughts, and impulsivity..I didnt feel sad about anything in particular, I know depression is a chemical imbalance..and I knew I needed help..Prozac gave me my life back. I am more in control of my emotions, I no longer get weepy and emotional..I am more energetic, my appetite is more normalized, and I dont have strange impulsive thoughts. I am also bulimic, and this has beenunder good control as well...I would most definately recommmend this..I have had very minor side efeects..But it requires close supervision of your Dr. so follow up is recommended always.

Family history of Depression/bi-polar disease.I had lumbar back surgury that failed and 2 Yrs ago I broke my leg and my significant other died. I went into major depession and anxiety. My Psyciatrist put me on several different meds. I took Cymbalta 60mg for 2 years and it stopped working. It did help my pain alot. Then I started getting major side effects, went thru all medical testing for the symptoms, gastric,suicicidal,weight gain without changing eating habits,self esteem lowered, and concluded it was the Cymbalta! I tried to get off and after 3 days had bad withdrawal symptoms. I am on Prozac 20mg for 2 weeks and lowered my Cymbalta to 30mg. It is definetly better. I don't feel suicidal. Prozac is working great! I do think you need to be on it for wks before you see any change,side effects go away. Great for PMS, I am feeling like myself!!Thank god!! Sex drive has come back.

Depression	 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female		12/17/2008 8:08:38 PM	My experience with this treatment was life changing.&#160; I was 15 when I had chronic headaches so they put me on a different antidepressant to help with my headaches.&#160; That pill gave me depression so they prescribed Prozac.&#160; Shortly after I started taking it my depression worsened and I started &quot;self-mutilating&quot;.&#160; My ignorant doctors decided that was part of being a teenage girl, so they upped my dose.&#160; I was unhappy for 3 years and experienced effects when trying to quit, much like I hear people talk about drug addiction.&#160; If it works for you, great, but take the warnings seriously to stop taking it as soon as it gets worse, whether your doctor thinks so or not.&#160; Upping a dose isn't always the solution.
Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	25-34	12/17/2008 12:17:09 AM	I was on this medication for months for depression when I was 15. I can honestly say it did nothing for me. My mood didn't change one bit over the course of 6 months with constant adjustments to my dose. Thankfully I eventually found a med that worked and was medication free by the age of 19. This was in combination with therapy, of course.

Some made me feel suicidal. As soon as I started taking Prozac, I don't have thoughts of suicide, before I had them every day and cried all day every day. It's a Godsend to me.

First of all-everyone has different reactions due to their chemical makeup. This medication has to build gradually in your system.You can build a tolerence to it, so you may have to start and stop a few times. It takes at least 3-4 weeks to have an effect. I've have taken this medication for over ten years. I recently tried several others because my migraines were getting worse. I will be going back on this medication because it is wonderful. If you are having any difficulties talk to your doctor right away, and if you are taking multiple medications. Its perfect for some so do not let these reviews scare you. What should scare you is going through issues alone when you should talk to a professional. 
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	12/15/2008 3:54:47 PM	I have been taking SSRI antidepressants since July.  I started out on Lexapro which seemed to work very well.  I had to switch due to insurance issues (they wouldn't cover it). The we switched to Celexa (the generic brand) and that didn't seem to work. The depression and irritability resurfaced. I've been on Prozac for 3 weeks and I think it is causing the mucus/phlem problem that I seen to be experiencing. Every morning my gag reflex seems to be heightened and I feel like my sinuses are full of mucus that I can't get rid of.  Anyone else experiencing this?

Other	SouthCarolina_Scorpio_Chick, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/14/2008 11:01:11 AM	I was prescribed 20mg Prozac for anxiety. I have been taking this med for 3 months. The first day I took it I felt incredible. I was in a great mood and this med also helped with my anger issues.  Prozac did make me sleepy for the first two weeks, but it only made me sleepy when I was not busy doing something else.  About a week into taking my meds I realized I was having incredibly weird dreams, but not normal weird dreams; really off the wall; who dreams this kind of stuff, dreams. My dreams are more vivid and they are so out of this world that I actually remember them enough to be able to tell someone about them in detail! Even the normal nightmarish dreams are not really scary, my dreams are pretty comical! I am in my 3rd month and I dont really feel a change so my doctor prescribed me 40mg. I was very scared to take this medication for the first time, my doctor told me not to go to WebMd and read the reviews of this drug. As soon as I got home I went to this website, but the reviews proved my doctor right. He told me everyone reacts differently to this medication and to not scare myself into a panic attack. Sometimes it can be hard to find someone who understands what you are going thru unless they are going thru the same thing. I find it comforting to talk to people who have my condition because we are all able to relate to one another and the biggest thing is that we have sympathy for one another and not empathy. Our doctors and psychiatrists can only tell us what to take and listen, but they truly do not know how it feels to have your heart beat so fast that you can actually feel it, or when your body begins to shake uncontrollably; when your throat feels like it is closing up, you just want to get out of your own skin because you truly do not know what to do! This is an awful feeling, and to have someone to tell you to just calm down and breathe makes it even worse because your mind is so powerful it wont let you. I hope this med works for you, Good Luck!

This med keeps me calm and is very helpful in helping with my depression.  I had taken myself off the medication due to money issues and I have to say that you should never do that! I was having a horrible time and you should always stop medications under a doctor's watch. Since I have restarted I have experienced some nausea and insomnia other then that it is working great for me and this happened the first time I started taking it and will go away again.  All and all I am very happy with this medication and all of my family and friends say they can see a diffrence in me!

After trying several different medicines, I have found that Fluoxetine (20mg) has made a difference in my life. I was so depressed that I didn't want to leave my home and even had to take a leave from work. I'm also taking Clonazepam 0.5mg. twice a day. Although I seem more out spoken now, I feel a lot better than before. 
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	12/9/2008 9:47:07 AM	I have been on this medication for only a week, but I started feeling the effects right away. I started taking it due to anxiety and stress, and it has helped a great deal already. It doesn't make me tired, there's been no loss of energy, and I seem much more relaxed. My husband noticed the improvement after my second day of taking it. I was having severe anxiety due to worrying about things beyond my control, and feeling like something bad was going to happen to my children (I'm OCD when it comes to their safety). The worrying was consuming me. After 1 week I have already noticed I do not worry as much. So far, I am satisfied with this drug.

Because he was never asked about his depression or saw a doctor the day he was handed the script or was followed up on for any of the warnings signs on this drug.For anyone thinking about taking this medicine please make sure you are under the care of a licensed medical physician and or doctor and make sure they take the time to ask you the right questions and follow up with you. Please do not take this medicine unless your sure you have a relative or friend with you and can speak for you and discuss your medical conditions with your doctors office (please waive your rights to the HIPA law) because can not count on the doctor or the person handing you the prescription to know or care to take the time in your 2 minute long visit with you to know what is your best health.

Depression	opheliac, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	13-18	11/28/2008 11:56:31 PM	Started taking this medication ten days ago for dysthymia (chronic depression) and IBS-A. I take 10mg of the liquid generic fluoxetine in the morning every day. I have experienced a great deal of drowsiness and hypersomnia, which was honestly pretty nice at first, as I wasn't sleeping much before due to the depression, but after a few days it became a huge inconvenience. By the second week of treatment I was constipated. At the moment I haven't had a complete bowel movement for five days and I feel bloated, crampy, and miserable. My IBS hasn't been this bad in a long time. There has been no effect on mood, although, to be fair, the medication isn't supposed to take effect for a few weeks yet. I'm planning to go off this medication and try something else.

Within a week I felt more productive, and was able to accomplish simple tasks with relative ease.  Since medication usage, my focus has incresed during class, while socializing, and countless other activities.  After taking the medications for approxiametely three weeks now, my uneasiness has gone up slightly.  I definetely reccomend this product, especially because many of the sideeffects listed are not prevalent in ,y life.

I have tried others, and tried weening off it completely.  Nothing else has worked for me, but I do have memory loss/lapses, but not sure if it is from the longterm use. Any side effects I have way out way the depression I suffered before Prozac.

Because of switching health insurance, the new carrier would not cover it.  I went through three or four different meds and none worked real well.  Switched jobs...was able to get the Prozac again and feeling good.  May not work for everyone, but works well for me.

I can be very irritable. The slightest thing can put me in a rage.This has effected my job and relationships.  I've tried all the drugs but Prozac eased the  monster in me. The side effects, rare but I coughed none stop, I  was exhausted -worse in the morning  trying to get up. Due to the exhaustion I stoped going to  the gym and gained 40 lbs. I had itching, but not all the time and that's also a symptom of menopause.  I  was on the gen and stopped because I couldn't take the fatigue any longer. But my anger and mood swings worsened.  So i'm going back on prozac but i'm going to try the real drug, not gen. Doc is going to give me a small sleeping pill see if that helps with waking up all night, hence the exhaustion. I'm going to force myself to hit the gym.  The side effects are not as bad as the rage and mood swings I experience without it.Hope this helps.

It has saved my life with no side effects.  I have tried to go off it myself just to see if I could and I can not do it, I need my meds like a diabetic needs theirs!

I love it in fact through the yrs. they have tried other things and nothing else would work like prozac. Mental illiness runs in my family so I have a long history. Sometimes though late fall I start feeling a little depressed and I wish I could find something else out there to take with my prozac to help this. Christmas is suppose to be a happy time not sad.

I'm on this for my OCD which I would get anxiety from and my violent outbursts where I would change from happy to sad within seconds. I still have some OCD, but this has helped maintain it where it's not controlling my  life. My anger has gone away dramatically, I haven't had an outburst pretty much since I've started taking this. I don't have anyside affects with and I've been on it for about 7 months. I would recommend this for anyone with OCD or anger issues.

Bulimia	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	25-34	11/10/2008 10:50:42 PM	I have been on this medication for eleven years (since I was sixteen).  Initially, I did not notice a difference.  However, I have attempted to ween myself off of it over the years (which I do NOT recommend without doctor's consent) and after two weeks, I noticed that without it I am not able to think as clearly, I am very irritable, and I consistenly see the glass as half empty.  For me, this drug has been very helpful.  The one downside is that I absolutely have to eat with it or else I get terribly painful reflux.

Depression	HappyMom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/10/2008 11:50:06 AM	First of all, for anyone struggling with depression, we have all been told that exercise is also a key element in fighting depression.  When taking Prozac, or any medication for depression, it goes hand in hand with exercise. I have found this drug to be amazing after two short months.  I feel absolutely great, like I never have before, love my life and my children/family and have done a complete life turnaround.  However, for those of you who enjoy a few cocktails, with the holidays approaching, BEWARE!!!! Three glasses of wine used to be nothing for me before the medication, and now after 3-4 drinks, you can have blackout instances without even realizing it.  It is really scary.  Please take control and caution on the alcoholic intake come the holiday season.  It can be very dangerous for those who are new to the drug.....

Today is the first day I've felt anything, I feel sort of out&quot;up&quot; and a little drugged and a little buzzy, kind of tingly.  I have been slightly nauseated after taking it, this is the first antidepressant I have ever tried, but I've become desperate and constantly down over the last couple months from feeling a total lack of control in my life and my husband leaving for a year-long deployment to the Middle East.  I really hope this works, I  know it can take a couple weeks to kick in.  I am nervous of side effectsk hoping I won't gain weight... we'll see!!

I didn't ever think much of it until recently when it started getting really bad, I went on here to figure out what was wrong and I saw that the medicine can cause this. I don't see my psychiatrist for another month and I plan to tell him then, but has anyone else had this problem?

I find that some days my depression is worse than before i took it. I've experienced dizziness, severe drowziness, weight loss, loss of apetite, nausia, irritability, and still have that feeling of emptiness. I was wondering if anyone taking this medication has experienced small sores on the inner lip and numb taste buds? I'm getting concerned.

I knew I hace bulimia, but once I decided to get help, I was also diagnosed with depressi&#243;n.  I feel more mellow now, but my dosage was upped from 20 mg/day to 60 mg/day, not because of my depressi&#243;n, but my bulimia.  I have lost weight, but I also started a diet with a professional, since I used to be obese, until about 7 years ago, but still had to lose about 20 lbs.  IT HAS HELPED ME.

I have severe insomnia, i get dizzy, i don't eat ( i like this one though), I get irritated easily, I'm always tired and I feel week. I can't work like I use too. My temp is up and down. I feel sweaty then I'm shaking. I figured all the side effects would just go away, my doctor told me to stick with it and they'll fade. But I can't get in touch with him for 2 more weeks (I go to a free un insured place for working people). So I decided to stop taking it. I slept! For for two days. I had major withdraw symptoms. So I am now taking this awful thing till I see my doc. I'm going to try breaking them in half and taking half the med out to get myself off of it. I can't wait two more weeks like this. I feel awful.

Once I had to stop taking it (about a year ago) because I realized it had stopped working; the Lexapro wasn't good, but it got me off Prozac for a bit (1-3 months? can't remember), and the Prozac was just great after that. Unfortunately, my dr. told me to try Cymbalta; after 2 weeks of constipation, extreme dry mouth, worsening of an OCD symptom, and depression, I just can't wait for my new prescription of Prozac (generic) to be filled.

I had such hypo-mania and severe mood swings.  It changed my thought process also..I became wreckless...I also began losing tons of weight(which I was already underweight) When I stopped, I gained a lot of weight..but I got back to normal...When I was on it I wouldn't stop talking, even when I knew I was talking too much,,also very paranoid.  People accused me of being on drugs...yes, it was that bad..also, my grandfather killed himself(which was really unexpected &amp; out of character) while on Prozac.  I felt like that all the time...I really felt crazy..real happy &amp; then so sad I didn't want to live..I can't even tell you some of the horrible things..just be careful.  Some of it is probably me, but I have been fine for 3 years after stopping it and not being on anything.  Good luck all.

Bipolar Depression	comediktragedi, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	19-24	10/6/2008 9:08:46 AM	Both times I took this medication I ended up being hospitalized for suicidal ideation, the second time with a suicide attempt. The first time I was being treated for what they thought was depression, so I was only put on Prozac, which sent me into mania. I guess for that I'm slightly greatful for the drug because it clued my doctor's in to my bi-polar disorder. The second time I actually was taking Prozac with a mood stabalizer, and that time I actually ended up being hospitalized because of the Prozac. Needless to say, I'm not taking it, and won't touch it with a ten foot pole anymore. Even if it made me feel really really good at first.

Depression	kquirky, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	10/4/2008 3:20:17 PM	I have been on prozac twice before, and just started again.  Both of the other times, I felt edgy and antsy in the beginning, and then the anti-depressant aspect kicked in and I felt pretty good.  This time, I've been on it 4 weeks. It has helped with anxiety, but the depression is still here, and still pretty bad in the mornings.  I've never felt this erratic with it before, so I don't know if this is typical, or maybe related to the fact that I've gone on and off it a few times, or am not up to the dosage I last took or what. But overall, the last two times I felt it was my miracle drug, so I'm going to give it more time this time and hope it works again.

Years later tried it again and had very bad stomache pains using this med. Retried it a year later and had same problem of severe stomache ache pains. Would never try it again. Also seems to cause some hostile feelings. Would never suggest going higher than 20mg. daily. Would never suggest for young person(teen).

I tried it many years ago, and became very agitated / akathesiastic at only 10 mg., so, when it was suggested to me in replacement of Imipramine during a recent life crises I was hesitant, but figured I had nothing to lose at that point. I am so happy that I did. I have my life back.I also take 70 mg. of Vyvanse for A.D.D. in the morning, and have noticed that Prozac really helps to even out the stimulant mood variations (I used to take Adderall which made me go up and down alot), and I have noticed that Prozac along with a stimulant makes the stimulant effect noticeably less mood-altering. I feel less &quot;Up&quot; from the stimlant, but also don't feel it can bring me as &quot;down&quot;. To the point where the only difference I can see is that, when the Vyvanse isn't in me, I am just much less organized but my emotional world is not much different. I also take Trazadone, 50 mg. per night for bed as Prozac makes me noticeably prone to fatigue during the days and insomnia often. This is a great medication for regulating circadian rythems.Prozac SAVED MY LIFE from a VERY dark place.

Her self-esteem is coming back.I will see my daughter graduate this year feeling better and more confident then she has ever felt in years.All I have to say is be patient and read alot on Bi-Polar.I as a parent have been through so much and cried hoping something would help. We still have a long way to go with coping with Bi-Polar we want to be in control not the Bi-Polar.

Depression	Emmepenny, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	9/26/2008 8:14:12 AM	I took Prozac during my entire pregnancy, stopped for about 3 months and recently started taking it again three days ago...  yesterday I experienced a severe migraine and after having migraines only during pregnancy have finally associated this ailment with the Prozac use.  Has anyone else experienced this?  I also tried Effexor (37.5mg) and could only use it for a day due to the intense physical side effects (sweating, mouth sores, it was awful).  Any suggestions on an alternative medication?
Depression	ramey, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/26/2008 7:48:01 AM	I began taking Prozac many years ago following the death of my father by suicide. It helped, and I was later able to taper off and then quit. I resumed Prozac during a painful divorce and again got better and felt able to discontinue the drug after a time. Each time I remained off the drug for an extended period, however, my depression reoccured regardless of my current life circumstances. Currently, I have been on Prozac for about three years. I am perimenopausal and believe it is the only thing that keeps me from feeling the severe mood swings that are so common with the hormone fluctuations associated with menopause. I also attribute Prozac with saving my life as it has allowed me to function more normally than when I have not been taking it. There were many times I felt like giving up prior to taking this drug. Now, I can't imagine not living every day to the fullest. This is my experience but I would encourage people who try this drug to stick with it for awhile if the side effects are not too severe. For I believe, it is the long-term effects of the medicine that are so beneficial. I also take a small dosage of Trazadone at night as a sleep aid and take it and the Prozac only before bedtime. 
Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/26/2008 12:14:14 AM	Made me feel numb and a little slower, but it helped my depression and anxiety tremendously. I have tried some of the newer and more expensive drugs, but they don't wrok and make me feel quite strange.  I found that I got acid reflux, felt like heart problems, if I took it just before bed time. I have had no problems since I started taking in the morning. 
Depression	Anonymous, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/25/2008 6:13:35 PM	I have been taking Prozac for three weeks.  I started to feel better after only a few days.  Sometimes I feel too good- like I cannot cry when situations are sad or frustrating.  I sleep better now and my family has noticed that I am less irritable.  Some minor side effects I have experienced include yawning and gas, but I woud rather deal with the side effects then go back to the way I was.  
Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	25-34	9/25/2008 6:02:33 PM	I have had MAJOR chest pains from this medicine.  It has only been 3 days, and my heart feels like it is going to jump out of my body.  (I guess it it's making my anxiety worse)!  But like the other person's comment, I too have been in a great mood-soooo weird.  If the pains go away, I will be happy to stay on this for my anxiety.  I also take wellbutrin for depression and ambien to sleep, so I can't comment on how this drug would effect those issues however I am not obsessing about work, money, and other day to day things as I was-just 3 days ago!  I just don't really care as much...

I have tried almost everything and it is one of the older meds and  I feel so much better with little side effects . I have to tell you if your depression keeps you in bed and away from life and you feel no energy prozac might be the one for you. i'm happy and loving life again
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/23/2008 12:51:44 PM	Within one week I felt like a new person. I had no idea how badly I felt until I began to feel good again. This was within two weeks of a suicide attempt after a very painful divorce. I have opted to continue treatment even though I was told I could stop taking it after six months. At first I could not sleep at all but that got better after about one week. Now I sleep well. I have the yawning side effect but I have control over choosing to give in to the tiredness. If I keep moving and stay busy it has little or no change on me and I am able to function just fine. I feel like me again. It worked very well for me
Depression	Sundance22, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	65-74	9/23/2008 2:30:13 AM	I first started to take this medication after my son died from suicide. It helped at first.I have been on prozac for several years now. I am now expeiencing mild memory loss, and my mind seems to wander aimlessly. Aftersome research, I discovered prozac contains fluoride, the same stuff as in toothpaste. Fluoride is an extremely toxic poison, which is even added to our drinking water. Fluoride has been proven to cause dementia, and can lead to alzheimers. Prozac is also been known to cause suicidal thoughts and tendencies. I have since stopped taking prozac, but am still feeling the effects of this toxic drug. I would never recommend prozac to anybody I cared about. Research all your medications...thoroughly before you take it. You will be very surprised at some of the ingredients they add to medicine. It is pretty scary stuff!! An informed patient, is a healthier patient!!Good luck, and good day!Sundance22
Premenstrual Disorder with a State of Unhappiness	my_malady, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	9/19/2008 8:15:35 PM	This is the fourth or fifth time over the last 15 years I have tried Prozac. Each time hoping for the famous results and instead, each time getting nothing except fatigue, complete loss of libido, weight gain, and only a slight change in mood for the better, on a few non PMDD days; one or two days of my two week PMDD. I have depression and it gets so bad before my period. My weight fluctuates 10-15 lbs before my period. My mood swings are scary. I have cramps for a week. So in a nut shell, I am a nut. In all seriousness, I have depression worsened by PMDD or PMDD worsened by depression. Either way, the Doctors always go back to &quot;Let's just try adding some Prozac again, one more time.&quot; I think there are two or three days of the month, not during my PMDD time, I think I feel better. However, the rest of the month is not worth it. Tired and sexless? Those are the two best ways to make a married depressed and hormonal mother of two, in her 30's, give up all together! I did see a small difference in cramps too. If it did not wreck my libido, I would stay on it for longer than the three months I usually give it, to see if the effects would increase and perhaps I could see better overall longterm benefits.

It sucks, but other than that I'm seeing results. I only take 40mg a day.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	9/2/2008 8:06:50 PM	This was the first anti-depressant that I ever took.  I didn't realize how deep into depression I was until the Prozac started working for me.  My mood swings were eliminated, I liked my husband again, and I was happy...which was something I hadn't felt for years!  I really wish I would have been brave enough years before to admit that I needed some help...it saddens me to think of the &quot;living&quot; that I lost out on in my youth.  I took it religiously for the first year, and then developed some sort of itchy body rash.  Two biopsies could not determine the cause.  After 6 months the rash went away.  Near the end of the first year of 20-30mg I was frustrated that I even had to take anything, and felt like it wasn't doing anything for me anymore.  I quit cold turkey with no side effects, but noticed after several months that I was reverting back to my mean self.  Finally, June of this year I got back on at 40mg.  It started helping right away, but now my body is once again consumed with this rash.  My skin constantly feels like it is crawling, and I wake myself at night scratching, that is when I am fortunate enough to fall asleep.  I haven't seen where anyone else has reported this side effect, but I can't trace it to anything but the Prozac.  I haven't taken a pill in 3 days, and the swelling in the bumps is going down, and while there is still an itch, it isn't as extreme as it was.  My doctor is going to switch me to Celexa, which I know nothing about.  If it works the same, but without the itch, it will be a God send!

I don't have that &quot;I don't care&quot; feeling as some have reported.  I feel if that is your reaction to Prozac, it isn't the correct treatment for your condition.  My side effects are minimal compaired to the benefits.  I sweat ALOT.  I never sweated this much but I make a choice between being a functioning human and explaining why I have sweat pouring off me.

Depression	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	2	Male	45-54	7/25/2008 9:24:48 AM	Prozac was the first of the new class of antidepressants I was prescribed, and I think it would have been the best one for me except I could not tolerate the side effects -- GI problems and an &quot;up&quot; feeling. While I was on it, I do remember thinking more clearly and acting more decisively. It has also had a good effect on my sister, who just started it recently. I recommend trying it because the side effects may or may not bother everyone.

Sometimes I get &quot;too much music&quot; repeating in my head, so I'll take it every other day until the music lessens.  It's one of the only depression meds that is easy to go off - very few side effects during gradual withdrawal (unlike Paxil, Effexor, etc.)

I have only been on it for 2 weeks but it seems to have helped with the crying all the time but now I just don't care about anything.  I'm tired all the time and am always yawning.  When I wake up in the morning I can't wait for evening so I can go to bed again.  No energy at all, and I just feel totally emotionless.  I don't laugh or cry, nothing.  I am going to contact my Dr. this week and see what he thinks.

I have a history of anorexia, ADD/ADHD, and depression. I was taking adderall when I was taking prozac. I notice that I was getting panic attack everytime I took my medication. At first I thought it was the adderall so I stop taking it for a couple days, nothing change. Then I stop taking the prozac and started taking the adderall again. That's when I notice the panic attacks were coming from the prozac. Everytime I took it within an hour I would start getting paranoid. My doctor and I were surprise. 
Depression	sammyed, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	45-54	7/18/2008 1:17:24 PM	I took Prozac for many years. After awhile, I got a kind of a tolerance, and I realized when my family doctor described it, I wasn't sufficiently treating my depression--which I have had for over 30 years, because Prozac is just a SSRI and I needed the SSNRI, the neuropinephrine part of treatment. I started to have &quot;breakthrough symptoms&quot; of crying and low energy. But it really helped with my premenopausal rough periods, unlike the Effexor I am on (which helps more for depression but not my periods.) Oh, perfection and the quest for it! I am just glad I met Prozac and I read Prozac Nation and all the other literature, Listening to Prozac. We will look back on this time in mental health and realize we had development of a good thing for a true brain illness. I am just grateful to have better meds. Now I need to accept my illness and stay on medication. And I am grateful for sites like this, psychiatric researchers and providers that care, pharm companies that do work on meds because they want to improve care for mentally ill people.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	35-44	7/13/2008 9:40:37 AM	I HAD been taking Prozac for several years. I had many (too many)conditions for which it prescribed...Bulimia, depression,Bipolar and panic attacks. (fun, huh?) I eventually stopped my Bulimia, but that was due to a wonderful treatment center and MUCH needed bathroom supervision. I don't credit Prozac with my 'cure'. Three months ago I was realizing that the Prozac was doing nothing for my depression-actually at a point, I felt as if was making me MORE depressed.  I would yawn all day at work and immediately would pass out on the coach while watching TV...always. Along with the help of my Dr., we decided that Prozac wasn't for me. We decided to switch to (can I say this?) another form of antidression...W&amp;*lb&amp;^rin.I have my energy back, I don't pass out at 7pm anymore, gone are the days of yawning all day. I am SO glad that I am off of Prozac.

I SAW NO HOPE NO REASON TO SURVIVE, NOW THAT I AM ON PROZAC I AM STILL IN EMOTIONAL PAIN, BUT I FINALLY!!!!! SEE A LIGHT. AFTER 3 YRS I SEE HOPE.
Panic Disorder	tired, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	7/12/2008 10:11:53 AM	I started this medication about 4 weeks ago, having never used any type of medication for panic/anxiety attacks...After taking the 20 mg dosage once daily, I am having bad effects..my legs/arms feel like jello, I am constantly tired, yawning, and still having anxiety.  Doctors wanted to increase dosage, I refused, I am weaning myself from this drug..it is NOT for me.
Depression	live.love.laugh, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/9/2008 4:03:40 PM	Prozac has been wonderful for me. I had a baby last year as well as my older step-daughters move in with us on top of having an 8 year too. There were so many adjustments for t me make and without this medication. I would still not be dealing well with everyone. I am also OCD and this has give me more patience than I have ever had before. Hallelujah!
Panic Disorder	Vizzle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	7/9/2008 10:09:43 AM	I just started taking Prozac 10mg... Even that small amount makes me drowsy, nauseous, dizzy, headaches, and bouts of laziness, so my doc told me to take it every other day until my brain gets used to it. I notice some results already but I am still weighing out my overall opinion. I have been having panic attacks associated with constant worry. It has seemed to curb the worry a lot... I am just very hopeful that I made a good decision... And after seeing these reviews, I am having a little bit more faith in the drug. 
Depression	happy girl,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		7/9/2008 2:24:54 AM	Prozac has helped me so much. I take it at night to avoid stomach upset. The side effect I have noticed is the sweating. I will just break out in these sweats when I am not ding anything. Other then that I am happy again.
Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/8/2008 9:57:30 PM	I felt better the first week I took this medication! I am so happy and feel like myself again. I was drowsy the first day and by day 2 I felt normal with 20mgs.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/8/2008 10:03:15 AM	It took about 2 weeks of taking the med consistently to begin feeling better.  Now the constant sense of dread and sadness that I lived with for so long is gone, which is just fantastic!!!  I still have to deal with small bouts of depression/anxiety, which I would consider to be at normal levels of every day living.  The only draw back is that I find that I am a little drowsy at times (and I only take 10mg/day), but for the sense of peace that I have, the trade off is worth it!  
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	7/7/2008 7:03:46 PM	Prozac was very helpful for many years. I didn't have any side effects. It got me through a bad depression and gave me back the ability to enjoy life. Lately, it hasn't been as effective, so I'm going to try Cymbalta at my doctor's recommendation.

I yawn all the time and I just want to go to sleep.  My eyes get very heavy and it is very difficult to function at work like this.  I get home from work in the evening and just want to crash on the couch, no energy level whatsoever.  I have to force myself to get anything done.

Thats a lot on a poor little 19 year old like me. But after thinking  something was wrong with me, my doctor put me on 20mg Prozac and I feel much better. I dont cry at everything and stupid little things don't get to me anymore. I dont stress out over stupid things like traffic and bills. I even sleep better at night. I am no longer confrontational with others. The only bad thing about it is that it makes my Tourette symptoms stronger but its worth the extra little tics I get. I can actually live a normal life.

I haven't seen that on every website that talks about Prozac though. Has anyone experienced that? That condition ruined my girlfriend's life and I am worried about taking a drug that may cause it. Any feedback would be appreciated.

Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	6/24/2008 12:18:08 PM	I've been on 20mg for about 4 wks. Read the reviews and side effects before I started taking the med &amp; they scared me to death! Thought I would @ least give the med a try.  Have had NO adverse side effects.  I go to sleep better @ night &amp; do not take any OTC sleep meds.  (Took OTC sleep meds for @ least 2 yrs or more). Before starting this med, I cried alot over the least little thing and got very anxious during the day especially if there was the least little unsettling news. I also have a Rx for Xanax 1mg, but seldom use it. I have used this before in the past (because of my divorce and a VERY difficult daughter) and liked it, but I am very cautious not to take it unless I think I need it, I do not want to become dependent. My doctor told me that my family &amp; friends would most likely notice a change before I would and he's right!

Does it normally take a while when you just switch from one anti depressant to another without weening down just one day my doctor told me to begin 20 mg of prozac because my celexa was not working and I was getting worse. Was anyone else slow to feel the effects? and how long to I continue before I tell my doctor that Im not feeling better.

Some side effects not commonly acknowledged that i've experienced are frequent outbreaks of acne, however not severe.  Also experience some nausea and loss of appetite.  Have also noticed a dramatic difference in the number of headaches for the better.  Before starting on meds headaches occured at least daily and were severe where as now i get them rarely.

The first time I was on it I was on it for 2 years. Since I've been on it this time around it's been about 2 and 1/2 months, I wonder how long it will work. Pesonally it is a wonder drug until it stops working, but keep at it, after being taken off of it and switched to some different meds but you can always be put back on it. Good luck all.

I actually lose weight while taking it, after breifly stopping the drug I actually gained weight, but lost it once I started it again.

Depression	anonymous, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	19-24	5/20/2008 7:23:39 PM	I started taking 20mg of Fluoxetine about a month and a half ago to try to get a hold of my depression. I have had depression on and off for probably 6-8 years or so (I am now 24). I've tried Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and another anti-depression medicine, but Fluoxetine seems to be helping me the best. Some of the other medications actually made things worse for me. I have been dealing with a lot of stressful things in my life over the past few years (and even more here recently), but this has definitely helped me tremendously. The only negative side effect I have experienced thus far with Fluoxetine is losing some sexual desire. This was/is a problem for me because my wife and I are currently trying to conceive. I have never had a problem in this department and actually I would say I had more desire when it comes to sex than most others. Just here recently I think I am starting to get back to normal a little bit in that department. I feel like my sexual desire may be coming back to me like it was before getting on this medication. Overall, I really like Fluoxetine and I think it's worth a shot if you are experiencing depression.

I had insomnia, irritability, and episodes of crying. My doctor started me on generic Prozac 20mg daily. The medication's effects were immediate. I felt much better from the very first day. I have been on the medication for about 5 weeks now and feel as though it is no longer as effective as it once was. I am calm now and stopped the crying episodes but I am quite fatigued, weak, dizzy and have terrible heartburn. I am becoming irritable again, have memory loss and trouble sleeping. I have also been unable to lose weight, no matter what I do. I exercise everyday and eat less and healthier. Not sure if I want to continue on this drug.

Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	5/15/2008 1:18:36 PM	I am 32 now I took this when i was in my teens. I never noticed a dramtic difference in how I felt BUT my family did. They swear it worked wonders. Looking back now it did. I am just starting on it again now. A thing to keep in mind with anti depresants is that it takes time (sometime 6 months) to work. I know I have taken many of them but prozac worked best. I have noticed through my experience and reading up on it that some work well for people but not others, so even though this worked well for me it might not for you.  DON'T expect a miracle from anti depressants they work gradually and you might not know it. Others will notice a difference in you more than you do.

At the time i was told there was no effect on the unborn child. When my son was born he was highly irritable and had alot of difficulty feeding. I have just recently read this could be a posible side effect of the prozac i was prescribed during pregnancy. If i knew the effects it would have on my son I would have never taken it.

I am connected with my feelings again. Also motivated again to bring my weight down. Lost 30 to 35 lbs. now. With building back up some muscle tone.

Depression	Razorback, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	2	5	1	Male	55-64	5/7/2008 4:10:25 PM	After taking Prozac for many years at 60 Mgs daily, my wife was diagnosed with stage IV Lymphoma Feb. 14, 2007. Our life has been a living hell since then. Many Chemo. tratments, hospital stays, a stem cell transplant and nothing has helped. I did some research on the medications my wife was taking prior to the cancer. I went to Eli Lilly's web site and researched the side effects of Prozac. One of the side effects of a high dose is the inflamation of the lympnodes which can lead to Lymphoma cancer. I lowered the dose my wife now takes to 40 MG a day. We can not stop the Prozac now because of this horrible cancer and the depression involved. We are a young retired couple living a life of hell, I feel because of Prozac. Thank you for reading this and remember the most important thing in life is your Health and the Health of the ones you love.

Had a year of therapy, tried to not take meds, but I started at 20mg and hit the perfect amount at 40mg. I am currently weaning myself off of it, and am having no trouble. I had NO side effects besides sleeping more, which is not so bad. I had no sexual side effects either. It worked a lot better than Paxil did.

The first 2 weeks were filled with horribly increased anxiety but my doctor had warned me of that possibility and gave me 0.25 mg  Xanax to get me through.  I'm on week 3 and doing much better.  I sometimes wake up in the middle of sleep with an anxiety attack but those moments are decreasing.  The only side effect I'm currently experiencing is the increased heart rate but it isn't enough to cause dizziness or shortness of breath.  The anxiety is getting much better.

Depression	35 year old, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	4/30/2008 7:08:08 PM	Before using Prozac, I experienced a range of emotions between severe depression to feeling down and foggy. I also thought I had anxiety which was severe enough to cause shaking and most of the time just felt like constant static. I've been taking 20 mg generic Prozac for 10 months now and friends &amp; family &amp; I have noticed a very positive difference. For a time, I thought it was becoming less effective but my Psychiatrist suggested a Cognitive Therapy class. The combination of Prozac, 1-on-1 Therapy, group therapy, and the Cognitive Therapy class have each contributed to a significant reduction in my symptoms. I think it is normal to have positive and negative feelings when reacting to normal events in my life and that continues to happen ALTHOUGH the times when I get down about something do not last for extended periods of time like they used to and I don't get as severely depressed as before. I can still feel sadness about things but it's not the unreasonable &quot;crying for no reason&quot; that I used to experience. I consider Prozac one of many tools that my Psychiatrist has given me. I feel that it's the combination of the Prozac and the different forms of therapy that have eased my symptoms. Additionally, maintaining my weight and health and energy levels are important to me and none of these have been affected by taking Prozac. Now, instead of feeling depressed or anxious, I feel more positive,  clear-headed, and static-free.

Depression	Checkered, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	4/21/2008 10:12:37 AM	I gained 40 pounds in 2 months (from 115 to 155); I no longer cried every day, but the anxiety as a side effect was almost worse.  I was in a perpetual state of fogginess, and just didn't feel right.  I finally stopped taking it after a year a half, and got my life back.  Have learned to care for myself more holistically, with exercise and good nutrition extremely important, as well as limiting harmful factors such as alcohol.

I had had every treatment out there for severe depression. (hospitalizations,ECT and all of the antideppressants on the market)Prozac gave me the chance to live life to the fullest once again.  I have been on it for 18 years and I worry maybe that's too long but I'm going with &quot;if it's not broke don't fix it&quot;.Since prograf I have never had to be hospitalized again.  I have a great husband, job and family.  I never thought that was an option for me.

I have been on paxil for over 15 years and just switched to prozac 2 days ago.  I would like to know if anyone has done anything similar and would like to know their experience on it.  I am very concerned about weight gain.  I was on paxil 10mg. but when i go higher, i gain weight within days even though the higher dose made me feel better.  my dr. suggested the prozac 20mg. and i really don't know if it was my imagination but i wanted to eat all day yesterday.  I love to eat but I have to eat very little to maintain my weight.  My calorie intake is less than 1000 a day.  I treadmill 40 min. at least 3-4 x a week.  I want to be able to eat normally.  My diet is actually very healthy also. Lots of veggies, whole grains etc. Has anyone had a switch of drug and the prozac made them lose weight?

Depression struck me about a month ago and I could barely function, couldn't eat, sleep, could barely take care of my kids or put my mind to rest.The first week I had a few side effects but they were mild. I experienced dizziness and dry mouth.Now, I can eat, sleep and take care of my kids. I am glad I made the decision to take this medication. I still have some anxiety and &quot;negative&quot; thinking but I hope that, with time and therapy, I will be my old self again.I was very reluctant to take any anti-depresssant, because of the few neg. reviews I have read, but the truth is it saved my life.

After taking Prozac for a week I've never looked back!  All those symptoms are gone and life is great again.  I don't worry constantly, stay in bed under the covers and cry because of depression and I don't obcess or things, like mistakes I've made, or that my kids are grown or tramatic events in my life.  I've lost 30 pounds, have lots of energy and am happy 99% of the time.  I am alive once again instead of struggling to get through everyday, not leaving my house because I was afraid of people, and the only real relief I got was sleeping, when I didn't have terribly traumatic night terrors.  I can't tell you how prozac, the generic, has saved my life.  Suicidal thoughts are gone too.  I would recommend it to everyone.  Thank God for my Doctor!  I was so afraid of trying Prozac, but I'm so glad I did.  I plan on being on it for the rest of my life.  I take 20mg daily and I've been on it almost 5 months.

The PTSD gave me anxity and panic attacts.  Then came the Depression.  I self medicated for years, Now I don't have to any more, first I was  put on xanax and then just a couple of monthe ago I was prescrebed Prosac.  Since the Prosac, which took about 1 1/2 weeks to get my system working together I have noticed that I don't have that underlying anger, or beating myself up every day for things that happened in the past.  I have gained some weight, but I feel that once my body comes around that will drop off.  Plus I will never let myself become anorixic again.  This is a antidepresant I do recomend.

Depression	berrygirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	3/20/2008 11:34:42 AM	The effects of this medication, for me, were horrific. Not only did it increase my depression and anxiety but,it also created irrational thoughts which seriously made me think and feel - as if I was going crazy, almost if I had totally &quot;lost it&quot; mentally. Actually thought about checking myself into the hospital, but feared if they admitted me, they would lock me up and throw away the key. Wow, it's simply frightening how   20 mg of Prozac can make a person think that they are truly going crazy and insane!I acknowledge that I do struggle with depression, but I also make a conscious effort to keep things in proper perspective. When I contacted my physician, she wanted me to increase my dosage. Obviously, I refused to continue on the same course - I would rather take nothing at all and &quot;suffer from the blues&quot;, than suffer from extreme irritability,agitation, and irrational thinking. Thank goodness she switched me to Paxil - atleast now, I have no adverse side effects
Depression		2	4	1			3/18/2008 8:19:02 PM	This medicine worked horribly for me. I didn't feel any better and it made me gain tons of weight. My doctor didn't believe me when I told her that I gained between 10 - 15 pounds in 2 months because of this medicine she told me that it was my eating habits. As soon as I started seeing another doctor and switched medications (which I was then told that this medication is mainly used for anxiety which I don't have), I literally droped 10 pounds in 3 days. If you have issues with this medication, trust me there are alternatives out there that work a lot better without the side effects.

No one could get along with me. Wanted to just walk into the woods and disappear or worse. Now I am happy with my marriage, job and parents. My family thinks it is the best thing I every did for myself and others.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/14/2008 5:14:03 PM	I have been on the generic Prozac for 4 years now.  It changed my life.  I finally felt like myself again after many years ofnot knowing what was wrong.  I started out on 20 mg, then increased to 40 mg.  Just a few side effects - night sweats and a little decrease in sex drive.  Also, lost 35#, which was great! I have been very pleased, but now I am pregnant and will beswitching to Wellbutrin per my doctors recommendation.

Depression	39 yr old male, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	35-44	3/7/2008 2:31:46 PM	I had to stop taking this drug after two weeks because it was causing severe dizziness. I could not concentrate at all and it was very disturbing. Interestingly, I had no side effects for the first week.  It was the second week when the dizziness started, and it just would not stop. I think it hit me once the drug built up in my system. I thought side effects would occur as soon as I started taking the drug; no one told me and nothing I read indicated that the problems could be delayed. I wonder if others have had this same experience. I was determined to be patient with this drug, but the dizziness was just too extreme. I know this drug has been great for many, but it just wasn't for me. I am going to try something else. Hope this is helpful to someone.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/4/2008 12:37:31 PM	This drug has helped me so much. (The first 1-2 weeks on it made me feel awful...but I hung in there and now I'm fine.)I was very reluctant to take it at first (it took an unprompted crying fit in my doctor's office for him to ask me to consider it.) I was afraid it would turn me into someone I'm not, but actually, I feel more like myself (minus the excessive anxiety). I used to cry most days and worry to the point of having anxiety attacks. I no longer cry unless there's actually a reason. I do experience pretty serious fatigue (to the point where I fall asleep watching movies quite often). I've started consuming more caffeine and that has helped. (I would love any suggestions for what to do about the fatigue besides caffeine...)

I spent a year on Lexapro. I just saw my doctor last week and I am back on Prozac, at a higher dosage. I believe that was all that was needed. With Prozac, my life is on an even keel again. I feel Prozac has the least amount of side effects and does not affect my core personality like Lexapro did.

I couldn't handle other peoples behavior. I new there was something wrong i went thru four mariages, i wanted someone around but still pushed people away. I drank away my problems for 30 years, at least i thought i did. Ten years after i quit drinking i still felt the same. I finally got to the VA and got help through a Physicatrist. They started me on different Drugs,Prozac was the drug that has helped the most. Its given me my life back.

I thought this was the perfect combination at start as I was happy, more energetic, slept well, and no anxiety and no anger.  Yet, after 3 months, my fatigue returned at a worse degree from the start, increased the dose, fatigue increased and agitation became worse.  After I stopped it, I felt much better again for a while.  Now I am looking for another medication.  The Neurontin unfortunately retains fluids in my body and increase my appetite.  The same experience happened a few years ago.

During the holidays, spending 1 day with family...I have extra clothes. And I dress in layers IN CASE I get hot too quickly, I can unlayer. Doc says there is nothing that can be done for the sweating.  I just cant believe that.  Does ANYONE have this issue?? or know of anything I can ask my doc about that might be able to help?

With two kids at home and one with ADHD, OCD, ODD, and GAD it was a nightmare.  I didn't think my paxil was working so I made an appt to get on something else.  Turned out they put me on Prozac.  I took it for 4 days and felt like I wanted to vomit and die.  It was worse.  I went back to the dr and said I'd rather up the dose of my paxil then try something new like prozac.  I told them how horrible it made me feel.  They said someone should never just stop and start a new drug within a day like that.  The dose should've been monitored.  Never ever take prozac.

Depression	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	2/8/2008 4:11:18 PM	I used Prozac for 8 yrs for mild depression; very effective.  Never manic or manic/depressive.  In May 2007, took Mucinex DM for persistent cough. Began having double vision &amp; manic symptoms.  Later research revealed that DEXTROMETHORPHAN, a common ingredient in many over-the-counter cold products, can produce above side-effects in Prozac patients.  Horrible experience.  Don't find out the way I did.  Always consider side-effects of other products.

My Dr. 1st prescribed Effexor, which was not covred by insurance so he opted for generic Prozac. What a difference it has made! The only down side is, my &quot;already waining sex drive&quot; has really hit &quot;rock bottom&quot;. Oh well, I'll take that over night sweats, any day!

I still take xanax 3 x day. 1 for stress and 2 at night to help me sleep. so far so good. Has anyone had a problem with weight gain? When I first started prozac over 10 yrs ago I lost weight but was also going through a divorce so that could be the reason for the weight loss but now I am at least 50 lbs overweight and wondered if my body has adjusted to it and causes weight gain since I am not so stressed. any comments would be welcome

Don't worry you are not getting dependent on this drug, your body is just going throught changes. I stared on this drug in 3rd grade with 5mg daily and am now up to 180mg weekly,and my body has had no trouble makeing the changes. If your doctor reccomeds taking more, try it, you can always stop if you are not satisfied. Overall I have been very pleased with prozac ,it really changed my life.

I'm usually a very laid back person, however since my last child born Dec. 2006 I have never been the same been very deppressed. I hope this works. The only side affects I've had is drosey and not being hungry. I've been taking it at night so I'm not so sleepy. Have tried Celxa which did nothing. Cymbalta which did nothing and Effexor which gave me bad nightmares.
Other	laura, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/13/2008 10:09:00 AM	I started taking prozac before there was a generic.  I took it for a year and a half with outstanding result. After the generic came out my insurance would not pay for the real deal and switched my to the generic which had little or no effect.  I gained my weight back and then some, I became tire and depressed again, and started having problems with my period again.  I have never had this reaction with any other generic drug, but there is something different with this one and what ever is different is not working for me.  I cannot afford the $300 a month for the real deal, the doctors can't find another drug that work and my insurance will not pay for the prozac.  I am now up to 220 pounds and fight growing depression daily.

I have been on three meds and right now I'm on Cymbalta. All three have made me sleepy so that just might be something I am going to have to face. Prozac helped a little bit but also increased anxious thoughts and thoughts about self injury. It did reduce some physical symptoms though. Cymbalta is working much better!

At that time Iwas not diagnosed with anything in particular.....a lot of everyhing.  Major mood swings...PLUS   I started taking 10 mg. now I take 60mg. per day.

There is no where to begin to tell you how much I appreciate my prozac.

I started feeling a &quot;fake&quot; sort of happy and didn't realize that I wasn't getting better. I attempted suicide on this drug 3 months after starting it. Being hospitalized again at a different facility they upped the dose. I noticed the same feelings weren't getting better and my doctor didn't understand that it wasn't helping me so I just decided to stop using it. I felt better not being on it than I did while I was using it. I am now taking Effexor and I find it much more helpful than Prozac.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	11/25/2007 11:32:40 PM	I have been on this medication for sometime now and I cannot even begin to explain how it has changed my life for the better.  I would recommend to everyone experiencing depression to not be afraid and to ask your doctor about this.  I have two kids, i took this through most of my second pregnancy and while breastfeeding and it was completely safe...but im sure the warnings are on there for a reason, just my personal experience was awesome.

It has helped me tremendously. I take it for OCD (mild) and depression. I have tried Zoloft and Celexa and neither were as effective.

I tried the BCP-only first and found myself better, but with periods of anger rather than sadness.  When I started taking Prozac I finally felt like myself again for the first time in over a year.  I have had some issues of insomnia recently and now take it every other day instead of every day which seems to have helped.

Was on  Lexapro and that didn't work to well but kept me about 2 steps below going &quot;ballistic&quot;. Prozac works much better. keeps me about 5-10 steps below blowing my top. I think i need a higher dose though. No longer do drugs and don't have the desire to drink. I used to smoke pot regularly along with drinking STRONG malt liqour. I can now think and function rationally even when under stress. I am still very time driven. If I don't take every 22 hours watch out. to have a laps in dosage means trouble for anyone who steps on my toes. Didn't take on time this morning and inadvertenly hurt my wifes feeling pretty bad. I'm sorry baby.

I do not have the impulse to self-medicate with alcohol or illicit drugs.  I hate to sound flippant, but I do now feel &quot;high on life&quot;.  Amazing, miraculous medication.

I've taken Effexor and Zoloft since and neither of these has had that side effect.  Furthermore, I experienced an electric shock sensation in my hands, head and feet when I was being wean off that lasted for two months.  I will never use Prozac again.

The doctor tried other medications and none of them were right for me.  However, Generic Prozac was terrible.  When I went on that it was as if I went cold turkey off regular prozac and started taking sugar pills.  I went into a severe depression on the generic and it took many months to get my life back on track.  Name Brand Prozac is wonderful -- Generic Prozac should be taken of the market.

I stopped using it after about four years and the b_tchiness came back big time.  I also had a lot of vasovagal syncopy (passing out) episodes using prozac (which doctors told me was anxiety/panic attacks).  I didn't feel anxious and I certainly wasn't panicking about anything.

I've been taking Prozac 1/2 a pill to start once a day and I have very severe nausea from this.  I know I have to stick this out for a few weeks until its starts working but can anyone who is one this tell me if this will pass soon.  Don't think I can handle 3 weeks of feeling like this. Thanks
