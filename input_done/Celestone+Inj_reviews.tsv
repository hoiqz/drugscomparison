I have had another steriods injected into the knee with no relief obtained from it. After my injection with Celestone, I was able to do a deep knee bend (a feat that I had not performed for the past five years) without pain. For me, it was a miracle drug. I have heard that the effectiveness is dependent upon the location and direction of the injection. If it gets in the &quot;right&quot; spot, it will provide relief.
