Depression	grillins2cool, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	55-64	7/27/2012 1:37:21 PM	It works well while taking it, however when I miss a dose, I have severe withdrawal symptoms.  My mind races and I can not hold a thought long enough to act on it.  I become dysfunctional without it.
Depression	 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female		7/22/2012 8:53:01 PM	This drug was a big help in the beginning, but please do not take it!!! It did help me in the beginning, but it is damn near impossible to get off this medication. I started at 250 and was a freaking zombie for two years, finally went down to 150 and had severe withdrawal symptoms. Extremely painful brain zaps, horrible headache, sweating like crazy, terrible nightmares! I finally adjusted to 150 and have been trying to taper down from that for the last 2 months. I am now at 35 mg and can't seem to move down any more. It is a freaking nightmare being on this drug. I don't believe in lawsuits but if I had the money I'd sue Wyeth pharma if I could!!! This stuff is poison! I have gained 30 pounds, lost a lot of hair and have no sex drive!!! Please don't take this dangerous medication!
Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Male	35-44	7/18/2012 10:55:00 PM	I started taking this about 6 yrs ago. Wish I would have read reviews before starting it. It has really helped me with everyday life, feel much better about myself and just take things as they come to me, no big deal. But if I should miss a dose, or even a little late, it does things to my body that I just can't explain. Kind of feels like having the flu. And I get these like electical zapps through out my body. I know if I should ever decide to stop taking it, it will be pure hell getting off of it. My advice is to avoid this med and hopefully there is something else out there that will help. Also advise researching before starting any drugs. Like I said, had I done some research about Effexor prior to starting it, I would not have ever started it.
Bipolar Depression	BillWRocks, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/15/2012 3:51:15 PM	I was put on 150mgs right out of the gate. It took 2-3weeks to see the results. My depression has been lifted. I am fearful of weight gain and withdraw symtoms. My rx medications are close to 1800.00 per month.If not working, go to the county for help. The have behavioral health workers to help you through a very dark time. This has been the absolute worst depression I have ever experienced. Death spiral. Had to choose between sitting at home suicidal and alone or be hospitalized. Been there, never want to go back. They treat you like a kindergartener. No respect for the disease we carry with us constantly. I wish everyone the best on their own journey, it can be really awful,a death spiral.

My husband and I wanted to try for another baby so I told my doc I wanted off..he cut me down to half which wasn't too bad, but he said stay on it for 2 weeks at half then just stop..BAD ADVICE! DO NOT ever just stop it!! The dizzy spells, the feel of everything in slow motion (don't know how I avoided 3 major car crashes in one morning with my toddler in the car)the emotional crash..it was horrible. I've been off of it for about a week now and the physical side effects have somewhat got better but the emotional..not so much

It was supposed to lessen the side effects from menopause - sweats, anxiety &amp; insomnia.  Instead, I became must WORSE &amp; eventually attempted suicide when weaning off the medication.  I don't think the drs monitor you closely enough while on this medication.

I have gained about 30 pounds since being on it. Im slowly getting off the medicine but the withdraws are the worst thing I ever delt with. I felt like I was going to die. My whole body would shake. I felt so sick to my stomach. My anxiety jumped through the roof. It was horrible. I could not even function. Im down to the 37.5mg and scared to even cut myself down from that. I dont want to go through the withdraw again. 
Depression	survivor, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/4/2012 9:47:16 AM	I have found that Effexor has helped me in my depression and has taken the edge off.  In having periodically blood work done it appears that medication is working without any side effects.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	5/30/2012 7:10:52 PM	I really liked this drug in the beginning. It gave me my sex drive back (unlike any other). However, if I would miss even ONE day of this pill the side effects are SEVERE! I am not trying to get off of this pill and the side effects are INSANE! ie: Depression came back, Severe Dizziness, Sleepy-Tired ALL the time, Emotionally unstable,etc. Don't ever start this pill if you do not intend to continue taking it forever. You will never be able to get off of it without INTENSE, SEVERE side effects!!!

It keeps me balanced and not feeling so fragile. The anxiety is sometimes there but is not so overpowering. Some side effects like wieght gain and ejeculation problems sometimes.If you miss several doses it can get cotton head and anxious. If I ever go off I will have to ween off slowly.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	45-54	4/30/2012 7:45:22 AM	Depression relief absolutely.  Experiencing some annoying side effects.  Hot flashes, allergy symptoms, more forgetful than usual, waking up earlier and can't go back to sleep. Maybe I could take a lower dose.  Will see doctor soon.
Depression	MuffinFace, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	25-34	4/14/2012 4:43:56 PM	This medication helps tremendously with my depression and helps me get a good night's rest if taken at night. I have however gained 20 pounds.I went off this for a bit with other heavy medications and didn't have a problem. If you feel like the withdrawls are severe you should be weening yourself off slowly. If you do that it shouldn't be horrible. This is the case with most psychotropic meds.
&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs		4	5	4			4/13/2012 10:16:58 PM	Started with 75 mg. My therapist said I needed to raise it to 150 mg. Had the mood swings, depression with other peri menopausal symptoms. This med definitely raises your body temperature. But it definitely calmed my moods down. Almost too much . I don't have the feelings of panic or urgency on certain situations which I did before. My emotions are also more flat. Also helps with Obbsesive thoughts. Going thru tough times in marriage too. Think it has helped me overall. Also feel dizzy when missing a dose.

I have noticed minor changes in my mood, I sleep much more, no weight gain.  Excessive yawning does happen and night sweats as well.  I am giving this medication a few more months to give me its full effect!

I've been on 75 mg twice a day for about 6 months and I am very happy with the results. I have not gained any weight at all. In fact, I've lost a few pounds. There are some side effects, but they beat the heck out of constant panic attacks which cause vomiting in my case. Don't forget a  dose, or nasty withdrawls will happen fairly quickly. Overall, I'm very happy.

One good side effect is that I feel much better emotionally. My fibro symptoms are all but gone, also. However, some other side effects are not so pleasant. My husband says I &quot;shake&quot; all night long. Tremors. Even after a year on this med. Also, alcohol and Effexor DO NOT mix! Miserable headaches the morning after. 
Extreme Apprehension or Fear of Social Interaction	CrayZhedd, 25-34 Male  (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	25-34	2/5/2012 5:14:32 PM	This drug worked wonders when I first started using it. I tried 3 other drugs before this one and it's the best. Unfortunately, all of them have sexual side-effects. Then, you start needing more and more, and it's hard to get off of. Very weird withdrawal. Diziness, head flashes, waekness, crabiness. But once you take it again, you never realized how much it helped. It makes you feel good, and even keeps me from going to sleep. SO--there are a couple of ups and downs to keep in mind. -T., Madison, WI

I have had a lot of deaths in my life and became overly anxious and depressed. Effexor made me able to think again. I take 75mg daily and I hope I can continue on this medication. After I started taking this, I realized how much I really needed something several years ago. I can't comment on withdrawal as I make sure I don't miss a dose.

I've gone down to one pill per day, taken in the morning, and that helps with the side effects.

As I got older I tried to wean myself off of my previous medicine. I went one year without medication and it was terrible : I couldn't drive or work. I decided to go back on medication and my Doctor suggested we try Effexor. For the past 5 years I have been on a low dose of 75 mg that I take once a day before bed. My life is so much better. I can do anything. I have travelled, went to University and no longer suffer. I know I will most likely have to be on medication forever because of my chemical imbalance, and this worries me for when I want to start a family (I haven't read too many positives about being on Effexor and pregnant). If i miss a dose I can tell right away as I feel dizzy and disorientated. The pros of this medication outweigh the cons for me.

I was using it for about three years.  It actually helped get rid of really bad headaches I was getting, but I gained 30 lbs in 3 months. I could not sleep, and when I did I had the most horrible dreams and woke up most nights in a panic. During the day I went from being emotionless to a screaming lunatic.  My doctor refused to help wean me off the drug so I did it on my own.  It took me almost 2 months to get past the really bad withdrawal symptoms, I fell on a flight of stairs when my legs went numb.  I have been off the drug for over 3 years but the side effects still hit me. It is as if my brain takes a few seconds to digest information, conversations, questions anything. I often find myself staring at the person not understanding and then I finally process the information.  I have half the mental ability I had before taking this and no motivation or drive.  If anyone has gone through this and found a way out, would love to hear from you.

I started this one and have had problems with it.  The doctor's kept increasing the dosage and it caused more and more side effects.  I stopped eating, sleeping, felt like crying all the time, etc.  Was hard to get off of.  Actually was hospitalized and took other meds to get off of.  Not a big fan of this drug.  I met people on this for 5 years and I met people that can't stand it.

I was tired, but unable to sleep. My thinking was cloudy.  It did not help my social anxiety or help me talk to people and make friends. It just made me accept my aloneness.
Depression	Ladyrider, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	8/26/2011 10:09:17 AM	This has been the worst experience of my life with a medication at least with depression I didnt care. The severe side effects that are causing me to come off this poision happended overnight: gained 13lbs in less than a month, developed severe dry mouth so bad I would choke, severe severe rage. Im almost done with this poision and the withdrawls are horriable I lost 5lbs in this last week due to no appetitie and when I eat I throw up, I feel like I'm on speed and aggitated when I'm awake and when I crash I sleep and never want to get up, it has destroyed my life and marriage, please do you research 1st dont take your doctors word that this is a great drug i thought so until it caught up with me.

She said this has been effective. I just took one pill and never felt worse from the medications than I have with the side effects of the menopause. I feel nausea, blrured vision and the worsest sudden headache and depression.  I hope I don't suffer permanent damage from the medication. This is not worth the risk. Doctors need to think twice before prescribing this medication.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	45-54	8/15/2011 3:33:14 AM	I was prescribed effexor to help with the depression that comes with fibromyalgia.  I loved effexor, lost about 50 pounds, was singing instead of cussing.  I have been on it for about 5 years.  Started to notice extremely bad side effects if I missed a dose, progressed to the point if I did not take it at exactly the same time every day I would have terrible side effects.  I literally felt Like I was dying!  I could barely talk much less go to work!  My heart felt &quot;sick&quot;, head zapping numbness/pain, felt like a stroke or seizure, forgetfulness, extreme lethargy, brain fog, confusion, blurred vision, on and on it goes.  The worst part was the mood swings, from crying at a toilet paper ad to screaming at and hitting the computer for going slower than a second.  The rage is the worst...my poor family avoid me as much as possible because I have become such a horror to be around.  It is the worst withdrawal symptoms I have ever seen.  I kept trying to stay on it because of the weight loss and the &quot;happy&quot; syndrome (until I missed a dose of course).  This drug is dangerous and nearly impossible to get off of.
Depression	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	8/12/2011 2:25:26 PM	Started out on 75mg/day, then increased to 150mg/day. It seems to really help me stay on an evan keel. Not too high, Not too low. Very satisfied.
Depression	depressed, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	8/8/2011 7:11:32 PM	After taking this med for quite some time I developed excessive sweating from using a higher dose which does help with my depression.  This is embarassing (the sweating) my hair gets wet, my face, and sweat just runs down my temples.  My make-up &quot;melts&quot; and to have hot coffee is terrible.  The meds can definitely work but there are side effects sometimes.  I am now going to try another drug to treat the sweating problem, hopefully it will help.

Depression	Jeanelizabeth, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/10/2011 7:23:18 PM	I kept fighting the idea of going back on a antidepressant, but I finally gave in. I was taking Citalopram but had to discontinue it because it conflicts with Tamoxifen which I have to be on for 5 years. For the first couple of weeks I had problems with constipation, but eventually got back to normal. Now I am &quot;loving life&quot; again and couldn't be happier. If I have to stay on if for the rest of my life, I'm ok with that. So far, no weight gain! :)

I'm miserable.  I sweat profusely with just the littlest activity.  Head sweats are terrible.  I need to stop this medication because my legs and ankles are all just retaining water like mad but do I have to check myself into a hospital to get through the withdrawal symptoms?  I've tried cutting down on the dosage but I get the spins and feel like I'm gonna throw up.  I'm not sure what to do but I'm not happy being on this.  I've never gained so much weight in my life.  I now weigh 185 and I haven't weighed this much since I gave birth to my daughter 18 years ago.

It works for my depression, but I've been aware of eye problems and other common side effects such as sexual, ringing in the ears, unusual dreams, dry mouth and constipation.  But lately I have additional problems - stomach always upset, gas, bloating, stomach cramps, itching, and muscle twitching. I am thinking of asking my doctor for a new medication.
Depression	presley1835, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	6/7/2011 9:54:24 AM	I have tried several depression medications, as most of you who post and read here have. it's about finding the right med or the right combo. i have to say that all i have to take is this now. no need for abilify, which i found overpriced and ineffective. not everyone has the same experience or gets the same side effects. mine is about an hour of nausea every day. So worth it to me. I did not find that it made me gain weight as much as other drugs, but that has a direct correlation to my level of activity too. for more than one reason, i am not excited about having to ween off of it when i get pregnant. i do plan on taking it again, if needed, once i can again.

Depression	FatKat, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	6/3/2011 1:20:27 AM	1. Ultimately, I began feeling jittery and had trouble getting a good night's sleep.  2. Even the generic of this drug can be extremely expensive.  3. When trying to discontinue the Effexor, I experienced nausea, diarrhea, and episodes of rapid heartbeat for weeks.  I'm switching back to an SSRI, but NOT Paxil.  It caused weight gain.  Meanwhile, it's still not totally understood why the same drug can affect different people in such a variety of ways. Thus, finding a &quot;perfect fit&quot; may take some unpleasant trial and error.  (When it came to Paxil, the perfect fit certainly didn't extend to my skinny jeans!)  How convenient for physicians to have us available as experimental rats...  Am I bitter?  No, just increasingly wary.

This medication has worked for me but getting off of it is very hard.  I have body zaps, shakiness, dizziness, nausea, sweating and flu like symptoms...I suggest taking a long period of time and use some xanax or adivan to help.

I am completely clear of any side effects after maybe a month or two.

I always felt &quot;Dead&quot;. The worst part was getting off it. I went through a rough time for a week. With twitching, Sweating, &amp; what they call &quot;Brain zaps&quot; which feels like an electric shock going from your brain through your body. It was the worst thing to come off of. I thought i was going to die. I couldn't even walk i was lifeless. I would NEVER recommend this to anyone.

My frequent &quot;crying spells&quot; are gone and im lees likly to think negative thoughts. I have lost about 10 pounds since i went on it. The side effects are BAD :( my sexual function has decreased to almost zero... if you miss a dose for a day i get really dizzy and sick to my stomach. and also i sweat alot at night. I still want to be on this medication but im not sure if the side effects are worth it...

I exercise 5 times a week for 1-2 hours a day. decided to go off medication and I am having horrible feelings. brain feels like every few minutes someone shakes you violently, eyes have a hard time focusing. also feel as if I am slower mentally then those around me. over whelming feeling that I am not clicking on all levels. hope that this feeling will go away in about 7 more days. bad issues: weight gain, loss of sexual desire, and the effects of going off med, I would strongly recommend trying another drug that does not have these side effects. I dont know what is worse the anxiety/depression or the feeling i have when I missed 1 dose/and stopping taking the meds. I think Dr (psych) prescribed this med all too fast for me.

Withdrawals were horible first 3 days. Had all the terrible withdrawals and basically stayed in bed. I believe the switch to Celexa instead of going off Effexor cold turkey saved me weeks of agony. I am sorry for so many that have to completley go off Effexor due to losing their insurance, etc. I would not go back on Effexor or recommend it unless you are going to be on it for life! I chose Celexa because it is less expensive therefore, insurance is willing to pay without the hassels I had with Effexor. Also, after researching Celexa, supposedly the side effects are not as severe if I choose to stop it later.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	3/9/2011 4:27:24 PM	I took Effexor for several years.  At first, I thought it was a miracle cure...my depression was cured and I lost a lot of weight!!!  As time went by it was less and less effective.  When the decison was made to change meds I could not get off of it!  I went thru the proper procedure to wean myself off and, of course, i was doing so per my doctor's instructions, but the withdrawals were unbearable!  It was like my brain was scrambled!  I couldnt make ANY decisions!  If someone asked me if I wanted coke or pepsi I was not capable of deciding.  After much agony I finally got thru it and was put on Lexapro.  Lexapro is not nearly as helpful as Effexor was, but I can go for several days without Lexapro and still function normally.  I'm not sure what the deal with Effexor is, but it's a real shame because it was very effective for a long while.  
Depression	Depression Survivor, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/9/2011 2:14:20 PM	I was put on way too high a dose for my small frame...150mg Effexor XR in addition to sleeping tabs and Xyprexa...once off the sleeping tabs and Xyprexa it became painfully obvious that I was still extremely over-medicated!! Effexor was slowly poisoning me...I had extreme asthenia(fatigue, weakness of body, lack of strength and energy). To top it off my psychiatrist would not listen to me or take my complaints seriously!! Eventually I had the courage to see just a GP. I now take 10mg of Cipralex and I have my life back!! I almost lost everything - my life, my husband and my children. Effexor can be a dangerous drug...be very careful of it!!

I worked ok, but I had the strangest sensations visually.  If I turned on a bright light first thing in the morning, I would see streaks of light.  I had terrible vivid mixed up dreams that left me tired in the morning.  I developed double vision and the eye Dr. couldn't find a real cause.  I stopped Effexor and went on Celexa and my vision corrected itself.  Not sure if Effexor caused it, but won't take a chance again.

Within 30 min of taking, I was incredibly nauseous, couldn't eat, dizzy and had violent diarrhea.  Went to bed and didn't sleep ALL night.  Nauseous all night and wanted to throw up 3 times but maintained myself.  Cold, clammy, weak, shaky, spacey.  In the morning, eyes dilated, nauseous, tired, basically felt like doo-doo.  This all in a matter of 12 hours!  Looking at the long-term side effects of this drug, it is sooo not worth it!  I wish I would have researched this before agreeing with my Dr.  I will deal with anxiety naturally... exercising more and eating better.  Oh, and the thought of gaining 30-60 pounds!  What the??  No way!  That would give more more stress and anxiety.

First left arm tremors, then major ragedy Ann uncontrollable shaking that moved to rt side.  Anytime I moved around I would start shaking so bad!  The withdraw of this med has been way beyond hell. And I was only on it for 2 months.   Explosive headaches, buzzing &amp; convulsion like shaking. BAD BAD  drugI will never take another pill without researching it myself.

I was suicidal, cutting myself worse, couldn't sleep at night, slept all day, was like a zombie, lethargic, and went to my dr 19 times in 2 months during the withdrawal.

HOWEVER,  when I decided to stop taking the medication, I experienced many negative physical issues including passing out and being taken to the hospital, low blood pressure and a seizure like episode.  Had I known how difficult it would be to stop the medication, I never would have started it.
Depression	None, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	12/18/2010 7:20:50 AM	I've been taking 150mg for a few years now. I started with 37.5mg and after a life trauma, my doctor increased the dosage to 300mg.  I have tried many times to reduce the dosage but my doctor insists that I take a medium dose.  He pisses me off because he has never suggested counseling.  The biggest side effect I wish to share are the frightful, colorful, detailed nightmares.  If I miss one dose, my dreams are so very realistic.  People I have known and know now are part of my dream.  Situations with these people where I feel that things were unresolved or I cause negativity in our lives are animated so clearly in these dreams.  Sometimes I purposely don't take this medicine to see what I will dream next because I remember everything.  
Bipolar Depression	Polar, 65-74 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		65-74	11/24/2010 11:26:54 PM	It brought me up from depression a year ago after some months of trying with other drugs by my doctor. She said results are not the same for all patients; that's why, I guess, doctors sometimes have to experience with different drugs until they find the appropriate one for the specific patient.I hope this message may be useful for many in the world afflicted by deppresion or bipolar disorder.

Side effects for me were: extreme tiredness...no energy, yet I had little to no anxiety. So, if you struggle with weight like I do, STAY AWAY! It really helps with stress-management but the weight gain for me was a bigger stressor. Also, the withdrawal symptoms for this med are WORSE than what made me &quot;need&quot; it in the first place!!! I am SOO glad to be finally off this med. Proceed with caution if you plan on taking this!!! 
Depression	Mikey, 45-54 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4		45-54	11/22/2010 7:08:17 PM	I have been on this med for 6 years.  I started on 150 mg, moved to 225 mg, and then back to 150 mg.  225 worked best for me but insurance insisted on 150.  I don't really have any side effects other than possible sex drive diminishment.  If I miss it for just one day I begin to feel the negative physical effects immediately, which seem to be withdrawal symptoms. It works pretty well for me.  An internist prescribed it, but a psychiatrist would like to ween me off of it, which I refuse to do.

Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	45-54	11/19/2010 3:57:51 AM	   My doctor prescribed this med for me 8 years ago for depression.  I started with 75mg and now take 225mg daily.  It is very effective in regards to controlling my depression, but there are negatives too.  I have gained over 50 pounds while taking Effexor and my sex drive is nearly nonexistent.  I forget things often and my family notices this.  I cannot remember the last time I cried. It is great to feel like I can cope with life, but I do not like the extra weight.

Neuropathic Pain	Jesemine, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/3/2010 11:10:25 AM	I had tried almost every medicine I could to try to stop the pain in my body. I asked my doctor to change my depression medicine. An added benefit of this medication for me was that it greatly diminished the pain enough so that I could move around again without stopping continous times along the way to my destination.

Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	10/21/2010 2:57:42 PM	I take 75 mg of the extended release per day.  Have had instances where it seemed this was not enough (depression continued), but increasing the dosage by 50% was not effective at all, even detrimental (depression worsened).  Am now back to the 75 per day, but still battle with depression.  Am hesitant to add any more meds to my life.  Started this drug in the wake of breast cancer (chemo, radiation and after-effects) 3 years ago, in conjunction with Ativan (for anxiety) and Neurontin (for extreme neuropathy).  Have completely eliminated Ativan and Neurontin, but feel like something is missing...  Following up with doctors on correct dosage is very difficult (depressing!).

I was then hospitalized for 2wks in psyc unit. after trying five other med combos I was put back on effexor 300mg I also take a mood stabilizer.I no longer see a therapist(stopped 3yrs ago). I am now down to 75mg. I also take a mood stabilizer(I have bipolar).I take my meds at bedtime. This helps with the tiredness. Its very important to take at the same time everyday. I have very few side affects as long as I take it regularly.  I do have dry mouth, but gum helps with this.  and I have to be careful not to get overheated in the summer.I am not concerned with withdrawal symptoms because I will be on medication for the rest of my life.  Thats fine with me.  I have a full time job and am raising my daughter in my own. I am a very functional person now.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	9/29/2010 7:35:49 AM	This medication works well; however I had experienced several side effects that made me uncomfortable (nausea, dry mouth, stomach pain and constipation)after three days of taking the medication.  The pain usually started during the digestion of the medication.The anxiety had subsided and I feel okay after the stomach pain went away.  I might give this med a few weeks to see if I can manage the pain.  And, I have not noticed any change in my appetite.  I exercise on a regular basis and actually have noticed that I dropped a couple of pounds.  Although I do not think that the medication had anything to do with that.  So, I guess I will have to check back in and let you know how it goes.

Depression	Veronica, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	9/23/2010 10:42:53 AM	My family doctor started me on a dose of 300mgs daily. I experienced constant shaking of my hands, cold clammy sweats whenever I would exert myself, profound lethargy, confusion, worsening of depression. I felt like I was going mad. I was so nauseous during the day that I could only eat late at night and gained about 20 pounds. After three months of &quot;sticking with it&quot; I called my doctor about the side effects. She told me to quit cold turkey. After three days of feeling like I was about to have a seizure I sought a second opinion and was put back on the drug with a plan to get off of it completely. I am now down to 37.5 mgs and am feeling much better but am looking forward to being off completely. I would recommend seeing a psychiatrist to be prescribed this drug. Family doctors, in my experience, do not know enough about this drug to prescribe it to anyone.

I feel it is time to reduce the drug and to begin slowly going off it due to severe headaches since beginning the med.

I was in better shape before I ever started. BE AWARE that it may take up to 12 months for withdrawals to go away, which for me and many others include: insomnia, uncontrollable shaking, vomiting, loss of appetite, panic attacks, paranoia, muscle pain/spasm, headache, dizziness,electric shock sensation in brain, confusion, sweating, chills, fever, and WORST of all suicidal thoughts and attempts. This stuff should be illegal. I even got a psychiatrist to admit that it has the worst side effects of any antidepressant. THIS DRUG IS BAD STUFF!

As long as it's taken everyday you might be OK, but as soon as you start to come off it taking it every other day the side effects of withdrawl start. I am starting Lamital now.

Other	ALA, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	8/24/2010 11:39:05 AM	I was only recently prescribed this drug for my mild anxiety that has been escalated due to a birth-control implant. I did not feel I needed something so potent, so i took half of the 75mg I was prescribed. Within 45 minutes I was so sick and confused I could hardly communicate. I was immediatelty sick, and was throwing up the rest of the day, not to mention in a state of delerium. I have taken medications like Zoloft, Wellbutrin, and Xanax, but NEVER have I reacted so badly to a medication. I am under the influence that I may have had an allergic reaction to this, that or it was just too potent for me and my needs. I suggest assesing your need for a medication, and how intense you think your anxiety/depression is. I feel this drug provides more seratonin/dopamine than I may have needed for my mild-moderate anxiety.
Depression	NJLINDA, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	8/21/2010 2:14:13 PM	About January, 2003, I started taking an anti-depressant. I tried several: Zoloft, Lexapro, and I can't remember the others. A friend recommended I try Effexor XR (75 mg.), so I did. At one point (a couple of yrs. ago), I felt better &amp; weaned myself off of the 75 mg. by taking it every other day for a week or 2. I had no problems with stopping Effexor. However, something else happened (I can't remember exactly what),&amp; I felt I needed to start back on Effexor again. I'm tired all the time, and I DO have some weird dreams &amp; flashbacks to dreams when I am awake during the day. I usually drink red wine every evening, so that may also have an adverse effect! However, overall, I am very satisfied with Effexor.

Yes, I am afraid of ever coming off it, but maybe I won't have to.  Some side effects, losing weight in the beginning (yahoo!), dry mouth and sweating. All stopped soon enough. Everyone is different for sure, but this literally saved my life.

Was taking for Fibromyalgia and it was like a &quot;magic bullet&quot; for my symptoms.  However, after about 1 1/2 years the effexor lost its effectiveness.  I would like to try it again, as nothing else Ihave taken has been as effective overall for my FM symptoms.

I feel happy and incontrol for the first time in many years. I have tried to come off the medication over a slow and log period of dropping the doseage but still get very off balance and feeling very nauseated. I would like to come off them but unable to get past the withdrawl symptoms.

I have been showing some improvement in my mood. Early side effects have diminished an my doc has upped the dose to 150mg. Now I'm experiencing some more anxiety as a result and am hoping they diminish with more time.  Side effects for me include: sweating &amp; some fatigue.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	7/23/2010 11:06:38 AM	I have been on Effexor XR for over 10 years. Began at the 75mg level at the age of 18 and switched to 150mg after a year. Recently switched to the regular from the extended release due to my insurance. This medicine has been amazing for me. I used to experience severe mood swings, anger and anxiety. The only side effects I have are vivid nightmares on occasion and I bruise very easily. I did take this drug with both pregnancies due to the fact that the benefits outweighed the consquences and at the time not much was known about the effects Effexor has on pregnancy. My boys were perfectly healthy and happy. I have tried to go off of Effexor a couple times working with my doctor. I was weaned off and put on another medication over a few months. The withdrawl and side effects were horrid. I had severe anxiety to the point I felt like my insides were shaking. I had flu-like symptoms and felt like my head was in a cloud. The anger was the worst. I was full of rage for no reason and was extremely mean. I can't say for sure my symptoms were caused from withdrawl or were from my depression. I would highly recommend this medicine if you truly need it but be very careful and research the side effects. Plan on being this medicine forever once you begin.

My doctor put me on the generic version of Effixor (Venlafaxine)about 6 years ago and I have been on it since. I have to say it is a &quot;wonder&quot; drug. It's  made life on earth worth living. The improvement this drug has made greatly out weights the negative side effects. I take 150mg per day. 75mg in the morning and 75mg at bed time. You can't miss a dose. If I do my brain starts to hum inside, (i can't explain it as there is nothing i can reference it to),I become aggitated and I know something is wrong. The biggest side effect I notice is my reduced sexual drive. It really puts to &quot;death&quot; my libido. I don't have the sexual desires as I use to have before the medication, but again this drug has given me my life back where I can function and contribute to society.

I have used this at a very low dose (75mg) along with Celexa and it effectively manages severe depression and anxiety.Two downsides with this med: 1. If you miss taking it, you will get sick.  Even at 75mg.  2. Regular Venlafaxine hurts my stomach.  I have to take the extended release capsules or risk an ulcer.

Since I didn't want to start hormone therapy, I suggested it to my doctor and we tried it. It leveled off my mood swings that came with the hot flashes.  I started exercising regularly and trying to watch what I eat.  This combination was successful for me.  I am at 75 mg. and I feel more balanced in my life.  At 50, I have met a man after being single for 10 years and have fallen in love again!  Life is good, and the Effexor has just leveled things for me so that I feel more myself!

Doctor said stick it out they will go away. But I couldn't. Then read a study that Lexapro is equally effective with milder side effects and that it works faster.  Another study said it's discontinuation syndrome was considerable less.  It wasn't without side effects, but I can tollerate it and getting of it is pretty easy.
Depression	 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	1			6/15/2010 12:49:38 PM	WARNING!!! What ever you do Do not take Effexor without reading the effects you will have when you want to come off it...#1 The effects you will live with when coming off this drug are not worth it....I weaned off the best way possible going from 150mg to 107 to 75 and finally to 37.5 over a couple months and still had to live with the worst side effects / withdraw symptoms you could imagine for months!!  You dont get warnings on this before taking this drug.  Look/google it up and read the horror stories before you decide to take this drug... You will be sooooo sick no matter what when you try to get off this drug.....tons of people can not get off because of how bad the withdrawl is.  You just can not function...You are to ill to move, you get so dizzy you vomit, you get weird brain zapping feelings, you cant concentrate, I was afraid to drive it was so bad and so on... #2 Now being off this drug and the side effects slowing  I feel so alive, motivated, happy,I can finally poop like normal and sex !! Being on Effexor you might as well forget sex... I forgot how fun it was (lol). I had no idea what this drug did to me, looking back just a month later and how I feel now,,,,Was I a walking zombie?...I dont know but Im so happy to be off it....I would not recommend Effexor to anyone!!! Personally I will stick to prozac...... Good luck to all....

Other than incredibly vivid dreams I wake up to having a hard time determining whether they were real or not, this has been incredibly successful. No more overwhelming anxiety and mood swings. When I do get sad, however, I get really sad. This happens rarely.

I have taken it for 5 days and i noticed an immediate help unlike celexa. Depression runs in my family and most of my cousins and my sister are on effexor.

I took it for about 2 years, 75 MG and it was a lifesaver. It's a great companion to Wellbutrin, and helped both my anxiety and depression. I felt level headed and human again. I took it to get over a rough patch in my life then was slowly weaned off. My anxiety returned within 3 months to monstrous proportions. The only side effect I experienced was a slight feeling of being &quot;doped up&quot;, but when I found the dose that was right for me, that mostly subsided. I can't recommend Effexor enough! For my current anxiety the same doctor is prescribing Lexapro instead to see if it makes me less &quot;doped up&quot;. But, if Lexapro isn't for me, I will have no hesitation in taking Effexor again.
Depression	julijuli, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/20/2010 2:58:11 PM	Severe depression, anxiety, sadness.  Tried many different medications over the years.  My psychiatrist decided to put me on Effexor.  Felt immediate relief.  More cheerful, more energy and weight loss.  No more side effects than any other meds.  If you listen to all the cons you are setting yourself up for failure.  It's scarey reading some of these reviews.  I wouldn't have started it if not for a psychiatrist I trust and who monitors me closely.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety		5	5	5			5/18/2010 2:12:39 PM	I have been taking Effexor for quite a few years and I am happy with it.  I have been told Effexor tablets, not the generic or theXR, just the regular tablets have been discontinued.  Could anyone please help me verify if this is true???  Thank you!
Extreme Apprehension or Fear of Social Interaction	shakydeb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	5/10/2010 11:52:59 PM	I gained about 25 pounds while taking this medication, and that was on top of the 20 pound weight gain from using Paxil before being switched to effexor. It helped with the social anxiety and depression,but it took me a good 1.5 to 2 years to wean  myself off of this med.  For most people it can't be in a few weeks like most doctors think. The withdrawal symptoms are terrible. 
&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs	mothernature50, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/10/2010 1:30:47 PM	I have taken efferor xr for about 6 years.  Intitially it was for my hotflashes, it worked wonderfully.  After my change ended, about 4 yrs ago,  lost my lodest son unexpectedly so the Doctor decided to keep me on it a while longer.  Two years ago I was diagnoised with fibromyalgia, so I still take it today. I have forgotten to take a dose and it makes me realize just how much this really has helped me navigate through these lasr few years.  Without effexor xr, I am so emotional drained its like my abosute worst day of my fibro.  I hope my Dr. lives forever, because trying to have a new Dr. understand this is just too overwhelming to even think about.   
Depression	kspankey, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	55-64	5/9/2010 2:12:49 PM	I'm concerned because I am having rapid movement on my hands and legs. I don't know if this is because of the meds or something else.
&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs	Rozebud, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	45-54	5/5/2010 11:46:00 AM	I've been on effexor for about a year now for hot flashes.  I still get them, but maybe they'd be worse without.  I do sleep well at night and haven't had any concerning noticeable problems with it.  HOWEVER:  Recently I ran out and didn't pick up the new ones over the weekend (2 days).  BIG MISTAKE!!  Now I know what its like to be a addict and go thru withdrawals!!!  This med is BAD, i had no idea it would be so awful, puking, shaking, sweating, couldn't think of anything but getting more!! It was horrible! Needless to say, I did get my pills and started back on them, and do feel better again. But after experiencing that ordeal, it is apparent that this is an addictive medication and I want off, but after reading others reviews, it doesn't sound easy.  I'm totally disgusted. It has kept me from being edgy and flying off the handle, as I did before I was on hormones, then changed to this med.  But also has affected my libido, basically no desire. I haven't had any problems with weight gain, altho I do seem to sweat alot. All in all, I am not satisfied with this drug and I DO NOT RECOMMEND this med to anyone for hot flashes or other change of life signs.  By any means, DO NOT TAKE IT!!  I'm checking into bio-identicals or anything else, no more of this.  Its going to take awhile to get off it apparently and I'm not looking forward to it either....in fact I'm scared!!  My earlier review was 8/09 if you want to check it out.
Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/4/2010 11:31:21 PM	I have been on effexor xr for little over a year. I tried Wellbutrin and then Lexapro prior to trying Effexor. Effexor has been such a great help. I don't feel like my old self, I'm better than my old self.  I'm calmer and more relaxed and my mood is much better and it stays that way.

This drug for depression has worked for me after trying many others. The secret is when you begin feeling better, which means the medication is working and fall in the trap thinking you can live without it.
Bipolar Depression	etw2004, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	4/14/2010 11:25:38 PM	I have been on effexor for about 20 years. It worked at first but continued with serious problems and dosage would be increased. With each increase new symptoms would appear, paranoia, anger, outrageous behavior. Later I was diagnosed bipolar and added a mood stabilizer and had much more control. Problem is, the new symptoms are still present, just more controlled. And I cannot get off of it. I have tried several times. One time weaning slowly off for a period of 6 months. The withdrawl affects were unbearable. I hate it, I wish I had never started on it.

This was my 2nd attempt with Effexor, now I know I did not give it enough time the 1st go around.After 5 weeks I honestly feel more capable, less pessimistic and less bothered by the unusual things that can disrupt your life. My stressors are 10-fold now what they were when I began this drug and I feel more confident of coping and overcoming.  This is not a magic pill by any means you also have to do &quot;self-work&quot; and really invest in making your life different.  However for an anti-depressant the side effects have been minimal (moderate weight gain but now I feel more motivated to exercise and manage my weight as a result).I highly recommend for the right diagnosis.
Depression	RAP, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	4/12/2010 7:03:08 PM	I first experienced depression 40 years ago.After trying many antidepressants I was introduced to effexor. Over the years the dosage increased to 225mg which I've been o for at least 13 years. Recently I've begun to feel the depression creeping back and this in turn has caused me to have anxiety attacks and feelings of depersonalization. I don't know what's left for me now.......RAP
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	4/2/2010 11:44:10 AM	I have taken this for about six months, and am now up to 225mg daily.  I had pretty intense weight gain - about 20-25lbs - and it makes me very tired.  I was originally taking 75 in the AM and 150 in the PM, but the 75 made me so tired that I either had to nap again before going to work, or I'd fall asleep during my drive to work.  Scary!  Now I just take both at night.  I frequently have very vivid dreams, and sometimes I can't remember if I dreamt something or if it really happened.  I had brain zaps when I first started and as I increased the dosage, but those have mostly stopped.  But my moods are definitely better overall and my depression has lessened.  I might look into Cymbalta, as I'm really frustrated about the weight gain.
Bipolar Depression	eh, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	4/1/2010 6:28:17 PM	I was prescribed Effexor XR 150mg 1x/day nearly 10 years ago as an anti-depressant for bipolar.  I have had no side effects and the medication has worked well with my other medications.  I would also strongly recommend that often times have to give psychiatric drugs 8-12 weeks before they reach a therapeutic level to even work, so give them a chance.  Additionally, don't expect everything from your medications; you should also be involved in counseling and group therapy for an adequate time ( I still go regularly to a psychiatrist and to a therapist) to better help you understand whatever disorder you've been diagnosed with and help you cope with the challenges that go along with it.
Other	Effexor, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	3/30/2010 12:54:30 PM	I have been taking Effexor for 5+ years - I have Fibromyalgia.  It seems to help with some of the systems and helps with depression and anxiety due to the Fibro.  On 112mg day.  If you forget to take a dose one day, not pleasant experience - you feel like you have intense flu and very strange feelings.  Don't like the 50 pounds gained, but Effexor has given me more of a normal life - I am thankful for that.  I sometimes think I should start weaning off this drug, however, I then think of where I was to now, so I then stop and think, what the heck, weight gain, being on a anti depressant - humm, it helps me function - I'll stay on the low dose.
Bipolar Depression	hopeithink, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	3/29/2010 10:22:47 AM	been taking for 5 months now, began with 37.5 and am now at 75, the first week was rough i felt detached and shaky but that went away, i was havening severe ups and downs before beginning effexor and now i'm pretty leveled out if a little emotionally numb. my dreams have gotten super intense as well, and i have lost about 10 pounds. all in all so far so good, everyone is right though, whatever you do DO NOT miss a dose or it feels like your brain is being zapped.

Suicidal thoughts. No thank you. Will stay with non ER...slow but efficient.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	3/9/2010 6:02:45 PM	I have tolerated this drug better than others (BuSpar (hallucinations), Paxil (intense lethargy but lovely sleep), Zoloft (ugly rash), &amp; Prozac (intense suicidal thoughts). Xanax - a calmer - is so nice, but unfortunately docs fear its addictiveness and it treats anxiety but not depression (unless the depression is caused by anxiety). The nice thing about Effexor: it covers both of my symptoms - depression and anxiety. I have gained about 50 pounds, however, which has been consistent in the past 14 years since I started it. You definitely will know if you miss a dose as you will have waves moving through your head and feelings of detachment from reality. This scares me as I'm sure it will affect tapering off, which I hear isn't easy to do. It's a powerful drug and can be very effective. But, you have to be strongly committed to sticking with it. It takes weeks to kick in and you can't stop taking it abruptly. Also you must be sure to not miss doses or you will suffer extreme side effects as your brain tries to adjust to life without the chemicals it craves. I had weird intense dreams before starting Effexor but they have become even more extreme on it. Be ready for that. The dreams will intensify your psychological conflicts.
Depression	mom2two, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/9/2010 1:42:31 PM	My sister was on this medication for nine years. She feels like she has lost nine years of her life. She was very delusional,parinoid, seeing and hearing things. Finally she had a breakdown and ended up in the hospital she was screaming throwing things. The DR. that was treating said she was in orbit for two days before the other medication brought her back to reality. THER NEEDS TO BE A WARNING ABOUT THIS MEDICATION. I'm just wondering how many people are suffering needlessly due of the severe side effcts my sister suffered with while taking this medication

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	3	Female	25-34	3/6/2010 8:11:42 PM	I've only been taking 75mg a day for about 3 weeks now so the meds. may not be working fully yet. However you need to know that if you have to take a drug screening for anything this med. will cause you to test positive for PCP. I was not made aware of this until my supervisor (a nurse) explained it to me...Be sure to take your prescription w/ you for any drug screening!

I'm not sure if the benefits outweigh the risks, since these medications tend to raise blood sugar and cholesterol, both of which I am dealing with now. I take it with Lamictal, klonipin, adderall, and mirapex. I don't knowh how they all combine, but I wish there was a safer way to stay stable.

Depression	PBAR, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	45-54	1/26/2010 2:10:25 PM	Found Effexor to be effective on depression.  Nausea went away after a short time.  Sweating still bad and libido very low.  I have to stop though, because my cholesterol has gone from 135 to 295.  If you are using Effexor, monitor this.  It is rare, but can happen.
Depression	chick4troy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/25/2010 12:05:25 PM	Effexor has been helpful!  I do experience night sweats &amp; occasional upset stomach but nothing severe. The dizziness is most prevalent and the reason I looked @ reviews to see if anyone else was experiencing the same.  The 1st few weeks I noticed a decrease in appetite but that went away (unfortunately) :o)  If anything, I don't gain weight but have trouble LOOSING it.  The best thing to report is that I have not experienced any SEXUAL side effects as with other meds! I initially began taking depression meds for anxiety/short fuse/easily frustrated &amp; feelings of being let down. Through the course of taking meds I became depressed instead of anxious. Lexapro wasn't quite enough for me, Zoloft was TOO much &amp; Lorazapam was just a quick fix. Effexor has been good for me but I wonder if it's effectiveness will wear off over time as other meds have. From reading reviews, it seems that this med is NOT for EVERYONE. I would try it ONLY after other common meds have failed you.

I gave it high marks then because it was working great. However, after 2 months I developed constant and severe indigestion, and I always took it with food. I also experienced weight gain and extreme laziness and always wanted to sleep. Weaned myself off in a few days which triggered headaches, but they are decreasing now. The Dr. switched my meds to Cymbalta. I guess I'll have to wait and see if that works any better.

It has made me violently ill. I don't even have an appetite. Other side effects have included: blurry vision, tremors, hot fashes, night sweats, and serious fatigue (which probably is due to not being able to eat). This was certainly not the medicine for me...

My Doctor started me out with 35MG and I worked my way up wasn't till I got the genaric form did I truly love these after I got my dose down on my own as I could have went off them at that time. I take 75MG a day. And by breaking the pill down I could go off them now if I chose to.I did not like the high dose as It made me sleepy all the time and not care about nothing and I do not like not caring. Even at low dose I know when it is time for Medicine. I too get headace's, and a strange sinsation in my head but when I think of how I was with panic it is O.K.

I'm really bad at remembering to take my meds and if I miss a dose by even a couple hours I feel terrible withdrawal symptoms. One time I couldn't get the scrip filled for a few days and had to be hospitalized. I'm still severely depressed too. I can't stand being on this medication anymore and it's going to take a while to wean myself off of it.

Extremely dangerous to stop taking suddenly - it took 6 weeks to wean off it under a dr.'s supervision.  Must decrease dose VERY slowly.  Dr. said if someone stopped cold turkey, hopsitilization was likely.  Didn't feel it was effective and in fact I suspected it was making me feel worse.
Bipolar Depression	dixieanny, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/19/2009 5:34:04 AM	Upon awakening, if I did get any sleep, I had a deep crying feeling inside from my stomach to my chest. The feeling of loosing a close family member abruptly. Therefore, I could not get myself motivated to get out of bed or get dressed for the day, or general taking care of my needs/hygiene. After 6 days on effexor xr I no longer have that emotional pain inside and I get dressed half the time. I feel better, I am getting a bit more deep sleep. It is doing well for me, as I am paradoxical to so many medications. I hope it continues. I take 75 mg per day.

Since he has been on it in the last two years I don't see where it has helped him at all. He's tried to come off of it once and he kept complaining that &quot;his head felt funny&quot; he eventually had to go back on it because of the withdrawal symptoms. His mood swings are terrible, angry outbursts and well I don't see where it helped him any besides becoming an addict to it. The sex drive is gone, erections that last for maybe 5 minutes and him complaining that he has no &quot;feeling&quot; anymore&quot; in that department, headaches constantly. I wouldn'tsuggest anyone to start this medication. It has been the biggest problem in our marriage for going on two years. I just want the person back I married because thisis not him.

I take 75 mg daily and it has changed my life for the better.  As with any antidepressent, when stopping usage or starting a new medication it must be taken in steps, your doctor shoul provide the best understanding of symptoms and withdrawl.  I have had no weight gain, or sexual problems and am more relaxed and easier to get along with.

Bipolar Depression	erinryan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	3	Female	25-34	11/24/2009 6:35:59 PM	I just started this medication 3 days ago and the side effectsare troubling me. First of all I think that the pharmacist gave me incorrect directions. Do they usually start someone off with: 50mg twice a day, 37.5 twice a day, and also 75 mg twice a day? That seems like a lot to me to start out with. I caaled my doc to ask about this but have not recieved a call back. I did it per these directions for 2 days and couldn't stand the vomiting after eating anything, the muscle tension that I could not control, and the clenching of my jaw. it also made me very dizzy and I had to lay down. Are these symtoms normal or am I having adverse reaction? I have been online looking up side effects but have not found an answer to how this drug is started and if I am taking too much . I took myself down to only the 50 mg twice a day until I hear from my doctor.

Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/18/2009 3:43:57 PM	I took Prozac for 4 or 5 years but then it stopped working.  My doctor called it &quot;Prozac poop out&quot; and said it happens sometimes.  I've been on Effexor for a couple of years.  I don't notice any side effects.  I am grateful to feel &quot;normal.&quot;  I can laugh at things that go wrong. On the other hand, I also still cry over sad or sentimental movies.  Before I started antidepressants I was worried I'd feel numb or zombie-like, but that is not the case at all. 
Other	 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female		11/16/2009 12:54:38 PM	I have been taking this medication for almost a year now and am quite happy withthe results.  One side effect that does bother me though is the sweating.  It is horrible at night, but I will live with it due to the results on my emotional state and mood.

I have have been on primarin since 83.  I have had problems for years, finally we found the ovary &amp; crevix grew back, we think it was the hormones.  So to fight the hot flashes I was put on Effexor.  Now I have very high blood pressure and many other side effects.  Now I have slowly ease off the effexor.  Hot flashes would be better then this.

Bipolar Depression	13-18 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	10/27/2009 2:21:21 AM	I took this medication for a long time. It had a reverse effect on me, as well as many others. It got so bad that i attempted suicide on this drug. I took a minimal amount but my liver and kidneys are about to fail. My doctor said if i would have taken effexor normally, my organs would fail in six more months. This is a horrible drug. Im sixteen and this drug has completely deteriorated my life as well as my esophagus. I recommend you do not take effexor.
Depression	sondra, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	10/26/2009 10:39:51 PM	There are a few problems I had with this medication: first, after only a month, my menstrual cycle lasted exactly 7 days instead of the normal 4 days.  Also, this medication has had a very very dizzying effect on me.  When I wake up or lie down, I feel like the room is spinning or my eyeballs are spinning around in my head.  One thing I did like is my appetite decreasing, but that is not worth the dizzy effect.  I have taken myself off of this pill.

I have tried tapering off but like someone else said it's like ping pong balls bouncing in your head when you don't take it! I was down to once a week, no ping pong balls bouncing, then had some bad family problmes arise, and all the sudden the ping pong balls came back! What can I do?? Any suggesstions?

I don't even know if it is helping anymore. My FM is so bad!! I am rec. my meds from the maker, free, in the mail and have run out and I think I'm going crazy!! I am nauseaus, my head is killing me, and I feel like like electricity is running through my whole body! I desperately want to stop taking this but I don't know if I am going to be able to stand the withdrawal symptoms.

Also, I have been trying to get off of effexor for some time and it is almost impossible! I have tried tapering off. I am down to one 37.5 about once a week but on or close to that 5th day it is almost unbearable!!
Depression	Kate, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	35-44	10/7/2009 10:36:23 PM	I have been taking this for a couple of years which helped my depression.  My weight gain has been beyond disheartening.  My doctor said she purposefully put me on this because of the side-effects (nausea, headaches, diarrhea, etc.) so I would not try to quit or wean myself off due to this commonly happening when people start to feel better or think they no longer need it.  She'll help wean me when WE feel the med is no longer needed.  Counseling/therapy is also important since depression is due to life issues, both conscious and unconscious,that have gone unresolved.  Thank God for meds and my psychiatrist!  (Just wish the weight would come off with exercise.)  Anyone else experience weight gain???

I am diabetic and have hbp.  If I miss my pills one day you are assured of feeling &quot;ping pong balls&quot; bouncing around in your head, dizzyness, nausea and all the rest as  stated by others.  But if I don't take  the pills it's standing in the shower crying, tv all day, napping.  I don't remember being this bad before I started Effexor.  I am going to discuss changing meds again on my next drs. appt.

I also felt nauseated most of the time after taking it. These symptoms did not subside. It decreases your libido, who needs this with other emotional problems. But listen, the only anwser to my emptiness and constant fear was the Lord Jesus Christ.  I still have to work at my own mind, but He gives you true peace deep down. He will give you a peace and hope like no other.  Living Water!

At the beginning, it worked but has been ineffective for most of the time.

I tried the non-XR form for about 6 months but could not last a full 24 hours between pills before the withdrawal symptoms started. I have an inner ear disease, called Meniere's Disease that the Effexor withdrawals severely aggravate. I found a PETITION against this drug, if anyone is interested. www.petitiononline.com/effexor/I am just about to begin going through actual withdrawals because I can no longer afford the medication and my insurance went with my former employer. I truly hope that I will not end up getting as bad as some of the reviews I have read here; I am not a violent person normally, so I will hopefully be able to keep things under control. 
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	8/22/2009 11:10:23 AM	My recommendation is to not take this medication.  It was effective, but no more so than Prozac.  I get sick every time I take it.  I haven't taken it in a few days because of that and wondered why I was feeling so awful.  When I started reading other reviews I've realized I'm in withdrawal and it's AWFUL!  I'm sweating, dizzy, feeling &quot;drunk&quot;, having headaches, feeling sick, quickly beating heart, eyes feel almost swollen and I feel in a weird fog.  There are so many medications for depression to choose from, for me this is the worst!

It helped somewhat but I would still go through bouts of depression.  Once I retired from the military, my new family doctor started prescribing 75mg of Effexor to me.  I have been taking Effexor now for nine years and am quite happy with it.  I rarely suffer from depression now and am much happier with life.  The only side effects I have are if I run out of my prescription and have to wait for more.  I start feeling &quot;waves&quot; of nausea and also feel unbalanced.  I cannot function well in normal activities such as driving and cannot concentrate well on work.  Needless to say, there is a degree of dependency on Effexor.  For those that are uncomfortable with feeling dependent on a drug than Effexor is not for you.  For me, getting rid of the feelings of hopelessness and self-pity have made Effexor the antidepressant drug of choice.

Dr put me on this to replace the hormone replacement therapy I'd been on for 4 yrs, to control hot flashes mainly. It doesn't control as well as the hormones did, but is better than totally without before HRT.  I had tried natural treatments before HRT, they quit working. She now wants me to increase my dose from 75mg to 150mg to see if that will do a better job.I haven't noticed any other effects from the drug really.  I have lost 14 lbs since going off the HRT tho!  I don't have depression altho before starting HRT, I did find I would fly off the handle easily and had other menopause symptoms. The HRT controlled that aspect, and haven't had that &quot;urge to blow&quot; on this either.It is quite expensive tho, so wish there was another option?? I am concerned about discontinuing use some day tho, from others experiences!  I don't know how long she will want me to remain on it, at this point.  I'm hoping someday sooner than late, all these hormone symptoms will pass.....

It did (along with a number of heart &amp; cholestorel meds) I'm taking, absolutely destroyed my sex-life!!The biggest drawback I've found, is, DON'T ever let your prescription &quot;lapse&quot; for any reason. (In my case it was the druggist's inability to stock enough product) On my 2nd day without Effexor, I had become a blubbering mass of tears. Luckily, I work nights, and my wife was kind enough, to retrieve the prescrip' from the druggist and deliver it to me, at home. Otherwise, I simply would NOT have been able to operate at even the smallest things!!

Depression	triedptn, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	8/7/2009 11:56:11 PM	I took this after falling &amp; fracturing both ankles.I was hospitalized for 6 ds. Hosp. bed @ home for 6wks. My dose was increased to 300mgs.a day.  I have been reducing down for almost 2wks. I have felt awful. This would be good to give terrorists to punish them &amp; brake them down. Get them addicted to this &amp; then take them off of it rapidly.  I have never experienced anything so awful in my entire life.  I have been through a lot of terrible things in my 67yrs. including watching my husband die in 6months w/esopheageal CA. This terrible feeling in my head doesn't seem to ever go away.  I have gained so much weight that I can't stand long enough to cook &amp; clean. I haven't been out of the house for almost 2wks. My personal hygiene has never been this bad in my life. As another person said, this should never have been on the market.  I noticed the effect of glaucoma &amp; I have glaucoma. My how awful. Don't trust anyone else to know what is best for you. Read, read &amp; read some more.  This is your life that is being treated.  Make sure yourself that any medicine is safe for you. I have had nausea, diarrhea, itching 3ds, excessive sweating &amp; burning feeling, hands &amp; feet turn red &amp; burn, awful feeling in head, chills, thirst, shakes.  I wish I had never taken this drug.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/6/2009 12:39:03 AM	This medication is the most wonderful thing to happen to me.  I was suffering from severe depression and nothing else would work for me.  My doctor started me on this and within the DAY that I took it, I started to feel better.  Of course, like with all medications, if you take yourself off of it without the weaning method, the effects can be severe.  I notice if I miss a dose I tend to get more irritable and angry.  Also I notice an increased sensitivity to light of any kind be it the TV, computer or a lamp.  But this medication most certainly works for me.Don't let the withdrawl effects stop you from talking to your doctor about this miracle medication.  It can really help.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	8/2/2009 12:06:53 PM	This drug destroyed my life.  Was put on it for some situational insomnia and not ever told by doc anything about it.  Have been off of it for 19 months now and have to take natural supplements or the discontinuation syndrome comes back full force.  Never had clinical depression in my life.  Now I believe I will never be the same.  Do Not Take if you value your life!
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	kelly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	7/29/2009 9:35:00 PM	Effexor was great while I was taking it. It totally made me feel &quot;balanced&quot; and calm. I had little to no anxiety. On-the-other-hand, I would definitely NOT recommend this to anyone who is in need of an anti-anxiety medication for the simple fact that I have TRIED to go off of it 3 times but have experienced terrible side effects. Even after slowly weening off of the drug, I experienced depression, severe dizziness and other side effects that are difficult to explain. I wish my doctor would have told me about the side effects of going off the drug before I started taking it. I NEVER would have started taking it, I would have opted for something else.

I have been on it 5 years and tried 3 times to get &quot;off&quot; it. It is highly addictive. I have finally been off it now for two weeks and am still suffering from side effects. I wish I had never even heard of the stuff and I know there has got to be other medications out there.

I had some minor panic attacks for the past year and depression.  Only in the past month or so after starting Effexor have I realized how very depressed I must have been.  I seem to be much happier and able to handle stress more easily.  I also am more aware of even the little things that I must have ignored for so long. This has been a very helpful drug for me.

The sweats are very bad, and i have heard the withdrawal is described as coming off heroin.  Dr's should read about the side effects before prescribing. If I would have been able to make an informed consent I would have declined this drug. When I mentioned the severe sweating to my Dr he said well it's either sweat or be pain free. I take a lot of pain medication, lately I have experienced head aches in the sinus area like a barometer. I never miss a dose, but after reading the other reviews, I am convinced it is a side effect of the drug.    
Depression	momoftwo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/30/2009 8:47:46 PM	My sister was murdered and I sank into a deep depression, stopped eating, cried all the time, personal hygiene went out the door, sleeping less then 2 hours a day, unable to take care of myself let alone my husband and children.  I had no history of depression up until this point.  When I finally went to see my doctor, after 8 months of this, he gave me this drug.  In less then 2 hours I had stopped crying, I was finally able to go to bed a normal time, and I cooked breakfast for my children the next day.  I can't tell you the relief I felt from just getting that far.  I've only taken it for 2 days, but regardless of the nausea and other strange side effects.  I 'm just relieved that I finally stopped crying.

The first time ended up with me back in the hospital due to siezures. The second time I was given the med I was taken off all the other meds I was on the first time to see what reation I would have. I could not fall asleep at all. I had to end up being on tranquilizers to help me sleep and that combination caused a second seratonin issue but not as bad as the previous time. On the upside I was very active while on it and didn't have any mood swings or any real signifigant issues with my depression. 
Depression	WNV, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/18/2009 12:49:56 PM	Had life altering mobility changes due to a virus. Lengthy rehabilitaion (6 mos. inpatient care at 2 hospitals and a nursing home)then continued outpatient PT &amp; OT. Returning to my job after 1 year off of work in a power w/c. Continual disabling physical challanges X 7 yrs. Tried Paxil and Celexa for about 2 months with very little success for my profound depression.  The suggestion to try Effexor came from a nurse aide taking care of me in the nursing home because she was taking it herself. I asked MD to try it on me and it has been a Godsend.  I returned to work as a nurse in a wheelchair...then progressed to a 4 wheeled walker. I am no longer in the patient care aspect of nursing but I work full time even with multiple physical challanges and am able to maintain good emotional health as I am continuing to take Effexor. I regularly get MD check ups and have been able to reduce the dosage over time but continue using under dr's orders and supervision and life is Great! (7 yrs post disabling virus infection.)
Depression	Jean, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/16/2009 10:54:05 AM	I have been on this almost a month and could tell within the first week that it helped me greatly.  Getting ready to get it refilled again and discovered that I was supposed to be taking 2 a day after the first week.  I really wonder if I should take the 2 when I am feeling great with only taking 1 a day?  I even sleep better at night.  I still haven't picked up the things that I lost interest in, but I am not sad or angry or cry at the drop of a pin.  Compared to the Lexapro I was taking before, this works great.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	EvanD214, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	6/13/2009 7:14:48 PM	 I've been taking Effexor for about 8 months. It worked well for the first little while, then stopped, so my doctor increased the dosage and I've been fine since. My problem now is that I want to go off it. A few times I've tried to go off it all at once. After just 2 days I felt horrible. I felt like little shocks were going through my mouth and into my head. I also cried about everything. Each time my husband convinced me to go back on it.  Now I desperately want to go off it again right now. I don't know why. I don't want to go off gradually with a doctor; I just want to be off it now.

Depression	Kim , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/8/2009 9:38:20 AM	I take 3 caps of 75mg every day and have for a few years now. I like Effexor, haven't had any side effects. If I miss a day for some reason, I have serious side effects such as severe headache, loss of appetite, nervousness and a feeling of electrical shocks going through my body. Sounds weird I know. My psych told me that the electrical shocks are the main complaints with Effexor. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	25-34	6/5/2009 2:31:33 PM	I've been taking this medication for about one month now and somethings this medication is good at and others not. Recently, I've been having severe anxiety attacks and my doctor decided to use this in order to help with the anxiety. The first couple of weeks were torture but after that the side effects did subside. Now I've been having terrible and weird nightmares. It didn't really help with the anxiety but however it does work with my IBS and my compulsions. For myself, it really was kind of a hit and miss; it treats one thing but not the other. 
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/3/2009 5:04:08 PM	I've been a antidepressants for 10 years.  I recently switched to Effexor (low dose)and it has been awesome.  I suffered from severe pain due to GERD issues and it would get worse as my anxiety level went higher.  Now with that under control I am feeling so much better.  I did lose 5 lbs and worry about gaining weight, but I need to be responsible for what goes in my mouth and not blame the meds. :-)
Depression	Yoa-za, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	5/11/2009 4:23:00 PM	I started taking this med for a mild depression. I have been a long term pain person, taking ten meds a day, and getting damn tired of doing it. The chore itself was dragging me down, heading to the med chest over and over and over. Combined with low testosterone and having to slather myself with gel daily to get that up, also became part of this nuiscence. So, I asked for something and this was it. Now, I am la di da over most things, while my wife weighs the pros and cons of various things, I simply just go about it all with out too much of a care. I am taking 37.5 2x a day. Is this worth the garbage you must endur to get off of it? I guess I will let you know, as I already have an issue with dizzyness and a whooshing as I turn my head quickly, like to see if a car is coming as I enter the highway. That is being teated by a CT scan of my head and a neurologist and Prednosone. Ho, will he be surprised this could be the culprit! So I will go with half the drug for two weeks, then off we go. I will try to deal with these, albeit minor problems, compared to some of you with major situations. I have always relied on the kindness of.... no just kidding I have always relied on myself for keeping ME on an even keil, its back to taking responsiblilty for me. Ciao!

The paic attacks started at a very young age and over the years, I developed many phobias as a result.  I was given many drugs over the years, but never took them.  My life became &quot;smaller&quot; and &quot;smaller&quot;, and in desperation, after many years of therapy that never really helped, I agreed to take Effexor.  For two weeks, I had every reaction listed.  But at the end of the two weeks, my life began.  All of the fear and anxiety was gone!  All the things I couldn't do for years, or would do with incredible fear, was not a problem.  I consider it a miracle!  Yes, I don't like to think I will have to take it always, but I know that my disorder is genetic and won't go away because it is a chemical imbalance. Many of my family members and children have the same issues.  I know I was lucky, and on the first try, got the right medication for me. Life is good.
Extreme Apprehension or Fear of Social Interaction	Theresa,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female		4/29/2009 11:18:03 PM	It has been very effective with my social anxiety.  After the initial week of side effects, I had 6 months where it worked.  The last three months I've become mentally slower, physically weaker, I feel shakey and my hand is starting to shake.  My sister who started taking it about the same time I did also complained of feeling off when she needed to take a test for a job and only got 1/2 of the questions done.  That's when I recognized that it may be the medication that we both take. 
Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	45-54	4/10/2009 11:20:13 PM	Effexor or its generic is a &quot;good and bad&quot; story for me: good, in that it did a great job at managing my A.D.D. (and the depression that can come from it); bad, because I gained 75 POUNDS while on it! My family doctor thought I had something wrong metabolically. She ran all kinds of tests on liver function, blood sugars, etc. Nothing. No matter how much I exercised or dieted, the weight kept piling on. The clincher was when my wife and I did the South Beach diet. She lost about 15 pounds; I gained about 10 (and no cheating at all). While researching Effexor on the internet, I kept seeing comments about weight gain over and over again. When I asked my psychiatrist about it, he seemed not to know! So we moved me off of Effexor and on to Wellbutrin and a small dose of Prozac. BINGO! I've already lost about 30 pounds in the six months since then, without any change in diet or exercise. In fact, with my crazy schedule (I'm a pastor), I've exercised LESS in the past six months than I usually do. No doubt - it was the Effexor. I have one warning for anyone reading this who wants to get off: the withdrawal period is going to be really WEIRD! I had some strange effects during the about three weeks it took for the Effexor to filter out of my body. Things like your head feeling like it's whooshing around in a breeze, sudden surges of &quot;voltage&quot; through your body (no pain), occasional minor twitches of muscles for short periods of time. None of it was enough to impair me - it just wasn't very pleasant. If you've gained a bunch of weight while taking Effexor, I'd venture to say: it's the drug. Your psychiatrist can prescribe some combination of other things that will work well for you. My combo of Wellbutrin and Prozac is doing the job admirably for me. Hang  in there!

This made it difficult for me to remember to take the medication.  I am not satisfied with the amount of pain relief and the effectiveness as an antidepressant.  I am experiencing several episodes of suicidal thoughts and PTSD flashbacks. I have noticed my mood swings and depression to be increasing. I have Fibromyalgia which also does not seem to be helped with this drug.

I was told you don't get addicted to it, but it seems like you do. It works really good for my anxiety &amp; depression. I can't take many other anti-depressants due to the fact they don't work.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	3/23/2009 11:28:29 AM	My experience with Effexor changed after the first six months.  I take 75 mg daily.  The first six months were great.  I had some side effects at first, but after a week, they went away almost completely.  It really helped with my anxiety and I was very satisfied.  After about 6 months on Effexor, things started to change and I started feeling pretty bad.  Now I feel a little dizzy and &quot;drunk&quot; all of the time.  I also have a minor headache all the time, which occasionally escalates into a debilitating migraine.  I've also noticed I'm more compulsive than I used to be.  For example, I feel a compulsion to do the same things after work every day.  Or, if I start a task (cleaning or gardening for example), I can't stop until I have finished every single possible related job.Has anyone else noticed this?  My first instinct is to stop taking it.  Has anyone else had a similar experience?  I don't really know what to do now.  I don't want to feel anxious any more, but I also don't want to feel the way I feel right now.  Any comments would be appreciated!

Have gained 15 pounds in 7 months, had joint pain and constipation and decided to stop taking it.  My doctor suggested 1 pill every other day for a week and then stop taking it.  Experienced headaches, dizziness to the point of making me nauseous.  I think the effectiveness of this drug was outweighed by the awful withdrawl.

Depression	kanga, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	2/21/2009 7:01:02 PM	Initially, I thought it was working, but I think it was just summertime.  I even increased the dosage.  After a short time, I really didn't see any difference in my energy level or mood, actually I got more tired than usual this winter.  Am trying to stop taking it right now.  I am getting dizzy, nauseated, that 'drunk feeling' others have mentioned.  My doctor told me there were few side effects, and rarely do people have withdrawal problems. I thought I was an exception, until I read these reviews.  This isn't fun to stop using.  I wouldn't recommend this to someone looking for more energy, which is why I went to my doctor in the first place.  My mood isn't any better, either.  I'm gaining weight because I have no energy, which continues to make me sad.  I feel like I have wasted a year hoping this would work.

Anxiety and worry left me unable to sleep, and I was crying much of the time. It worked well for me, within just a few days, at the 75 dosage. After a few months the anxiety came back even worse than before so my doctor raised the dosage to 150. I've been on that now for 2 months. The only side effects I've suffered are dry mouth and difficulty reaching orgasm. It has been worth it though because my quality of life has improved. I'm worried about having to go off it at some point.

Has relieved symptoms of anxiety including inability to concentrate, palpitations, insomnia, obsessive worries/ mental loops.  Previously I was able to alternate between 37.5mg and 75mg dose depending on the stage of my menstrual cycle - low dose starting on day 1, switching to higher around day 8 - but now I suffer withdrawal symptoms (nausea, exhaustion) if I reduce, so I need to stay on the 75 mg dose.

Made terrible decisions from depression.  I took Zoloft for 4 years after loosing family to cancer and tried to get off Zoloft because of low sexual drive and weight gain.  Could not do it.  I sank instantly.  Dr. suggested Effexor 37.5 mg.  I feel great.  I experienced what I will call flu like symtoms for a day or two, then got over it.  I am happy, look forward to each day.  Do not need my sleepy pill to sleep.  But hat to have 8 to 10 hours of real time to sleep.  I have made this possible and enjoy my every day life.  I don't even feel depressed after watching CNN and the result of our economy.... I have a sence of changing the things that I can and leaving the rest to GOD.  I will take the rest of my life.

I am seeing a psychiatrist to deal with everything, but the medication helps me get through the days. I am a little worried about the withdrawal everyone talks about when you stop using it...but i'll jump that hurdle when it comes.

This is the second time I have been prescribed effexor and am due to come off the drug very soon. I am terrified of the withdrawal effects this drug has. Having come off effexor before, I know exactly what I am in for, withdrawal fom this is horrendous. Even reducing the dose very slowly over a matter of months is horrible, the slightest change in dosage effects you. Dizzieness, nausea, shooting pains, confusion, those are just to name a few. Effexor, did and has worked for my depression on two occassions, but never ever again will I take this drug, to be honest, i'd rather poke sticks in mye eyes than go through the debilitating withdrawal this drug give you. It should seriously be banned.

I specifically inquired about suicidal side effects &amp; was told it didn't apply to older people. I was so suicidal during the 1st 3 days, it was the most awful feeling I have ever experienced in my entire life, there was no joy, no feeling, just the most terrific dispare so unimagenable one could not believe &amp; had I not known that these feelings were caused by the drug I probably would have committed suicide because it took all I had to fight the urge to do so. I DO NOT recommend anyone taking this drug for any reason ever. There are probably better drugs available -don't chance losing a loved one due to the use of this drug, it's not worth the benefits which are small anyway!

It literally,left me unable to function for an intire summer. I was put through so many test, blood, and cat scans, I was ready to die. It is a pain thats impossible to live with. I was seeing many Doctors, It was my Psychiatrist, that diagnoised and treated me, the only one with success.I have been on zoloft,cymbalta,wellbutrin,seroquel,ativan, and many more that I cannot recall right now, this has been in the previous, 14 yrs.

Depression	keys2john, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male	55-64	1/2/2009 12:44:24 AM	It has worked well for me. My doctor has allowed me to titrate down for the past 6 weeks, because I think I am well enough and now. Also I was having sexual disfuntionam and lack of libido side effects, which at the time I thought was good, but now I would like to have an erection if nothing else but for occasional self sexual satisfaction. But this has brought on insomnia which is driving me crazy.  This to shall pass. (I hope)
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	chevychic, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/29/2008 3:30:37 PM	After many drug trys ( cymbalta,wellb, zoloft) this is the one that is working ( besides remeron- which made  me gain 20lbs)I felt better the next day!! Have had no side affects!! I do take Restoril for sleep and hope thatI may beable to stop that and only take Effexor! I has my doubts with stopping this med, it seems to have major withdrawal- but its working great for now. So I guess why stop a good thing. Im happy and not anxious! Oh and not as angry as I used to be.

It leveled me out and, in addition, helped any depressive symptoms i used to have.  i think this med works phenominally for mood disorders
Other	noname, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	1	2	Female	35-44	12/26/2008 3:10:01 PM	I have been on the medication for over a year. It has not improved my situation. I am on it for fibromyalgia pain. I am the lowest dose available. When I have missed a dosage it will make me so sick. There does not seem like a way of going off of it. I have gone as long as three days. No way of functioning. Not a drug you want to be on short term.
Depression	icartm, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/22/2008 6:24:37 PM	For SOME people, this medication can work when others don't.  I was on it one time and weaned myself off.  When I saw another therapist, I was put back on it.  I'm at 300 mg/day, which is pretty high.  I'm often tired but that could be caused by lots of things.  One word of warning:  be ready to take this forever or be ready to have major side effects while being weaned off of it.  The side effects are challenging and sometimes cause people to have to stay on it permanently.

Was prescribed for General Anxiety Diorder and had terrible side effects. Migrane for days, extreme nausea, dizziness, head spins, shakiness...felt like I drank 6 pots of coffee! I am a mother of a beautiful 22mo old son and this medication was so debilitating! Felt like a 'junkie' coming off of some type of drug. Would NOT recommend this to anyone and it is such a shame that the FDA has approved this. I truly felt like someone was taking an ice pick to my brain for 3 days. This started only on the second week when I started taking 37.5mgs 2x daily in the second week. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!

It took over 2 months to come off of it because of all the side effects- vomiting, chills, sleeplessness, headaches...the list goes on and on. Do NOT recommend to anyone who doesn't plan on being on it the rest of their life.

I take 225mg of Effexor and 15mg of Diazepam per day. It's the forth drug combination I have tried and probably the best so far..but things still aren't right. Hard to judge if Effexor is really effective or not, without my re-diagnosis to go by. If it works for you, then great! If not, try another drug or drugs. I'm just not sure yet about my situation..it is a long process!

We finally got it  right. I experieced lightheadedness and nausea at first, then as we increased dosage I almost felt euphoric...and I didn't like that! It did, however, go away. Four years later, I tried (with doctor help) to wean off the medication. It threw me for a loop! I couldn't hack it! Severe mood swings, crying episodes, fatigue...so-am I chronically (as in forever) depressed and doomed to stay on this med...I don't know...but it really changed my life.

Please be careful when taking the medication, it has taken me several months and another antidepressant to get off of it.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	35-44	10/8/2008 4:41:51 PM	First and foremost, I have no history of drug reactions, allergies, etc.  I am just an average, healthy chick w/ anxiety!This is a complicated medication.  When I was switched to it, I was given short-term disability for reasons I didn't know at the time, but went with it.Now that I look back, this med is just as hard to go on as it is to go off!  Going on, I had episodes of serious nausea to the point where I had to pull of the side of the road because I thought I had to vomit.  When that is said and done, the medication DOES work.  I experienced no anxiety attacks at all.  That was pretty cool, but let me tell you, you surely don't need to watch a clock so you don't miss a dose.  For me, when the clock got close to meds time, the withdrawl symptoms of this med started rearing their ugly head.  I mean, even within an hour or so of the time it is normally taken...an internal alarm clock, of sorts.What you read about withdrawl symptoms is COMPLETELY accurate.  I've always described them as &quot;the throbs&quot;, but brain zaps works juts as well.  They get worse REALLY QUICKLY and it is the most debilitating feeling.  Keep missing them and you can be keeping your head still and just move your eyes and those ZAPS move whenever your eyes hurt. You are kind of &quot;zombied&quot;.  It is HORRIBLE.  It's been 6 years since starting this stuff and the ONLY reason why I am still on it is because it is easier than going off...seriously. I cannot EVEN believe there hasn't been any sort of law-suit with how horrific the side-effects are!!! Today, my meds are late coming in the mail and I am nearly 48 hours down and in a state of complete bewilderment, so to speak.  I am crying because of the w/drawls...it is TRULY that bad and I had to get a script called into the pharmacy so I don't lose my head.  There ought to be a law against stuff like this...SERIOUSLY.  Bottom line, had I known 6 years ago what I know now, NO WAY! Search Google, TONS of stories!. retrowfmk at yahoo dot com

However, as my condition stabilized for a long period of time, Effexor caused me to feel all too sleepy.  It also caused me to feel unable to &quot;get it together&quot;.  I take a very minimul dosage, 35mg every other day.  Good luck.  Bipolar is a living hell.

It help me immensly in the beginning to slow down my head and let me concentrate on getting better.  After about 6 months when I was more stable (not suicidal) and feeling level, I decided to start weaning off.  The reason I chose to decrease my dose was because along with making me calmer and more level, I found it also took away my personal creativity and the ability to think fluidly.  I found myself having a hard time articulating and it drove me crazy.  Physically the only negative side effect I had was a strange feeling when I turned my head to fast, like what I had just looked at and turned away from was trailing me in my side vision.  I am off effexor now and am doing well. Being on it helped me slow down and get the help I needed (talk therapy), though I am happy to be off it, as I feel more like me how I am supposed to be with no pharmecutical help.

I call it my happy pill. I am a very sensitive person and emotional to, but this pill helps me stay a float. I use to fall into depression where I couldn't eat only work go home and sleep, sometimes having to take off from work because my emotions were to high. I haven't gone through a spell like that in years and instead of losing weight now I have gained and have to start exercising to manage my weight. I tell all that effexor works.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety		1	5	1			5/7/2008 5:37:52 PM	I have had anxiety problems for the past 3 years and I thought it was about time to try something as anxiety has been taking over my life.  I was given 75mg for 14 days to start under close monitoring.  I took it the first day after breakfast and felt a bit &quot;out of it&quot; for the first few hours. However, on the 4th hour I had an extreme panic attack and had to leave work.  I felt dizzy, tired, hot/cold, dry mouth, anxious, shakey, pupils were huge... I got home around lunch and vomitted all afternoon with the company of a bad headache.  Also, I have not had an appetite all day as I still feel quite ill. I will not be continuing this drug and will not recommend it to anyone from my own experience and others that I've witnessed and read about.
Depression	petalumarealtor, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	55-64	4/30/2008 2:15:39 AM	I was suffering from clinical depression that started when I was being treated for HEP C. About 8 months into the treatment I would awaken everyday with feelings of hopelessness and a wish to simply not exist. The doctors said I needed to see a psychiatrist and get treatment for this severe depression. I tried several anti-depressants including Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft with no success. I finally tried Effexor and it worked! I lost the feelings of hopelessness, I found I was able to smile, I regained some energy and generally felt better. At the end of the HEP C treatment I stopped the Effexor treatment also but after a couple of months the depression returned and was quite disabling. I ended up taking Effexor again and the depression subsided. I have been taking Effexor in doses of 150 mg to 225 mg for the past 5 years and have been able to return to work, enjoy my family and life in general. If I stop taking the Effexor I find myself slipping back into depression after just a few days. I am taking the time to write this to provide a note of encouragement to people who have not found a way out of their depression. As I said, I had to try several before I found something that worked but I kept trying. I also use diet and exercise and therapy and prayer and meditation. I need them all to stay in the light. I still have days when I awaken with my head in a negative space but with the help of the medicine, doctors and prayer and helping other people worse off than I am I find life is usually pretty good and often downright great!  
Depression	haim777, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/28/2008 12:05:36 AM	Taking this for depression and anxiety. My anxiety attacks stopped almost immediately. I still get depressed, but only now usually before my monthly cycle which is common for women. I have more energy and way more patience. I too have the &quot;zaps&quot; when I miss a dose. The major downside for me to this med. is the weight gain. I've gained 17lbs in 3 mos. However I must admit my diet is not good so that probably has alot to do with it. I'll see what happens once I start exercising and eating right.

Depression		4	4	4			4/17/2008 2:42:06 AM	I must say that Effexor is most effective at treating depression. It really helped me through a very bad time in my life. BUT I must warn anyone who is thinking of taking this medication that the withdrawl symptoms are MOST SEVERE!!! Sweating, Chills, Bad Headache, Nausea, Restlessness, Inability to sleep, Cloudy thinking just to name a few. It is impairative that anyone thinking of stopping this drug do it correctly and under the close supervision of thier doctor. The symptoms are no joke, I felt like a junkie going through detox! Review all your options to find what's right for you and be ready to endure the side effects, the more knowledge you have the better!

I have been on this medication for 4 years and have regained my life again. I have no side effects, and anxiety has not acted up since. I can now do anything without fear that my anxiety will flare up. It doesn't work for everyone but it sure works for me.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	3/25/2008 8:21:49 PM	I've had a long battle with depression that worsened after each pregnancy. This is the only medication that ever really worked for me. It's weeks, not days between breakdowns. I would like to come off of it sometime, but each time I try, the side effects are worse than the depression was. I experience severe headaches and electric shocks throughout my body - enough to want to do ANYTHING to make it stop. DO NOT go off of this medicine without a good support behind you to help with the withdrawls!

Depression	hillguy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	3/8/2008 4:07:38 PM	I started with Prozac and withing hours I was on a high and then about 1 year later I started to sleep around the clock and was back in depression.  I have been on several others with limited effectiveness or none at all.  Then I was prescribed Effexor and in light of my past drugs I am very happy with it.  If I go off of it within a few weeks I am back in the mental mud bog and sinking. I am now very sure to have enough effexor on hand.  I still get depressed and most people that I know do.  However, now my depression is about something that I can work through but, I never want to be without the effexor.  I don't think that there is any medication that can work 100% 24/7.  Compared to the person that just sat on the couch in front of the TV and drink or sleep much of the time.  I find it a blessing no matter what anyone says (Mr. Cruse) it has helped me so much.  I actually can plan for something or get excited about something or just go out to be out.  Before I was in front of the TV sucking down 2 six packs a day and sleeping the rest of the day and not to mention my anger.  My depression has had an effect on riends and family or just meeting someone.  So, you can jump on a couch or tell me that I am brain washed and I'll tell you that I am better off today than before I started effexor.  People tell me that I am a different person and I actually choose to help people with their depression because of what I have gone through.  I'm not a doctor but, my exeriance has helped other people.  I now think positive thoughts instead of negative ones.  So, MAKE TODAY THE VERY BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE.
Depression	persephone, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/4/2008 8:36:57 PM	Basically, this drug has helped change my life. I've had problems with recurring major depressive disorder for as long as I can remember, but it took one really bad episode in my adulthood to make me consider taking an antidepressant.I have to say, taking the meds in combination with talk therapy has improved the quality of my life beyond measure.Most of the complaints people have here are about weight gain, decreased libido and withdrawal effects.My weight gain started before taking Effexor, so I can't blame it on that - I know it was due to a lifestyle change. I had decreased libido for about 6 months, but then it returned back to normal.And FYI - you're going to have withdrawal effects when you stop taking any antidepressant. The key is to taper off slooooooowly and with the supervision of your doctor. Not everyone needs to take Effexor (or any antidepressant) forever, but for me - as long as it keeps me in remission, I'm a happy camper.

Most of the previous remarks were helpful to those trying to go off the drug -I can't say the same for the edited version!

Depression	Physiology, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	65-74	3/1/2008 6:26:29 PM	I too was having a terrible time trying to get through the terrible withdrawal symptoms after several years on Effexor. I am now taking some OTC items which are helping tremendously. I saw that some people trying to escape the Effexor demon were taking fish oil supplements and multivitamin/minerals, so I'm now taking Organic Flaxseed Oil and a Mega Vitamin/Mineral Complex with an additional boost of B-Complex Vitamins which I purchase cheaply with very low shipping costs from http://www.VitaCost.com. Some treatment programs are stating that with the depletion of antioxidants, one needs to add a product such as gluathione supplementation. This is also available from VitaCost very cheaply. I've added another super antioxidant, Acai pure freeze-dried pure organic powder from Amazon Thunder, the provider of Acai for the Oprah Show documentary. I take my scoopful daily in juice, but some people like it in applesauce, yogurt, etc. It has no sugar added and is completely organic. It's available from http://www.amazonthunder.com/members/coonmartranc h. I've been using these dietary boosters during the entire time and will continue to do so for several months after I'm completely off the Effexor as my withdrawal symptoms have been minimal. Let me know if this suggestion helps or not. Best wishes.........

I have been dizzy, nauseous for 3 days now.  I didn't realize it was the withdrawal from the meds until reading this!  It took the edge off, helped with menopause symptoms, but I eat constantly (not good!) &amp; have NO libido at all!  I am not happy with this med, overall.
Depression	shaz, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	2/26/2008 11:49:11 PM	I have been on 3 other anti-depressants and this is the only one that worked for me!The others made my depression much much worse.I have been on Effexor for over 4 years and will probally be on it for a lot longer as I am a cronic depression sufferer.The only side effects I did suffer were cold night sweats for about a year, and night mares but compared to how I was feeling that is a small price to pay.I have also had a baby whilst on this medication with no effects to my child.He is very happy and healthy.It is very different for each and every person that is on anti-depressants and it is a very hard road to get better.I know thats all I use to hear was &quot;one day youll feel normal, it will get better just hold on&quot;,at the time its so hard and you just dont want to but I can tell you first hand THAT IT REALLY DOES GET BETTER!!!Trust me.It couldnt get much worse right.I have had a lot of suicide around me I have recently lost 2 friends, and have in the past lost 4 family members to suicide and I tell you, you are a long time dead. There are so many things to live for but the most important thing is your self.Im still getting to know my self after 24 years but its great and scary at the same time.We all deserve to be happy and healthy and enjoy life.I hope that this has helped you and wish you all the best for the future.Just remember hold on, It does get better :-)

(I tried almost all of them!)  I have been a chronic pain patient over 10 years with Neuropathy and Fibromyalgia and the additional pain relief is wonderful.  I also suffer from panic attacks, and the Effexor XR helps with that too. No negative side effects other than dry mouth, which is easily handled by drinking lots of water...(good for the body, anyway.)

Effexor worked like a charm.  When the divorce was over and things were settled then I went off the medication.  Everything was great for about 6 months and then the anxiety came back.  I went back on the Effexor and was back in control.  At this time, I really had no reason to have anxiety so i went off the meds again.  Suddenly I started having issues with high blood pressure so back on the Effexor again. The blood pressure is fine now.  I don't know if Effexor was the cause of any of this, but I really don't want to be a slave to this drug forever.

It works, but at what cost. I'm was always tierd. As for sex in my life it was non existent and severe hot flashes weight gain, and sinus problemes. It fixed one probleme and gave me five more. I am now trying to get off this medication. It is so hard!! I have been pill free for 4 days and i'm dizzy I fell sick to my stomache and I just want to cry at the drop of a hat. I wish I had know of the withdrawl. At this point it is very hard to function normaly. I hope this gets better.

Lexapro did nothing.  Wellbutrin was like speed for me.  I feel great now.  It has been two months and if I feel down it is for a short time and feels normal.  My desire for sex has waned a bit but orgasm is still possible.  No other side effects.

The first dose I took made me so agitated and antsy I had to have my husband take over with the kids. I had internal tremors and headaches, my skin crawled, I scratched myself until I would bleed. I felt like I was losing my mind. I asked my dr what side effects the drug had prior to starting it, she said it really didn't have any. I wish doctors would prescribe this drug more carefully.

Did not have any hot flashes after the very first dose, but within a very short time the effexor completely wiped out sexual response.  Switched to neurontin. It doesn't work quite as well, but no side effects.

Awesome, miracle drug! - BUT no one told me about alcohol and the drug, I had a couple glasses of wine and by midnight I was throwing up like I drank a bottle of whiskey - Took me almost two days to recover from that episode  - vomited for about 6 hours straight.

I've been on it for 2+ years. ButI have trouble getting my doctor to call in my refills in a timely manner and I cannot skip a dose or the withdrawl begins.I get lightheaded, stumble like a drunk, blurred vision, nausea, sweating, and SEVERE Anger Rages. They are so bad they sometimes I have to send my kids to their grandparents until I get leveled out again.(I tend to destroy things which is very unlike me) While this is the most fast acting drug to treat what it is intended to: Panic, depression, anger. The side affects of not taking it is NOT worth it. I like many others was not told of the side effects of this costly drug or I would not have began taking it. Now without it though, I feel worst than a druggie.  And the amount of weight it has caused me to gain is unreal. I've gained close to 100lbs in 2 years. And the worst part is my appetite has decreased but my body absorbs every ounce of fat it gets thanks to this medicine. And sleep, I stay so tired it's unbelievable. I sleep 12-14 hrs a day more if I could. My sex life is nearly non-exsistent! Thank God, I have a understanding husband! I really would like to stop taking this Medicine. My doctor also told me that should I become pregnant to stop taking immediately. I don't think one could survive the withdrawl side effects added to the syptoms of a new pregnancy. And I can't imagine how unhealthy this med. would be for a fetus. I would recommend trying every &quot;non-addicting&quot; anti-depressant before taking this one. You CANNOT JUST QUIT! It is truly ADDICTING!

My anxiety went so low to the point that after about the first six months I lowered the dose to half (i.e., one pill every other day). I am happier, have more patiance, and more extravert. I get drug withdraw when I forget to take the pill (feel naucious). My moderate alcohol intake does have negative interaction with it. I wish that a generic brand becomes available to reduce cost.

If I don't get some quality sleep soon...I dream (or nightmare) so much that I wake sore and confused.I am exhausted, have muscle weakness, anger, apathy, and feel like an observer of my life rather than the main participant. As soon as I have the finances and the right people around me to get the support I need, I want to stop taking this drug.  But for now, it's sligtly better than the depression and I am hopeful that the new dose will settle soon.

My doctor did not explain the side effects associated with discontinuing the medication.  I haven't experienced any of those side effects because I still take Effexor, but I'm worried about how it will be when I come off.  Ultimately, this drug saved my marriage, but I do not feel 100% myself.
Depression	Originalinsomniac, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	13-18	12/15/2007 5:16:36 AM	They should call it, &quot;EFFECTS - OR&quot;!    I was prescribed this drug when I was in sixth grade (six years ago), and it has been a bumpy road of on and off ever since.     When I was first prescribed, I was on a small dose. However eventually I would out-grow that dose and once again feel my general sings of: Nervousness, Anxiety, and my tourettic body maneuvers would return.      However after a while on this prescription, like all patients of this drug, I was slowly becoming addicted. This meant that, If I didn't take my prescribed dose once, It didn't matter If it was only one dose, or even if it was an unnoticed accident, before long I would be stumbling around like a drunk, I would have a headache so splitting that if I turned my head too fast it would feel like the blood in my skull was in a centrifuge on full turn. Not too mention my appetite would be lost, mostly because of the low-aching-numbness in my gut that nulled out all satisfactory feelings for food. Also there was muscle cramping. Normally you only feel a muscle cramp of this caliber if you just ran a couple-non-stop laps around a track and stopped to touch your toes, however this was not the case, My tendons, thighs, and even hands would go as far as to &quot;lock up&quot; if even given the mundane task of bending down to tie my shoes.     However the effects while taking the drug could be even worse. For one I was so fatigued that I would be going to bed at 8:30 pm and still be exhausted at 6:00. Also weight gain, the extent of the weight gain was so massive that now, that I am attempting to cleanse the drug from my system( I've been clean about a week and lived with negative side effects every day since) but the weight gain was so massive that once I limited my intake of the drug, I was beginning to add new notches to shrink my belt every-so-few days. Not only has my weight gone down but I am actually able to stay awake.    In the end all I am saying is, the choice is yours. Choose right.

I would physically get tremendously sick. In the end I wouldn't recommend this drug. Though it may work is it really worth it if it messes up your body that much. Not to mention the major amount of weight that it made me gain. I would suggest trying something else. Unless of course you like to feel sick if you accidently miss a dose.

Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	11/25/2007 9:39:19 AM	If I miss even one dose of effexor I experience buzzing in my head, disorientation, and blurred vision.  I went to an audiologist, an ENT dr and told my regular md--nothing wrong with my hearing or ear tubes and all I got from my reg dr was &quot;barometric pressure&quot; could be affecting my sinuses.  I really thought I was losing my mind or had a brain tumor--honestly.  I finally figured out that when I missed my meds (usually on weekends) I experienced the mess I mentioned above.  After reading the other comments I realize I am not going out of my mind.  I also now dread the day that I have to start weaning off this drug.  Overall, effexor has helped me with depression...I can only say don't miss a dose!
Depression	pumpkiny, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	35-44	11/23/2007 10:20:13 PM	My doctor gave me this for anxiety and irritability. It helps a bit. I went off it once and it does have to be tapered off very slowly but it's not that bad. I get these head zingers if I forget a dose and that's how it was when I went off it but I just had to put up with it for a week or so and then I was fine. Don't stay on a drug for fear of side effects when going off it. 
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	11/17/2007 11:12:00 PM	Effexor XR changed my life. I have panic disorder with agoraphobia but am now symptom free. I used to be housebound, afraid even to be alone at home. Since I became symptomatic in 1969 I had taken tricyclics with some success but was never able to go anywhere very much. I was a virtual prisoner. Even the infomercial lady talked to me on the phone and realized I had a physical source to my problem. My brain is sensitive to epinephrine. I needed something that would control the norepinephrine in my brain. Guess what? That's what Effexor XR has done!! I started taking it in 1996 at age 45. I can drive anywhere, go anywhere and do just about everything a normal person can do. I even went to Ireland and stayed alone in a small town for three weeks -- If someone would have told me that was possible before Effexor I would have said &quot;No Way!&quot;   It's not perfect. My worst side effect is insomnia. Better that than being a prisoner in my own home. The very worst things are FIRST The price. When might we see a generic equivalant? SECOND It is very hard to reduce the dosage or stop taking the medicine entirely. I experienced sort of a buzzing in my head (an actual noise), disorientation, tremors, sleeplessness, somnabulation (sleepwalking) when I did sleep, extreme hypertension that alarmed my internist so that I know I must be carefully watched if I ever have reason or desire to quit.   If this medication doesn't work for your particular problem, don't be afraid to try something else. I have a lady next door to me who has my problem and hasn't left her house in 40 years. All because she is afraid of side effects. The life she has missed, it's sad.

I was also having difficulty sleeping more than 5 hrs per night. The initial dosage was 150 mg per day, which was somewhat effective, then upped to 225 mg, which worked better. I now can sleep normally (7 or more hrs per night), however will find myself &quot;tensed up&quot;, with various parts of my body such as my neck, shoulder, back, drawn up in an unnatural position. I have to then force myself to relax whatever region is affected at that time. 
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	35-44	11/4/2007 10:38:51 PM	This medication worked well initially, but now that I would like to stop taking it I find I suffer from odd withdrawl symptoms if I miss even one dose; including dizziness, rapid heart rate, odd almost inner ear/motion sickness feeling, ill at ease.  I spoke to my doctor recently who informed me that he no longer prescribes this medication due to the difficulty of stopping use.  I would be interested to know of any documented information regarding the discontinuation of the medication.

I have had mood swings and depression since I was 16 years old. I have always experienced extreme irritability and anger. This drug gave me back my life and helped me become the mother and wife that I had always tried to be. I now get to enjoy the holidays  without freaking out and ruining it for everyone. It also helps my ADHD!  I am so much happier now. The only problem that i have experience is that when I miss a dose, I dream long, vivid dreams all night. I always know when I miss a dose because of that. I have been on it for 5 years, and I'm afraid to quit for fear that my life will return to what it was like before. I have also read all of the horror stories of people trying to quit, and that scares me.

I told my doctor and he prescribe Effexor XR 75mg capsules.  It saved my life.  I cannot swallow pills or capsules.  I open the capsules in applesauce and take it that way.  I know I am not the only one.  Apparently the drug improved my WHOLE daily attitude for my family, friends and girlfriend saw a marked improvement in me.  To this day I have not told anyone about having depression other than my med doc and shrink.With this drug there has been no weight gain, no urinary problems, no sleep problems, no eating problems, no more voices.I would recommend this drug to anyone. I take it once daily in the morning.

Effexor XR works better for the extreme irritability I experience from the constant pain. I've tried other anti-depressants but Efferor works best so far to help me keep what little sanity I have left. I don't feel the urge to scream, cry, and/or lash-out nearly as much since I've been taking Effexor XR. That fact alone makes it much easier to be around people. Even when I'm having a bad day, I can manage to keep it to myself.

I am slowly tapering off from 300mg to 150mg a day.  So far it has been okay.  I think this drug is great and really did help me and my family!  Definitely the sexual libido is not the greatest - hard to reach orgasm and wish it could be better.  Get night sweats at certain times of the month - could be drug related not too sure.But overall the drug has been fantastic for me and did help me when I needed it.

I was having severe anxiety/panic attacks and felt like I couldn't go anywhere by myself.  I finally feel like I have my life back and it is in my control.  I even sat on a plane on the runway for 3 hours and did not freak out like I would have!  It has also helped control my anger.  The only negative thing I have to say about this medicine is that I have noticed if I do not take it with enough food it will make me feel naseaus all day and my doctor insists that I take it in the morning and I am not a breakfast person.  I was told that the withdrawl effects when you come off the medicine would not be that bad (a little of what I have read about the effects has been a little frightening)

He is taking 300 mgs/day and Effexor probably is doing its job.

I found it easy to use and worked well for my depression.  However, if i miss a few doses, I get light headed/dizzy which reminds me that I've forgotten it.  Which is both positive and negative, for I do not look forward to ever coming off of this drug due to the withdrawals I experience from just a few days off of it.

So calming, nothing phased me. Could fall asleep in seconds. Would go to car on lunch hour and mininap, out in a flash and wake up totally fresh. Was worried about things I had read about stopping use of but I gradually reduced dose as suggested and was off in two weeks with no problems. I have since retired. Was taking the XR.

Have been on 150mg XR &amp; 75mg XR after the sudden death of my spouse of 30 years. Doesn't interfere with other meds I'm taking either.

Almost immediate relief. It has caused me to wake up in the middle of the night. Would still recommend.

I switched to Cymbalta and, although it also interfers with sex life, it didn't leave me feeling as bad about losing this part of my life.  You can still have sex, just not the orgasm (very frustrating) but I'm on a much more even keel and mentally feeling safer.

The side affects were extremely painful (headache, stomache ache, dizziness) not fun getting off.  Be very careful before you make a decision on this one.

Depression	none, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	10/26/2007 1:48:33 AM	this medication has helped me feel less depressed in most ways, but has also made me cry for no reason at all..sometimes i will have quick thoughts of doing things I shouldnt do.. but quickly recover... sometimes i get to where I feel impulsive about buying or doing something even though I know I should not. And sometimes the urge is very strong..and sometimes I have gone ahead and proceeded with that thought or action even though another part of me said not to. For the most part.. this medication has improved my mood.. but sometimes it also alters it to someone I am not. That meaning to change my thoughts to unusual at times.. Also,, at times I will completely forget all my meds and will have bad and bizarre dreams at night.. I am also alot more forgetful about other things as well.

I had persistent and frequent hot flashes after menopause.  Effexor reduced to more manageable symptoms.  If I try to taper dose (every other day), I get a greater number of hot flashes.

On Effexor XR 75 mg at the time I made a serious suicide attempt. Phycologist advised family doctor to up my dose. Advice not taken. This could have cost me my life. I'm a 54 year old women with a full time job. Married with 4 grown cildren. Total medication effects. I am still on Effexor XR,now 175mg - 225mg and I see a phyciatrist about every 2-3 months. I contact him immediately if I'm spiraling down, Effexor XR works well,but physicians need to advise pts to call immediately if they feel suicidal. Not just children/teenagers. I've been wanting to express this for 8 yrs now,but haven't known a way to get the message out there.

Still have lingering short term memory loss &amp; uncontrollable yawning.  Might be the mix of this med with my others.
Bipolar Depression	songofthesouth, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/23/2007 3:45:41 PM	I've been taking it for a few weeks now and I can't believe the difference in how I feel. The only side effect I've noticed is not feeling hungry hardly at all. Hey, works for me.
Depression	j, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	10/23/2007 2:08:46 AM	It seems to have a serious effect on my short term memory. My ability to cope with high body heat, like temprature or clothing is difficult.  Heat stroke could be a problem. My overall ability to cope with my stressfull life has improved. I can talk about stress related issues without crying. The downside is that there are times when I should cry and am not able to. It is impossible for me to fully  experience grief or justifiable anger or fear.  When my dog had to be put down I needed to cry in order to grieve and was not able to.  When my husband treatened my life I was unable to react with anger and so was put into a dangerous situation.  But I would not quit taking effexor.  It has helped me more than it has caused problems.
Other	Jeff, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	25-34	10/22/2007 5:14:29 PM	I'm still ramping up my dosage so to speak but so far have noticed a few side effects including:  dizziness, abnormal difficulty sleeping, and excessive sweating at night.  I have a pretty severe anxiety and panic disorder and have tried Lexapro and Paxil both to there maximum dosages with no success.  I will say so far Effexor seems to be more promising than the others and I haven't been needing to take my Xanax near as often.

But so far it hasn't helped my headsches. What I do like is it keeps me in a good mood and doesn't effect my sex drive like Prozac or Paxill did.

Depression	 Jason, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	13-18	10/1/2007 2:03:13 PM	My Dr. had placed me on this, because I said I was going to kill myself, but in reality I didn't think I was ever going to get out of rehab after my car accident. They were just words and I got out of rehab a little over a week later. I was just in rehab for 5 months and I wanted to get out so I could finish school so I didn't have to repeat a year. 1) I shouldn't have said what I did 2) He should have listened when I told him I was just saying that 3) The drug messed with my head. I took myself off of it with no side effects. I do know I'm thrilled that I'm off it now, and have never been happier, even though I still had to repeat a year...

Depression	Nan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/24/2007 7:00:31 PM	My doctor has me taking 75mg/day, alternating with 150mg/day (1 pill odd days, two pills even days).  I have had no problems, and my depression is under control.  When I began to take the 2nd pill, however, I developed a rash on my face from the moisterizer I have been using for years. It has vitamins C and E in it.  The rash took almost a week to go away, and when I tested the cream a few weeks later, I had the same rash.  I changed moisterizers and have had no other problems.
