Migraine Headache	IrishEyes, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/26/2012 12:57:20 PM	Migraines used to lay me up for 2-3 days.  When my doctor prescribed Midrin, I got my life back.  My first symptom is usually loss of periferal vision.  As soon as that happens, I take my prescribed dose, lay down in a dark room, nap for 2-4 hours and I am near perfect again.  When I have to wait to take the Midrin(not at home, have to p/u kids from school etc.), or I wake up with the migraine, I take the Midrin and stay in a dark, quiet room until the next dose.  Migraine is either gone or greatly reduced in 6-8 hours.  Which beats hell out of 2 days!

Migraine Headache	dnrshaw, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	7/22/2012 8:10:53 PM	I started taking this medication just a few days ago. I've had a migraine for 7 days. Although this has taken the edge off, it hasn't fully worked because my migraine had already started. I'm hoping it will work in the future. I've tried a few other medications and nothing has worked. I'm ready to even try botox!One side effect that it says is severe, is dark stools. Has anyone else experienced this? I am also taking an antibiotic for a UTI and something called Omerprazole, which I couldn't find anything saying those would affect the stools. I'm not really sure what it going on, but I am terrified I am overloading my system and its starting to effect my liver.If anyone could help or give insight, that would be great!

Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	1/10/2011 4:18:45 PM	Although it sometimes takes the 2nd dose, this has often been the only medication to ease suffering with a full blown migraine, thank God for it.

My doctor perscribed this medication to me as treatment. I take the medication at the onset of a migraine. Since the first time I have taken the medication, I have had no complaints. Works everytime.

Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	2/23/2010 12:18:46 PM	I get terrible migraines that start at the back of my head on the right side and creep up behind my right eye.  They come at least twice a month and always end up with me vomiting.  At the onset of a migraine, I take two, as prescribed.  It takes about 30 minutes before the migraine is completely gone, but only about 10 minutes for it to start decreasing in pain.  The only side-effect I've experienced is fatigue.  I definitely recommend taking this at a time when you will not be operating heavy machinery.  All in all, I have been very pleased with my doctor's advice.

Migraine Headache	unkkkkown, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	9/3/2009 4:22:37 PM	After having my first child, I began getting headaches that made it impossible for me to function, work, or do pretty much anything. My doctor prescribed this drug for me to try on a 2 week trial and then wanted me to come back and let her know if it worked, or try something else. I couldn't even make it through the 2 weeks, the prescription did nothing for my headaches.

It relieves the headache within a half hour.  I seldom need to take more than one dose.  These headaches are usually around my monthly cyle.

Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	6/18/2009 4:28:34 PM	I usually take two when I feel like I might be getting a headache and then one at a time if it's not completely gone. However, it does not do anything for menstral headaches.

Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	2/16/2009 11:36:33 PM	It kills the headache right away. I try not to take it to often because it makes me feel like I am under the influence of a heavy narcotic. I have had some good luck with Excedrin Migraine over the counter. The headache lessens and I am able to drive cautiously while taking it. 
Other	cricket, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	2/12/2009 2:29:57 AM	My Dr. prescribed this for fibromyalgia pain.  I don't feel that it is working, and it's giving me more frequent and bad headaches.  We have yet to find a med that works and has tolerable side effects - guess I'm an odd one.  Also, 2 wks. after starting it, (the only new med I'm taking - the others I've been taking for awhile), and I started having what I thought was my period, which has been very irregular for the last 2 years; some months nothing at all.  My bleeding went into overdrive to the point where I was soaking both a super OB tampon AND a maximum pad within 1/2 hr. to an hr.  with a lot of pain.  I don't know if it was from this med or not, but it has raised the question.
Migraine Headache	luce cannon, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/23/2009 12:58:51 AM	I have daily headaches, occasionally turning to migraine thanks to sinus issues (according to my ENT anyway).  I only take this medication on days when the headache is unbarable- when I can't go to sleep to ease the ache because the pain is so severe.  It usually takes a few doses/hours, but typically it works well and once the headache is gone, it's not severe again for some time.
Migraine Headache	Judith, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	55-64	7/30/2008 9:21:11 AM	I used the medication for treatment of migraines and tension headaches.  For instance, I've had a headache since Saturday and it's Wednesday.  I treated it with two capsules right away which relieved it, but subsequent doses have done little or nothing for the headache.  My doctor sugg'd I tried to put an ice pack on my neck and at the same time heat on my feet.  It relieved the headache in 20 minutes, however, given 5 hours later, it has returned.  I think I might be suffering from rebound headaches.
Migraine Headache	duramater, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	5/10/2008 12:23:19 AM	This has really helped me get control of my frequent migraines. It works fairly quickly and I don't get any side effects - which is great because I can't use Imitrex due to terrible side effects, and using Excedrin works but it can cause rebound headaches or sometimes that's just too much caffeine. I also like Vicodin but it's too hard to get prescriptions for it due to the dependency factor, and sometimes it didn't work anyway. My only complaint is that when I get one of my days-long headaches, this stuff only knocks it out for some hours (instead of completely which would be heaven) and I have to keep re-dosing. But it works. I'm so glad I finally found a doctor that prescribed me something that works without side effects.
Migraine Headache	migrainechick, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	3/11/2008 2:43:29 PM	This medication really helps with light sensitivity and nausea that I usually experience with migraines. I often have to take this medication along with Vicodin to help with the pain. Unfortunately after I have taken the maximum dosage, the migraine frequently returns.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	10/14/2007 9:51:30 PM	It used to work for my migraines, but has stopped. I also tend to get rebound headaches when using it, and it completely knocks me out.
