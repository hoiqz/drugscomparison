Irritable Colon	Matt, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	45-54	5/23/2012 2:02:15 PM	Severe dizziness, drowsiness, lightheadedness, weakness, blurred vision, excitement, extreme anxiety, fast, irregular heart beat, increase in blood pressure---helped ease abdominal pain but didn't address nausea, gas, bloating, acid reflux, deep belching, etc.  Most definitely could not drive while on this medication.  In fact, basically had to remain in bed.  Extreme bad reaction.

The name sounds painful and believe me it is!! I am able to take it only when I feel an episode coming on. Each episode can last from minutes to hours. I also have learned to avoid some triggers like granny smith apples and Wheaties.  Weird? yes I know.  It took months to sort out the diagnosis because my gall bladder was coinidentally bad at the same time. Got rid of that, had a &quot;swallow study&quot; and ruled out heart attacks.  Tried several other drugs that were not effective in controling the spasming. Bentyl is a lifesaver for me.  It works by relaxing the smooth muscles.  This is also why it works for irritable bowel and spastic colon. Makes me sort of drowsy but I can still function normally.  Dry mouth is very minimal and I usually do get a headache, usually when the med is wearing off.  Its not bad or bothersome enough to make me not take Bentyl however.  Within a few hours the headache is usually gone as is the other symptoms.  The longer you take it, the softer the side effects as your body gets used to them.Its funny how a drug made for a specific syndrome (irritable bowel) can be used in other ways and be just as effective!

It took this long to find a doctor who knew what to give me for the cramping.  The spasms were debilitating, so I will be eternally grateful for this drug!

Irritable Colon	Wonderful100, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	2/26/2012 3:11:24 PM	I have had IBS for years. About 3 years ago I had a colonscopy and was diagnosed with collegeous colitis. The pain was in my right lower abdomen elevating up to the gall bladder area. The doctor did a CT Scan and nothing was found. It even hurts when I put pressure on my right leg. So a C-Reactive Protein test is being done (with no results yet). It helps but now I have started having the shakes and I don't like it. But what am I to do. Also taking Bentyl (generic) along with my other meds, I really feel bombed out. I tske it 3 times a day before meals. Since I have started taking the Bentyl, it has helped the pain. After so long, the med wears off and I start having the pains again. It is helping but I pray I don't have to stay on it the rest of my life. BM is more firm that before since starting Bentyl.

Irritable Colon	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	2/19/2012 11:45:35 AM	My doctor only has me taking this when experiencing a flare-up. It works well, and works quickly. However, I've noticed that I am personally more prone to attacks in the days following a dose. I try not to take it unless the pain is unbearable, or in a place where I can't easily camp out in a restroom. Despite that little side effect, I am so happy my doctor prescribed this to me! I've had this condition as long as I can remember, and this stuff revolutionized how I cope with it.
Irritable Colon	Joe, 55-64 Male  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	12/19/2011 7:20:15 PM	Before taking Bentyl, my bowl movements were regular and almost always very loose. Have been taking 3 times a day for 3 mmonths and I am probably 3/4 of the way to normal. Most of my movements are firm, and they are not as forced or irregular. I am very grateful to my colorrectal MD for prescribing this for me.

Horrible stomach pains and diarhea.  I also struggle with incontience.  I was prescribed Bentyl and after the first pill I thought wow I finally found a miracle drug.  It works wonders...unfortunately I am experiencing side effects.  Blurry vision, hard time concentrating, and feeling a bit out of it.  Does anyone know whether these side effects go away over time?  Is this something that your body needs to get adjusted to or if you have these side effects will you always have them.  Although the side effects are bad and it is very hard to work will feeling the side effects I am still willing to use this drug as it is unbelievably helpful.  Please let me know if these side effects eventually went away for anyone else.

I was miserable without it. It's been a miracle drug for me. Bentyl and a high fiber diet have made my life normal. I could not have the quality of life I enjoy without it. Thank God for Bentyl and the doctor who finally diagnosed me correctly and prescribed it.

I was prescribed Bentyl for my symptons.  I take it 4 times a day as directed, but I continue to have flare ups several time a month.  The cramping in my lower abdomen almost makes me pass out. It is the worst pzin I have ever experienced.  After an attack, it takes me several days to feel good and and not be afvraid to eat.  I suffer with both IBS with constipation and diahrrea.  Wish someone could come up with something that eliminates the cramping and suffering.

I just started taking Bentyl after all the tests were normal.  Makes me a bit drousy and dizzy which is not good for my vocation.  I wonder how big a part stress plays when it comes to gut pain.  Every doc seems to just throw a drug at it instead of coming up with a reasonable assessment for the pain.

The first said take Benefiber which contributed to the diarrhea. 2nd MD gave me Bentyl and since I also take Vicodin, Zoloft and Ambien CR for my fibromyalgia I am a zombie. Sleep eludes me till 5-6 in am and then I sleep all day up till 11am. My eyes are blurry and dry and I get this horrible flushing feeling worse than my menopausal hot flashes, plus worse difficulty focusing from this medication which is a part of the Fibromyalgia. So I really don't know if I'm coming or going. I want relief but not at the expense of my livelihood. Thank God for decent benefits but I miss my job.

Irritable Colon	Angela, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	11/7/2010 8:36:51 PM	I was diagnosed with ulceractive colitis in 2001 and was prescribed bentyl and although it has helped with the pain it has also caused other problems to. It is now 11-7-10 and I was taken off it 3 weeks ago. I started having extreme pain in my stomach and was constantly vomiting in march of 2010. I was refered to the mayo clinic and was diagnosed with Barret's esophogus and Gastro-paresis along with IBS. (Oh and just a note on IBS It is diagnosed so no more test will be ordered. There is no such thing as IBS. Its a diagnoses when the physician can't tell u whats really wrong.) I am very sick and my stomach is dying. I believe that the bentyl has caused me more problems than not. I can't prove it but I was on this medication for almost 9yrs. It was the greatest drug when I began taking it in 2001 but I remained on it for so long that it has caused me so many more problems. For short term use its a great medication, but I WOULD NOT recommend it for a long period of time. Also, there is a new drug called Kapidex, its very expensive, but its worth it. It has helped me so much. For all the people out there with stomach problems, my prayers and thoughts r with you.

I recently found out I had lactose and tomatoe intolerance. It is helping me recover from IBS and GERD after correcting my diet. I DON't take it in the morning unless I don't have to go to work, because it makes me sleepy. The doctor said I could still take it with Imodium, when necessary, but I am finding the keys to the diet my gut likes. SEE AN ALLERGIST!!!

Irritable Colon	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	19-24	7/19/2010 9:13:00 PM	I take 10mg anywhere from 1-3 times per day as needed for IBS.  It does little to ease my abdominal pain, that I can tell. The worst has definitely been the side effects. I am VERY sensitive to medications and experience unpleasant side effects with nearly any medication, and bentyl has been no different. My worst reactions, which occur even when I have been off it for several days and only take one pill, I have very unpleasant mental feelings (like paranoia and mild delusions), and blurred vision (to the point where I can no longer drive myself and cannot function in my classes, since I often can't even see the blackboard or projection screen!).  My vision can't be corrected for this, since the degree of blurriness changes from day to day. Less problematic but still annoying is that it gives me very dry mouth.  It also used to make me tired, but no so much anymore.I'm sure this medication has probably helped a lot of people, but it hasn't worked for me.  My doctors are aware of all of the problems I've had, but none of them seem to care enough to do anything about it or change my medication.  I am getting off of this as soon as I can.

No help, I went to a hospital and they gave my a stronger anti-biotic. Next monthI took antacids no help. the pain became so intense I took morphine, little help. Next hospital looked for gall bladder (hida) test.Next came ultra-sound and other test showed nothing and I finaly got to a Gastro. He thought it was IBS so I was given Bentyl. I was without pain for first time in 4 months.6 weeks later pain spread to every part of my abdomin. Now I have stomach aches, intestinal cramps and pain and discomort every where. I have an apointment for a endoscopy. It only took 8 Doctors, giving me 9 diagnosess, and I am taking anti-depressants,antacids,metamucil,bentyl, prilosec, ambien and pain killers. Ihave slept 2 nites this week.

Can't tell if it's working, they gave me miralax too.. which is a nightmare for me.  I think the Bentyl made me wet the bed once, and almost a second time.  IS this real common?

These days I am trying to figure out if my cramps are colitis or gynocologic. So i take this to see if my cramps go away---if they do its GI related. BUT I just took a20 mg tablet and I am all of a sudden feeling weird in my head. I feel like my eyes are dialated and I an dizzy and nauseated. YUCK! No way can I take this multiple times a day. I will not take this anymore because I have 2 young children that I have to be able to take care of. What i need right now is a nap to sleep off the affects. It just dawned on me that I am having trouble with this med. Before I just didn't relate the 2 until i just read up on side effects. I feel really yucky. Glad it doesn't affect everyone this way!

It was to the point where going out to eat was not an option. I was prescribed Librax about a year ago and really helped. Than last month the price went so high that I was not able to afford it anymore. Doctor prescribed me Bentyl and it is working great. The only problem I have had is some nausea and drowsiness, but will take a little discomfort over the intense pain that I would feel if not taking this medication. Hoping that this will continue to work for me!

But, every other muscle in your body becomes relaxed as well, making daily activities sometimes difficult to do.Please note that this medication does not help with the amount of bowel movements you have. My doctor gave me two choices: reduce the abdominal cramping or reduce the amount of bowel movements. I wish it could do both.
Irritable Colon	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	11/30/2009 2:49:02 PM	Been taking this since 2008. Ive had mahor aggravating symptoms such as: dizziness, lightheadedness, a drunk feeling, drowsiness and those are just to name a few of the worst. All year I thought it was my Zoloft doing this to me but now im really believing that Bentyl is causing these symptoms. My IBS pain bothers me less frequently than before starting Bentyl but I do still get the unbearable pain, depending on what I eat. Its a tough game (dealing with IBS) sometimes you cant win! From reading reviews, Bentyl doesnt sound very helpful. Maybe with less frequent pain but too many bad symptoms! I dont like it and plan on finding another way to help my poor tummy!

I can barely see the screen right now to type this review. I have been to several physicians including the emergency room and an eye DR. because of severe dizziness, blurred vision, sweating and lack of concentration. Not one of my wonderful physicians even mentioned the possibility of Bentyl side affects being the culprit(they were all told what I was taking). I am so greatful for all the comments here, because I now know what has been happening to me. I have been so afraid of what was going on with me, because no physician was able to find a diagnosis for my symptoms. THANK YOU ALL FOR TAKING THE TIME TO COMMENT, I REALLY FEEL LIKE MY LIFE HAS BEEN SAVED.

If I know that I will be eating something that can have a bad effect on me, then I take one before eating. I do not take it everyday and that works for me. It's a great medication for me.

I can't urinate without &quot;pushing&quot;. I can't have an orgasm. I still can't eat properly because many foods just go right through me (and not junk food like greasy stuff, I mean healthy things like fruit and veg), I can't eat at a restaurant or a friend's house because I don't know what the food's going to do to me, if I'm going to spend the next hour in the bathroom. When I have to go I have to go NOW. I still have terrible lower abdominal pain (especially when passing waste but also right out of the blue). This drug was supposed to stop these gut problems not only isn't doing so but is almost as bad as the disease. I want to go off it but my stupid gastro is off on vacation for the entire month of August (how convenient for him).

At first I only took it when needed.  And it really helped almost immediately.  Now I try to take it regularly (2-3 times a day) to avoid any problems to begin with.  I rarely have any bouts now.  The only problem I had is dry eyes.  I use Visine tears and it works pretty well.  But the dry eyes is a small price to pay for relief.
Other	pheephee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	8/17/2009 5:24:06 PM	I use as needed when I have a flare-up.  I avoid the foods that bother me: milk products, yellow/red onions, onion or garlic salts or powders.  Now if restaurant workers would REALLY read the labels! I am a 6 year survivor of Stage IV colon cancer, and I do need people to be careful what they tell me is in the food.  This flare-up is from them sprinkling some powdered junk on the pollo asada I ordered; it is usually marinated in natural ingredients, and I can eat it.  Just messed my clothes at the store because it is not for diarrhea, but to slow the peristaltic action of the whole digestive tract in order to reduce cramping.  Overall, it has been useful and effective.  And I do not need it very often.  I also use digestive enzymes (omnigest or other)when I eat out, probiotics or liquid acidophylus after flare-ups, and watch what I eat.  I also eat sitting, and I do not get up to get anything once I start to eat.  I also use medical hypnosis to ease stress so I have fewer flare-ups. I was first diagnosed with IBS at age 31.

I have IBS and sometimes get HORRIBLE stomach pains! I am to take this 3 times a day but I usually take it 2 times. The only side effect I have is it makes me a little tired. I see that many people are saying that it did not help their diarrhea, it is not for that. If you have bad diarrhea you should also take Lomotil.  With IBS you have both constipation and diarrhea. Bentyl is just to control the pain that comes with IBS.  When diarrhea acts up you need to take something seperate to treat that. Like I said Lomotil works well for that. 
Irritable Colon	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/3/2009 1:13:18 AM	This medication has been amazing for me.  I am a light weight when it comes to medications, but I've had very little problems with Bentyl. The side effect for me is my eyes blur a little, but it goes away after a few hours. I only have to take the med on as &quot;needed&quot; basis. I had IBS so bad I ended up in a hospital in Warsaw Poland last year, and when I came home the doctor prescribed this and it helped immediately.  NO waiting period for me.

The first time I tried it, it worked immediately, and I ended up taking it every day for about four years.  Now I only take it once or twice every few months, as I've learned to cope with the IBS better, Bentyl helped in that regard.  I'm not sure if it was legitimate in treating the IBS or if it was simply a placebo, but either way it was a security blanket that helped me gain some control of my life back.  I still struggle with IBS, and still take Bentyl.  It isn't a guaranteed cure or treatment, but 9 times out of 10 it will help reduce IBS symptoms and at least increase my ability to cope.

I have had the LLQ pain for a couple of years now off and on and my gyno assumed it was my ovary. Now come to find out it is most likely IBS or an intolerance to gluten. My doc prescribed me Bentyl and it did NOT work for me. I called her a week later and she switched my meds. I am now (come to find out, which I was NOT told up front) on an antidepressant which also serves as a muscles relaxant. It has helped relax my stomach cramps, but the symptoms are still there otherwise. I have both the &quot;go&quot; and the &quot;not go&quot; problem back and forth.

I stopped taking it when i researched the drug and found out it CAUSES KIDNEY FAILURE. I was born with ONE kidney. it didn't do anything for me (i didnt need it in the first place) AND it caused an abnormal routine blood check up to show something was wrong with my kidney. GREAT!

It worked so fast and the abdominal pain was gone!!  I found out from the ER Dr. that I had Gall Stones.  She gave me RX for Bentyl until it was determined by my Dr. that I would need surgery. In the short time it took for the follow up tests and decision for them to do surgery, about 10 days, I had 3-4 more Gall Bladder attacks.  I'M SO GLAD THAT I HAD THE BENTYL.  What were lasting about 12hrs were gone in about 30-45 minutes.

I occasionally have episodes while on it, but I am narrowing those down to certain foods.  Overall, I have no more cramping or diarrhea as long as I remember to take it.  I just wish it came in a once or twice daily form.

Since I have been taking this medication, the cramps and abdominal pains have subsided, yet this is the third day of taking it and the urgency is still kind of there.  Otherwise I am so thankful to have a knowlegdable doctor to know the symptons and prescribe a good drug.  Highly recommend

I dont use it everyday, just when I need it or before I eat a meal I know will give me troubles. I take between 1 and 4 25mg per day when needed. No real side effects except for a little dizziness when I take a lot. For years I was told there was no medication to help me. Very happy.

Irritable Colon	matth, 25-34 Male  (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	25-34	10/22/2008 10:11:32 AM	I was given this prescription by my gastroenterologist when Levsin no longer stopped my symptoms.  Bentyl is stronger and more effective, however there are more side effects than with Levsin.  The main downsides to this drug (in my opinion) is that can make you pretty foggy, and like most drugs of it's class must be taken four times a day to be effective.  Putting the side effects aside, I'm in much less pain than I used to be, so I will continue to take it.

It does help greatly with the cramping and pain, especially if I'm taking it for a mild flare-up instead of the dreaded prednisone.  I have been on this higher dose, taking it 4 times a day, for about 4 months.  It makes me feel so dopey and sleepy.  Am going to see if my doctor will reduce dose.

Finally I went into the ER and the found it was Gastritis.  They gave me this medicine and a GI coctail.  I have to say that since I have been on this medicine I have been feeling much better.  2 thumbsup to the person who invented this drug!
