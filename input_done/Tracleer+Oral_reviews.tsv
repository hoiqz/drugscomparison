I am taking 125 mgs.Started at 62.5  mgs. I have been on oxygen for 12 yrs. Am  now at 6 liters - 24/7. I'm in my third year of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. I believe the medication has helped me. I can walk more and longer. I've had headaches, flushing, fever like feelings, coughing, sinus like problems. I  have my liver tested every month,so far so good. I also have asthma and am on allergy shots. Some of my problems could be related to the asthma. Over all I beleive this medication will prolong my life span.
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension	acain, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3		25-34	5/14/2011 3:31:41 AM	I've been on this medication for about 5 going on 6 months now in the first month i had headaches but they stopped. about half way thru the second month i started getting head rushes every time i stood up and if going from sitting on the floor to standing i would have to do it in stages or i would have fainted however this has now also stopped.  Was reading another post that mentioned heartburn...I too have been getting way more heartburn then before and also a lot more gas causing burps. The pills seemed to be doing more for my breathing in the the first 2 or 3 months and i feel as though they have lost some effectiveness however i could have just forgotten how much worse my breathing really was before am still hopeful for a bit more improvement of symptoms as the Doc said it may take up to 8+ months for full effectiveness of this treatment. overall i have to say its has made activities easier to accomplish.

My doctors convinced me I needed to take it.  After about two months, I feel much stronger over all, and I do not get short of breath as quickly.  I can do things it was very hard to do before.

Am on oxygen 24/7, which is awkward and uncomfortable.  Have had no good effects from Tracleer - it could be progression of disease but I have gotten progressively worse.  Not a lot of side effects and liver tests are good.  Have some new joint pain but not sure if it is a side effect.  Overall very disappointed in results.
