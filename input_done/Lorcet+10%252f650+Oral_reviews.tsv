Sometimes the pain is tolerable and other times the pain has been severe. I have noticed and learned over the years to take this med RIGHT when I START felling the pain that is 8 or over on a scale from 1 to 10. And this med works great. However, If I wait to take this med until the pain is severe, the med is not as effective, and I'll will have to take another one in 30 min. to a hr. just to get the pain under control again. Also, this med does sometimes cause constipation. I use and recommend vegetable laxative from walmart. It works great and it's natural. Also, I take some extra virgin olive oil and dip it in whole wheat bread, and that works great also. I hopes this helps.

This is the BEST med I have been prescribed to keep the pain level under control and allow me to be a single mom, working and going to school. Because of my age I was told surgery was not an option until now and have had to suffer..I will finally be having surgery next week to remove disks in my neck!

Now the lower back is almost gone and SI Joint pain totally gone. The only thing I don't like is the days that I have to drive I don't take it until I get home. so I'm in pain when I away from home. It works great on my mirgrane headaches as a added bonus.

When I had the surgery the Dr. didn't fix my heniated disc just removed fragments of the disc that broke off.  Lorcet seems to work well for my post-op pain.  Because the surgeon didn't fix my herniated disc I will probably remain on this medication for some time. Would prefer percocet but it is difficult to get for long-term chronic use.  Going to the Dr. once a month to get script isnt feesible.  It is nice to finally have a medication almost as effective that you don't have to jump thru hoops to get

Pain	ampm3, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	11/12/2008 7:06:36 PM	I have sever back pain---two back surgeries and cannot have any more.I have several congenitive, progressive back diseases. For 21/2 years I have been on Oxycontin which,for me, works better. However, it is difficult because you must get a new prescription every month, it cannot be called in or faxed in to the pharmacy and my doctor has to get insurance authorization because of the dosage I take--40mg 9 pills per day) So on several occasions, I have subsituted this drug (Lorcet 10650)when I cannot get Oxycontin on a timely basis. It relieves my back pain but I have to take Ibruprophen 800mg with it. I had to take this with the Oxycontin as well. This drug has three side effects which make me not use it all the time. First, I do have trouble sleeping, although I take another drug for insomnia which has always worked effectively. Secondly, this medication gives me intense hot sweats--I feel like I am burning up. This will last for about 20 minutes. But then the sweats will return periodically all day and all night long. This intense heat is usually more prevalent at night. I also lose weight very quickly--about 8 lbs. in four days. Therefore, it makes me week.I wish I could take this instead of the oxycontin because it is much easier to get (just like a regular prescription) and it is cheaper because I am given the generic form (hydrocodone/APAP 10650 tab), however the side affects are hard for me to deal with. However, I may have to stick with this medicine because of the ease of getting it (refills, call in to pharmacy, fax in, no insurance authorization).

Overall it has worked well,but beware this drug IS ADDICTIVE! so take the smallest effective dose and make sure this is the right medicine for you.

Doctors have put me on a number of medications for back related problems over the last 3 years. Lorcet 10/650 seemed to be about the only thing that would take the pain away but now I'm afraid that I have built up such a tolerance to it that it just doesn't have the same effectiveness. I have done quite a bit of research on this medication and it has been stated that this very well can happen. My back pain will more that likely never go away so it scares me that this drugs is starting to lose its effectiveness. Where do I go from here? Morphine!?!? No way!
