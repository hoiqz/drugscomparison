Very effective on the first day to now - over 6 months later. I generally only need 1 a day and it fixed the problem. If its a bad day I'll take 2 - 12hr apart.

Gave urine for lab at Dr's office. They gave me this 3 x day until lab results in. This drug works great for the frequency issue (6 x night) and relieved the irritation feeling. However, it gave me significant gastro/stomach issues after about the 4th dose.
