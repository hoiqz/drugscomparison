Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood	Amy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/2/2012 3:03:56 PM	I'm on an anti psychotic shot called Invega Sustenna and because of it my prolactin levels were at 153 causing missed periods, lactation and weight gain. I started on 1.25 mgs for 2 weeks and about a week ago I started on 2.5 mgs. I just got my first period in 7 months. My lactation has also decreased. When I went in a week ago my level was only down to about 130 but I'm assuming it's dropped a lot after being on one full pill a week seeing as I got my period. I never thought I'd be so happy to get my period. I haven't noticed any weight loss yet but am hoping. I have noticed I am less hungry after taking my pill in the morning. I read about horrible side effects but have had none besides a bit of head rush when standing up sometimes. Nothing annoying or serious and I don't know if it's related but am assuming so. This medicine has been wonderful. I'm curious to know what my level is at now.

I also experience stuffiness at night.  Overall I am very pleased. I use to have breast milk and my menstrual periods were absent.  I happy to say my menstrual cycle has returned normal.  I am not sure what my prolactin level is now but when I was first diagnosed it was 79 and kept increasing to 95.  I know it is lowered because my symptoms of elevated prolactin has decrease.
Prolactin Excreting Tumor of the Pituitary Gland	Mae, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/24/2011 2:20:47 AM	I have been on this drug since 2000 when I was diagnosed for absence of periods for six months.  Prolactin level was 198 but dropped to 40 after 3 months, and my period resumed after 2 weeks at 2.5mg. I am currently taking 5mg daily because prolactin rised to 98 in 2007, but leveled off at 10 since then.  My only concern is the long term effects of taking this drug on my body.  I tried to wean myself off of it, but the prolactin levels rose immediately and I had to go back on it.  Any similar comments?

Took 1.5mg at night and woke up early with severe migraines. Dr. says this cannot be from the med, but I've read too many similar accounts. Different Dr. prescribed Dostinex, but I haven't started it yet.

I started taking the first week only half a pill at night. The first few nights I took with food at dinner and experienced dizziness, nausea, and was extremly tired and drowsy. After about 3-4 nights the other side effects went away and I only expereinced the drowsiness. Then after 1 week I began taking half a pill in the morning in addition to the half a pill at night. I'm on my second month and don't expereince the side effects anymore. Before treatment my prolactin level was mildly elevated at 48 and after taking the med for 1 month my bloodwork showed that my level went down to 9 (anything below 23 is considered normal). Now I am playing the waiting game to see when menstruation will return.

I have no choice of medication other than these 2. Anyone out there with similar side effects?If so how did you manage it?I have no kids and wanted to have as soon as possible.

Absence of Menstrual Periods	bee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	5/2/2010 2:50:29 AM	I had been on birth control for years to regulate my period and decided to stop taking the pill due to adverse effects.  I had one period in 10 months and decided to see my OB.  We ran several tests and found I had a mildly elevated prolactin level (mid 40s or so?).  It was suggested I do an MRI to determine the size of the prolactinoma.  When the MRI came back with no sign of a prolactinoma, I decided to try the bromocriptine anyway.  Three weeks after taking half a pill twice a day, I got my period.  Must admit the Bromocriptine made me extremely drousy.  Additionally, I woke up with occasional headaches and dry mouth.  Staying hydrated definately helps.  I always sleep with a bottle of water on the nightstand.    
Prolactin Excreting Tumor of the Pituitary Gland	Niki C, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/29/2010 10:43:02 PM	I started missing periods without any explanation. Several tests were done, but nothing could be found. Finally, one doctor got a hunch and checked my prolactin level. It was 110. MRI confirmed a macro pituitary adenoma. Original dimensions were 2.4cm x 2.2cm x 1.8cm. There was talk of surgery many times. We tried another drug, Dostinex, but the side effects were too much. My doctor then put me on Bromocriptine 2.5mg. My prolactin level dropped immediately. Six months after starting it, my prolactin level was at 7.8. A year into treatment, it was 6.4. The tumor took a little more time to shrink. Two years and two months after being diagnosed, an MRI showed the tumor as being less than a 1/2 cm in diameter and dying. This drug was very effective. It kept me from having to have a surgery. I AM VERY HAPPY. I do still have to take it to keep my prolactin level down, but it is a smaller dose now.

Most people state they go away, but the severe fatigue is the worst for me. I have had o stop &amp; restart med several times, and the longer i take it, a new set of side effects arise. I wondered, has anyone else suffered from complete blockage of sinus. I take my rx @ nite , but wake up after only a couple hours of sleep gasping for air. My nose becomes completely stopped up, and I'm so tired I have to concentrate to breathe through my mouth( which leads to nasty sore throat). I take a 2nd rx to help with the fatigue, but am really at my wits end with these side effects of parodel. Dostinex gave my migraines so no luck there. Does anyone have similar occurances &amp; what can I do about them?

This med has caused me to have mild nausea, vomiting, headache, and weight loss. For me the medicine is working slowly but hopefully in three months it will go down a little bit more. I am eagered to have children.

Did not have a period for 2 months. Finally in May called the gyno and had some bloodwork done. FOund out that i had a prolactin level of 120. I had an MRI done and found out that i had a 4.5 mm microademia on my pitutary gland. So they refered me to an endocrinologist. He put me on 5 mg a day. One month later my levels dropped from 124 to a 19. That first month on the drug i was moodier than ever. All my emotions were magnified. Bloating, didn't feel good. I usually took it with orange juice that seems to help my stomach. One month after that my levels are still a 19. So my doc increased the dosage to a 7.5 everyday. My moods were going back to normal but i'm getting the symptoms back. Hopefully this higher dosage my body will take less time to adjust to it and my period will restart from it.

It took approx. 7 months and blood work every other month before my Dr. found the correct dose for me, since that time and 4 months later I no longer have any symptoms caused by the tumor.  I have not experienced any side effects from the medication. I am due for a repeat MRI next month to see if the tumors size has decreased. I only wonder what is next because everything I have read about Bromocriptine indicates that is only used temporarily.

I had the surgery to have my tumor removed because it was not responding to the medication Dostinex. I contiuned on Dostinex after the surgery and my prolactin level has stayed slightly elevated. Around 38. My doctor chose to put me on Bromocriptine to see if my level would go down this time. I had my blood drawn today so now is the waiting game to see if the medication worked. If not I know there is a chance of having the Gamma Knife procedure. Has anyone else had this? I know there are very few places that perform it in the US. I will give an update soon of how the Bromocriptine affected my prolactin level. I have not experienced many bad side effects. Mainly nausea when i wake up in the mornings.

I always experience at least three or four of the symptoms at the same time and if I miss a dose, I'm like a junky on drugs looking for my next hit! So I guess i'm hooked!!!When I take my missed dose, I feel somewhat better, that's until all the side effects start to kick in.

I was diagnosed with a micropituitary adenoma when I was 19 and prescribed 2.5 mg - for the first 6 months or so I took this several times a day - after that, just once a day.  I was never told to take this with food - figured that out on my own.  Now it at least shows up on my presciption bottles!  One side effect that I did have was while in college.  At that time I did not have health insurance and the medicine was fairly expensive for a college student, so I tended to not take it as regularly as I should have.  I would have fainting spells, that were never attributed to the meds.  However, since I have been financially stable with health insurance and take the medicine every night before bed, I haven't had any issues for 15 years.

The only time I was sick was on the second day. Still no period though (not that I really want it back!) I can't sleep worth anything - not sure if that's due to the medication or not. Nonetheless, it has stopped the physical symptoms I was having.

Still sleeplessness, achyness, fatigue, stuffiness (right after I take the pill), headaches and ocassional dizziness and vomiting. BUT, the good news is I had my first &quot;normal&quot; mentrual cycle in 9 months! I guess that means the drug is working. We'll see if it continues to happen. I'll see my doctor next week to check my prolactin levels. My HG hormone is now low too, not sure what that means.I take this drug at night, after a sleeping pill and that seems to help me sleep through some of the symptoms.

My only problem with this drug is I have been trying to get pregnant for over a month and nothing is happening. I have not seen my period since trying to conceive but pregnancy test is negative. I will give an update next month. Other than not getting pregnant, the drug worked well in returning my menstrua cycle.

I currently take 7.5 mg and my prolactin levels have been around 30.  I had the surgery in 1999 and was back on the bromocriptine within 2 months.  I often feel nauseaus throughout the day and dizzy.  I have learned to eat just before bed and take an acid reducer daily to try and limit vomitting.  I have also had problems with my blood pressure dropping low and often feeling cold.  Lately I have been noticing that even taking the 7.5 I have been lactating.  I am not sure if anyone has taken this drug for a while and then had it stop working but I am noticing a lot of the prolactinoma symptoms returning?  I will see my endocrinologist next month and will find out more then.  I have spent a lot of time trying to figure out the best way to take this medication and not struggle with the side effects and the best thing I do is take it right after eating and just before I go to bed so that I seem to sleep through the worst of it.  I have become so dizzy I become faint if I take it during the day so I do take all 7.5 mg at one time.

I began to have fainting spells.  It was determined that this medication was the cause of the fainting spells.  It lowered my prolactin 15 points in a 6 month period.  I began taking a different drug (Dostinex) and am doing so much better. My prolactin levels are almost where they should be.  This is after only 3 months of being on the Dostinex!
