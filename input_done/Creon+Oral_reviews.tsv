Other	Richoe, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	55-64	7/27/2012 3:30:43 PM	I have ben taking Creon for a couple of onths due to inability to gain weight following Whipple procedure, as well as abdominal pain.  I take 24000 units with each meal.  I have been having abdominal discomfort for the past two eeeks, diarrhea at times and constipation at other times.  The bowel excreted has a terrible odor. I have not gained any weight.  I am tempted to discontinue the creon, but will wait to see my doctor next week before doing anything.
Pancreas Organ Failure	William, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	5/28/2012 11:15:09 AM	I have suffered with acute pancreatitus on 4 occasions resulting in hospitalisation. This was initially caused by excess alcohol. I now suffer with chronic pancreatitus and have had 3 spells in hospital. Last year I had sever pain throughout my abdomin which resulted in an extended stay in hospital. For the past year I have not had any alcohol resulting in a remarkable easing in the pain side. Before my stint in hospital I was taking opiates in tablet and liquid form as well as paracetamol and in hospital changed to fentanyl patches rated at 50mcg/hr. I take Creon oral in the 10000 capsules. I have found that taking 2 with meals and 1 with snacks works well. I also take 1 with the drink supplements. I have now stopped using the fentanyl patches and seem to control the pain with just paracetamol and oramorph at night. I have also increased my weight from the 9 stone average to some 11 stone. I am suffering with joint pain which is currently being investigated. Without the creon I believe I would not be able to digest my food as prior to using this RX I had difficulty in eating and so establishing and maintaining a sensible weight.

Several procedures later I am getting better. I take 4 of the 2400 capsules with meals and 2 with snacks. It seems the larger dose has helped and kept me almost pain free in what's left of my pancreas.
Pancreas Organ Failure	kris-10, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	3/29/2012 12:42:40 PM	I am taking this Creon b/c I have pancreatic insufficiency brought on by alcohol abuse.  I don't seem to fit the profile as most of you, but the instructions for this RX are to take it with food (BEFORE) you eat.  Often, I skip meals because I also have acid reflux and nausea and I find myself repulsed by many foods.  I use nutritional shakes to keep my nutrition up, but is Creon helping me if I don't eat, or just drink a nutritional shake?
Pancreas Organ Failure	jingle, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	65-74	12/10/2011 7:30:20 PM	I had a Whipples Resection &amp; am unable to digest anything without Creon. This works well but it is very hard to judge the amount needed with meals &amp; when dosage incorrect then stools very soft &amp; oh so smelly as is the wind. Still without it I would be in BIG trouble so yes it is a great lifeline for me.
Other	whiskers1, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	2/13/2011 7:52:11 PM	As far as digesting foods it works fine. My problem following bipass surgery, I was found to have, hepatic biliary disease. The appropriate meds where ordered. then when speaking with the M.D., about another disorder I have which require narcotic tx. He ordered the creon. I think he misunderstood, I was not having any problems with constapation, but bouts of diarrhea. Now my stools are so soft it's difficult to defecate. I was wandering if I could add metamucil to manage this problem? I will talk to my Doctor at my next visit because, of the multiple disorders I have but feel this might be the answere I need at the correct dosage. I like to see what others think about my problem, perhaps they are having the same problem. Thank you.

Otherwise it doesn't work.  Biggest problem I have is paying for it
