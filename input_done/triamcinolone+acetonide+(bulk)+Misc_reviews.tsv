Other	Iam, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/10/2012 12:22:58 PM	I have used TA for cold sores/cracks on the edges of my mouth and it works great.  I have also used it in moist/fungal areas and it also works great there.  I just started using it around the back of my ears as I have some type of irritation that will not go away.  It is very soothing in the area, however, I don't know yet if it will solve the problem.

Unfortunately the rash is red, spreading, and itches like crazy.  It appeared to be going away (side effect is that is has dicolored my skin, actually making the skin lighter that the surrounding area which is terrible on a fair skinned black person), but then it came back with a vengence.  I'm not going back to my Primary Care giver, but making an appt. w/ a Dermatologist - I need a cure and fast!

Works like a miracle.  You just use it like you would a corticosteroid cream or antifungal cream.  My face is consistently free of any redness or itching for the first time in about a decade.  It seems also to treat the flaking that accompanies the outbreaks.  Good idea to try...

It doesn't cure it, but it helps when nothing else has.
Other	EELZIE, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	45-54	7/23/2008 5:05:42 AM	I had an allergic reaction to a natural oil and I was given this drug by my doctor. It work almost instantly, but it was the side effects that did me in. I had infected bumps, like boils on my neck. It is very painful. I have had these things for a week now. I had to go into let the doctor cut them open and drain all four of them. I am on antibiotics. If you can get another drug in the place of this one PLEASE DO SO.
