Cough	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	2/12/2012 8:44:35 PM	Gave Delsym to my 7 yr old grandson. It did not help his cough, which the doctor confirmed the day I began using this drug as alergy/sinus related. It wired him so badly that he has not slept for over 24 hours. We are hoping for a good night sleep tonight. His cough was not supressed. Honey, tea and warm apple juice worked better than this drug!

Cough	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	8/25/2011 3:26:17 PM	I took Mucinex DM and it has this ingredient in it. I guess I am sensitive to it and had a completely horrible night/day. It wired me, dialated eyes, felt isolated, couldn't function, motor skills delayed, nausea, upset stomach, chills, teeth clinched, basically felt like I was poisoned. Worst feeling of my life and I only took one dose (60mg). Be careful!
Cough	cajun2core, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	45-54	3/15/2011 4:13:51 PM	I took it for a cough related to sinusitus.  If codeine based cough syrups give you the hiccups, chances are this will too.  It did for me.

Cough	mommyr, 7-12 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	3	1	Female	7-12	2/1/2010 10:04:58 AM	I gave this to both my kids while they were sick and the next day was aweful. They were off the charts hyper and they are usually calm children. It's like they were on speed and totally different children. It helped there cough, but for me wasn't worth the side effects. 
Cough	daishia22, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	10/12/2009 4:50:50 PM	This medication works well, but tastes horrible. I was taking it to treat a cough from a small virus (most likely a cold). The first night I started taking it I sweated my fever out. However, instead of taking teaspoons, I was taking tablespoons(on accident). Because of this &quot;overdosage&quot;, I became severely drowsy, loss my appetite and felt completely out of it. Overall, the medication works well, but works best when taken properly!
Cough	ntngale23, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	11/3/2008 12:29:03 AM	It works well for my 4 year old, especially at night. I tried it a few times, and it works. Tastes okay. If my child likes the taste, adults should tolarate the taste too.
