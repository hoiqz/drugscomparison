Been taking Femera since then and have just 2 more months to go. I am so grateful that the medication is available - I'm sure it has helped to prevent a recurrence but at what cost to my general health. Aches and pains everywhere (mainly joints and lower back), depression, pins and needles, weight gain, loss of libido. I will be celebrating at the end of July.

I started taking Femara after radiation.  After six months, the joint pain was hell, shooting pains in my feet at night (both tops and bottoms of feet) Inability to sleep because of the shooting pains in feet.  Depression, dry mouth.  After sitting at work, pain in feet when getting up to walk.  Oncologist suggested trying Arimidex.  After one month, it was worse than Femara.  Dizziness, headache and still severe joint pain and inability to sleep.  I think I am going to discontinue all of these types of drugs and take my chances.  My quality of life is terrible with this drug.  Even excercising does not help enough.  Cancer is hell but so is this drug.  I don't think I can do it for five years.  And I do not want to take more drugs to counteract the side effects of another.  I am 68 and never had any health problems until I was diagnosed with cancer.

I am experiencing most all of the side effects Femara offers, For example, muscle spasms and muscle contractions in right leg; constant aches/pains/disconfort in lower back, thighs and leg; hair loss from head and vagina; insomnia; minimal sexual desire;vaginal dryness; forgetfulness/memory loss; bloating, and mood swings.Initially, I started out on Arimidex and due to similar side effects mentioned above, I switched to Femara.Well, I tolerate Femara because I want to live and there is nothing else. I can only hope and pray that I am able to continue this for the next 4 years.

Lots of bone, joint pain, weight gain hard to lose, became prediabetic, hypothyroid, tired all the time, walk like I am 100 yo, I have had some falls, have osteopenia keeping it stable at -2 with TriboronPlus, use vagifem but no sex drive, no relations the past two years, blurry eyes, cataracts from Tamoxifen I took for 5 yrs previously, can't wait to stop the med but will I still feel the same? Swimming and walking helps me keep going.  Hoping I don't have to take anything else after this but I'll worry if I get the ca again.  I'll just have to try thinking positively.  My husband is in great shape and acts like a man of 40 and I act like a person of 100.  I should go on the &quot;cancer&quot; diet which works, I just need self discipline...no sugar, no caffeine, no white products, no red meat, no dairy but eat organicly and do some juicing with fresh organics.  I did that 10 years ago when I got diagnosed after lumpectomy and radiation and lost 50 lbs just trying to eat healthy, not trying to lose weight, but that was before Letrozole.  Wishing everyone great health and to be cancer free!!!

I started taking Femara after radiation.  For the past two years I have had mild joint and muscle pain.  Two weeks ago I woke up with moderate to severe arthralgia and muscle pain.  The bottoms of my feet hurt. I have been off the medication for four days with slight relief.  The symptoms seem to be slowly subsiding.  I have f/u tests with my oncologist ruling out recurrence of cancer. This drug is powerful and mean!  I do not want to go back on it.  I am hoping these symptoms go away and there is not permanent damage done...I am grateful my cancer was treatable but the treatment is very rough!

I started taking arimidex along with the radiation and had so many side effects I was switched to Femara. On Femara I've had hot flashes, weight gain, very little energy, no sex drive,and sleeping problems, but the biggest problem is my breathing.   I was diagnosed with asthma in 2008 and since the lumpectomy, radiation and medication I've had MANY more breathing problems.  I've not found breathing issues listed as side effects but wondered if there can be a connection.

In 2010 a lot of joint pain in hips and legs. hot falshes very often in the day and at night. vaginal dryness. and weight gain. I now found out I have osteoprisis. I want to stop taking Femara because I have had no of this before taking this drug.  What are the risks of not taking Femara for the remainder of the next 2 years?

I first had the small tumor removed and within two months decided to have a lateral mascectomy.  I chose not to have radiation   Six months after my second surgery I started the chemo and have been on Femara since.  I found that if I take it before bed, my symptoms are less noticable.  If I take it earlier, I am so sore and achy that I can hardly move.  I also take a powdered vitamin which seems to help.  I try to work out on a treadmill or exercise bike daily. I have spent time hiking and mountain climbing.  The more active I am the better I feel.  I will not let the side effects of this medication rule my life,  I will find whatever it takes to beat it.

Went through chemotherapy and radiation therapy until Feb. 2011 and has been on Femara since then. In the first 6 months, the side effects were bearable. Then I began to feel depressed. My family doctor prescribed me with &quot;Sertima&quot; which helped a lot. Then the bone pain got worse, insomia, frizzy mind and bad memory. I tried to exercise but could not last and I lost interest in doing many things because I couldn't focus. I began to gain weight. My knees, neck and shoulders pain got worse especially in the morning when I got up. I went to Thailand for vacation with my family last month and found that I had just about the same energy as my 85 years old dad who is 30 years older than me. I took 1,200mg calcium with D3 and  Gluocosamie with no improvement. I was desperate and wondered how I could continue the pill for another 4 years. Then a friend who is also a breast cancer survivor told me to try taking &quot;Magnesium&quot;. She said calcium has stiffen our blood artery and joints while magnesium can help to soften it. It should be taken in 2:1 ratio with Calcium. I tried to take two 250mg magnesium. In just one day, I felt the knees and shoulder pain lessen by 40%. I checked out &quot;magnesium&quot; on WebMD and found that it can help with insomnia, constipation, leg cramps, headache...etc. Now I have more energy, less bone pain and sleep better. My doctor said as long as it helps me, it doesn't hurt to take it. I hope this information can help others. I went for my annual examination last week and I am cleared of cancer.

Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Mo, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	65-74	1/2/2012 8:52:19 PM	I was diag 4/08 w/stage II hormone receptor positive breast cancer; I had a lumpectomy, followed by 6 months of 3 different chemos and 37 days of radiation. 2/1/09 My Dr. prescribed Aromasin, extreme joint pain; then Aromostat, joint pain no better and after 4 months my Dr switched me to Femara. The joint pain was there but not as severe. The neuropathy is very bad and getting worse and I've been blaming it on the Taxol (the 3rd chemo)however, after reading other reviews it may be the Femara. I have many side effects - can't sleep, weight gain, ache in every joint, thin hair, etc.  The soles of the feet hurt and I cannot walk very far before my hips and legs ache very badly. I'm going to try the generic of Femara (Letrozole) this week, only because I can no longer afford the Femara. My insurance carrier doubled the cost of my co-pay this year (several hundred dollars for a 90 day supply). If I cannot tolerate the generic (only $21. for a 90 day supply) then I will stop using the drug. I was &quot;told&quot; that Letrozole (Femara generic) is exactly the same; but some reviews say otherwise.  I don't want the BC to re-occure but living with pain every minute of the day is not fun either.

I had a very small tumor in my left breast - ductal insitu.  I had the recommended chemo&amp; radiation &amp; now taking Femara (actually, she has given me the okay to take the generic). I ballooned in my weight - gained &amp; can't seem to lose much. I developed hyperthyroidism &amp; a year ago ablated my thyroid so now am taking synthroid(another medication that I believe is making me gain weight).  Femara is very expensive - I have noticed aches/pains, back pain, high &amp; low back, is the worst.  I find myself not being able to finish my dishes at the sink at one time.  I have to stop &amp; bend/stretch out my back.. sit down &amp; rest until the pain subsides, then go back to it.  My eyes have blurred I believe since starting this med, also.  There for awhile, it was affecting my fingers being painful - I type for a living, so that was a no go.  My Dr. took me off briefly &amp; then put me on something else but I couldn't take that. .so back on Femara.  I have 1 yr to go - hoping I get back what I feel I have lost - including energy &amp; some kind of sexual desire..  I have NONE and I'm exhausted very easily.  I am 54 &amp; feel 74 or 80 ..  tired out.. no oomph.  I guess if it does the main job, it's worth the angst but I will be glad to get off the stuff &amp; see how I feel then.

My doctor switched me to Arimedex as he thought it was more effective but I had severe joint pain to the point I could hardly walk and when taken off it I had an allergic reaction. I have been on Femara for 5 years and until recently no problems. I thought my insomnia was just me and not the drug. I recently had a dizzy spell and could not walk for a day as I could not put any weight on my knees. The doctor told me to stop the drug and I already feel better. Do not know what I can do next.

Started on famara,right after radiation was complete. Each month has gotten worse with joint,muscle pain. Don't have hot flashes, have major sweats!! Dr put me on Gabapentin to help with skin burning from sweating so much. It has help with the buning, but not sweats. Don't sleep well, maybe 3-4 hrs. How one &quot;LITTLE&quot; pill can cause so much!! It seems like I gain weight from breathing air. I walk, ride my bike everyday. Watch my diet. Nothing works. Don't know if I can take femara for 5 yrs?? I'm so misrable. I'm greatful that I don't work anymore,because I don't think I could taking Femara .

Stage 3.  Went thru 8 bouts of chemo.  Was on fermara for 16 months, got cancer in the left breast, which my (second opinion) doctor told me was cause by the fermara.  Please check with your doctor if you are taking fermara and see what he tells you.  The info on fermara tells you it can cause cancer but not which types.  The worst experience of my lift.  Worse then being toid I had cancer.  Joint pain, hot flashes, insomnia (sometimes awake for up to 36 hours), vision trouble (some days I couldn't drive to work), shakes, axiety attachs.  Side effects do not start till I was on fermara for a while, just kept getting worse.  Some days I could not get out of bed without feeling pain.

The side effects have caused me to have numerous unneeded tests to rule out actual medical problems that actually were only severe Femara side effects.  I quit taking it after 2 years because the pain and other side effects outweighed any benefit.  Side effects linger on long after you stop taking it.  Good luck and be prepared for the worst.  Breast cancer is easier to deal with than Femara.

I take it before I go to bed at night.  I can't rate the effectiveness because only time will tell if it keeps my breast cancer from recurring.  I had read several horrible reviews of this med., and had myself terrified of taking this, but I have been pleasantly surprised that I have had no reaction that is obvious to me.

When I stand up after sitting awhile, my right hip and both feet-especially the bottoms of my feet--hurt; also don't sleep well, decreased libido, but all of this is tolerable for a 27% decreased chance of BC recurrence! I recently changed to taking Femara in the evening, that seems to be helping with the joint pain. Now that it is generic, I'm paying $20 for a 90-day supply. Ladies with negative experiences are probably more likely to comment, so I just wanted to say the really bad side effects don't happen to everybody.
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	55-64	10/10/2011 12:34:00 AM	I was diagnosed in November 2008. Bottom line was Stage 2, mastectomy and chemo. I started on Tamoxifen in May 2009. A little over a year later my oncologist switched me to Femara. Sleep issues, hot flashes, weight gain, and joint pain, minor, at first. Have been on it almost a year and a half. The last few months have been horrible. Not able to sleep without medication, terrible joint pain first thing in the morning and after any sitting or laying down, frequent hot flashes, and weight gain in spite of increased exercise. A couple of weeks ago I heard about someone 70 years old who went off Femara and the side effects were mostly gone after a couple of weeks. I called my doctor, he allowed me to go off the meds for a month and then we're going to try one of the other aromatase inhibitors. After only one week my joint pain is easing up, hot flashes have diminished. No weight loss yet but I'm working out and trying to eat better. Still not sleeping at night without meds. But hoping that will change over time. I'm hoping that the next drug won't be so bad.

Had a lumpectomy followed by 6 1/2 weeks of radiation.  The Oncotype DX test was done and now I take Femara (or now the generic). The following Feb( 2010) I had a complete hysterectomy.  I have had problems with joint pain, sleeplessness, hot flashes, and fatigue.  It has been relieved somewhat by adding Cymbalta to my treatment along with recently a low dose blood pressure med at night to help ease the hot flashes.  I work out and eat mostly healthly except for the diet cokes (my only vice) and now I seem to be craving sweets!  I cannot lose weight and I feel I am losing more hair that normal. The other problem I have had is all of my rings have become too tight and I have had to have some stretched and some reset.  I feel very fortunate and blessed to have the medication to take and feel guilty about complaining.  I have no sex drive and my husband has been so understanding, but I hate what it is doing to my life. I used to work in the yard and my house was perfect.  Now it take forever to acomplish the things I want to do.

I have taken Femara over 2 years and the negative effects started to develope in 3 months.  I have horrible joint pain along with numerous other side effects, dizziness, insomnia, genital fisures, etc.  According to the Physicians Desk Reference (PDR) 94.4% of patients taking Femara suffer side effects.  I have 15 of the 20 or more negative effects listed.  My quality of life is gone.  I would rather take the very small chance of return of cancer than live without any quality.  I have endured numerous unneeded medical tests to rule out medical cause for my disabilities but every one found no possible explanation but Femara.  The PDR lists other cancers types resulting in patients taking Femara.  I have increased bone loss of over 10% in a 17 month period and now have serious osteoporosis.  Femara isn't a cure - it's a curse that's extremely expensive.

MRM right breast, radical left breast.   From the beginning, I have had a lot of joint pain.  I am 63 and wish I could feel as good as I used to.  I work full time and, after sitting for long periods of time, I notice how my lower back and hips hurt when I get up to walk, plus I have been falling more in the last 6 months, but not sure if this is causing that or not.  I have been taking Femara (Letrozole) for 1 year and was told I would need to take it for 5 years.  IBC is very aggressive so anything that will help me to continue with living, I'm up for.

I would say I had mild side effects compared to those mentioned above.I took tamoxifen for 5 yrs which affected my rectum terribly. Femara 5yrs. I have been off about a mth. I have to admit of having more energy.Less hip pain. I exercise regularly.Massage.If can't sleep I take 1/4 of Valium it works well I don't feel groggy the next day. I feel positive. I was given 30% chance of survival. So hang in there. Be positive stop thinking about it &amp; go on with life

It has been so helpful to read others reviews.  I have mostly felt fatigue and an inability to sleep.  In the beginning I felt dizzy so my doctor told me to take the pill in the evening, which I do.  Some of my joint pains and &quot;sore feet&quot; I have attributed to &quot;old age&quot; (I'm in my 60s) but now I'm questioning if it is a side effect of femera.  I am not a pill taker (other than vitamins) and would love to stop taking the pill--but am too fearful of the consequences.  The doctor says 5 years so I have 4 more to go.  Thanks you good ladies for your input.
Cancer of the Ovary	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	9/13/2011 6:02:10 PM	I have very sore joints and muscle pain, extremely tired and nausea. Been on Femara for about 5 months. If I bump into anything or stub my toe the pain is terrible. Has anyone else taken this for ovarian cancer? I was diagnosed at Stage 3C in October 2011 but my body could not tolerate the chemotherapy (Taxol and carboplatin. Was thrown for a loop when they put me on the Femara. The tumor has shrunk and the CA125 has reduced but the side effects are very hard to take.
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Advanced Breast Cancer	Foxlairfrm, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	8/23/2011 7:35:50 AM	I have stage IV breast cancer that is in ny bones. After several months of taking Femara, the CT scans have shown no progression and my tumor markers continue to come down every month. The side effects are hard to deal with. Hot flashes, hair loss, bone and joint pain but it may be from the cancer and I have lost a tremendous amount of weight rather than gain it. That could also be from other meds. Some fatigue but not bad when taking vitamins. You should make sure your calcium and vitamin D intake is good. I can deal with the side effects if it keeps me alive!  I do wish they could find a way to decrease the side effects, it would make quality of life better but it's not intolerable. For those women that wonder if they should stop , don't!  You do not want to find you have metastasis because you didn't want to deal with side effects. It's not worth the risk!  The side effects from the 5 years of tamoxifen were worse for me.  Also, there is no reason you should have to live with the pain. Talk to your Dr, they should prescribe you something for it. If they don't, find another Dr. It's bad enough going through breast cancer, you shouldn't have pain as well. Find a good support group like breastcancer.org where women of all stages support one another and they have professionals there to answer questions. It's wonderful. Good luck ladies, God bless

I'm an active person, eat healthy, and work out.  I'm glad I found this on WEB MD where ACTUAL USERS of the drug can rate it.  Keeping my fingers crossed, and good luck to all the rest of you beautiful ladies. I'm hoping to continue enjoying life and having lots of energy.  I've got lots more living to do!

Began Femara March 2008.  Initial side effect was massive hair loss.  Oncologist said was not a side effect, yeah right, I would brush and wash my hair and handfuls would come out.  Finally he said &quot;it IS a chemo class drug&quot; and when my body adjusts to the medicine it would stop.  It has.  I do not know how effective it is, I'm cancer free to my knowledge.  My Oncologist does NOT do any blood testing or scans, says Oncology Society does not recommend... Hmmm.  I have no hot flashes, never did, I DO have joint and bone pain, some days it's unbearable but I soldier through it.  What else is there to do?  I have not experienced any of the other side effects others talk about.  I've never really attributed the joint and bone pain to the med.  Maybe I should.  There is NOW a GENERIC form of Femara.  I refilled last week and was given it.  I have not used it yet, I hope it is as effective as Femara itself.  I am curious is there anyone out there that has completed the five year course and if so, how are you doing now?  Still cancer free?  My Oncologist says he will take me off at five years and there is nothing else to follow up with it.  Don't worry about it now, but when the five year day comes, I will be concerned.  Positive attitude and a supportive husband has helped tremendously.  Never MISSES an appointment with me.I traveled this journey never alone and I am blessed.

From the lack of sleeping properly, the loss of hair, the dry skin, the sagging breast, etc. - it may help reoccurences, but at what cost.  Is this the best there is?  Does anybody know the % rate for taking the drugs vs. taking nothing after lumpectomy + radiation?  Thank you for advice.

It is the only treatment I am receiving for the estrogen receptor positive advanced breast cancer I was diagnosed with following gall bladder surgery.  So far it has reduced my tumor markers from 284 to 84 is just 3 months.  The side effects make me feel 10 years older. I have joint pain in my knees, ankles and wrists.  I am very stiff and achy if I sit too long (30 minutes) and I have severe fatigue.  My oncologist says it is not caused by the Femara, but after reading all the posts on side effects, I disagree.  I did not feel this way prior to taking this drug.  I would not even know I have breast cancer if it were not for the biopsy taken during my gall bladder surgery. Thank you ladies for posting your experiences it has helped my a lot.

Two lumpectomies and radiation, then began Femara eight months ago. Primary issue is breast pain which I do not see in other posts. Pain began after about six months. Med onc suggested I go off for several weeks - pain went away. With what I know of Tamoxifen, Arimadex, etc, what do I do now? Four more years+ to go with all the additional side effects? Is there any organization that truly cares what happens to women who have cancer?

However I have been takin Med. for approx. 18 months.  I have had bone and joint pain as well as muscle pain, hot flashes, weight gain,and stay tired all the time.  Will be glad when don't have to take it anymore but will continue as would rather have these side effects than the cancer coming back.

Just over six months ago, my oncologist switched me to Femara. The joint pain in my hips and knees is constant and sometimes extremely severe. The fatigue is also constant. If it were not for my two year old grandson who lives with us and needs me desperately, I would NOT take this drug anymore, yet I have over four years to go. My oncologist assures me that my chances for a recurrence will increase greatly when I go off of the Femara. My pharmacist tells me that there is now a generic version of the drug which will decrease our costs and I'm hoping the side effects may decrease as well. Is this drug effective for any of us? Who knows? Ibuprophen helps the pain, but it doesn't eliminate it. I have found swimming to be the best exercise for it, although walking helps, too. However, standing for any length of time is next to impossible. Like my sister survivors, I am trying to live with my new normal.

Thank you ladies for your honesty.It is comforting to know we are not alone!

I am only 24yrs old and have been battling Endo since I was 18yrs old. This drug has saved me life compared to all the pain and misery I was in. I take this along with Norethindrone on a daily basis. I have always had an &quot;over heating&quot; issue since I was born. Consistent hot flashes whether I'm asleep or just sitting in class. Do to my over heating I have to be careful not to over exert myself, then my blood sugar drops and I get weak. I can tolerate the hot flashes with out a problem but they are bad for those not used to them. I have gotten the dizzy spells from getting out of bed to the point where i felt like my heart was about to stop. It only happened once but definitely put me in a panic. Compared to the misery the Endometriosis has put me through, I will take these side effects any day. The Endo has taken over my whole abdominal cavity and I have a massive amount of infected tissue removed including a large part of my bladder. Being that I am only 24, I cant find a doctor that will do a Hysterectomy. All I wonder is what are these drugs going to do to me in the time it takes for a Hysterectomy. This drug has definitely given me my quality of life back to an extent.

I also have depression, severe dry skin problems, severe vaginal dryness.I have been taking this medication for 3 years &amp; am trying to take it for the recommended 5 years. but the longer I take it, the side effects seem to become more severe.My concern, is that I have been told that this medication ONLY reduces my chances of recurrence by 6%.  I am not sure that all of these side effects are worth going through for only a 6% reduction in my overall Breast Cancer recurrence.I was told that this article regarding the only 6% Breast Cancer Recurrence reduction was in the Harvard Medical News Letter recently.

After two years, my arthritis has gotten increasingly painful, to the point where I can hardly use my thumb.  All my finger joints are now knobby and stiff, my spine cracks and pops when I walk, and my knees and feet hurt continuously. But my blood tests show the cancer is gone, so do I assume it's the excellent radiologist's treatment, the Femara, or the combination?  CANNOT WAIT to off of this stuff, however, I fear the damage is already done to my joints.

Took Prednisone for 10 days recently and all the aches and swelling went away. Now on a three week &quot;vacation&quot; from Femara.  Not sure I will start using it again.

Whether the reason for that has been because of Femara, I will never know.  Femera is, beyond any doubt, the worst medication I have EVER taken. Much worse than Chemo or  radiation.  Only recently, much to my embarassment (but great relief), have I realized all my agonizing pains (muscles, joints), my exeedingly extreme dehydration (dry mouth, chapped lips, terribly painful splits in my tongue), numb legs, and frightening, never ending exhaustion upon physical activity, have been caused by that small yellow pill, Femera. All my suffering has resulted in deep depression, having not only severely effected the quality of my life, but also that of my concerned famiy.  Now that I know why I've suffered so, deep in my heart, I want to discontinue Femera, so I can become normal again, but am afraid to because of the possible results.  Now that I'm aware of why I have suffered so, I intend to plan for what will be difficult days ahead, but will try to manage my activities and pain with my new knowledge and new attitude.  I'm grateful to finally understand why my body is in this crumpled condition, but live for the day when I will not have to take it anymore.

Cancer of the Ovary	SLNinTX, 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4		55-64	4/13/2011 8:16:45 PM	I have had ovarian cancer for 11 years.  I was originally diagnosed with stage 2-3 in 1999.  The first 7 years I had several reoccurances (actually, I don't think I was ever entirely in remission) which required four surgeries and 35 plus rounds of chemotherapy.  4 years ago, after another 8 rounds of chemo, the cancer was still there and spreading.  The doctor put me on Fermara and so far so good.  My PET scans have been clear.  I do have the bone and joint pain, but I also have arthritis and severe neuropathy (from the chemo), so it's hard to say what exactly it's caused from...it could be both, I guess.  In fact, all the problems I have today, i.e., bone/joint pain, neuropathy, sleep apenia, severe fatigue, weight gain, swollen ankles and feet, hair loss, etc, I had within 1-2 years of the cancer diagnosis, so all I can say is that the Fermara has probably intensified the pain in some cases but the orignal cancer treatment..(again the chemo) was where these symptoms originated.  I have learned to live with it as it beats the alternative.  Fermara appears to work and I will take it and these side effects for the rest of my life if necessary as long as I never have cancer or have to take chemotherapy again.  I am now 64 years old and hope to be around for a few more years.

Now I have resumed usage for five days and I can't stand the pain. I had built up a tolerance for it but I can no longer ignore it.  I will talk to oncologist about making a change and I am discontinuing it again today.
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Advanced Breast Cancer	Janie, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		2/28/2011 1:33:07 PM	I just went off femara after 5 years, I was one of the first to start it. Was consistently a bit achy but biggest effect was hair loss - a lot, it started the third year.  Everything was manageable, and I'm great at &quot;comb-overs&quot;, and the main thing, I am  alive with no sign of cancer.  -- and folks, that's what it's all about.  Good Luck!

Not worth even when reviewing guarantees, statistics considering ALL its side effects! not worth it.

I also had multicentric disease, which required double mastectomy followed by 8 rounds of chemo.  NONE OF THAT WAS NEARLY AS PAINFUL AS THIS FEMARA, but if it keeps the cancer away I will endure it.  As others have said, I am 48 years old but if you see me get up out of a chair and start walking you would think I'm 98 instead.

Went back on it and got severe joint pain, mainly during the night so could not sleep. Dr prescribed anti-inflammatories and drug to stop reflux.  Joint pain diminished and I started getting hot flushes, so further diminished sleep as the flushes seem more severe at night. I have always loved hot weather, hot showers etc, not I can't stand the hot weather and have tepid showers etc. My knees ache constantly and I can't sit for long periods of time as my knees seize up.  I have put on weight and I get angry and depressed.  I have been on this drug for 2 years and hate it!

Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	sherrie w., 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2		55-64	1/5/2011 11:33:43 PM	I had a lumpectomy in Jan. 07 for early stage breast cancer; no lymph node involvement.  Had six rounds of chemo and 32 radiation treatments.  My hands went numb and have been in pain since my first radiation treatment.  They are very stiff and can't make a fist.  Have been to numerous specialists, no arthritis or nervedamage - they are baffled.  They have gotten worse on Femara.  Recently my hair started falling out, especially around the hairline.  I've been on Femara for about 2 years and on Tamoxifin for 1 year and had noproblems.  Can't sleep, hands are almost non-functioning and now this latest devastating problem - severe hair loss.  I have always had twice the hair of most people and am beside myself.  I don't know what to do.  Should I continue Femara or end up bald and crippled?  It seems the Femara would have caused hair loss earlier than this.  I've been on it for two years and my hair was extremely thick and healthy.Have any of you experienced severe hair loss after two years of Femara?  I went to the doctor today for blood work to see if it's a thyroid problem.  Any advice or comments would be helpful.  I am very distraught.  Bless us all going through this treatment.

After 2 years on Femara is still have nerve, bone, joint,and muscle pain. Sleep is difficult. If the hot flashes don't wake me up the hip pain does. My blood pressure, cholesterol,and weight (20 pounds in 1 year)are up. My bone density is worse even with exercise, calcium and Vitamin D. I have difficulty with stairs. I can't take NSAIDS due to ulcers. The only thing that has improved my quality of life is an antidepresant, massage therapy, and accupuncture for the nerve pain.

After one week I felt depressed and fatigued. The doctor had me go off of it for a month and within two weeks I felt great. We eased into a half dose over one month, which created some fatigue, but it was manageable. After one month, I went on a full dose and within 10 days am back to being very depressed, negative and fatigued. At this point, I'm considering in going off it. I can't function effectively and I'm not able to actually do all the healthy activities that would benefit my health. I'm also experiencing some shortness of breath.

My feet feel pretty swollen every day.  Have some joint pain in hands also.  Having trouble sleeping.  I'm tired all the time.  I take it, though, because I'm afraid of having a recurrence.  Try to  keep busy and not think of the side effects. Have a positive attitude. Would rather take a pill a day than go through chemo and radiation again.

I do still have some of the mild side effects.  I will be done with the medication in November of 2010. I have the night sweats, constipation and some other mild side effects.  I can't wait to see if these go away. I am cancer free. Hope to stay that way.
Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	gerimouse, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	10/29/2010 6:22:59 AM	I was diagnosed with early stage BC in July, 2006.  After a lumpectomy and 9 weeks of radiation treatments I started on Femara.  After 4 years I made the decision to quit taking the drug because I just didn't want to go on anymore.  The side effects are horrific!   My mind was gone; I couldn't even remember what day it was.  And I was and still am exhausted from lack of sleep. Between the night sweats and waking up every 1 to 2 hours with severe pain what sleep I get is restless at best. I immediately gained weight and my hair started to thin overnight.   BUT THE WORST BY FAR IS THE JOINT AND MUSCLE PAIN.  I am now 62 and like others have said, I feel like 100.  Hot and cold flashes are with me day and night.  They make me crazy. I have no energy at all. There are days I dont want to get out of bed.   This last year I have experienced blurry vision and dry eyes.  I have been diagnosed with savior depression. The list of side effects just go on and on.  I have been off the femara for 4 months but the side effects are still with me.  Does anyone know if the pain will ever go away?  Please help......

I have depression, joint pain, especially my fingers, fatigue, Found taking SAM-e REALLY helps, Omega fish oils too. Taking Femara is a JOB!! Four more years to go!  Have to MAKE myself exercise, as fulltime work is about all I have in me. Just turned 60 and want more birhtdays, so I am going to continue..its not the drug ladies, its the lack of estrogen. Oncologist said sam=e is ok, so try it..get health food store formula, not the cheapy one. I felt better after the third day.  It is a metabalite of an amimo acid that is supposed to be for joint mobility,comfort and support.  It also has an effect of creating a sense of well-being.  I did a test and stopped it for awhile and got worse.  It assists neurotransmitters, and there are some drugs listed on the box that can't be mixed with it. Also should not be taken by bipolar people. With sam-e, I CAN COPE.  Good luck to all of us survivors. Caroljean

At this point I do not know the efficacy of the drug, as I haven't taken it long enough. I wish I hadn't read the negative reviews.  I'm determined to live my best life during this treatment. I think that if I believe I will have side effects or am frightened of having them, I will have them.  I'm just saying &quot;yes&quot; to life.

I feel great on a general basis and live a full and happy life despite vaginal dryness, brain fuzziness, slight joint pain and daily thoughts of having cancer. Opted for the genetic testing at MD Anderson and fell directly in the midline so made the choice to gamble and am so far winning.  I truly believe positive thinking and carrying on with doing those things you truly enjoy(I've not given up anything I previously enjoyed) have a great impact on survival.  God is in charge here, and with a supportive loving husband who tries his best to make me happy I'm willing to gamble on being around until it's my time. I'd rather live a fulfilling life now than grow old and depend on my son to be my caregiver as I have experienced with both my deceased parents.  Every day is a new one in which to enjoy and spend living and loving those things and people you truly enjoy--so be it if I'm not around to wither away and lose my faculties!  Life is too precious to worry about what could happen....enjoy what it is and love your family, friends, and pets(my dog is my joy)--who, by the way, definitely makes life much more fulfilling and enjoyable as well as giving me great pleasure.  My Dad always told me &quot;you gotta have someone to love, something to do, and something to look forward to&quot; to be truly happy.  He was right.  Find those things and it makes you and those around you much easier to live with. If I pass tomorrow I will have truly lived a life full of smelling the roses and having a drink or two when I wish.  And I will be ready to go with no regrets.

They got all the cancer and I am very happy I don't have to take chemo or radiation.  Also feel so much better since the cancer is gone!!!  Thank the Lord!!!!!! I have been having chills a lot lately, but I don't know that it is related to the femara.
Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Robbie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	9/8/2010 2:30:00 AM	Like many others, I have had terrible arthritis from this drug -- same problem as described of hardly being able to stand after sitting for a few minutes and upon waking up. My feet are heavy and swollen when I first get up. My fingers are painful and all my joints are affected. I can hardly believe that my legs actually work enough to allow me to walk on a treadmill. I have been on Femara for about 2 months, at first one tablet every other day and now everyday. I guess it's also causing weight gain and another awful thing: age spots on my face (had a near-perfect complexion before). The night sweats and hot flashes are difficult, and I wake up about every 2 hours. Isn't there anything else to take that doesn't cause equally bad side effects? I can't imagine living this way for years.

I take blood pressure meds, lipitor and an inhaler so by June of this year I was in the hole, Femara costs me almost $450.00 a month and I know there are cheaper drugs that are just as effective.

Many users talk about being unable to get up after sitting for a while. Yes! Plus, I'm very sweaty, always too warm, (when I'm not freezing! The internal thermostat must be shot!) achy all over, not sleeping well, fatigued, no libido whatever and wondering which of these symptoms will ameliorate after I'm finished with the Femara.  On the plus side, I'm cancer free now, and grateful things are no worse. But, I have significant osteoporosis, my skin has aged, and I'm much more wrinkled than I was. I had spine surgery a year ago for spinal stenosis and sciatica; hard to know what the effect of the Femara is as opposed to just plain aging,  but I'm hoping I'll feel a bit more like my old self when I finish this medication.

Have been taking Femara for about 1 year, after 6 mos of chemo, a double mastectomy, and 5 weeks of radiation 2x a day. I think my leg aches are worse than before, but I have arthritis, which is, of course, progressive, so who knows? My hands are stiffer and ache sometimes. Sweats have been minimal. But--my PET scan was clear and I feel great generally. I work out 3x a week. Keep moving!! It helps. I get lots of sleep and take Celexa.

Have been on Femara since last November.  After reading the side effects, I called my doctor to tell them of my aches in my feet and ankles with more swelling as time goes on.  I was told to stop taking in for two weeks to see if things improve.  I have been off of it for two days and am already feeling better.

Hot flashes, anxiety, can't sleep.  Was surprised when I read the actual statistics of the study that they advise women to take it without a lot of discussion.  Actual deaths from all causes in both groups pretty much the same.  Could be that as many people are hurt by this drug as helped, though they didn't study that.  Half as many who took the drug had a recurrence as those who didn't.  If you have severe side effects, consider your quality of life.

Fall asleep whenever I sit down and rest.  Have no energy. Also finding it painful to stand up and walk. Have been taking Femara since November 2009.  Had no problems with Tamoxifen.  Really beginning to wonder if it is worth it.  I have two more years left.  The cost is also OUTRAGEOUS.

I had a mastectomy and chemo., also took tamoxifin.  5 years later, the cancer metastasized to a lymph node in my trachea.  It was stage 3b.  I was then given 1 year of Herceptin and have been on Femara 5 years.  Just went into  remission.  Dr. says I have to stay on Femara forever, or until it stops working.  I hate the drug.  Severe hot flashes, many times per day, severe sweating, no sex drive, severe vaginal dryness, very blurry vision.  I do not have the arthritis pain that so many others have.  I am 49 and feel like 79.  My bones are getting thinner.  I have broken 2 ribs, one by leaning forward in a chair, the other by vacuuming!  Scared of the long term effects that are not yet known, as I am going on 5 plus years of taking Femara.  I am a guinea pig.  Plus tons of wt. gain.  I am currently 2 X my previous size.  Part is do to no exercise and depression.

HOT FLASHES are bad but staying busy seems to help me more than any thing. One hits in the day I get up, wave my hands, jump up and down, and laugh at the thoughts my family must be hiding--&quot;THE OLD GAL HAS FINALLY LOST IT.  Seriously, we are doing something positive for our selves not just sitting and waiting for the what comes.  I have mood swings, horrible headaches, some memory loss but things could be worse.  The main thread with any medication is the fact that each of us are reacting differently to femera.  Read all you can find but take every thing with &quot;a grain of salt&quot;.  Blessings to you all.

In Jan 2007 on a routine mamo 2 lumps were found in my left  breast.  Since so far apart, I had a left masectomy.  4 rounds of chemo then Femara.  I really do not have joint pain (since I have had 3 sets of hip replacements) but I do have excessive perspiring.  I can't do anything without my chest and back sweating and getting me dretched. In the morning, after my shower, I turn on the fan and try to cool my  body down and get dry.  If this is a side effect - it is very annoying.  Otherwise I am fine!!!!!

The 1st 3-4 months were fine or maybe I just didn't realize what I was feeling was related to the drug. Since then I have suffered with increasing joint pain starting with my ankle, then my knee and hip.  Worst is my hands.  I wake up in the morning and my hands feel swollen.  They're not but feel that way.  I can not make a fist or even hold my toothbrush for about 15 minutes until I am able to get the fingers going.  During the day they stiffen up if I haven't used them recently.  Another side effect that I realized this morning is diarrhea.  It has been awful for approximately 6 months.  I was actually taken to the ER in January with excruciating stomach pains and diarrhea.  I never put 2 and 2 together until this morning and neither did several doctors.  I've been under the care of a GI doctor and I'm actually scheduled for a colonoscopy next week to try to figure out what the problem is.  Today I decided to research more side effects of Femara.  Guess what I found as a side effect.......diarrhea!!!  Isn't the job of the doctors to find this???    Anyway, I have an appointment with my oncologist in August then I'm coming off this drug!  I will have been on it 1 year at that point.  I can tough it out until then and keep treating the symptoms but it won't be easy!

STAGE N1.  TWO TUMORS WAS LESS THAN 1/2 CENTIMETER EACH BUT I CHOSE MYSTECTOMY OVER LUMPECTOMY TO AVOID FUTURE RECURRENCE.  I HAD 4 ROUNDS CHEMO, FOLLOWED BY TAMOXIFEN FOR 2 1/2 YEARS.  I WAS PUT ON FEMARA IN FEB OF THIS YEAR (2010). I HAD THE ACHING BONES AND MUSCLES BUT DISCOVERED IT WAS THE VITAMIN D I HAD BEEN TAKING.  I WORK OUTDOORS AND WAS OBVIOUSLY GETTING ENOUGH VITAMIN D FROM THE SUN.  DOCTORS LIKE WOMEN OVER 50 ON D, BUT IN MY CASE, AFTER STOPPING THE VIT D, THE FEMARA HAS BEEN FINE.  THE ACHES AND PAINS HAVE GONE COMPLETELY AWAY.  I'LL BE 54 IN AUGUST AND SO FAR CANCER FREE.  THE CA27/29 FLUCTUATES FROM 32.2 TO 48.5 SO GETTING SCANS.  IT GOES BACK AND FORTH.  NOT WORRYING ABOUT IT UNTIL I HAVE TO!!

However, is this have side effects for losing your hair. I don't want to take this pill if this happens again to my hair. I rather go without another pill than lose my hair again. Let me know if this happened to anyone who took it. I need to know if this medicine it will be alright to take without any hair lose. If not this can stay in the medicine cabinet then I will not take it if it will have my hair fall out. No Thanks!

I had previously taken Tamoxifen for 2 1/2 years and was switched to Femara in Feb.  My bones, ankles, feet and fingers ache like arthritis would ache.  My friend went on it in Feb also, and she feels the same way.  Also have another friend that has been on it over 5 years and still has the aching.  I can't wait to get off it but have another 2 years to go.  When I sit for a while and get up I can barely move.  Everything tightens up.  The mornings are worse after sleeping all night.  I just hope and pray it's doing what it's suppose to do because the side effects suck...excuse the expression.  I almost had my oncologist schedule a bone scan to rule out bone mets.  Then, after speaking to others on Femara, and reading the comments on here, I see I am not alone.

After a lumpectomy and 31 radiation treatments I get a shot once a month to throw me into menopuase.  I have been on Femara for 8 months.  I am not happy at all. My hands have nasty arthritis. My hair is thinning. My bones ache and my right foot is numb and tingly.  I asked the Dr. to take me off for three weeks. The foot problem is better. My hair is a bit thicker and the bone pain is gone.  I think that this medicine is overkill.  My tumor was small and confined.  No lymph nodes affected.

I started taking femara 5 months ago. For the first 2 months I felt fine, now it is almost embarrassing when I get up. I am 53 years old and when I stand after sitting I look like a 80 year old. My legs hurt all over until I get going good. My feet hurt a lot also. Is there any one out there that is through taking femara and have the pains went away? I sure hope this will stop after finishing the drug therapy. It will be worth it if it keeps me cancer free. 
Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Still in pain daily, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		5/30/2010 10:53:42 PM	I took Arimadex for about two and one half years and had some leg pain.  Then it was recommended that I change to Femara.  After a few weeks I started having increased leg pain.  It got so bad that I could not stand it so I've been off of it for about two months.  I'm continuing to have the pain but hope the effects will lessen with time.  My doctors can't explain my leg pain that sometimes moves to my hip, ankle, thigh, and calf but I really feel that it may still be the side effects of the hormone blocker.  My doctor has me off of it on a three month trial.  I have no plan to ever take it again. Please think carefully before taking this drug.

Wasn't sure if half of my symptoms were imagined.  Took tamoxifen for 2.5 years (was premenopausal at time of diagnosis), switched to Femara 3 months ago when uterine lining was discovered to be growing (thank goodness nothing wrong!).  Great first month, then terrible joint pain, esp in legs and feet (toes already have neuopathy from chemo), BUT bad pain is generally only once a week; also swollen ankles and feet (ugh!); hard to lose weight - noticed a gain of 5 lbs; increased tinutus; harder to sleep thru night.  Work out every day, eat extremely well, drink lots of water, walk, meditate, and will get thru this!!
Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	65-74	5/19/2010 8:26:26 PM	I have taken Femara for 7 months and have experienced bad hot flashes especially in my head.  But the worst of all is my hair loss. It started out slowly and increased to where &quot;gobbs&quot; came out daily. This was very disstressing.  My doctor has prescribed a different medication for me to try.

My debilitating endometrial pain has stopped and I don't even need pain meds. I was very scared of the side effects I read about with alternative treatments, but have experienced few noticeable symptoms. Some fatigue, back is more achey than usual, had some initial problems with irregular vaginal bleeding. Overall feel much better and my quality of life has greatly improved. Highly recommended for treatment of endometriosis!

All 3 drugs have made me miserable and I will be glad to stop taking them even though I am a 3-time cancer survivor. I ache all over, especially my joints and muscles. I have infrequent but severe headaches. Chronic fatigue so much so that I am unable to do much of anything. Overall I feel bad all the time and cannot sleep at night for more than 4 hours. I will stick it out with this drug to the end but it is miserable while I am on it. 
Other	jk, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/27/2010 8:52:14 PM	I was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer though was on the pill so no one sure if I was menopausal or not.  Went through chemo and radiation.  Now post-menopausal...obviously no longer on the pill.  Have been on Femara for 6 months and minor joint pain in one wrist which advil works fine.  Having trouble losing the weight from the steroids in chemo, but definately not gaining weight.  Go to the gym 3 x  week which gets feels great!   I really feel that the move you can possibly move; even if it's a little bit; you will feel better.   I want to do whatever I can to get better and stay healthy and if my oncologist feels this is the best form and I'm satisfied so far, then I'll continue.

Rather than mystectomy, my Dr sought to reduce the tumor first.  After 3 months on Femara, the tumor is  completely gone!I'll stay on Femara and have another MRI in 3 months. Will probably be on the drug for 5 years. But No surgery necessary.   Amazing results, Amazing drug.   Only side effects are increased hot flashes. I can live with that!

I have been on the drug since Sept. 2008. I was diagnosed with hormone related breast cancer in Dec 2007. I had 8 chemo treatment's and a bilateral mastectomy on July 24/2008. So far, all is well and I am doing great....

Was on Femara and terrible feet, legs, and back aching.  Felt like I was 90 when getting up from sitting or lying down.  Changed to Aromasin after 3 months, but had same side effects.  My hair has come back real thin and baby fine, can see scalp all through it.  Stayed on Aromasin for 3 mos. and now on Tamoxifen.  The aches are better now, but still no hair after 2 mos. on Tamoxifen.    For me, tamoxifen is the better choice as of now.  Would not want to go back on Femara or Aromasin again!  My best to all on this journey.

After radiation and a year of taking Femara, the cancer was found to have spread widely through my spine and other bones in my back. I have recently started chemotherapy to attempt to stop the spread of the cancer.

The chemo left me with severe neuropathy in my feet and fingertips. The cancer returned, more surgery and this time started me on tamoxifen. When this didn't work, Femara was started and slowly the cancer started to decrease. For me, the side effects are terrible.  The joint pain keeps me awake at night, the neuropathy keeps me awake, the Femara itself keeps me awake.  In three days, I have had about six hours of sleep. There are days when I consider stopping the Femara because the pain is so great, but I realize it is what is keeping me alive.

Had a mastectomy, 12 weeks of dense dose chemo and 32 treatements of radiation.  Then Femera.  My biggest problem is the pain in my fingers.  I thought it was arthirtis util I read these posts.  I have about 2 hot flashes a day but can deal with that, they come in the evening.  It is very, very expensive and puts me into the medicare gap by June.  I haven't gained weight but have a hard time retaining my current weight as it has a tendency to go down.  I do get lightheaded but thought that was because I needed to eat something.  I hate this drug but will continue to take it if it keeps me cancer free.  I would do anything on this earth to keep from taking chemo again.  It almost killed me.  Lost 45 pounds and was sicker than I have ever been in my life.

I have varicose veins and being over the age of 65 they have become a real trouble for me. In taking Femara the swelling of my feet and leg became unbearable; specially again the left foot and leg. Could not stand or walk, burning, aching and I could see the skin stretching and the deformity of my ankle and upper foot increase by the minute. After 7 months of suffering, I discontinue taking my medication and within days I was back to my troubled normal but not to the excessive distortion of my limbs. I try to go back to Tamoxifen which I still had on hand from when I was switched to Femara last May.  I was switched to it after 6 months of taking the Tamoxifen because it too was bothering my legs; BUT not to the extent of the Femara! Unfortunately my experiment failed; I had to stop taking the Tamoxifen because after 48 hours I was beginning to balloon up and hurting again. So I am now taking NOTHING. I was supposed to have vein intervention, but I am skeptical that my varicose veins are the total culprits of my problem, so I postponed doing anything with them.  All my life I have had swelling of the left leg and foot when taking ANY medication, even over the counter medications, so I am at the point in which I dont know what to do; I refused chemotherapy so I REALY must take something!! I had posted this once before but it did not get posted, trying again.

Femera was prescribed for the remaining spots still visable in the scans and they are shrinking. It works, but the pain in all of my joints is horible. Constant pain causes depression. Now I have a prescription for Pxil. Exercise helps tremendously. Yoga twice a week and a 3 mile jog on the other days. I have had tremendous bone loss says the dentist. Will be addressing on my next trip to MDA.

After chemo (8 rounds) my hair came back beautifully, but now due to femara I have a receiding hair line. No desire for sex whatsover, I'd rather watch Law &amp; Order. Sometimes feel as if I'm having a major meltdown. I've got another 2 1/2 years, don't know how I'm going to make it. I take lunesta &amp; neurontin so I can sleep at night, &amp; effexor for the hot flashes during the day. I feel as if I coming apart as the seams.

I've been on  Femara 4 months &amp; the worst has been the hot flashes. I've found that taking the medication in the early pm lessens the flashes during the day. This has really made a difference in daily functioning. I hope all you ladies find this info helpful in your daily battles...stay strong!

I feel like an 90 year old woman.  If I sit down, it takes me forever to get up.  I hate feeling this.  My doctor says that it only affects the hands and feet but my joints hurt all over.  My hair is thinning and it is hard to sleep at night.  I am always tired and my vision and memory are also affected.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	4	5	Female	55-64	12/7/2009 10:51:13 PM	Just completed 3 years of femara.  Before that I was on tamoxifon.  Last week my oncologist released me.  Hallelujah!If I was experiencing side effects (other than the vag dryness, etc., I was unaware of it.  Glad I didn't discover this website while taking the femara! My imagination might have gotten the better of me.

I have taken it for 10 months after completing surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy + herceptin for 1 year.  I have gained weight (10 lbs above pre-cancer weight), have joint pain, and I have higher blood pressure and cholesterol levels than before taking drug. Herceptin can cause joint pain and numbness side effects, so I am unsure which drug caused these conditions in me.

Then--suddenly I was having bone pain in legs (felt like someone took a 2x4 and whacked me across the leg bones)--joint pain in shoulders, knees, ankles, feet, and fingers.  Also--hair thinning badly--and gained 15 pounds in about 2 months.  Cholesterol has remained ok--too early to tell about bone loss.  While I am 65 years old, I move like my Mom did when she was in her 80s--difficult to stand up after sitting for more than 20 minutes--and it takes forever to get everything moving once I do get up.  Insomnia is my constant companion these days--along with depression.  HOWEVER--I had my 6 month checkup and was cancer-free.  Guess it's kind of a crap shoot--don't take it and take a chance on cancer returning--or take it and put up with the side effects.  Good luck to all of us who struggle with this.

Only mild symptoms of pain in finger and toe joints.  Nearly unnoticeable.  Vaginal dryness, painful intercourse and frequent UTI's very noticable.  Dr wants to put me on Vagifem but then I will be taking 1 drug to counteract the effects of another drug.  I do not like that.  I also have lung changes due to radiation.  Maybe the cure is as bad as the cause?

Had a lumpectomy. Completed 4 chemo sessions and 6 weeks of radiation.  Started femara after chemo.  Felt fine for a few months then developed blood clots in leg and 6 cent. clot in breast.  I now have terrible leg and feet pain, can't sleep have to take warfarin for clots.  Some vision problems.  I am starting to think this is all caused by femara.  Since dr.s feel like they removed all the cancer (none in lymph nodes).  Do I really need to take femara.  Seems like overkill.

I am also on Zoladex which DOES cause many side effects, so it may be difficult to distinguish which medicine is causing what side effect.  All in all, I think Femera will work for me.

Stage 3a and so onto Femara.  1st year no problems so prevalent, but upon second year can hardly walk, spinal stenosis in neck and just ready to go off of it in month 24.  I have had enough.  This is not quality life, pain killers frequently and not able to stand for 5 minutes.  Get UTI's when going in a pool, so that exercise that I love, swimming is out for now.  I will write back to let you know when the pain is gone after the 24 month period.  It is now month 22.  it took me so long to realize it was this med, thought I had arthritis everywhere, and yes i feel 90 and I just turned 60.  My daughter the PA student, told me to read the reviews. I wish everyone best, as I know your suffering.

I began experiencing night sweats, severe headaches, weight gain, rash on legs, and horrible joint pain.  After surgery and completing radiation treatment, I began questioning the use of Femara.  After much discussion with all my doctors, I have refused further treatment with Femara.  I wish I had researched Femara more thoroughly before agreeing to take it.  I would have just said NO!!

After surgery and radiation treatments I have been on Femara since Oct 2008. The first 3 months were fine, then everything changed. Every joint in my body started hurting when I tried to get up or sit down. I can no longer think about having a sex life due to the dryness even with the vagifem my doctor has prescribed. And now i have found that there is a new study that may cause doctors to keep patients on this drug for longer than the original 5 years, I'll find out more on my next visit. I'm afraid I wont be able to walk by then. (oh, and sleeping is a thing of the past). I'm happy the surgery had a good outcome but I wish there were better drugs.

I decided to have my right breast removed. Almost all of the female side of my family have had breast cancer. I could not have radiation or the regular chemo treatment due to having COPD from years of smoking. (I no longer smoke). My Dr. started me on this medication 6 months ago. My joints and bones are so painful some times I can't stand it. I am having hot flashes again.  I am 62 and feel like I am 92 and I have no energy at all. I just hope it gets better.

Most of the symptoms associated with menopause.  My energy level has increased in the last year.  I will do what I can to beat the cancer.

I then read reviews of Femara and realized my new problems are drug related. Having also had colon cancer, I truly believe I can endure anything if it works. I can only hope Femara is effective. My sister recently passed away from breast cancer.

After chemo, bilateral mastectomy and radiation, I have been on Femara for almost five years. Yes, I have developed osteopenia, but am trying to battle that through exercise and diet and will probably stay on Femara some more time. I have never experienced side effects. It has kept me free of cancer and just had all body scans and everything came out great, except some bone loss, which my physician says may well reverse itself after treatment.I was very surprised to see so many women had many side effects.

On June 8th I found out I had it again and it was hormone receptor positive, which is a good thing. This time they found it in my gallbladder and it had spread to the bones, a place in the skull and one ovary. I am very thankful that I was the one diagnosed with cancer and not my girls or husband.  I survived it once and am going to give it my best shot this time also. I was started on a daily dose of Femara June 11 and an IV injection of Zometa once a month.  I have not had any side effects except for hot flashes and some sleeplessness. When there are other aches and pains they are not severe and I hesitate to blame the medicine.  I am just glad it was found and is treatable.  I was 40 the first time and had Chemo so when I found out this time I could just take Femara and Zometa I was thrilled not to be taking Chemo. I would take Femara any day over Chemo.  I have had very good results.  My tumor markers were in the high 60s when I started, the 2nd month in the 40s and this last time they were 32.5, almost in the normal range.  I am thrilled with the results.  I will have a bone scan and CT scan in December to see how things are going.

I had previously always enjoyed excellent health.  I took Tamoxifen for about four years and have been on Femara now almost a year. Since I have been taking the Femara,  I have a lot of mild joint pain, I am very tired all the time and have extreme hot flashes.  I am so uncomfortable, it is making me depressed, I have never before had this problem, and prevously felt very youthful and positive.  I have lost that feeling; I now feel like my body is &quot;rusting out from the inside.&quot;  I work out on a treadmill about five hours a week, I am still able to, but on occassion, I have to start slowly until the pain goes away.  I dislike this medication so much that I sometimes think it is better to risk getting cancer again than continue taking it.
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	amyhope, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	8/19/2009 7:22:32 AM	I am 50 and was diagnosed 6/08 with an early stage breast cancer.  Chose to have a double mastectomy followed by Femara.  After using femara for 6 weeks had terrible bone and joint pain and could not sleep. Continued using femara hoping the pains would go away.  The doctor checked my liver enzymes and they were elevated so I had to stop the drug.  It has been four months and I still have joint pain and my liver tests have not gone back to normal yet.  My dr. is watching me, hoping this will resolove.  Anyone else with this side effect? Contacted manufacturer, they have no data.

Horrible joint pain in hands (almost crippling), frequent numbness in hands and feet, difficulty standing after sitting due to joint pain in back and hips, insomnia, low libido, feel 90, I'm 58.  Had lumpectomy Jan. 2007 with chemo and radiation.  Took Tamoxifin for 1 year and now Femara for 8 months.  So far cancer free, but I hate this medication and radiation.  My hands went numb during my first radiation treatment of 32 treatments.  The doc said &quot;it's nothing we're doing&quot;.  I don't believe it.  Good luck and God Bless to all the cancer thrivers out there.  I want to stop taking Femara, but am afraid cancer will return.

One month in, it was like taking a sugar pill-the next month, my body felt like it had aged 20 years in the joints, mostly my feet. Once moving it's ok but getting started is awkward. I will prevail!! With yoga,swimming biking, hiking, running, and weight training. It is critical to be VERY WELL hydrated as this helps protect the joints and tendons! ALSO, being strictly a 2 glass of wine person, my tolerance is EXTREMELY REDUCED!!!! I get tipsy quickly and with the cranky joints it can be quite undignified! Peace to all, may you endure no suffering and always dwell in your heart. Be happy!!

One month in, it was like taking a sugar pill-the next month, my body felt like it had aged 20 years in the joints, mostly my feet. Once moving it's ok but getting started is awkward. I will prevail!! With yoga,swimming biking, hiking, running, and  weight training. It is critical to be VERY WELL hydrated as this helps protect the joints and tendons! ALSO, being strictly a 2 glass of wine person, my tolerance is EXTREMELY REDUCED!!!!  I get tipsy quickly and with the cranky joints it can be quite undignified! Peace to all, may you endure no suffering and always dwell in your heart.  Be happy!!

I had a lumpectomy &amp; mammosite radiation in 2006. Dr. put me on Femara after hysterectomy last year. Pain started in my elbows &amp; moved to my shoulders &amp; now my lower back &amp; hips.  I cannot stand in one place for more than 5 min. or my back locks up.  I do find that walking and regular workouts at Curves do help.  I also take Prozac which seems to help a bit with the hot flashes &amp; night sweats.  Advil or Aleve sometimes help with the pain at night.  Now I have new insurance which is going to cause me to have to pay nearly full price for this.  Not happy about that!  Did I say Healthcare Reform NOW??

Doctor suggested 200 mg alpha lipoic acid and 200 mg hyaluronic acid to reduce inflammation. Now back to whatever joint pain from arthritis I had before Femara. Also do tai chi, water aerobics and strength training. Only missed one tai chi class after surgery, which helped arm immensely. Also really helped by strength training. Now do not feel affected by Femara.

My oncologist said this probably was not from femara as it is usually in the hands.  As I have just read from all the posts...we DO have it in the knees.  I am going to an osteosurgeon to have the knees checked out now. I too feel like I am 95 and I am only 58.  Very debilitating and frustrating.  The cancer never felt this bad.

I am now 58 yrs old,but feel older since being on femara since 3/07. But if taking this med will help assure no reaccurance than i would rather deal with some of the side effects. My feet,back,legs,have been really aching and sore. I have been very tired. I also gained weight,which i tend to have that problem anyway. But I'm here to tell you that you can lose weight taking Femara. I thought i wouldn't be able to but that is not true. I have lost weight since June 09 and still losing. That was part of my depression, having the weight gain,which plays alot on my self esteem. So I will continue to take Femara,because the side effects out weigh the chances of cancer re-accuring.

I feel worse now than I did with chemo. I ache constantly, mostly in my joints; elbows, knees, ankles, neck, etc. I get horrible hot flashes, and it doesn't help that I live in Las Vegas, where it is already HOT!  I have a hard time walking for long periods of time, I can't sleep at night because of the pain. I have to take half a vidocin each morning to get moving, and when I ask the doctor for a refill, they make me feel like I'm a drug addict. But the pain is horrific, and nothing else will help. The worst part is my lack of libido and vaginal dryness, which leads to yeast infections. Depression and just plain feeling like crap is bad too. I try to stay positive and watch a lot of funny movies, and try to keep my self in check. I thought I could control the pain myself through positive energy, herbal supplements, etc, but sometimes you just have to take a pill. Good luck to all you cancer survivors out there. I guess the long-term permanent benefits outweigh the temporary pain. I am looking forward to being DONE with the horrible drug!

The pain in both legs are getting worse as time goes on.  Can hardly stand after sitting for a few minutes.  Have taken calcium, vitamin D, glucosamine chondritin, and celebrex but nothing has helped even a little.  I am trying to stay on it but don't know how long I can put up with the pain and work at a full time job.

Lumpectomy followed by 7 1/2 weeks of radiation and 5 years on Tamoxifen. In 2004 I began another five years of Femara and will be finished in September 2009. My only complaint about this drug is the continuing joint and muscle pain. I had no side effects for the first 3 years but sometime into year 4 I started to just feel achy all over with joint pain in hips,  knees and fingers.  I have seen my oncologist every six months since 1999 and we both agree that being cancer free is well worth these inconvenient side effects.  So, even though some days I feel crummy, I plan to tough it out,not quit and give thanks everyday for being cancer free. However, I have a good friend who was diagnosed at the same time I was..same treatments, same doctor.  She quit Femara during year 2 with the same side effects. She says that in about a month all he aches and pains were gone and she felt 100% better.  I, however, am just going for it and hope that I have the same results.

I have no joint pain.  I have minor hot flashes and night sweats but nothing to interfere with my life style.  I have had a lumpectomy, intensive radiation for five days and femara.  The biggest draw back is the cost.  I am counting on Femara to keep me disease free.  
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Advanced Breast Cancer	J Leath, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	55-64	5/27/2009 1:57:10 AM	I had a lumpectomy and was cancer free for 10 1/2 years until diagnosed in August of 2008, breast metastatic bone cancer. I have taken femara everyday since and zometa by infusion every 4 weeks to strengthen bones. I have had intermittent traveling pain from neck to hips and feet. I lost 7 pounds and use Tylenol once in a while and exercise. I have also had some intestional issues in the past which have caused me to be more careful about my diet now. My 6 month progress report was &quot;encouraging&quot;, as my oncologist stated with a smile. Femara is a walk in the park compared to taking tamoxifen. I take melatonin once in a while at night to sleep. It is not habit forming and works for me. New studies show some connection between zometa and its bone building properties and positive effects in helping to fight cancer. It will be interesting to see results of further studies. I am grateful to put up with the aches in exchange for life, as well as my hair and eyebrows.

I have experienced the joint/bone/muscle pain the other posts refer to; however, my review will be mostly positive.  I deal with the joint pain by taking OsteoBiflex twice a day and exercising with walking/swimming/weights and it helps a great deal.  I also take aroniaberries which can be found at www.superberries.com and they are wonderful.  You should read the testimonials from this outstanding fruit. I am also dealing with having to pay over $300 a month for this drug having entered that &quot;gap&quot; where no assistance is available.  My checkups have been wonderful.I feel great.  Meditation helps me too.  I just keep going!

My most recent encounter has been with muscle spasms in the legs at night.  Mostly in the calf &amp; feet areas, but occasionally in the thigh area which is really painful.  I am not sure this is caused by Femara, but didn't have much trouble with this before taking it.  I could not take aromacin (allergic reaction), so Femara was the next best thing and I really want what is best for me to fight this cancer, so if it means putting up with a few aches and pains then SO BE IT!!!!  I am a Fighter and I am going to Beat this Cancer.  With GOD anything is possible!!!!!

My feet and bones hurt almost constantly. Trying to walk up or down the steps, I feel like a really old person and to get up after sitting is terrible.  My feet hurt so bad. I stand for my work, so I thought it was from the standing, but after readying some of the other post, I now feel it must be the medicine.  My oncology dr. said I was cancer free at this time and so far I feel I can endure the side effects to keep me cancer free.

It's difficult for me to stand up once I've been sitting for any lenght of time. My migraines are daily where they used to be a couple a month. My hair has started thinning. I am trying to tough this out because I'm very happy that the BC is in remission but it's getting more difficult every day.

It was 10 times worse than tamoxifen in its side effects.  I hurt so badly I could barely get out of bed or walk down the halls at work.  My feet hurt horribly.  I had aches and pains, depression, weight gain, terrible mood swings.  This was supposed to be better but it was certainly worse, when the oncologist insisted that I take it, I had a 2nd opinion with another one.  After reviewing my history, he said I should have quit after the tamoxifen.  I had already decided that I wasn't taking either one of them and he agreed with me.  I did manage about 2 1/2 years of therapy although it made my hmoe and work life horrible.  I was never questioned if I had a history of depression in my family or if I had it myself.  Thank goodness I went to another oncologist.  The first one never offered me any kind of support like counseling or medication monitoring.  The second one has me see a nurse practioner who monitors my cymbalta.  I feel like I am coping, although I have had a few bad days since.  I have been threatened at work with termination, was told that &quot;having cancer was not as bad as getting a divorce&quot;.  If I didn't need insurance I would have been out of there.  I feel like a leper some days.  Some people hardly speak to me after 3 years.  Guess thay think it is catching!  Hope they never find out what it is like.  Was told by Human Resources manager to stop thinking about it.  How can you not?  Some people need to get a clue.

Tumor was not estrogen related so I will be on Femara permanently.  I had pre-existing osteoarthritis and this drug really exacerbated the pain.  Also bone density issues and had to go to Injected Boniva. It does seem to make sleep difficult either due to the drug or the additional joint pain it causes. It is not fun but, I guess, beats the possibility of cancer returning.  Cost is terrible and I hope a generic is in the near future.

I had depression at first, but don't think it was the drug because I'm fine now.  However, now I have joint pain in my knees and pain in my feet, which is very painful and makes me feel old.  I had a back condition before and it does not seem worse in pain, but seems more stiff than before. I'm sleeping well but feel bloated and do not have a great appetite as in the past, nor can I eat as much.  Will be making an appointment with my doctor after reading all comments. It does beat breast cancer, but quality of life is also important.  I'm grateful but concerned.

I have joint pain, muscle pain, lack of libido, vaginal dryness, very tired, hands hurt and feel numb sometimes, memory a little off....I wonder what else is going wrong on the inside. Just had my 6 month breast check...good. I play tennis 3 times a week to get the endorphins to my brain. After several years of insomnia I've discovered wearing a mask to shut out all light, helps keep me a sleep. I use a vaginal moisturizer to relieve the dryness and fake it with my husband to get myself into the mood...most of the time it works. My husband has been wonderful and has stood by me....sometimes a very grumpy girl!!! He deserves whatever it takes from me to make him happy. Hot baths help the joint and limb pain. Oh, also lavender soaks help with sleep. I really can't get over how great that mask helps with sleep... my college daughter turned me on to it...I think they're very popular at the dorms!!! I would love to be brave and go off the drug...to be without pain would be wonderful...so every once in a while when I just can't take it any more....I take a pain killer...get my senses back...and move on. If taking the drug will help our sisters down the road...we need to think of them....when we just don't feel like we can do it any longer....just think of the women before us...hell, 20 years ago..they wouldn't have been able to complain...they, would have had to say goodbye to their husbands. Good luck to us all.

Within 6 weeks, I developed lymphedema.  Then began the sore joints.  I put up with this for 2 1/2 years.  I quit taking the Femara in Nov '08 &amp; feel like a new person!!!

Minor hair loss at first, no weight gain. But there's no getting around the seriousness of libido loss and vaginal dryness, a real sad deal for us and those of us who have supportive husbands/partners. Having read others' experiences with cholesterol and loss of bone density, will know to have those checked. The best to all who fight this battle, armed with a drug with such mixed benefits.

In 2003 my BC returned in my lungs with a tumor in my head with 80% loss of sight in 1 eye. I took Femara for 5 yrs until the BC recurred in 2008.  I had some night sweats and bone pain for the first 6 months only.  The tumor was gone in 11 months and the BC went into remission.  CT scan showed BC had returned in August 2008 and my Oncologist  stopped the Femara.  I am now on Arimidex and have severe joint &amp; bone pain.  I hope it is worth it because my quality of life is really bad.

So far, only very minor side effects: occasional hot flashes and weight gain (@ 15 lbs.)...small price to pay if it keeps me in remission.

I have hot flashes now and then. The weight gain has been terrible.  I weigh more now then I did 9 months pregnant. Joint pain is bad in my legs when I stand up to walk.  It almost feels like the bottoms of my feet hurt.  The pain goes away within a minute or so of walking. I do have pain in my right shin.  It comes and goes daily.  Sometimes it wakes me up at night it's so bad.  My real concern is I have had incredible swelling in my face especially around my mouth for no reason.  It has happened at least 6 times already.  My neurologist thought it was nerves and finally ruled that as well as a food allergy out.  I just picked up my new femara perscription and noticed that under Very serious side effects is swelling: especially of the Face/tongue/throat/neck  HAS ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM?

So far so good.  I accept that my muscles and joints hurt and that nearly every side effect is experienced in some degree.  It so beats how I felt on chemo and look forward to enjoying everyday as quality of life is OK.

Have joint pain but still in remission. Started hair loss when I first began Femara.  Hair became very brittle and broke off and/or fell out.  Thought I too would be bald.  Solution for me was to switch shampoos and conditioners.  Went to the very creamy (almost greasy) formulas and it solved my hair problems.  My hair is in great  shape now. Possible that the Femara was more of a drying agent for my hair.  People might want to try switching to the thick, creamy shampoos  and conditioners and see what happens. I  have a rather wide selection of products that I rotate thru.  Keeps the &quot;build up&quot; down to a roar. This worked for me and hopefully will for others

Dr. Aye insisted there was clinical evidence showing it was safe for children, although I don't understand why the FDA is unaware of this (their website says dangerous to embryos and no established pediatric safety).  Since I believe my son's short stature is genetic, and neither UCSF doctors or the internet indicates it was even safe, I discontinued treatment.

Started femara at diagnosis, as per my oncologist.Two lumpectomies, one awful staph infection at site, 6 wks radiation. Hot flashes were bad, but have gotten so constant, day/night several an hour, that I'm crazed. I got a terrible rash about 3 months ago-GP unable to find cause. Waiting for derm app't.I think femara is affecting mepsychologically-depression, anxiety (at times severe) I don't want go off it on my own-tho' if this gets any worse, maybe. I am seeing my doctor, who tends to brush these things off, this month. Good luck-be healthy!

It has caused depression,and I have noticed a behavior change with myself which I;am not pleased with. I have since dropped the RX until I speak with mr Dr. This has occured on a weekend when I could not reach the Dr and decided to discontinue the RX until further word.Why does this RX have so many unpleasant side affects?

Thought I was done.Had pain in my left leg this year. x-ray showed it spread to my femur. Had a femoral rod inserted to prevent bone breakage. Good news, so far, no other cancer seen. More radiation, but have not had chemo yet. They are just watching closely. I got another opinion on this and both oncologists agreed. Has anyone else gone thru radiation only? Been on Femara for 6 months. This drug is tearing me in a different direction every day. I'm getting used to the muscle/joint pain but am always worried that it's not from the drug but another spot of cancer.I've learned to live with night sweats, although these are getting better. What really gets to me is the mood swings. I'm either laughing or crying, but, as long as it's doing the job, I really try not to complain. In the meantime, it's regular bone, cat and PET scans and a lot of prayer. I don't mind all the tests, it's the results I fear.

After calling my Drs office to discuss my options (twice) with no returned call, I elected to take myself off the Femara.  I know this is risky, but can't imagine 5 years of living like this.

Most intense side effects are hot flashes/night sweats and insomnia. These are more intense with Femara. My doctor has prescribed a sleep aid which has helped tremendously! I take it every night along with a low-dose generic form of neurontin and an herbal non-drug supplement for flashes and problems with sleep. No major problems with weight-gain, slight joint/muscle pain. I try to exercise every day and do weight training which helps w/the pain. I know this drug is necessary for my cancer diagnosis but I look forward to the day I no longer need it. I've been dealing w/these side-effects for 5+ years and probably have another 5 to go on the Femara, but you do what you have to do. I just thank God that these drugs and treatments are available for us.

At age 51 to feel like this just isn't worth it.  The joint/bone pain and endless hot flashes were enough. I didn't take it long enough to see if there was weight gain or hair thinning.

I had double mastectomy and lymph nodes removed from right arm, &amp; both ovaries removed. (Left mastectomy was voluntary for peace of mind). I take Zometa once a month for bone builder and after 11 mo's after diagnosis, I found a tumor on my neck and my Dr started me on Femara. I've been on it almost 9 mo's. I was already experiencing muscle &amp; joint pain from the Zometa, and hotflashes from the loss of ovaries, but I have constant joint pain in my knee, left pelvic area and lower back. The pain travels and is never constant. Does anyone else experience this?  Also night sweats are terrible! But it beats the alternative. The tumor on the neck dissolved in about 2 mo's thanks to Femara! Just finished reconstruction, I got the new &quot;gummy bear&quot; silicone gel implants. I would recommend them highly! Also I had about 3 weeks of a lot of hair loss but it has stopped now.

They do not interfere much with my lifestyle.  What I am unhappy with is excessive thinning of my hair, which was not evident before taking Femara (excluding, of course, the baldness from the chemo). If the cancer stays away, it is worth it.

So far I have experienced  severe hot flashes, leg and knee pain, insomnia, and lower back and hip pain. Recently I have begun to bleed vaginally. Talked to my Dr. about this and he recommends a hysterectomy. After having no periods for 8 years, I am not happy about the bleeding. Has anyone else experienced this?
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	8/30/2008 8:07:48 PM	I can't really judge its effectivness since after two months of it I had to discontinue it. The side effects were horrible! My mind was fuzzy and I was exhausted from lack of sleep. Between the night sweats and waking up every 1-2 hours with severe hip pain what sleep I got was fitful at best. I immediately gained weight had joint and muscle pain that nothing could ease. Hot and cold flashes were plaguing me day and night as if my internal thermostat was bad. The list of side effects is quite long so I will give you the abridged version. To name a few: breast pain, headache, backache, blurry vision, shortness of breath, nausea, stomach pains, etc. The final straw was when I got up from bed, about two steps toward the bathroom, I went blind. It was like someone flipped a switch! There was no lightheadedness, just no vision! After a few seconds and lots of blinking my vision returned. My MD says that the Femara probably caused my blood pressure to fall very low while I was asleep, causing the blindness. If it dropped that low, I would think I am lucky not to have had a heart attack or stroke. I give up. I now intend to try through diet and exercise to keep the cancer at bay. Make sure you are monitored very closely when taking this medication!!! I can't stress that enough. Arimadex was just as awful for me and I had to quit that one, too. I have been on these drugs since around April of this year, but no more!!!!

I am in 3rd week of ingesting Femara. Stage one;29 lymph nodes removed. Good path report. Good bone density. Has anyone experienced this? I feel like Gollum - sensitive to sunlight or bright light. Just happened this am. No joint pain;slight dizziness; slight tiredness but I attribute that to recovery. But really serious perspiring after small amount of outdoor phsyical activity. Have you experienced this and if so how have you coped?

Could not tolerate the Tamoxifen which prompted ovarian removal. Could not tolerate Aromasin - terrible foot pain.  Presently on Femara  for more than a year - had to cut back to 2x/wk  and the joint pain became intolerable. Now on 1x/wk.  and still getting increasing joint pain, insomnia, headaches, memory loss,weight gain, vaginal dryness , high cholesterol and now , even my fingernails are breaking down to the quick.  Sometimes several breaks a day!   I have no idea if it's Femara related - but my nails used to be very strong.   I feel incredibly old - not what I think I should be feeling at 50.   I need help getting up  from any position where I have to bend my knees.   I'm taking yoga and  weight training at the gym to keep up my strength - but it's hugely challenging.  I'm 4 years beyond my original diagnosis  and CAN&quot;T WAIT till I can stop taking this stuff and feel normal again. Really counting the days! 
Other	reneamrp, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	5/4/2008 2:10:25 PM	My doctor has prescribed Femara for me in an attempt to reduce the amount of peritoneal fluid produced by my body because it is not being reabsorbed or secreted. I have had 1 liter of fluid aspirated from abdomin and then another 200 ml taken out transvaginally. I am only 38, no cancer so I'm a little nervous about taking this. Has anyone heard of this drug being used in for this reason? I used Arimidex for 2 wks and couldn't stand the headaches but have only taken Femara for 2 days so no side affects yet.
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Advanced Breast Cancer	BJ, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	55-64	5/1/2008 5:31:14 PM	After 18 months on this drug,I feel like I have aged about 20 years,gained weight,very sore muscles,especially legs,bottom of feet hurt alot,walking downstairs is tough,standing up after sitting for awhile is hard,thumbs are not functioning,trigger fingers,blood pressure is very high now,no energy,pill knocks me out for about 3 or 4 hours,so I have to take at night only,depression ,fatigue, is affecting liver and kidney functions. At this point,I don't know if I want to continue taking this.I think part of the problem is that you have to take the one dosage or nothing.I think the same dosage for someone weighing 150 pounds as someone weighing 250 pounds is not right.I am very sensitive to drugs and always have to take a lesser dosage of drugs.There needs to be differant strengths of these drugs, one size does not fit all.I really feel this has alot to do with all the bad side effects women are having.If Novartis reads these opinions,I hope they take my opinion seriously and try making a lesser strength pill for women who are having severe side effects, but are afraid to stop taking this drug.I think you would find this to be true. I notice your competitors have released differant strengths and one even has a liquid form, which I would be interested in because I have a problem with my esophagus not being very wide.Supposedly, it is not a good idea to cut the pill in half,so if it is dissolved in the liver , than a less potent pill needs to be available to women.You would see more women willing to stay on this drug if the strength was decreased,and probably the most severe side effects lessened.

Yes, there are the bone aches and some days much better than others. But, I'm still here and that's what counts and I'm learning to live with it!

I've been on Femara for 8 weeks and have joint/muscle pain. Don't want to get out of bed sometimes. So far it isn't working to shrink the cancer under my arm.  Doctors say it needs more time. Taking calcium, Vit. D, Fish Oil supplements. Getting depressed. I need to see some good results for all the pain involved.

After 2 years of trying and two months on Clomid my doctor prescribed one dose of Femara. That month I had two large, robust eggs from which to try to conceive.  I now have a beautiful 3 month old baby girl. I had no side effects and she is perfect and a picture of health. It's worth trying if you have poor egg quality such as i did.

I have aches and pains, but cannot attribute it to the Femera. At nearly 60 I still work and exercise, that may help reduce the effect. I have taken it for almost 2 years now and experienced no dramatic effects. If it keeps me cancer free I will give it kudos for effectiveness. I initially had a lumpectomy which was followed by radiation. I have never taken tomoxifin or received radiation.  So, if I remain cancer free it can only be attributed to the Femara. I'll let you know if I make it 4 more years.

Before starting femara I had a cholesterol around 150-160.  Now it creeps up every year and is over 204.  I eat a very low fat, low cholesterol diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and very little red meat but lots of chicken and fish.  What can I do to reverse this?  I do not want to have to take cholesterol medicine.

Vaginal dryness and itching, some discharge, hands hurt and feel numb sometimes.  I am 57 years old and feel like a hundred.  I normally work-out, treadmill and weight training.  I do feel better when I work out and take a few NSAIDs but I don't want to take those everyday for the next 5 years.  I was on  Arimidex first and that cause bone pain too but I think Femara has been worse.  Both cause hot flashes which I can live with.  Doctor put me on Tamoxifen today to see how it works.  If things don't get better, I think I am going to go off mediation and take my chances.  My quality of life is just as important as quantity.  I feel like such an old woman.  Good luck ladies

Then, at 40 I had a total hysterectomy, so now I am postmenapausal and have been on Femara for 6 months. Intense hot flashes, anxiety has increased, I have had crying episodes with joint and bone pain.  I get down on the floor to play with my 5 yr old and I can not get back up by myself. I feel like I am 70+ years old.  Everything is so sore, like I exercised for 5 hours in a row!!   My oncologist is going to switch me to Aromasin tomorrow. Hopefully, relief is on the way!

Switched to Femara for 2 months hoping to diminish side effects (which didn't happen) and night sweats and coordination worsened. Fell twice in two days, with bad bruising, and decided to stop the medication.  Oncologist told me to take a break and then start Aromasin after I recovered, but it has now been 5 weeks and the pain and swelling are still present. It seems the effects of the medications have been cumulative over 4 years.  Has anyone out there experienced this and recovered, or is the damage permanent?  Oncologist said he sees maybe 3 or 4 patients a year (out of hundreds treated) who have this kind of reaction to aromatase inhibitors, but judging by the ratings here it appears more common.

I'm experiencing the joint problems and hot and cold flashes and insomnia.  Joint problems seem to flare up only at irregular times which I don't understand.
