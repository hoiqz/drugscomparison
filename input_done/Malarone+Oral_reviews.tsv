Prevention of Falciparum Malaria	how odd, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	3/9/2012 11:24:03 PM	At the recommendation of my travel medicine doctor I took Malarone for 2 weeks at the end of 2010 while in Laos. Even though I found the drug easy to take and didn't experience any of the more severe side effects, I did feel a bit vague and dizzy at times (kinda like having a bad hangover, even though I wasn't drinking). Nothing too unmanageable, more of an annoyance really. However, since coming off the drug, it's kind of difficult to explain but I feel less sharp and like my memory (both short and long term) is foggy. I'd definitely say I've experienced memory loss, sometimes I find it difficult to concentrate on what's going on around me and occasionally it takes me a few seconds to retrieve from my memory a word I want to use. I can't say for 100% that this is caused by the Malarone but I'm only in my mid-thirties so it shouldn't be age related. It's nothing serious, I just feel a bit vague. Anyway I'm only sharing this as a caution to others or as information in case anyone else who's taken this drug feels the same way. **Note: I rated this drug &quot;Effective&quot; because I didn't get malaria while on it but my travel companion did not take any anti-malaria meds and he didn't get it either. Obviously, if I could do it over and considering the way I feel now, I wouldn't bother taking the drug.

No listed side effects when there except - my hair started falling out (a lot). On my return, blood tests show a high reading on liver and kidney function. Now having retest to see why? I am tired, lethergic and down - the doc thinks it has been trigered by the Malaron
Prevention of Falciparum Malaria	amy t, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	8/24/2011 5:43:01 PM	 I took this medication for a trip to Uganda this Summer. I did not experience any side effects as in some of the reviews. I did have a very hard time sleeping, but it was also very hot. I also took this medication with a protein bar in the morning, to prevent any stomach issues. Hope this helps! Have a nice trip....
Prevention of Falciparum Malaria that is Resistant to Chloroquine	Katrina, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	7/29/2011 11:56:52 AM	I took Malarone for 20 days, starting 2 days before entering Tanzania, and 7 days after leaving the country. I did experience nausea, and vomited once just under a day after starting it. This is a common side effect, but I am a person that rarely throws up, and it wasn't too comforting having this happen 5 hours before before I spent 20 hours flying. Needless to say, it didn't happen again, and my stomach did quite well the rest of the trip.I'd heard that people experience crazy dreams and not be able to sleep when taking Malarone, and also that climbing at high altitudes(Kilimanjaro) would add to this, but I had no problems whatsoever. I actually stopped dreaming and slept even better, while most of the people I was traveling with discontinued the drug after only a few days of bad sleep and nightmares. The interesting thing is is that since I've stopped taking Malarone(3 weeks ago) I've had vivider and vivider dreams with each week that are becoming easier to remember. I'm really curious to know if anyone else has experienced this too, and why you might think it is.I was also taking dexamethasone(steroid) for altitude sickness for about 7 days, and experienced an anaphylactic reaction to food, followed by the use of an epi pen. It was a really odd reaction including near loss of consciousness(though oxygen was at 80% to begin with) and numb and tingly tongue and lips, one that I'm not used to(and I've had 10, so I've become used to the symptoms and how to recognize them), and it's hard to say if it was because of the combination of drugs I was already taking or not. Other drugs taken include zyrtec, allegra, hydroxyzine, zantac, and alvesco(inhaled steroid) all 2x/day, along with venlafaxine.

Stopped taking it one day, commenced the next day and same symptoms started again.  This was affecting my holiday so I stopped taking them.  Gradually felt better, although nausea continued when I got back home for a couple of weeks.  Would not take this drug again.  I was told that it is used for the treatment of malaria, and is very strong.  Would take sprays next time, and more natural precautions. This drug is very strong.

Since then she has had cognitive challenges, insomnia, confusion, headaches, and two serious episodes of frontal lobe seizures. She is still in the hospital after 5 days this time. We don't know yet if these seizures can be controlled. They come on following a night or two of insomnia. Seems most people are fine taking this drug but for some, it can be very risky. Be careful.

I took Malarone during my first trip (three weeks) and I am taking it now. I never experienced most of the side effects listed in other posts. I did have trouble falling to sleep at night and every day at around 4:00 p.m. I could not keep my eyes open and usually napped for about an hour. thinking back that could have been caused by the Malarone. I was told to always take with food, preferable a meal which contains some fat. I brought with me several bags of beef jerky and breakfast bars. Every morning when I awoke I would eat a piece of jerky, a breakfast bar, and my Malarone. I never experienced any of the gastrointestinal side effects includign loss of appetite.

Took one pill daily as prescribed and didn't observe any pronounced side-effects although did experience some symptoms (light-headedness, depersonalization, nausea and stomach ache)  which I am now recognizing, retrospectively, as having possibly been caused by the drug.Soon after I came back from travelling and discontinued the pills I noticed that my memory and mental clarity were reduced. This has persisted for the past year. My doctor says its anxiety, but after having read other reports of this type of 'brain fog' associated with Malrone on here I'm beginning to wonder. Cannot find any information on cognitive side effects or persistent side effects in long-term users but I'd be interested to hear if more people have experienced this problem. Email me on sosa56@hotmail.co.uk      
Other	grady7105, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Male	35-44	3/2/2010 9:49:57 AM	While in the African Congo, during a work assignment, I noticed symptoms appearing within the first 3 days.  Dizziness, nausea, loss of appetite, trouble spelling and reading, and everything seemed to move in slow motion.  After a week of using I noticed my urine had a foul odor, I began to urinate blood, and had spells of passing out.  Now I am off the medication and, have cold sweats/shakes, confusion, and there is nothing that my physician can do but monitor the symptoms.  I think the medication is poison and the persons responsible for putting this on the market should be shot.

Prevention of Falciparum Malaria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	1/15/2010 4:44:23 AM	This medication is poison. It was very slowly killing me. I had my first side effects about 3 days after taking it. Rash on my feet and knees. Anxiety, touble sleeping, shallow breathing, tingling &amp; numbness in my legs and arms and vivid crazy dreams. I was on a 2 wk and continued to stop and start the drug because of the severe side effects. I got home and was taking it for 4 days and by then was bed ridden and felt as though I was getting the flu or malaria. My bones were aching from the inside out. I felt like I had the worst flu of my life but yet had no symptoms of cough or fever... I experienced some serious memory loss as well. I felt unfamiliar in places that I should have known where I was. I felt as though I lost a serious part of my memory or something was very delayed. All in all, did not feel good or right. I will never ever take this drug again. I hope other people will realize the side effects and stop before you are having too many problems. Also on my drug description it says that if you get malaria you only have to take this drug for 3 days... So what are we doing here.???

I think it might be responsible for some hair loss but can't be sure. I tolerated it well as long as I ate something before taking the med.

I have been on the medication for 30 days now and have had 4 episodes of dizzeness with loss of peripheral vision(see stars and fuzzies at the outer edge of vision),  memory loss(I can't spell the simplest words, and nothing in print looks correct but is.)and a headache that feels like pressure on my brain.  These episodes last an hour or two and all I feel like doing is to sleep.  I think I will stop taking Malarone today.

I start two days before I leave (per my doctor) and continue for seven days after I return, taking the tablet with breakfast each morning.  My normal series is about eighteen tablets in all.  I have not contracted malaria and have not had the side effects the other reviewers have noted.  While I have had some pretty wild dreams, I have not had memory loss or issues with cognitive thinking.  All in all, Malarone has performed wonderfully for me and I plan on taking it on my next trip to Uganda later this year.  I am taking my young daughter along on this trip and plan on using the children's dose of Malarone for her.  If we have any issues or side effects, I will update this post.  Happy and safe traveling!
Prevention of Falciparum Malaria	PZ, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	6/1/2009 8:59:09 PM	Had taken Malarone at least 4 previous times with zero side-effects.  9 days into this round, on the plane ride back from Asia, with several more days to take it, started to feel slight tightness in chest - thought I was getting a cold.  Got somewhat worse by the time I reached home.  Next morning developed bright red very itchy rash all over and chest tightness was getting worse.  By evening, went to walk in clinic.  They thought I was having a heart attack due to abnormal EKG &amp; sent me to the ER.  ER confirmed it was just a drug reaction, not heart attack.  Put me on large dose of Prednisone.  Rash subsided &amp; chest tightness went away after about 24 hr but rash would start coming back as Prednisone dose wore off and would go away again after next dose.  After 3 days of that and rash almost completely gone, developed reaction to the Prednisone (had taken it many times with no problem before for poison ivy, etc).  Stopped the Prednisone, Malarone rash &amp; breathing issues stopped completely.  Took about 2 weeks to finally feel back to normal.  Now I can't take either drug.

It gradually spread down from the top of my back to my thighs.  I finally saw a Doctor who told me to stop (i've left the malarial area) and the rash seems to be reducing a bit.  But overall, it was one of the worst side effects I've ever experienced.

At day 6 to 7, I experienced nausea and lots of indigestion, burping, and gas.  By day 8, I took it without food, before bed.  Several hours later I woke up to vomit, hours later diarrhea; next day acid indigestion.  will try one more tonight after eating.  If same reaction, I need to stop.  I am back in the US outside the malaria zone, tempted to stop taking the medication.

Although it's listed nowhere on the side effects, I'm also experiencing forgetfulness, difficulty finding words, and mental cloudiness.  Is it possible that malarone is causing this?

Upon returning, I began experiencing loss of appetite, dizziness, severe diarrhea, and itchy rashes thoughout my body. After returning to my physician, I was told to stop the medication. I still have not regaining much appetite, but the diarrhea has decreased. The rashes are still present. They are extremely painful and am currently using outmeal baths to ease the discomfort. I suggest using another anti-malarial.

This time I had 21 pills and on the 17th day, I broke out in a flaming rash 3&quot; wide around my waist, it soon descended to the panty area and later in the day in the bra area.  A local physician advised me to quit taking the drug, but I had already taken the drug for the day.  He said the itching rash would go away in a week.  The next day after my bottom lip started swelling I went to the emergency room and was given a shot of something powerful + 4 pills and a prescription Ranittidine Hydrochloride 150 mg tablets, twice daily for 30 days and Predisone 20 mg twice daily for 5 days.  Today I am on my 4th day and still feel horrible (disoriented and tired out) but the rash has declined and has almost gone.
