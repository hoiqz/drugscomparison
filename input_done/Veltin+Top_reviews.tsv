Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	7/19/2012 9:17:27 PM	A lot of peeling and severe burning when I eat. I have only been using it for 9 days and my face is so much better.the medication seems to cause the most pain where my acne is the worse. I will see it through because my skin looks healthier than I could ever remember and it is working just maybe a little painful. I can deal with that vs. not wanting to leave the Ouse because I am 36 with ace.
Acne	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female		6/12/2012 10:35:02 PM	It's too soon to really see any effects of this drug yet or know if it's working, but I have some useful info:I've been using Veltin for about a week and a half now, and I have not had any more redness or burning like others. I had previously used a tretinoin gel (so I think that's why Veltin wasn't as much of a peeling, painful shock to my skin) and dermatologist gave me samples and these STRICT instructions: 1. At bedtime, measure out a small pea-sized amount2. dab the whole portion onto the center of my forehead3. split the Veltin on my forehead with my finger into quarters and dabing 1 quarter onto my right cheek/jaw area, 1 quarter onto my left cheek/jaw area, 1 quarter on my chin, and the last quarter stays on the forehead. 4. Rub the quarters into the areas of your face evenly.ALSO tretinoin, which is in Veltin, makes the skin extra susceptible to sun damage, so stay out of the sun. When I used 0.025% tretinoin gel on a daily basis as part of a previous prescription regimen, I'd get the painful, sunburn sensation when I overdid the medicine application. You gotta start off with small amounts and GRADUALLY increase the amount of gel used with anything that contains tretinoin or the area you're treating is gonna feel sunburned. Hope this helps!

At firstI thought my skin was gonna fall off. My Skin was peeling around my lips &amp; nose. My face felt sun-burned. I went back to my derm &amp; she said to go get hydra-cortizone (over-the-counter) &amp; I put it on the areas that peeled &amp; It really helped! She also said that I should take it every other day.  I have been seeing results It really helps heal my acne &amp; reduce bumps. Its really thick and Heavy but definately worth it. Keep taking it, the longer you use it the better!

Acne	Badly Burned, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	4/11/2012 3:45:43 PM	This medication is lethal and should not be on anyone face or anywhere. Its very expensive way for the doctors to help the pharmacy make money. After 4 weeks my face nearly burned off. Breakouts got worse than when I began. Lots of itching, redness and Im dark. Burning so bad you cant wash your face and the end result for me is dark bloches in my face like the thing. And lots of inflamation in my face. Please dont use this medication, it will probably be lethal to pregnant women as well. Beware
Acne	melandrich, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/24/2012 4:02:52 PM	I was given veltin gel due to severe acne. I hardly ever had acne in my teens but in my 40's it exploded.  Like some of the other reviews, my face got extremely red, peeled most all the time, felt like a severe sunburn. The only moisturizer I could use on my face was pure Vaseline.  but I realized the better I moisturized after I applied, the less it burned and peeled. I stuck with it because my face was awful with acne. After a couple of weeks it got where the burning and redness was not so bad.  It's going to peel some no matter what because it is a heavy exfoliater besides antibiotic.  But after a few weeks of getting used to it, I apply it at night, wait 30 to 45 min then do my moisterizer routine, then in the morning, I use a facial scrub (clinique 7 day) and do my normal moisturizing routine and my face has not looked this good in a long time.  If you guys just stick with it, the burning and peeling do get better and it really works.
Acne	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	11/28/2011 11:54:08 AM	I can't really give a review about the effectiveness of veltin as I've only been using it about two weeks. But what I will say is that my face burns like crazy. It burns to wash my face after using it and when I wake up in the morning and wash my face it is very sore and extremely sensitive. Even applying moisturizer is painful. I was prescribed veltin for bedtime use and finacea for the morning but my face burns so bad after washing it that I can't even put the finacea on and that never burned my skin until I began using the veltin at night. Also, I've noticed my skin does look worse now but I was told by several that that is to be expected in the beginning. Overall not too excited about this medication but I've had acne for 12 years so I'm ready for something to work therefore, I will try and stick it out with this for a while longer. That is, as long as my skin can tolerate it. Hope this helps as far as what to expect.

My skin is so clear, complexion has evened out and my skin is so soft. I use Veltin nightly after washing my face. I then use Cervae pm first then dap my forehead, cheeks, chin, and nose with the Veltin then rub it in. I have a few white heads which I never had before but the cystic acne is completely gone!

Acne	Smrtbld, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	10/2/2011 10:05:47 AM	My acne was diagnosed by a dermatologist and he gave me samples to use on inside of my thighs. I had severe redness and worsening of the skin along with severe itching and abdominal cramping. Now my skin looks worse and thanks to webmd I learned about the unexplained stomach cramping I've been having.

Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	19-24	6/3/2011 11:14:35 AM	I have only been on the treatment for a week now. The peeling on my face is awful. I am extremely compliant, but I tend to be impatient. Currently, I am very frustrated with veltin, but hopefully things will get better
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/5/2011 9:38:20 AM	It took a while (about 3 months) for me to start seeing consistent, good results. Now that I've been using Veltin for 4 months, my skin looks better than it has in years (I still get the occasional small blemish and dry/red skin that is common with many topical acne treatments). My skin is also softer than it has ever been. If you have patience, this is a great product to try.
