When I took tedral, it seemed like the drug breathed for me. It was a great relief. I no longer had to struggle to get air inside my lungs. It was automatic for me and I could breathe without thinking about each breath.However, when pregnant, after taking the drug, the child inside went onto a hyperactive state. I could certainly tell the difference in the child inside of me after taking tedral.

Yes, a full tab would make me anxious and nervous, but 1/2 was perfect for me. I found that Primatine tablets had the same formulation in the 80's. and over the counter! It saved my life. Inhalers do not work well for me, I feel worse when I use them. with bad tingling all over. Tedral was a miracle for me, I can't believe they removed it. But thru the years it becomes apparent that it is better financially for the pharmacy industry to get rid of it. Tedral was pennies, where as 1 dose of xoepenex is $7, and its crap. I am so sick of hearing the same &quot;drug pusher&quot; responce from the doctors that I need a $40 inhaler. I believe Canada still makes this drug. Now I take straight Theophyline in low dose when needed. Coffee also contains small amounts of Theophyline. Taken in proper dose I find some of these other postsnot credible.

Few years ago they told me I can no longer get this medicine. If it helps why can't I get it??? Any suggestions. My inhalers don't work good, and cortizone shots are hard on my heart and joints.

Other	herbjuice, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	65-74	8/15/2011 12:23:39 AM	I took Tedral as a child (1940's - 1970 for my asthma. It helped moderately - but it changed me. It made me cranky, nervous, shaky and in general, it made me feel horrible. It did help my terrible asthma though. Thank God there are better things today.
Other	barb, 7-12 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	7-12	7/14/2011 6:55:54 AM	as a young child i was prescribed Tedral, for severe asthma.  I absolutely hated it! it made me shake terribly. also made my skin crawl. i remember my legs bouncing so hard they would hit the underside of my school desk. my mother now says,why didn't you tell me how it made you feel?   I guess, I THOUGHT THEY KNEW..     tiny little tab, yet i would gag - .  anytime i got a chance i would throw it away- KNOWING i would prob end up in hospital-.  I think if doctor ever took Tedral himself, he wouldn't have given it to children, or anyone!

I, too, had asthma as a child, and was prescribed Tedral in the 1960's. It took care of my asthma symptoms very quickly, but the debilitating effects ran on for days after. The drug saves lives, but I found taking Theophyline alone-minus Ephedrine and Phenobarbitol-gave me the relief I needed to breathe, without the nasty side effects of shaking and feeling drowsy at the same time. That was a God-send. I NEVER took that Hellish medication again! Yes, I still have asthma, but these days Albuterol takes care of it with NO damaging side effects.

(An Adrenalin injection saved me from that.) I was four years old. I took Tedral until I went into high school when a steroid inhaler was prescribed. Tedral was terrible. It's worst side effect was a personality change. I became irritable and short tempered. I am surprised Tedral is still in use. I do not recommend it.

I have been taking this medicine since it was first introduced.  It was very effective in controlling my asthma attacks.  Too bad the individual in the FDA wasn't an asthmatic.
