Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	6/18/2012 9:17:44 AM	It has taken YEARS to find something that finally works for me.Expensive yes (with insurance $100.00) but I would pay the FULL amount. It has cleared my condition 100%. I use it once a day instead of twice and one can will easily last 2 months. I use a quarter size amount and it treats two fist size areas. It doesn't take a large amount to be effective!! Effectiveness and amount needed for treatment will vary from person to person I will agree...you just have to see what works best for you.

Skin Inflammation	lynnmooney, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	12/23/2011 5:46:25 PM	Of all the prescription medications that I have tried for this condition, this is the only one that will clear up my breakout.  I do wish there was something over the counter that would work and was less expensive.
Atopic Dermatitis	deaflounder@yahoo.com, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/11/2011 11:37:52 AM	In 2005, I had a blue cross insurance that time and bought a olux foam that cost me $80.00. Now I don't have ins and it cost me $400.00.. I can't afford and don't know why it is very expensive. Where can I afford to pay? I really want olux so very bad because it worked out on my head so well. Any suggestions?
Plaque Psoriasis	philsyes, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	4/19/2011 9:09:38 PM	I've had scalp psoriasis for over 20 years. It ranged from mild flaking to severe. Tried every OTC ointment, cream, shampoo, etc with varying and inconsistent results. Olux-E cleared up the condition in less that a week. Started at twice daily as prescribed, then reduced to once every couple days. My Doctor provided a discount card with the Rx to reduce costs to $15 per refill. This is absolutely the best treatment for my condition. I wish it had been available for my Dad who suffered psoriasis (elbows, knees, hands, etc) for many many years for as far back as I can remember - he passed away 3 years ago at 83 years old.

I have had this for 15 years and it has been 15 years of agony.  Then I found this drug and it is excellent, even if it is expensive it is well worth it.

Several doctors/several treatments - nothing worked. Olux-E cleared it up in less than 2 weeks. My daughter has eczema on back of thighs; not as much luck with that.

One can provided relief, but the product &quot;ran out&quot; after 5 days so I couldn't continue the treatment--consequently my itchy scalp returned.  I can't afford $220 every 5 days.  Who can?

Plaque Psoriasis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	8/23/2009 11:34:20 PM	The first two week treatment was highly effective. It cleared up nearly 90% of my psoriasis; however the following treatments have been less and less effective. In addition, I have been experiencing unusual muscle spasms in my upper back, shoulder, and neck region.

It got so bad I could't put the phone to my ears.  Olux-E stopped the itching and cleared up 80% of it within a week of taking it.  I still need to use it two day in a row every two weeks.  I read some reviews that a side effect is adult acne.  I have had some acne, and I didn't know why. So, thank you for your comments. 
Other	Kelly, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/30/2009 7:53:54 AM	My dermatologist prescribed this for me for folliculitis on my legs. After the first application the intense itching went away. The product is very expensive ($220 retail), fortunately I have a prescription drug plan and my doc gave me a rebate card to get $25 off so the cost to me was only $25.

Atopic Dermatitis	cpamom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	12/15/2008 7:20:49 PM	I have had ezcema on my hands for years and this definitely is the only product that has worked.  However, after a couple months of use, I developed adult acne and unwanted facial hair and it is terrible.  I have stopped using the OLUX for about a month now and the acne still has not gone away.  I guess it takes some time to get the medication out of my system.  I never had acne as a teenager and to start having it as an adult is so embarrassing!  So, beware of that side effect.

Most effective when dispensed directly to plaques and left in place until foam breaks down and absorbs (20-30 minutes). In my case this product was used in conjunction with X-Trac laser treatments.
