I haven't had any side effects either. I've tried Tricor &amp; Advicor &amp; my body became innume to them, so far my body like Lipofen, I highly recommend it.

We never got to testing my blood to see how it worked because I had to stop the medication.  I was having breathing problems and in general felt like I was very ill!  The symtoms got worse when I ran out of CoQ10 and that's when I decided to stop.  Also had muscle pain.

I had bloodwork done in January 2010 and my triglycerides were at a scary level of 920! After being on Lipofen 150mg for 8 weeks, my level is now at 152!!! This drug is AMAZING and I never had any problems with side effects. I would recommend this drug to anyone that wants to dramatically reduce their triglycerides and/or cholesterol.

In October of 2009 I started on Lipofen and so far it has worked great. I miss not being able to go to the tanning beds, as it suggests the medicine makes your skin more sensitive to the sun.

No more statin drugs for me... I'm sticking with Lipofen. 
High Amount of Triglyceride in the Blood	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	1/21/2009 9:21:27 PM	After a physical in December, my triglycerides were in the 470 range, which is over 3 times the &quot;borderline&quot; amount that is acceptable.  My dad had high triglycerides (among other issues, which I hope I can avoid, physical = wake up call) and eventually had 2 strokes.  I had my blood tested 6 weeks to the day later, and my triglycerides were at 157.  Obviously there were diet and excercise changes as well, but nothing over the top (more fruits and veggies, gym twice a week, so not that impressive).  I feel like this drug has given me a new lease on life, and now that the numbers are in check and stabilizing, I hope to be able to work hard with a better diet and more excercise to eventually be off the medication.

Just started Lipofen and I feel like a new person. Blood tests not until April. I'll report back on the results at that time.

I have found that Lipofen is actually much cheaper than the other medications. I got a coupon with my samples and it was the same price as the generics!

I doubt I will be on it long since at the time they did the blood test that put me on this, they have been testing me for liver damage too.  No side effects that I can see, but I about had a heart attack when I bought it at Walgreens, $80 for 30 pills.
