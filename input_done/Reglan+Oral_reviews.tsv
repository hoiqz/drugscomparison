Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	25-34	9/4/2012 6:45:55 AM	I went to the hospital for pain I was having due to my hiatal hernia. The nurse gave me IV Reglan. It did nothing to improve the pain. When I went home later that day, I felt like I had changes in my personality and was behaving erratically. What's really scary is that for the following week, I couldn't stop moving my legs when I was sitting down. Fortunately I didn't get the full blown tartive disknesia, but I can see how this drug could ruin patients' lives. Stay away from Reglan!

It crosses the blood-brain barrier which causes neurological problems. I experienced tardive dyskenesia: twitching of muscles in my face, mouth, feet.  The foot twitching has lasted years. I became depressed and unable to function normally. INSTEAD, take DOMPERIDONE, which does NOT cross the blood-brain barrier. You can get it from Canada. It works GREAT with NO side effects.

All of my muscles in my face froze with an occassional twitching of different muscles in my face. It was moving down into my throat. I am an ER RN and was working in the ED at onset of symptoms.  After an EKG, IV placement and the doctor ordering a CT Scan of my head, I stopped him and asked him to order IV Push Benadryl.  He ordered 50mgs and when the med was given my symptoms where gone in about 5 minutes. I was into day 3 when this happen. For whatever reason my mind took me back to nursing college and I remembered TD.....give benadryl. Reglan worked great for my stomach problem, but what an aweful side effect.

I was previously taking Zofran for nausea without any side effects. For some reason the ER doctor chose to give me Reglan. Big mistake. After only 6 days of taking Reglan I had to stop. I was experiencing confusion, dizziness, difficulty breathing, insomnia, restlessness, drowsiness and fatigue, and started having small tremors.  It became a struggle to sign my name or put my eye contacts in.  I felt so &quot;out of it&quot; one day at work I had to have someone drive me home, since I felt too &quot;impaired&quot; to drive myself. I didn't want to be a danger to anyone else. On the sixth day I finally figured out it was the Reglan that was making me so loopy. I stopped taking it and am still waiting to feel normal again. The Dr told me that it would be in my system for 12 hours, but it has been 36 hours and I'm not feeling totally back to normal yet, but I can tell it's getting better with time. Glad I figured it out after only 6 days, and didn't have to suffer any longer than that.

It took @ 5 years to get to a place of anywhere even near &quot;normalcy&quot;. It has now been over 10 years and he has never been completely the same; still has milder effects left over from the damage done. But, thank God he has at least gotten to this point.  The doc also added Paxil with it (to &quot;calm down&quot; his stomach area, as he said!). Unbelievable effects, tardive dyskenesia, suicidal thoughts, inability to function in his normal job (as an airplane pilot). As someone else said, we felt the same, just too tired and sick and dealing with the effects to be able to file a lawsuit. The doc should have been sued too, for mixing these medications. The most horrible long-term experience we've ever been through in now 37+ years of marriage. I absolutely believe this medication should be taken off the market for everyone.

I took three doses of this medication.  Immediately I felt very depressed, suicidal, and became a very angry, hateful person.  Especially to my kids.  I yelled and really thought about ending my life.  I am now on domperidone and love it.  I am feeling great and so happy that I was able to recognize the awful symptoms of Reglan and get off of it immediatly.  If you are concidering taking this medication, rethink again and do not do it.  
Stomach Muscle Paralysis and Decreased Function	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	2/16/2011 7:45:30 AM	After weeks of debating (and severe stomach pain/constipation/nausea caused by a mild case of gastroparesis), I finally decided to take Reglan. I was scared like the rest of you. But guess what? I'm still here and it's been about two weeks.It has helped me IMMENSELY. I'm pushing 29, so maybe I'm still in the &quot;safe zone.&quot; I know there is a threat to older women, but if I had not taken Reglan, I'd still be the vegetable that I was, living off of noodles and potatoes. When I looked for positive reviews on this drug, I found so very few. Thankfully, I have very close friends and family in the medical field and they assured me that the chances of the terrible side effects weren't as high as they may seem on the internet... It is a drug prescribed daily... and many people are pleased.  When you're pleased... why would you take the time to review it??! See what I'm saying?  Most people only make a big deal of something when it's negative...I hope that I can put a new perspective on this drug out there. It may not be for everyone and I'm no doctor.... but a small dose (5mg 3x daily) might not hurt to try. I wish all of you who struggle with this illness all the hope and luck in the world. It's a terrible, debilitating condition and I pray they find an alternative cure... The fear and anxiety associated with Reglan is enough to exacerbate symptoms. Take a breath and have some faith. You might regret it.. but, then again.. you might not?!

Nor did I ever have any warning by the pharmacist or written warning on the bottles.

Then it was taken off the market.  I've been on Reglan off/on for about 5 years.  I will be honest...For me it works wonderfully.  After eating I tended to feel really nauseated and uncomfortably full.  Reglan did what it was supposed to do and I felt relief within a half hour of taking it usually.  Though this drug works please take note that just like any drug out there you can begin to develop a resistance to it...In other words you'll need to take more and more for it to be effective.  Over time my dosage got larger and larger...Reglan and drugs like Reglan are regularlary used for people with more severe health problems to prevent nausea such as those on chemo or after surgery etc...I am in the medical field and just happen to be familiar with this...My fear was eventually this drug was no longer going to work for me and then at a time where I would really need it such as an emergency surgery etc...It would end up not working or being as effective.  OR I'd then have nothing to help me with the nausea anymore because there's not really a higher alternative...So, I did a complete lifestyle change...My diet is completely different and I no longer have symptoms anymore. I haven't refilled this medication in over 3 months and I used to take it on a daily basis.  My doctor is a believer in treating the cause and not just the symptoms...My symptoms are gone.  I don't recommend this drug to treat something like GURD.  Yes it works BUT if you take it continuously, in the end you may be left with nothing that works.   On a side note: I got extremely drowsy on this medication.  That's just an FYI.  The tidbits about it causing drowsiness and depression are definitely legit in my case.

It did help BUT after a few months he felt depressed, with severe anxiety. He started trembling, would not leave the house. This is a man that played golf and tennis every week. He started having very DARK thoughts. The first doctor did not connect it to reglan, I did my own research and figured it out. The GI doctor renewed his meds for 6 months, later we found out he was not supposed to be on it for over 12 weeks!! We were supposed to receive intense counseling, which we NEVER received. We ended up at a physchiatrist on anti-depressants, and xanax!!! DO NOT EVER TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!! My husband was not able to leave the house to work, no desire to do ANYTHING! He could not get a pen to paper his tremors were so bad, it was impossible to write. He could not even type on a keyboard, or talk on the phone(he would have to hold one hand with the other). It took a few months off the drug, and I am so HAPPY to report he is doing MUCH better!!! I wanted to post this so someone may find some hope from this awful drug! He still has some hand tremors, still on anti-depressants, and takes a small dose of xanax at night, YET he has his life back. When I was doing research I did not see find much hope in the reviews I read. I searched until I found a doctor that had seen this before. PLEASE do not give up, there is HOPE!!

But it worked great. I felt so much better while I was taking it that I was scared to not take it because I was scared of being sick again. I also had to take this for heartburn and because my food wasant digesting fast enough.
Throwing Up	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	11/16/2010 1:59:54 PM	Received Reglan after being admitted to ER for throwing up.  It stopped the nausea but made my involuntary movement disorder (Torticillis) worse.
Stomach Muscle Paralysis and Decreased Function	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/9/2010 6:07:05 PM	I was diagnosed with Gastroparesis approx. ten years ago.  When the bloating and nausea got to be too much, I was prescribed Reglan (metoclopramide) 10mg in 2006.  At first my only side effect was drowsiness, but after a while that went away, and it was great.  I wasn't as bloated or nauseated anymore, I was soo happy...  But then I started seeing the attorney commercials saying &quot;If you've taken Reglan....&quot;  It scared me, so I talked with my doc. and we decided it would be best to discontinue use of Reglan because she said cumulative use had a higher risk of developing Tardive dyskinesia or any Extrapyramidal Reactions.   I feel for you who have developed these horrible side effects.  Now I am bloated and nauseated all the time, it is horrible...but I don't dare take Reglan...so, I don't know what to do next...

Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	pamom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	10/21/2010 11:35:09 AM	I have been using Reglan for about 5 years now. It was the only thing prescribed to me that really helped for any length of time. However, when my dosage was higher, I did experience some side effects. I didn't realize that they were related until recently however. I have had some instances of the swollen tongue that I have read others have had, plus I've had the clenched jaw and some restlessness of my legs. I often have insomnia, but I can't say that it is definitely caused by the use of this drug. I've decreased the dosage in the past year, 10 mg twice a day, and have not experienced the above mentioned side effects. I never would have connected those things to this medicine if I hadn't seen some others who've used it also mention the same problems. I must say that reading some of the more severe side effects and hearing them from my doctor, I am trying to cut back even more on it. I do know that taking 1 10 mg pill once a day does not really help my condition though. I just think people should be aware of the side effects before using. 
Prevent Nausea and Vomiting After Surgery	BingoJ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	10/13/2010 1:56:25 AM	I had surgery on 10-12 and was given Reglan. It was 100% HORRIBLE! I'd never had it before. Was fine about having the surgery, ok with it, then they gave me this. I had a panic attack for the first time ever and I hope never again. I could not stop moving my legs, I had an extreme urge to run, and rip everything out of me. I felt like I had to escape but could not. Truly awful feelings.

But the side effects are far worse.  Insomnia, depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts.  Anger, mood swings, muscle twitches, blurred vision. I can eat anything if I take it. Spicy, fatty whatever.  If I forget to take it I experience GERD.  I guess I will have to adjust my diet, because I am quitting Reglan ASAP.

Nausea and Vomiting	ginfie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	8/11/2010 8:30:58 PM	I was given this medication in the hospital when I was admitted for severe acidosis.  I helped the throwing up but within minutes of being injected I had severe difficulty in breathing.  The Drs. thought I was faking after checking my blood pressure and continued to give me the injections.  This happened each time after an injection and nothing was done.  After leaving the hospital I was given oral tablets.  I took one and within 15 mins could not catch my breath.  Stopped taking Reglan and have NOT had any issues like this since.

I can now eat after 8 weeks on a liquid diet.However it has caused some mood swings and aggitation and really bad headaches. Still I can eat,(with no pain or vomitting) getting ready to switch to a compounded medicine because of the side affects. It did help and still is,I recommend only using for short time period.

Nausea and Vomiting	jam7031, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	7/13/2010 4:38:51 PM	I went into the ER for stomach pain. They gave me pain medication via IV as well as Reglan so that I would not be nauseated. Then I was sent to radiology to have a CT scan done of my abdomen which revealed kidney stones. But while i was on the table getting the CT done I noticed that my legs were turning in like my feet were pointing inward. The radiology techs kept asking me to be still and I could not becaus emy feel were inverting in and they were in that position so tight that I could not even move them back to a normal position. This was a horrible experience because it was scary not being able to control my limbs!!!

Before Reglan, I was in constant pain and had constant GERD.  My doctor warned me that I may feel jumpy or sluggish.  I felt slightly jumpy for about the first 3 weeks, then it went away.  I have not experienced the negative side effects described by others. 
Nausea and Vomiting	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	19-24	6/18/2010 1:39:47 PM	Reglan caused me to become very depressed and anxious plus it really didn't help with my nausea and vomiting.  I was extremely tired during the day however was unable to sleep at night. I was on Reglan for two weeks, before taking myself off.  Three days after coming off I notice a huge difference in my mood.  I would not recommand this drug to anyone
Stomach Muscle Paralysis and Decreased Function from Diabetes	John, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	45-54	6/14/2010 9:42:26 PM	I took this medication for six weeks to treat gastric paresis.  The prescribed dosage was 20ml, 3 times per day. I suffered severe depression while on this medicine.  I was extremely anxious and fearful of ordinary activities.  I was afraid to leave my home, and found myself hiding in the basement when the door bell would ring.  When relatives stopped in, I could not come out of my bedroom to greet them.  I feel certain that I would have commited suicide if I had continued to take this medicine.  I have now been off of reglan for 5 months, and still have occasional waves of severe depression, although I no longer consider suicide.  This is certainly a very dangerous drug, and my doctor did not warn me of the very serious side effects.  Be Careful if this medicine is prescribed for you or your loved ones.

Other	missa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	5/23/2010 5:39:46 PM	I went to the hospital because I had very bad headaches everyday and with no insurance it was all I could do. So once I was in the back at the hospital they started a IV and gave me Reglan through it. A minute later this drug made me feel extremely nervous,restless,and a lot of anixety all packed into one overwelming feeling. I felt so nervous I couldnt even get the nerve to tell them I was feeling this side effect and all I wanted to do was go home. I was finally discharged and they even wrote me a prescription for this crap, I threw it away and on top of it, it didnt even take my headache away. Dont waste your time with this drug. From past reviews on here seems like everyone has had around the same side effects. I'd rather have the headaches then these side effects any day.

Prevent Nausea and Vomiting After Surgery	llamamom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	5/1/2010 12:57:12 AM	I was given Reglan to keep me from vomiting during/after a colonoscopy.  I went to work after the procedure and began to feel like I was suffocating and choking to death.  A co-worker took me to the closest ER and they diagnosed it as a bad reaction to the Reglan.  They had to give me another drug to counteract the Reglan effects.  I will never let anyone give me Reglan again.Also, a doctor gave Reglan to my mother, who was in the nursing home, for reflux.  It immediately caused her to start shaking like Parkinson's.  The doctor recognized the effects and took Mom off of the Reglan, but she was never the same.  Mom died three weeks later and we will never know if her death was hurried along by the Reglan.Reglan should be taken off of the market and never again prescribed for anyone!!
Other	waiting, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	65-74	4/30/2010 8:47:00 PM	Endoscopy in Jan 2010 revealed numerous stomach ulcers from over-use of aspirin (6-8 daily for headache--stopped ASA on December 28 in prep for endoscopy) Ulcers were not accompanied by any stomach pain, so that finding was a surprise. Took antibiotics &amp; omeprezol and retested 4/27. No improvement in ulcers. Dr Rx'd Reglan 5-mg three times daily, 1/2 hour before meals, and this is day two. So far, have headaches again and feel sleepy &amp; tired. Activities have not diminished. Still normal work and social routine. I'm wary, though, having read the pharmacological info that came with pills. One &quot;tic&quot; and they're history--I hope. Maybe I'll be lucky. Dr. said two months but Rx was only for 15 days. Hmmmm....

I got so depressed, suicidal and homicidal. At first I wasn't sure if it was the Reglan or not, but then I noticed that right after I took a dose I would be fearful and just plain terrified.  I had to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital to prevent from hurting myself and others. I am still in the care of a psychiatrist and a therapist.  I am taking antidepressants and meds to help me sleep. I also experience tremors of my legs and hands.  This drug has ruined my life!  I have hired an attorney.   PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!

She started falling asleep standing up. She has had four seizures in the last five days. I took her to our neurologist at Duke hospital. He told my daughter to slowly wean herself off of the medication. Never just stop taking it. Next time you get a new medication,make sure you read the side affects. this is a very scary drug.  
Hiccups	ChgoGuy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	4/4/2010 11:00:54 AM	A bad case of hiccups sent me to my doctor and afterwards I was prescribed a daily usage of four Reglan 10mg tablets for ten days. After reading this site, I outright refused to take the medication and instead endured another long nite of hiccups. Another internet search landed me on other options for hiccups, I found BACOFLEN. A replacement prescribed after I told the doctor about my concerns regarding Reglan. My hiccups stopped and I feel so much better even though they were caused by pneumonia...the hiccups were my body's way of getting my attention for this unknown condition.  This site saved me a possible lifetime of regret!!!  Back in February 2009 the FDA stamped a BLACK BOX ALERT warming on Reglan. The sheer number of web sites from lawyers looking for new clients who used this drugs,comments, the FDA, etc. all add up to NOT FOR ME.

The only bothersome side effect I've had has been increased gas. I just don't understand how all these people have all of these adverse reactions to this medication. I take it in conjunction with another medication for my gastro reflux and have never had a problem other then increased gas.

Nausea and Vomiting	Hopeful, 75 or over on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	1	1			3/12/2010 1:03:32 PM	My 83 year old mother has been fighting stroke related nausea/vertigo for months. A doctor in a rehab center added Reglan to her list of other meds. 4 to 5 weeks later, we are back in the emergency room with extreme anxiety/fear, restlessness &amp; hand tremors. My mother is generally a ever aware elderly person. This Reglan has ruined her mental state. After the ER nurse mentioned that Reglan can cause tremors, I finally researched it and found the side effects match her condition. I had her taken off it the next day, but it's only been 24 hours. Xanax has helped. But I fear this will be a long term problem as many have written. Nice way to finish out your life, huh?
Stomach Muscle Paralysis and Decreased Function	shinoda77, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	3/10/2010 5:52:34 PM	I have been on this medicine for about a week now. My doctor warned me of possible side effects and told me it would be prescribed to me for no longer than 3 months. So far, it has been great. I have gastro paresis and severe reflux due to a hernia. It is a little inconvenient to have to take this before I eat but I deal with it. I still have to watch what I eat with the condition I have because when I do eat something I'm not supposed to, I pay for it. I have noticed that within an hour of taking the medicine, I feel sort of &quot;speedy&quot;, kind of shaky and get a burst of energy and I get hot but this lasts about an hour. I have not had any type of mood or personality changes. I needed something to help with the pain of the gastro paresis, I couldn't live like that anymore. I will stop taking it after 3 months and hopefully my stomach muscles will have regulated themselves. I don't have any bad feelings or thoughts about this medcine although I've read all the reviews.

Yes it can stop your period. With me, not only did it do that but I started excreting milk from my breasts. I was put on this for the Gastroparesis I was diagnosed with. It did help take away the vomiting and nausea but the side effects were too much. I found out that with diet changes you can pretty much control most of the symptoms of gatroparesis.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	2/7/2010 11:34:17 PM	I took Reglan for about a month when my first son was a baby.  The doctor prescribed it to help with my milk supply.  I wish I had never seen or heard of this drug!  I had SEVERE side effects from it, and my doctor did not put two-and-two together.  About 2-3 weeks after being on the medicine, I kept calling up to the dr's office telling them that something was not right, that I was tired all the time, and that I wanted to be tested for anemia.  They didn't seem to care.  Over the next weekend, I suddenly couldn't sleep at all, crazy thoughts started, and I entered a zombie-like state.  For the next week, everytime I would try to eat I would gag and throw up.  I didn't sleep hardly at all for a week.  I also couldn't sleep.  If I did manage to drift off for a little bit, I would have horrible dreams.  I went completely insane in that I had no more grasp of reality.  I had intrusive thoughts including suicidal thoughts.  I had never had depression in my life.  Luckily, my wise husband saw me taking the Reglan one day and for some reason we'll never know decided to throw them in the trash.  It took several weeks for the worst of the side effects to wane...and MANY months for me to realize just how much of it was drug-induced and to forgive myself for all the crazy thoughts I had during this time.  During the worst of these side effects, I was diagnosed with postpartum depression since I'd just had a baby about 8 weeks before this all started.  For about two years after this episode, I was scared to death about trying to have another baby.  Thankfully, my faith helped me over this fear.  When my oldest son was almost 3 years old I had another baby.  They always told me that if I had postpartum depression with the first, that I was likely to have it with the next.  I am thrilled to tell you that I didn't have any &quot;postpartum depression&quot; with my second (or third) son.  I am absolutely positive that everything that happened after the first was due to the Reglan!

I had finally found relief from the nausea and vomiting caused by the acid reflux. I have been taking this drug for 4 years and last year started having problems with my mouth neck and shoulder. I stopped taking it in Dec. 2009 and so far my symptoms have not gone away. I am in more pain and discomfort now and only hope that it will get better.

I only took it twice. The first time, I had TERRIBLE anxiety. It was awful. Since I had a history of anxiety and depression (which was in remission) I didn't make the connection. I just thought the stress of my recent wedding, the holidays, etc. had brought my anxiety back to the surface. I took the drug again about a month later and the same thing happened. I was up all night feeling like I was about to jump out of my skin! Only then did I make the connection to Reglan. I mentioned it to several nurses, psychiatrists, etc. since then and they all confirmed my theory. I think this is one nasty drug.

I have not had a period for 7months now. i found out that reglan increased my prolactin level which is the hormone that is in charge of lactation. as long as it is elevated i will not ovulate so I cant get pregnant.

Sometimes I have to visit the ER because my medicines are not effective at treating my migraines.  The last time I was there, I was given Reglan, like many other times.  I felt so anxious that I just had to hold back screams and I had the urge to kick my legs.  I would close my eyes and feel like I was shaking like a bobble-head internally (this is the best description I can come up with).  The doctor had me wait ten minutes because she said that the anxiety would stop, however it did not.  I had to be given a sedative just because of the side affects of this drug.  I will never take this again.  I cannot imagine long-term or daily use.

Had some physical side effects ut he WORSE was the depression that he did not understand and no one in our family did either.  After being on this HORRID drug for 5 months he committed suicide.  This drug needs to be totally remved from the market.  Nothing will help me now but it might save someone else's love one.  After his passing I met another lady whose husband was on the same medicine and also took his life.   I did report it to the FDA by filling in the online report.

I then read it was suppose to be for short term use. When I mentioned this to doctor, he stated they all say that. I immediately stopped medicine and developed dry mouth and tongue ticks. Fortunately, all symptoms are lessening. Do not take this medicine the advantages don't out weight the side effects.

I didn't want to eat and if I did I was nauseated and at times vomited. I became extremely depressed as I was missing so much work and I never went anywhere and had no energy to do anything. I lost over 30 pounds. My Dr. did every test/procedure known. Nothing was found to be wrong. He finally opted for Metoclopramide. He said that diabetics sometimes suffer from my symptoms. BINGO! The relief was immediate. I now take it only at bedtime or if I have that &quot;awful&quot; feeling I'll take it again. From the reviews I've read from others, I must be one of the fortunate ones. As for depression and tiredness, I'd suffered from that before taking Metoclopramide. To help with those symptoms I take Provigil and Cymbalta. I got my life back. I'm up at 4 AM, put in a full day as a NA in a hospital, I got my humors back and have energy to spare. I actually want to do things again. For me it has been a success. I regret others have had such dire results.

A week ago, I started noticing severe mood changes, anxiety, depression, complete loss of interest in doing the most mundane things. Over the weekend, I became extrememly nautious constantly, as well as restless and have had diarehha.  I called my doctor and they said to stop taking Reglan as it is a &quot;spooky&quot; drug and can cause these things.  I am so glad I have pinpointed the problem but I am hoping the effects are not lasting.  I feel like I'm going crazy! I can't eat and feel sick constantly. It has affected my work and my life.

I was told they felt like I was having a reaction to the medication (reglan) they perscribed for my stomach and they took me off of it. It took about 45 days before I could eat or speak without biting the inside of my mouth because my jaw was pushed out of alignment. My mouth was twisted all the way up on the right side.

I only take it when I take Imitrex for a migraine h/a. I have had no problems. I have only good things to say about Reglan, because it stops the nausea associated with my migraines and helps the Imitrex to work faster so I don't have to resort to an injection of Imitrex to control the migraine h/a. I only take 2 tablets with the Imitrex and until reecently had migraines down to once every other month or so. Have had more stress lately and an increase in migraines to 3 this past month. Still no side effects from the Reglan.

The Reglan worked quick and good for those symptoms. HOWEVER...like many other people I've read about, after about 1 month on the reglan, I began to notice depression, anxiety, etc. which I had never experienced and have no history of depression in my family. At first I blamed it on pre-menapause(48 and beginning the typical changes). Dr. checked the hormones, all was normal. Another two months went by and the depression was beginning to really affect my job and life. I realized after reading the reglan insert that came from the pharmacy that depression and severe mood swings was a side affect. Immediately stopped the reglan which through my into severe withdrawals, nauseau and diarhea for over 7 days could not eat, depression became dibilitating, went on disability, could not work or function. This was about a month ago, am on Remeron for the depression and am now feeling better and even normal most of the time. Hope this helps, hang in there, DO NOT give up. This medication has very bad side affects for many people. Had the exact same affect on my aunt 8 years ago. She says it took her 4 months to eat right again and 6 months on xanax to get back to normal. I am hoping to wean off the Remeron in 4 to 6 months and also hoping that the depression never returns (as it happened with my aunt)Hope this helps you all. Thank you all for your comments, it really helped to know that other people experienced the same and most have recovered fully. God Bless.

I still get the shakes in my hand ocassionally. This drug is just not worth being on. I eat smaller amounts and theat seems to help. I rather do that than be on a drug that makes me crazy.  
Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	Jewels, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	8/24/2009 3:22:20 PM	I was on this drug for slow stomach emptying problems along with acid reflux.( for 6 weeks )It was a tremendous help for the reflux and cured my gastroperisis. The doctor took me off but then my reflux has returned and nothing more has helped. I will be having surgery in September to fix the reflux, but have been on the Reglan for 3 weeks again. It's helping the reflux about 80% but I am started to notice some jaw clenching and some jittery hands.Also my depression is getting worse. I was thinking of taking myself off the Reglan.  I have 3 weeks left until surgery so I am not looking forward to feeling sick and the severe heartburn I will be getting without it. But the reviews and some of the experiences I am beginning to have are starting to scare me. Not so sure this is such a good drug, because of its side effects.
Stomach Muscle Paralysis and Decreased Function from Diabetes	Laura, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	8/24/2009 12:39:52 AM	I was diagnosed 3 years ago with Gastroparesis as a result of my Type I diabetes.  I immediately started having side effects such as an increase in depression and debilitating tiredness.  I went off the drug within a very short time.  There is another drug specifically for Gastroparesis, it is called Domperidone but can only be purchased with a doctor's prescription from a pharmacy in Canada or the U.K.  I have had no side effects from the Domperidone and it works to move the food through my stomach.

Minutes after the nurse put the drug in his IV line, his personality completely changed and he became extremely angry and restless/combatitive,screaming for water, and jumping out of bed, trying to pull the IV line out.Totally opposite of this gentle persons personality. This side effect lasted only maybe 15 minutes, but it scared me seeing him like that. I would NOT recommend this drug at ALL.

IT WORKED FOR THAT HOWEVER, AFTER BEING ON IT FOR ABOUT 3 MONTHS, I BEGAN TO HAVE SEVERE MOOD SWINGS. AT FIRST I BLEW IT OFF AS HORMONES BECAUSE I AM 48 AND(GP TESTED BUT HORMONES ARE NORMAL) IN PREMENAPAUSE. THE DEPRESSIONS AND ANXIETY GOT WORSE, IT READ THE INSERT OF REGLAN AND IT SAID IF YOU GET THESE MOODSWINGS TO TELL YOUR DOCTOR. SO I STOPPED TAKING REGLAN, HAD SEVERE WITHDRAWALS, COULD NOT EAT FOR 6 DAYS, DIAREAH, AND THE DEPRESSION IS UNBARABLE. NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH HORRIFIC DEPRESSION, I CANNOT FUNCTION, ON TEMP DISABIITY, CANNOT WORK, I AM A SINGLE MOM AND CANNOT WORK. MY GP PUT ME ON REMERON FOR DEPPRESSION, ONLY BEEN 5 DAYS AND NO RELIEF YET. STILL HOPING. TURNS OUT MY AUNT HAD THE EXACT SAME EXPERIENCE FROM REGLAN AS I DID. BAD, BAD,BAD, CANNOT EVEN EXPLAIN HOW EXTREME AND BAD THIS SIDE AFFECT IS. IT HAS DESTROYED ME. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR REVIEWS, IT HELPS TO KNOW THAT THIS WILL EVENTUALLY GET OUT OF MY SYSTEM AND I CAN BE NORMAL AND WORK AGAIN. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND KEEP THE FAITH THAT WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS HORIBLE EXPERIENCE. IT TOOK MY AUNT ABOUT 4 MONTHS ON XANAX TO GET THROUGH IT. 
Prevent Nausea and Vomiting After Surgery	ida, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	8/11/2009 3:12:05 PM	I was given Reglan intravenously to prevent nausea after surgery.  I immediately felt like I was experiencing anaphylaxis.  I had difficulty breathing and swallowing.  I became shaky, had SVTs, rapid heart rate shortness of breath, tremors and jerks.  This lasted for over a month and most symptoms slowly subsided. However I have been left with a movement disorder. I have tremors in my hands, arms, legs, face and jaw.  My eyes have difficulty staying in the same place for an extended period of time.  I have to exaggerate my speech patterns so as to not stutter over my words.  I get exhausted from the constant movement.  This was from 3 doses of IV Reglan administered after surgery 8 years ago!  I may have been given Reglan on two other occasions for two surgeries just months previously to this, what I thought at the time was an overdose, administration of Reglan.

I have gastreoparesis and took reglan 2 times a day.  After taking the medicine for about 3 months I began having the jitters, depression, sweats, problems sleeping.  I could be the poster child for the side effects as I have had about all that is listed.  Thanks to all for the honest responses to their experience on this medicine.  I thought I was about to lose my mind.  I have not been able to enjoy life for about one month and just discovered my problems were related to the effects of reglan.  It seemed to work and help for awhile but now I am miserable.  The least little task seems overwhelming.  I am tired but cannot sleep, have no appetite and dropped 30 pounds quickly.  I experience the teeth clenching, muscle twitches, rapid heart beat, rigid muscles.  I went to the my primary Dr. and he prescribe an anxiety medicine for stress.  Now I have just found out about the reglan side effects and waiting on a call from my gastrointernist.  I would never expected a drug to take such a toll on my life.  I have gone from a happy, enthusiastic person to listless, depressed and exhausted.  I hope this can help someone realize their problem caused by reglan therapy and find relief from the side effects.
Nausea and Vomiting	fletcheq, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	19-24	8/5/2009 12:16:06 PM	I suffer from severe migraines, with nausea &amp; vomiting and the dr. prescribed this to me about a year ago. I took it 3 times a day (like the dr said) and after about 3 days, I could hardly talk, my whole body shook, my neck was stiff, my tongue stuck out (I couldn't control movement of it), and I had a smirk on my face (like someone has once they've had a stroke). It scared my family to death, because they thought I was having a stroke and a seizure (I had them as an infant). Now I have to take Zofran. Because they told me to avoid Compazine, and Phenagren as well (not to take a chance with them). I would not recommend this drug to anyone. I spent 12 hours in the E.R. getting I.V. Benadryl (for the reaction), Zofran, Toradol, and Dilaudid (for the migraine).

Throwing Up	Plant Crone, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	65-74	7/28/2009 12:54:02 AM	I very much appreciate all the warnings from people who have had bad experiences with Reglan,  however it seems to work for the majority of those whom it has been prescribed for, with minimal or no side effects.  Discontinuing a drug because it causes problems in a few unfortunate people is not considering the effectiveness for most of us.I myself am dealing with some feelings of fatigue and some depression but as I am aware of these issues I can talk to my doctor about them if they continue-thanks for those of you who posted.I was RX'd this drug about 2 weeks ago as the final possible solution to an ongoing nausea issue caused by an e coli infection wherein the nerves in my esophagus were rendered inoperable and no longer signaled my esophagial muscles to swallow.  As a result I vomited severely after every food intake and lost over 40 lbs-I am already thin.  My doctor had run out of ideas and I found this drug by Googling my symptoms- Since I began taking it, I am able to eat and actually keep food down.  I no longer have the terrible blockage feeling in my throat.My doctor was hesitant to RX because of the tardive dyskensia and other side effects and I promised to notify him and discontinue if I noticed ir, but I am being very aware of my bodies status and so far no problem.I take 5mg about a half an hour before eating only when I am going to have something of substance-I can swallow liquids ok and eat yogurt, which was what I was living on prior to this, and I still tend to eat soft foods not wanting to push tyhings too much.I hope I don't have any of the side effects but honestly, I might still take the drug and deal with side effects instead of slowly starving or being hospitalized  or with a feed tube the rest of my life - which were my options prior to Reglan.
Nausea and Vomiting	Pregnant Seizure, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	7/27/2009 1:37:28 PM	Take at your own risk. My wife was pregnant and had the normal nausea. With our second child it was much more pronounced. She was prescribed the generic Reglan and placed on for 4 months (entirely too long), but we have heard of other pregnant women being on as long. This was before the recall. Less than a month after taking my wife began to have some symptoms of the tardive dyskinesia with eye ticks in particular. In her case though she has had multiple grand mal seizures that have only been surpressed through medication which creates its own set of problems. This is now a permenent condition we believe she will be stuck with for a very long time. Until we heard about the recall a few months ago we just thought it was an unexplainable cause. As the past few months we have heard more stories from pregnant women with their OBGYN's seemingly very concerned if their patient has ever been on this drug.

My daughter was born at 32 weeks and put in the NICU for 6 1/2 weeks, during this time my breast milk supply came in, was doing good and then began to slow down till I was barely getting one ounce every two hours, when before I was getting 4.  The NICU dr. gave me Reglan to increase production, and it has worked, the only drawback is if I stop taking it my milk production drops, that day.  I have noticed I am having some spasms in my face, arm and toes recently. About 30 minutes after taking it I become exhausted and have to sit somewhere, anywhere because I cant seem to keep my eyes open, but it passes after 30 minutes or so.  I am also anxious and paranoid to the point of hysterics, and I was never ever this way before.  I took anti depresants and they seemed to make it worse so I stopped those, I didnt know about the side effects of Reglan untill I read the reviews on Web MD today.  I am going to call my dr on Monday morning. I want to continue breast feeding my daughter but I dont know how this medication could be affecting her.  She stops breathing and has an apnea monitor she has been wearing since we came home from the hospital.  I am wondering if that could be the reason, because the drs dont know why she stops.  She is 4 months old now.

After reading the side effects, I nixed it for her.  I am so sorry that some of you have been floored by the side effects, and wish anyone a speedy recovery.  Thank you all for rating this drug.  The dosage amounts are across the board.  Do the professionals (Huh?) that are subscribing this even know what is the deal, or are they getting &quot;greased&quot; to perscribe this?  FDA wake up!
Nausea and Vomiting	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	19-24	7/5/2009 2:09:04 AM	Yes, this med works for nausea BUT I DO NOT SUGGEST ANYONE TAKE IT.  Why?  Well it caused me to be suidical (I am generally upbeat and never down), caused me to not be able to sit still, caused me to be paranoid and gave me the WORST unbearable feeling of anxiety.  Reason I say no one should take it is because you do not know unless you take it how you will respond.  But being nausous and vomiting was FAR BETTER than taking this drug.  I much rather be in pain with an obstructed bowel (which i have experienced) then EVER take this.  WHAT I SUGGEST PEOPLE TAKE: Zofran.  If you are nausous and vomiting, this is ur ticket to feeling better!  I cant express ENOUGH how HORRIBLE reglan is! Please please please do not take this, i dont want anyone to go through those horrible feelings I went through while I was on this drug.

Other	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	3	1	Male	55-64	6/26/2009 3:41:56 PM	My Dr. prescribed this medicine and I took it. But I had the symptoms of Parkinsons and was put in a mental institution and kept there for two weeks and kept on the Reglan. Then I was transferred to my regular hospital and was taken off the Reglan and became normal again. This medicine is dangerous and should be taken off the market. I spent the two weeks in the mental hospital for no reason other than the Reglan and the Parkinsons effect on me. No one knew what was happening until I was taken off the medicine. Be careful when taking this medicine. Make sure the doctor that gave it to you makes the other doctors aware that you could get a bad reaction from it such as Parkinsons.

My doctor which I saw yesterday had asked me if I had any symtoms. Didn't think of any. After reading all the reviews, I have been feeling nervous, jettery, and anxious.  I had no clue it was from the drug. Now I know why the Dr. asked, but fell to clue me in on the drug awful side affects. I did feel this right after I started taking the drug on 5/27/09, am still taking it till today. I have enought problems without this causing anymore to my life. STOPPING TODAY!!!

I am also a diabetic. If this is the correct med., which i'm almost positvie it is, i had a side effect of it. My body was producing breast milk and NOOO i wasn't pregnant, had a tubal after last in 2001.  My last child was born 3yrs prior to taking this drug.  I was 40 yrs old at the time i was taking it.
Throwing Up	kackymarie, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	5/14/2009 1:42:47 PM	This medicine has been a miracle for my son. He was brain injured 21 years ago. He now lives in a nursing home and, after years of arguing with him to eat and drink, I had a feeding tube placed almost 2 years ago. I thought this would solve our problems but it didn't. He would retch, erp and vomit frequently. He still argued about water as he could tell that he was full. After another hospital stay, being dehydrated because of vomiting, a DR finally figured out he had gastorparieses (sp)put him on Reglan and it's been a miracle! He is gaining weight and rarely, sometimes he still does but not often, argues about water. Never retches or vomits anymore. We were warned about the side effects so know about them. I guess it comes down to he would have died sooner than later. He's happy, no side effects at all. If it happens later I can say I was warned. Another young boy, 8 years old, with a terrible disease that causes him to vomit for days on end, was put on Reglan. Didn't stop it completely but definitely helped. I'm sorry for all those who did suffer side effects. Were you warned? I'm sure you were. EVERY medication has side effects and some don't affect some people and some do. You take the risk.

I have started having slight hand tremors frequently along with having trouble articulating words correctly.

Although i felt it starting to make my stomach feel less full after I ate, the side effects that develeped made me misearable. I felt restless, anxious, jittery, and irritable. I was extremely tired yet could not sleep or even sit still. The symptoms became worse and I developed muscle twitches in my legs, arms, and neck. My legs were always kicky. One day I felt like I was going crazy so I called my doctor and he said to take some benadryl and stop taking the reglan. The side effects have now stopped but I am now left with the same problem with my stomach that I started with. Use total caution before deciding to take reglan!

By the next morning I could hardly lift my arms and over the next 48 hours I barely was able to write. I noticed my legs could not be still and a tremble in my arms.  I thought I might have had a light stroke and then it occured to me that maybe I was having a reaction to Reglan.When I called my Dr the next day I told his nurse that something was happening to me,I had either had a light stroke,was developing Parkinsons or was having a reaction to Reglan.  She came back and said to immediately stop the Reglan and to go the emergency room and tell them I needed an IV to counteract the reaction. It's been about 3 years and now I have reactions to almost everything ,have to be very careful what I take.  Medication seems to affect my motor skills like Reglan. So possibly it could still be in my system.

I was on a very high dose at first and I was able to eat normal meals and not throw up (still some nausea) but I had side effects like drowsiness during the day, insomnia at night, excess gas/flatulence and restlessness/anxiety. Then I was put on a lower dose and the side effects decreased a little bit. I am now trying to wean myself off of it because I am concerned about the anxiety symptoms.
Stomach Muscle Paralysis and Decreased Function	graciesls, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	4/17/2009 7:59:29 PM	 Please read my whole review for the FDA warning. I was perscribed this medication for gastroparesis. I have been on it for about 35 days. It has greatly reduced the pain and is helping the food move properly. I have had no noticeable side effects. Unfortunately, this drug SHOULD NOT be used long term. The FDA just released a warning that will now be required to go in the information packet (as if anyone can stand to read through the entire thing). You can find this on the website http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2009/safety09. htm#Metoclopramide and it says the following: [Posted 02/26/2009] FDA notified healthcare professionals that manufacturers of metoclopramide, a drug used to treat gastrointestinal disorders, must add a boxed warning to their drug labels about the risk of its long-term or high-dose use. Chronic use of metoclopramide has been linked to tardive dyskinesia, which may include involuntary and repetitive movements of the body, even after the drugs are no longer taken. These symptoms are rarely reversible and there is no known treatment. Metoclopramide is available in a variety of formulations including tablets, syrups and injections. Names of metoclopramide-containing products include Reglan Tablets, Reglan Oral Disintegrating Tablets, Metoclopramide Oral Solution, and Reglan Injection. Manufacturers will be required to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy [REMS] to ensure patients are provided with a medication guide that discusses this risk. Current product labeling warns of the risk of tardive dyskinesia with chronic metoclopramide treatment.....I will only take this medication for another 30 days out of fear of permanant damage. I have read that Domperidone works in a similar way without breeching the blood brain barrier. Unfortunately it is not approved for the U.S. I may try to get some from Canada but am a little worried about the safety of that process. I'm disapointed reglan has such horrible side effects as it works.

Got sicker and was diagnosed with gastroparesis.  I started taking this drug and felt a little better but not much.  Then started getting depressed and had suicidal thoughts.  Was it the Reglan or my illness?  Stopped taking Reglan and started taking Domperidone.  Depression went away quickly and after a few weeks started to feel almost normal again.  Two years on Domperidone and I feel great with no side effects.  Reglan should be banned and Domperidone the choice of drug for gp.  That drug is a godsend.

Other	heathert87, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	4/6/2009 11:51:35 PM	I began taking Reglan to increase my milk supply while I breastfed my son. It worked for producing the milk, but I had to stop taking it because I started having unbearable, severe migrains. At first they started out kind of rough, but I could take the pain. After 5 days, they became absolutely unbearable so I stopped the meds and sure enough the migrains went away. I also had a friend who took Reglan for the same reason and she began having seizures. So just be very cautious when taking this med.
Nausea and Vomiting caused by Cancer Drugs	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	2	3	1	Female	55-64	3/28/2009 12:25:54 PM	My husband has been taking this drug for three months due to nausea caused by chemotherapy. He has taken it orally at home and by injection during hospital stays. During the past few weeks he has often fainted when he stands up, developed painful muscle spasms in his back, and a shuffling walk. He has also been very depressed, but he has an aggressive form of lymphoma, so depression is understandable. The pain and blood pressure medications prescribed to cure these symptoms haven't worked, so we researched the side effects of Reglan and were very surprised to see that the muscle spasms are a common side effect of this drug. He has stopped taking the drug and we hope that the painful spasms go away, but from what we have read, they may be with him for the rest of his life. This drug should be taken off the market. The risks are not worth it -- especially since the hospital nursing staff and the doctor didn't seem to be able to figure out that these were drug-induced side effects and not a new illness.

Experienced swelling in my hands and face and immediate weight gain(4 lbs) within the 1st week.  Also felt very lethargic.  Cut dosage in half(from 4 pills to 2) and lethargy and swelling went away. It has eased my stomach pain and constipation.  Planning to wean myself off this week (week 12).

Nausea and Vomiting	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	3/14/2009 10:05:56 PM	I took this medicine for 6 weeks for nausea from pregnancy. I just stopped it 3 days ago and have experienced horribly severe withdrawal from it, even though some professionals said there was no withdrawal from it. I had severe depression and anxiety. I didn't sleep at all for 2 nights and had to go to the hospital to get a shot to help me sleep. I was pacing and shaking, every time I tried to lie down to sleep I couldn't keep my legs still. I've never felt so miserable in my life, like I was going crazy and would suffer from depression and anxiety for the rest of my life. As I was going through this and came across these reviews, I realized that the Reglan was probably causing some other symptoms I'd been having but had not realized it. Some depression and trouble sleeping while I was still on the medicine. It is bad stuff!

He just stopped it after we realized all of the side effects he had are making him a different person! he now has anxiety and depression, which he has never had. He can't sleep and is very tired,almost zombie like. Now we are waiting to see how long it takes to get out of his system and hopefully he will be back to himself. I also believe this drug is dangerous and should be taken off the market.

My legs and arms twitch with no relief. I have been off of it for 1 year and no relief what so ever. No doctors can help me. I would never take this drug again, it should be banned. It might do a good job for reflux but the side effects are not worth it.
Stomach Muscle Paralysis and Decreased Function	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/2/2009 3:34:43 PM	I was diagnosed with gastroparesis in 2000 and put on this drug to aid with my delayed stomach-emptying. Right away, i felt extreme fatigue, to the point that i would fall asleep whenever i sat down and even sometimes when standing up. I started to feel anxious as well, and depressed. I assumed i was depressed and anxious about my gastroparesis diagnosis, so i continued to take the drug, despite the fact i really didnt feel it was helping my stomach empty any faster. The anxiety got worse, i started to feel scared to be alone, i started to feel paranoid, and i felt no interest in doing anything that i used to enjoy. When i told a friend in the medical field how i was feeling, and mentioned casually that i was now on Reglan for my GP, he immediately told me about Reglan's reported side-effects and i put two and two together and stopped taking the medication immediately. After stopping, i felt better, but not back to normal, and i had to be put on Celexa (an anti-deprssant) in order to feel calm, happy, and like myself again. It took me 8 whole years to wean off the celexa, to the point that i finally feel like myself without meds, for the first time since starting Reglan. I believe this medication should be banned - Im glad it got the black box warning, but that is not enough. It is dangerous stuff!!

I had gastric cancer, and found I still had nausea &amp; vomiting after 3 years of remission.  I do take Protonix for Acid Reflux.

Nausea and Vomiting	Rebecca, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	2/8/2009 5:02:18 PM	I took this medication for about three days after being in the emergency room twice with symptoms of nausea and severe vomiting from a headache after a spinal tap procedure.  The meds helped my nausea, but made me horribly paranoid and I couldn't sleep at night.  I was so paranoid, I stopped eating because I was convinced I would get sick, even though the Reglan was working.  I would shake whenever I tried to sleep or lay down, and was so horribly nauseous from not eating that I was relying only on the Reglan to help.  I only took it for three days and it caused all these problems!  I stopped taking it and began taking Prevacid for my nausea and can eat normally again, without being anxious and paranoid!  Do not take this medication orally!!  I also had it via IV in the emergency room and did not have any issues with it when given that way however.

I was amazed at how quickly it worked and how it treated all of my severe GERD conditions as well as the bloating after meals.  Within a few months I was calling my OB/GYN pleading with them to increase my estrogen because I blamed all of the symptoms I was experiencing on menopause (I am 49)I was incredibly depressed, anxious, and prone to crying outbursts.  Generally I felt hopeless and unable to concentrate or function.  My daughter was getting married and I couldn't enjoy any of the planning.  In short, I no longer knew who I was.  Finally I called my sister who is an OB/GYN nurse and described my symptoms.Immediately she said it was the Reglan which she knew I was on.  She had witnessed first had the horrific side effects when pregnant patients with serious nausea were give the drug.  She told me she had hoped I wouldn't suffer any of the side effects.  I called my GI who acted as if I was a little bit dramatic in my report of my symptoms.  She also said she had never had any patients with these side effects.  It told her that is only because they had never made the connection between the symptoms and the drug.  Who would?  I am thankful for my sister's recognition and have been off the drug since early July.  By my daughter's wedding in early August I had improved but it took at least another two months to be completely back to my normal self.  Like many others I believe this drug should be banned.

I watched this medicine slowly take my mother away from me. She was on it for 7 months and only off of it for 2 weeks until she finally commited suicide. Yes, she killed herself from this medicine. This medication NEEDS TO BE TAKEN OFF OF THE MARKET!! She had anxiety, depression, confusion, muscle ticks, suicidal thoughts, no appetite, constant diarrhea and lost down to 91 lbs. She shot herself in the head with a handgun on 11-25-08. I hope no one out there loses a mother (grandmother, father, friend, etc...) Please warn everyone that this medication has rare side effects that aren't so RARE afterall!  I tried to help mom with dr visit after phone call after lab work after doctor visit and it was just too much for her to handle. I don't have a mom anymore and it's a horrible pain I hope I can spare for someone.

It was prescribegd by my  primary physician and then by my GI specialist. I began to have severe depression, anxiety, teeth clenching and trembling. My doctor prescribed Zoloft and Xnax which I took with the Reglan. I was totally out of it for weeks and could not get off the couch or even talk. I looked up reglan on the internet and was shocked at the adverse side effects. It was 100% what I was experiencing. I called both Doctors who told me to immediatley stop taking Reglan. I am having severe withdrawal systoms and am still not able to function at a normal level after 4 weeks of being off the reglan. This drug is dangerous and I am not at all happy with the two doctors who prescribed it for use over a long period of time. Please report to the FDA, I have e-mailed them and called to be sure my report is on file. Something needs to be done to take this drug off the market asap.

It has worked wonders for my nausea and vomiting but are these side effects worth it? I dont think so. Before taking this drug, I never had any depression, anxiety, or any of those symptoms. I am so glad to have read these reviews. Now, I have to get off the Reglan but am very scared of these side effects getting worse or them not going away at all.
Feel Like Throwing Up	cath, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	10/27/2008 4:42:55 PM	Was prescribed Reglan along with Omeprazole  for Reflux , feeling of something stuck in throat,nausea and lack of appetite.  It worked fine at first and I was on the combination for approximately 3 months. Then I started feeling terrible anxiety,restless legs,couldn't sit still, cramping in my hands,and horrible dry mouth,so I stopped the Reglan but the anxiety continued so badly that I ended up with a panic attack and was given Ativan. I also had several sessions with a counselor and support group. It took 3 months for the anxiety symptoms to go away. It was a terrible experience aand i do think the drug should be recalled.
Nausea and Vomiting	my2000angels, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	1	1		35-44	10/22/2008 11:07:13 PM	I was put on Reglan for Gastropresis that caused Nausea and Vomiting about 2 years ago.The side effects were too much to live with. I became very depressed,couldn't sleep for weeks on end, caused facial twitching, and because of the depression I over dosed and almost lost my life.  Please think twice before taking this midication!!!
Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	Buzzy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	1	Male	35-44	10/22/2008 10:08:04 AM	As someone who has gotten over the effects of this medicine, I thought I'd share my experience with those of you who are suffering. I was prescribed Reglan by a pulmonary specialist for a chronic cough, 10mg 3 times a day before meals, 2 more at bedtime. I followed this regimen for 7 months until the side effects caught up with me. I was depressed, anxious, had suicidal thoughts (even though I would never act on them), lethargic, was even pacing. Normally, I'm a laid back, carefree person, so this drug really zapped me. I felt hopeless, didn't find joy in the things I used to enjoy, even something as simple as running an errand was a MAJOR challenge. My regular doctor, after a few visits, referred me to a gastroenterologist, who told me to stop the Reglan IMMEDIATELY, and said that he would never have recommended such a high dose, let alone taking it any longer than 12 weeks. He gave me Aciphex for a few months for the GERD problem that caused my cough (no problems). He performed an upper endoscopy on me a week later to make sure things were okay, and they were, then I went back to my regular doctor who prescribed Zoloft (50mg) to me which I took each morning. My side effects with Zoloft were lack of sexual drive, and insomnia (for which I took 5 mg Ambien each night). It seemed endless. I would go to work, and just be miserable. It took me just short of 3 months to get over the effects of the Reglan, and I finally started to feel like myself again. I tapered off the Zoloft by cutting the pill in half, taking 25mg once a day for more weeks, then stopped altogether. To give a timeframe, I stopped taking the Reglan on 02/21/08, cut the Zoloft from 50mg to 25mg on 05/15/08, then stopped the Zoloft completely on 06/06/08. I hope this helps someone, if you're trying to get over the side effects of Reglan - hang in there, there IS light at the end of the tunnel. It just takes time, which unfortunately just crawls when you're trying to get over this terrible drug.
Nausea and Vomiting	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	13-18	10/19/2008 9:26:50 PM	I had been taking this med for my gastroparesis. After almost 6 months of persistent vomiting after every meal for over 4 months. It was prescribed to me in Jan. Took the meds for about 3 months and it seemed to help. I began to feel constantly anxious, fear of living, constant agitation, felt uncomfortable in my skin. I was diagnosed with in May with a severe case of Major Depression Disorder. After crying for several days, my mom contacted the dr that prescribe the meds. He said that it was a very rare side effect and unlikely. I stopped taking the meds once diagnosed, and in two months, the depression went away. My gastroparesis has returned, I have been taking the meds for two weeks now. Today I had a melt-down. I've come the conclusion that it is the meds. Beware. The side-effects can be hidden. It's not worth the side-effects in my case. I'd rather feel sick, and vomit everything I eat, than be afraid to live!

Stomach Muscle Paralysis and Decreased Function	Donna, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	35-44	9/20/2008 10:06:32 PM	I was prescribed Reglan for stomach pain and decreased function. I take no other drugs, supplements, or prescriptions. After taking Reglan for only three days I was experiencing very swollen and tender breasts, early period, and, initially, severe leg pain.  I took myself off of it on the , fourth day.  That was on December 1, 2007, almost ten months ago. I continue to have irregular periods and it wasn't until this past summer that I started to get some relief in my legs.  Now the leg symptoms come and go: burning, tingling, aching,and numbness. Last spring I went to a neurologist to make sure that nothing else was causing my problems.  He put me through some tests, and could not find anything wrong with me like MS, etc. What he found interesting is that my leg pain goes away when I walk or exercise, as I was able to continue with my activities, like aerobics and hiking without problem, but sitting for long periods of time and crossing my legs were difficult until this past summer. It was the worst at night after I went to bed, but the pain immediately stopped when I got up and walked around, and began five minutes after I got back in bed. The drug worked for its purpose, but I DO NOT recommend it at all.

Each time I ate something, it felt like I got a kick in the stomach.  The pain was getting worse, after bigger meals. I decided to eat 5 small meals a day, but it didn't help much.  I've tried, Nexium, Prilosec, Protonix.  Finally, after few abdomen sonograms, MRI, colonscopy, endoscopy and nuclear scan - my GI doctor decided to put me on aciphex and Reglan. I can finally switch from blend food to normal food.  Although I stay away from deep fried, greasy and spicy, at least I can enjoy eating again.  Highly recommended for those with the same stomach issues.  Haven't experienced any side effects yet...
Stomach Muscle Paralysis and Decreased Function	Paula, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1		19-24	9/12/2008 11:56:44 PM	I was diganosed with gastroparesis during an endoscopy.  I had issues with throwing up food several hours after consumtion.  This medication was great!  I took it 3 times a day about 30 minutes before eating.  I took this drug for 3 months.  After that time, my periods pretty much stopped and during bloodwork my doctor noticed I had a very high prolactin level.  Since I've gone off of the med, my hormone levels are really off and I've been battling this for several years now.  The medication really helped for my initial problem but now I feel like I have some major isses because I took it for a long about of time.

I want to thank you for your honest posts.  It was after I read these posts that I realized I am going through the same symptoms from this medicine:  anxiety, near panic attacks, depression, confusion, just to name a few. My medical provider and I have been trying to adjust my other GERD medicine, synthroid, and Lexapro for a year without a thought that it could be the Reglan.  Those of you who have made it through this, how long did it take for these side effects to subside?  Is there hope for me down the road?

I took this medicine for four weeks...only because I was told that I would eventually adjust to it.  I never adjusted.  I spent four weeks battling tiredness and felt like a zombie.  In the fourth week...I suddenly experienced depression, anxiety, restlessness and feeling like I'm 80.I've been off the drug for a week and although I'm less tired...the anxiety has worsened.  What an awful experience this has been.  I'm only relieved to find that others have gone through this and I'm not going out of my mind.

After being on Reglan for only a short time, my appetite has gotten somewhat better.  I do still however, have to be very careful with the types of food I eat.Anything with tomatoes or otherr heavy spices still bother my stomach.  I amhoping with in a few days or a week I will be able to tolerate most foods.  I am also on Carafate to help the healing process.  I have Lupus and the doctor feels that may be slowing down the process of healing of the ulcers.  He also diagnosed me with Barrett's.  He wants to stay on top of things so I am better by the time I need to return to school in the fall as a teacher.

Not any side effects and I was told that reglan &quot;messes with your head&quot; by a nurse practioner that didn't want to prescribe this med. My doc realized this was what I needed and prescribed it. It has been a Godsend. I hope we can find something as effective after the 12 weeks is up. That is the recommended duration of time to take this med. I was living on milkshakes and lost ten lbs. These last two weeks I am now eating normal food again, having regular bowel movements and feel good. So far I am extremely satisfied with reglan.

On  one trip to the ER, the Dr prescribed Reglan and Dilaudid. Reglan was AWESOME! 5 min after taking it, my migraine was gone. First time in 18 years I have ever found a medication that helped. The Dilaudid made me sick to my stomach, so I only got half the dosage. I got a much needed nap after the Reglan and felt like I'd never had my migraine at all. I get 3-4 migraines a month and have since age 5, and I am 32 yrs old now. I welcome any medication that will help me live a normal life and Reglan seems to be the one. I pray my doctor is cool with the idea and sets me up. If not, well he will just lose a patient and I will find a Dr who is willing to get me the help I need and desperately have been looking for all my life.

She was out of it she goes into store for 3-4 hours and leaves with nothing and doesn't realize what she is saying half the time. She took this med while babysitting my 2 children and I had to leave where I was because I can not trust her while she is on the medication she is not herself.

I have never had emotional/depression issues until now it was horrible!  I thought I was going crazy feeling so tired yet so anxious not wanting to work or be social. I was contribuiting it to another drug that I was taking until I read this web site.  Thanks!  I have been off it for 2 days so far and I feel so much better already.  I am generally full of energy, happy and social.  I was completely the opposite on this drug...I would rather be consitipated over taking this drug and have it change who I am!

Bowels started to function again &amp; I was released - no cause for this was found.

I was on this medication for over 6 months and started having restlessness, insomnia, tremors, etc. My Dr didn't connect it to the Reglan.  He put me on sleeping pills and xanax.Then I started thinking about suicide, I thought I was going crazy. Then 1 evening I started shaking uncontrollably and went to the emergency room. I was diagnosed as having reaction/side effects to Reglan that had been ongoing and undiagnosed the entire time I took it. The next day I started having terrible anxiety attacks and severe depression. That was 19 years ago and I have never been the same do to chronic depression and anxiety.I hope to God no one ever has to go through what I have. My life was ruined and I was too sick to file any lawsuit within the required time frame in my state.

I was so depressed that I didn't care I was depressed! And of course it caused tremors that I still have, may always have according to my neurologist.The FDA really needs to look at this one, from my own experience and what I have read here. Oh, and don't try to go off of it in a hurry-I had the worst drug withdrawal symptoms, and I tapered off too! 3 months of hell, and then another year after going off of it before I felt like myself again.Thanks, I'll deal with the choking and pneumonia instead.
Other		1	1	1			3/10/2008 11:59:57 AM	A neurologist prescribed this drug for me for migraines. I think the idea was that it would speed up my digestion and get the actual migraine drug into my system faster. I have a history of anxiety attacks but this drug gave me the worst ones I have ever had! I took it twice before I made the connection that it was the drug causing it. I couldn't sleep, was jittery, heart racing, felt like I wanted to jump out of my skin. Since then, I've had at least 2 doctors tell me what a terrible drug it is and that they refuse to prescibe it. On the other hand, my husband took it for a GI problem without too much of an issue. My suggestion: BEWARE!

I was given this to treat esophaghitis.  I took ONE PILL and within a couple hours began to have involuntary muscle movements.  I could not control my jaw, head, neck, arm, etc.  It was one of the scariest things I have ever done.  Thanks to the pamphlets that they now give you at the pharmecy with your prescription, I knew immediately that it was the Reglan causing my symptoms.  But they took over a day to wear off.  I would have rather just dealt with the esophaghitis than taken this drug.  I spoke with a friend the next day that is an RN, and she couldn't believe that they prescribed this for me.  She said that it is one of the worst drugs as far as severe side effects go.  She said that MOST people have some adverse reaction to it, and that most of those are severe.  NO ONE SHOULD TAKE THIS DRUG!  The FDA should remove it from use!!

My Dr. perscribed Reglan, which has worked amazingly.  However, the first few days I was really tired right after I took it and would nap for 30 minutes to an hour after.  I made sure I was with someone and wouldn't have to drive.  That side effect has since gone away.

I really can not rate it's effectivness due to the fact within 2 days after taking it I was in the ER with the only anxiety attack I have ever had in my life. I thought I was going to jump out of my skin. It was very bad. I have never had any other problems with anxiety other than with taking thus drug. Not a good experience.

Nausea and Vomiting	cindysrvr@yahoo.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/19/2008 11:28:45 AM	Be very aware of this drug!  I was taken to the emergency room with a severe migraine.  I told the doctor what usually helped and she choose to give me reglan in an iv.  Within ten seconds my chest got tight and I started shaking.  I could not control the tremors and was shaking so hard I was almost off of the bed.  I was aware of what was happening but could not do anything.  I was paralyzed.  I have never been this frightened.  I really felt like I was going to die!  The nurses were scrambling around to hook me up a heart monitor.  My heart rate went up to 140.  They gave me medication to stop the uncontrollable shaking but it took about 15 minutes to go away completely.  The next day I still have mild shaking.  I am so scared that I will probably never go to an emergency room again.  My boyfriend said he really thought he was going to lose me.  They tell me that this reaction is very rare but I will never chance a new drug again.  Be very careful with this drug!!
Nausea and Vomiting	Patsy Horn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	1/14/2008 1:46:49 PM	My daughter,age 13, was given this Reglan for nausea and vomiting. After only taking 4 pills(2 days)we had to rush her to the hospital and she had Extrapyramidal Syndromes. This was a very frightening experience, we thought we were going to lose our daughter. She has been off of the Reglan for 2days now and she has uncontrolled movement of her right hand and her jaw. The hospital said it could take 3 months for the movements to disappear and that some people may have these uncontrolled movements permanently.I stongly suggest that this medicine be taken off the shelf.Patsy HornCorbin,KY
Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	mjarsmom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	1/10/2008 10:38:24 AM	I had my second child 5/07.  She seemed healthy when she was born, over 8 lbs. Then the sleeplessness, vomitting, and diarhea.  You could hear her stomach cramping and turning when she started eating. We changed formulas, tried medication and thickening the formula.  She refused to eat and was hospitalized at 5 weeks and weighing under 6lbs.  The peds gastro specialist figured out it was food intolerance.  I could no longer nurse &amp; normal formulas wouldn't work.  We thought we had it figured out and then the apnea started.  She was still spitting up quite a bit but things were so much better we lived with it.  Then it kept getting worse.  They finally re-admitted her when we had reached the breaking point.  They administered tests, ones I requested the first time, and they discovered severe reflux that was causing the apnea episodes, 5 or more a night sometimes.  Prescribed Reglan and Prevacid.  I was very leary but It had been a hard 7 months.  At first I noticed that she was very tired after taking it but that subsided after the first 3-6 days.  She seemed so much more comfortable.  She always looked tense and she is much happier.  We still have some days of vomitting but not too severe.  There are days when she is not her normal self and screams alot and she doesn't sleep as soundly as she did.  She is more easily woken than she used to but we haven't had any apnea episodes in three weeks and haven't had to go to the doctor in 2, trips were at least once a week or more with us. I feel the benefits of this medication have outweighed the small side affects for us.  
Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	babygirl2007, 0-2 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	0-2	1/3/2008 8:07:53 PM	Parents Beware! This medication was prescribed to my newborn. My daughter was born in Sept 2007 &amp; had an apnea episode two days after she was born. The hospital put her in the Neo-natal unit and ran lots of tests on her. They found that she had severe acid reflux. On the seventh day after she was born, the doctor put her on Reglan &amp; Zantac and released her from the hospital the following day. Up until she was put on Reglan, she was very alert and happy, but after taking Reglan, she became very irritable and screamed all the time from severe stomach cramping. The warnings from the pharmacy never stated that this product should not be given to children. I did not find this out until I looked on WebMD &amp; researched the medication. Thank you to the other parent who described what happened to their baby. This helped me understand what was happening to my baby.  Please take this warning very seriously! I agree 100% Reglan should not be given to children. All within 1 week of being on the medication my baby had severe side effects including: loss of appetite, became afraid of every little noise, cried easily, constantly had stomach cramping, exhaustion from lack of sleep (sleeping only 10 minutes of every couple hours), woke up screaming (I think she was having terrible nightmares), I also think she was dizzy as she was constantly raising her arms in a panic while in a laying position. At my babys 1 month Doctor appointment, I discussed my concerns with the Doctor &amp; he was leery about taking her off the medication but I was adamant about it &amp; he finally agreed. He explained that this product is not really supposed to be given to children, but there is no other product out there that works. He explained a few years ago there was another product but it was taken off the market due to the side effects. I feel that the FDA should also review Reglan &amp; also remove it from the market. Since we stopped the Reglan, she is very happy baby again.  Thank you WebMD!

I still have the gas, the abdominal pain until I down a couple of root beers,causing belching which helps a lot. I bet the root beer is better for me. ;-)

My doctor prescribed protonix, nexium,and prevacid, none had any effect on my symptoms.  I went to see a specialist and he gave me Reglan, which so far for the past 2 days have been working tremendously.  Hopefully it will continue to improve.  It comes as a generic which only cost me $10.

I was completely dried up and it brought my milk supply back and a better supply then I had before. The only side-effect I had was I was sleepy for about 30mins to an hour after i would take the medication. which kinda sucked because i had to take the medicine 4x a day for a week.

As soon as she started the Reglan, she went from being  vibrant and happy to sullen and exhausted. She stopped eating, became afraid of every little noise, was so tired all the time she could barely function, cried easily, constantly complained of itching, didn't want anything against her skin (wouldn't put clothes on), had dark circles under her eyes, lost the color in her face, had horrible dreams that woke her up screaming several times a night, developed a fear of falling(we think she was dizzy), blinked her eyes constantly, lost interest in all toys and activities, all within one week of being on the medication. She is no longer on it and has returned to her vibrant, happy, playful self.

But, hey, who complains to their doctor about that.  Turns out, I'm one of the very few people who gets the side effect that it causes medically induced Parkinsons.  I stopped the medication and now my handwriting is as messy as ever.
