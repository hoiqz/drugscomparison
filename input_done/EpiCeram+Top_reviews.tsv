Other	Magpie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/25/2012 11:01:23 PM	I had complained to my Derm. about dryness from rosacea meds. (mostly on my nose) She gave me a few samples and I was so happy.  It stopped the peeling and I could wear makeup without it looking so ugly and dry.  My nose was always peeling for years no matter what lotion I tried. I Love this!

Other	Epiceram (rx) , 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		7/18/2011 6:07:05 PM	For years I have had caratosis rough spots frozen (zapped) from my forhead and scalp every few months. (I am 78 years old.) I began using my wife's tube of Epiceram several weeks ago and have had a virtual elimination of several such rough spots. This has avoided the need for painful, expensive, inconvenient, procedures and the temporary ugly red welts caused by the liquid nitrogen burns.  Epiceram is my new friend.

I found it was no different in healing powers than Aquaphor but certainly less messy.  I found that Cortizone 10, an over the counter excema cream with cortisone, worked better and eliminated the need for Aquaphor and EpiCeram.

Our pediatrician prescribed EpiCeram and told us that it works as well as a steroid but without the side effects since it is not a steroid. This product has been a lifesaver. We use it twice a day on his flare areas and follow with Cera Ve lotion all over the body. EpiCeram seems to be more concentrated and really helps alleviate the dryness and itching. Anyone who has a child with eczema should ask their doctor about epiCeram. It has made all the difference for us.
Other		5	5	5			11/30/2010 3:18:22 AM	I have moderate eczema around my eyes and on my eyelids. Because of concern that longterm use of steroidal cream would cause thinning of the skin, cataracts and glaucoma, I decided to try EpiCeram. Having read some Stanford medical researchers write about the new theory that the cause of eczema is that it is not an autoimmune disorder, but rather a breakdown in the skin's natural barriers due to excessive dryness, I thought EpiCeram would be a great way to treat my problem. After trying it for 5 days, I have noticed a significant improvement in appearance, and the itching, irritation, and swelling is almost gone. The only problem with this cream is that the vapors it gives off when initially drying do irritate the eyes. If you close your eyes for about 10-15 minutes after application, however, you can avoid this entirely.

I have used everything and I mean everything.  I  used to use mimyx to keep my face hydrated but this stuff actually keeps me clear, almost as well if not better than the steroids.  I have only been using it for a week now but wow.  I broke out behind my ears and I tried epi ceram on one side and steroids on the other.  The epiceram cleared it up 2 days sooner.  I really hope this drug is the amazing thing I have been looking for.

I can see a improved difference in the the condition of my skin overall. I feel that with continued use the patches may actually heal and clear up completely.
Other	Mychel x Murder, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	19-24	12/20/2008 1:16:13 AM	I'm a 19 year old male with eczema on both inner corners of my eyes as well as my genitals. My dermatologist gave me some samples of EpiCeram and Eletone to test. While EpiCeram did in fact make my skin less dry and cracked, it did NOT help the redness of eczema at ALL. Given that these drugs have not had their efficacy tested via the market for very long, I took it upon myself to write this review in order to help fellow eczema sufferers who are tired of steroid creams. Eletone works as well as said steroid creams. Ask your dermatologist about that instead of EpiCeram!

Every winter my hands get so dry the skin cracks, bleeds and itches beyond belief. Plus my hands look 50 years older than they actually are. I justed started using this medication last week after my Derm. prescribed it for me. What a difference! I apply a thin coating twice a day and my hands are actually soft! No dryness, cracking or bleeding. I'm in heaven! And my hands look 37, not 87!
