Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	Jan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female	45-54	4/4/2011 12:43:51 PM	I just started taking Fosamax two weeks ago so I cant really rate the effectiveness yet.  After taking it I experence indigestion and some stomach upset.  But after reading some of the other reviews, I think I'm pretty lucky.  I think in my case if the drug was coated it may be a little better with less discomfort.

I am taking the depo shot which causes bone loss.  But, I don't think this is the cause of my bones loss.  About 5 years ago, I broke my collar bone where I could not grow new bone on my break.  I would like to hear from younger folks taken fosamax.

Every joint in my body seemed to ache, including muscle pain.  Felt like I had the flu.  It's been 2 weeks since I quit taking it and my symptons are not getting any better.  My mother (72 yrs), and my sister (53 yrs) also take this drug; however, they do not have any negative side effects.

My dr. says this is a little advertised side effect of taking fosamax for over 5 years!!  PLEASE be aware that in some women it can have this effect only in the femur.  It is NOT in any Merck literature but in Europe drs. require their patients to stop it after 5 years!!  Be advised.

It does not show up in dental x-rays so be sure you have a biological type dentist. Do not take Fosamax is my recommendation.
