I would wake up every 2 or 3 hours with my nose stopped up.  It had been so long since I had a good nights sleep.  The first night I tried the spray, my nose stayed un-stopped all night long.  And I sleep so good.  I use it every night before I go to bed.  I am very pleased.

Chronic Inflammation of the Nose Not due to Allergies	John D, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	3/11/2008 8:03:04 PM	It started my nasal passages to clear after about 12 hours.  During my 11+ day trial I had random blockages that were not associated with environment or time after treatment.  I started bleeding and could blow out large bloody scabs.  I was getting over an unrelated flu at the time.  I also had throat and esophagus that were characterized by reduced ability to swallow medication, especially large pills and capsules; feelings that things were caught in my swallow path and total discomfort with loss of sleep and feelings of panic.  I made a trip to off-hours with priority to attempt to get help for my feeling of choking to death.  They failed to find the problem. This problem seemly subsided after I quit taking the med for 24-48 hours.  Simple saline nasal spray seems to be better than this stuff and my old Nararel.  My dosage was two sprays each nostril once per day.  I reduced it to one spray each nostril my last two days of use.
