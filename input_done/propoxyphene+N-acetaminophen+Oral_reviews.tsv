Pain	cmorame, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	8/9/2010 3:27:17 PM	This med was dispensed by Walgreens after an injury to my finger,traumatic amputation, and was less than effective. I am not a pill taker and usually have to break an aleve in half. I took 2 w/no relief then took another 2 w/in 3 hrs. Ea time I would break out in a profuse sweat. I then obtained non-generic Darvocet N-100 w/immed refief w/in half an hr after taking meds ,no sweating and only have to take 1. Took 1 Darvocet last night but still needed another so I tried the generic again,soon broke out in profuse sweat again. Meds are NO GOOD,should no be on the market. Will never use Walgreens again !! Also had to take too much Tyl withthese pills,shouldn't take &gt; 2400mg/day and I know I took much more than that with poor to minimal relief from pain. I do know something about pain &amp; meds as I am an ICU RN.

Pain	Greenhornet, 75 or over on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5			7/7/2009 3:16:14 PM	I have tken the gernic of Darvocet for 10 years plus.I have found no serious side effect(read on). Dosage perscribed is one every 4 hrs but I have never taken more than 2 p/day(because they were so effective) until this last yr and now take 3 p/day.It is not as effective as it was the first 5 yrs. In the beginning it gave me a real lift as it was very effective.I found when working and under stress I was taking it for the lift as much as for pain. I stopped that immediately when I realized that. Now 6 years later and retired I have much more pain in the hips and three a day is hardly adequate but I am concerned with taking to many drugs. I realize that for effect I need to take 1 evry four hours thru the day but no more than 3 p/day.Dr. says I can take more if needed. MY brother has same kind of pain in the hips and he say's they are not effective in reducing his pain.No help at all. I insist they must be a little help but he say's he does not realize he has even taken one. I think you need to take one every four hours for 12 hours to realize if they are of benefit. I do note the side effect that perhaps I may get a little impatient(close to anger which I surpress) at times and perhaps talk a little more than normal.

When I got home, I followed the directions, took one pill &amp; within 5 minutes I had I think the worst headache &amp; I had ever had. And I have had my fair share of migranes. Then within 1 hour after taking this medication - I was in the bathroom throwing up about ever 4 minutes &amp; this lasted all night. The day after - still had the headache &amp; still had the upset stomach. This medication has been one of the worst experiences of my life!!

Kind of ironic for a pill prescribed for migrane. I do think it works and it's better than other narcotics like codine it doesn't impair me as much.

It tempers the pain without making me dysfunctional. I believe the slogan that came out with this drug was &quot;inhibit the pain, not the patient.&quot; I believe that is a valid statement. It may not be &quot;heavy&quot; enough for some people, but I found it relieved my serious pain, even though I was not completely rid of it. I would rather have a dull ache then laid out on the couch or in the bed in a coma.

I take 1 pill when needed and it helps greatly and doesn't leave me to where I feel doped up and can't work.  It does not take all the pain away, but reduces it.  These are pain RELIEVERS, not pain STOPPERS.  All medications work differently on each person, so review your allergy information before taking this because of the acetaminophen.

Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	6/18/2008 11:07:06 AM	I took it for headache (migraine) pain, and it gave me a worse headache than I already had, which is clearly stated in the side effects, I also have a herniated disc with several other disc's with no fluid, it didn't even touch.  The only way I knew I took this medication was the worse headache and the feeling of nausea that I still have the next day.

My dentist perscribed this and still even with a 1300mg dose there is very litle pain relief. I started to think it they had gave me a placibo but looked it up on here and see now that its the real deal, just a real deal that does nothing for me.

Pain	hays1122, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/5/2008 5:24:56 PM	I was prescribed this medication for a toothache. I took one as directed,I had a neckache and headache but my tooth still hurt. The dentist said I could try two. I took two. I threw up for hours and my head and neck hurt something awful. I vomited for 5 hours,even when there was nothing left to come up. I was sweating and had cold chills at the same time.This medication did nothing for my toothache and made me sicker then I could have imagined a medication prescribed by my dentist could have made me.
Pain	Sunshine29, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	45-54	3/22/2008 1:00:41 PM	I had real strange dreams,and right before I woke up, I was talking in my dream, but my roommate said I was talking in my sleep, but real slow. When I started to wake up, I had a hard time moving, and my mouth &amp; hands felt real weak. I felt like I was trying to call for help, but I couldn't. It was a very strange feeling...Im not going to lie...the pain is still there, but not quite as bad.
