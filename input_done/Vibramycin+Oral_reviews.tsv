Bronchitis	vlynnp3, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	2/6/2011 10:40:01 AM	I was put on Vibramycin for Bronchitis and have been nauseaous and vomiting ever since no matter what I do.  I've been on it for 5 days.  I had gotten sick with vomiting before the madicine so didn't think anything about it until now.  Due to my cancer, chemo and brain aneurysms I had to stop taking it.  Before this I hadn't vomited since I was pregnant in 1969.  If you have to take this medicine, good luck.
Skin Infection	sillygal , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	2	Female	45-54	7/14/2010 3:12:51 PM	Rough stuff.. Don't take unless absolutely necessary.  Don't ever lay down after taking &amp; I find piece of toast helps.  Phenergan &amp; Monistat also good idea. Have serious skin infection (not sure if Staph or MERSA yet) 1st day side efx nausea, vomiting, headache, lethargy, constipation, vaginal dryness.  Also need to put same cream on infection site.  Again, only take if absolutely necessary.

Had to call Dr. for new medicine. Cannot lie down for 1/2 hour after taking medicine and watch taking vitamins and dairy products.

I called my doctor and he immediately stopped the medication and prescribed phenigran.
Lyme Disease	KW, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	35-44	5/26/2010 10:38:58 AM	I have to take this for three weeks twice daily due to Lyme disease. I THINK the sympthoms from the Lyme is getting better, hard to tell because I feel so bad from taking the medication. Nausea is the worst side effect and occasional headaches are next.  I'm gonna touch it out and will report back at the end of my run.
Bronchitis	pderebery, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	45-54	5/20/2010 6:47:09 PM	Does not effect my sickness. Does not help it not strong enough.
Acne	jan21, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/27/2010 8:49:34 AM	My acne was non-stop. I've been using this for 36 hours so far and my complesxion is clearing up. It's definitely worth the nausea and headache side effects. My complexion is also evening out because I've been using a 10% glycolic smoothing cream along with the vibramycin.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/1/2010 6:59:11 PM	At first, I experienced extremely severe nausea.  However, I found that if you take it just as you are going to bed, there is no nausea.  It has really worked well for clearing up my acne. Which I never had until i got into my late 20's.  Within a week of using this combined with topical Retin A, I have received multiple compliments on my clear skin.
Other	Hannah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/20/2010 6:51:46 PM	This medication has been awful for me to take. It makes me feel like vomiting, and gives me terrible headaches. I made the mistake of taking it before bed and couldnt swallow when I woke up plus nightmares of spiders all night. This morning I found sores all over my mouth and and lips. 
Sinus Irritation and Congestion	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	11/21/2009 10:59:30 AM	I was on this antibiotic for a sinus infection. I took it for a week and felt nauseated everyday. I ended up in cold sweats, stomach pains, and eventually vomiting twice. I discontinued taking this medication and went back to the doctor since my sinus problems had progressively gotten worse. I was prescribed Levaquin today. If you're taking this medication, make sure to eat before you take it. You still might feel kind of &quot;funny&quot; or nauseated, but it should help prevent the vomiting and cold sweats. I would not use this medication again since it didn't help my infection at all and it made me sick all day.
Bronchitis	amtcp35, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	65-74	7/10/2009 10:16:38 AM	Used for bronchitis for 10days; infection recurred app. 2 wk.after ending this dosage. Now on  a 5 day course.  Let's hope it works.  I am quite sensitive to many antibiotics so treatment can be somewhat difficult for my provider.

Bronchitis	massimo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	45-54	3/18/2009 1:57:56 PM	 After three days of taking the generic made by TEVA MFG., I started getting an allergic reaction to this  50 mg capsule!  I have taken this drug (Vibramycin) for  35 years(I'm allergic to Pencillin) and have never had a reaction like this.  Maybe it's because it's generic?  Never had this problem with the brand name.  It has always worked for me, never had nausea or anything like that.
Sinus Irritation and Congestion	Luckylou, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/27/2009 5:08:00 PM	I have been on this medicine for 3 days for a sinus infection. Have never felt so sick before.By the 2nd day was vomiting and had migraine.Took pill last night and still having the effects of a migraine.Called my Dr and was told that I shouldn't be having headaches...&quot;not a side-effect of medicine&quot;. Wish he had the migraine and not me...can't function like this.Haven't taken the meds today...was told by pharmist that I'm having side-effects from the meds to Stay off for today and start back in morning and see what happens.Wish Dr had given me something else like he use to do.

Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever	Cantus, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Male	25-34	11/17/2008 9:15:38 AM	The Doctors decided to use this medication to treat my rare case of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. From day one my light sensitivity made working outside difficult at best.The upset stomach was something I was not use to. Like the doctor said though, the side effects are worth the end result of no more rash.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	10/29/2008 11:47:00 PM	I took Doxycycl hyc which i think is generic for Vibramycin. My school (im 21 in college) nurse prescribed it for me because i had a bad flu-i dont remember feeling so nauseous last week-but my last 2days have been horrible-i have one day left but at least my flu was gone-it was my worst flu i have had too. good luck! 
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	10/26/2008 11:45:07 AM	I was prescribed this medication to treat bronchitis.  Within 2 days, I was feeling worse than ever because of the side effects of nausea and stomach pain.  Definitely not a good medication for me but I am glad that it worked for some people.
A Sexually Transmitted Disease due to Chlamydia	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	9/12/2008 1:25:01 PM	I really hated taking this medication i hated the nausea and three days after i started this medication i finally vomited im so glad im finished this medication thank god!!!   
Treatment to Prevent Lyme Disease	Lynx, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	7/12/2008 2:36:55 AM	As one would rather feel nauseous than possibly develope the severe symptoms of Lyme, I'd have to give this a thumbs up.  I as perfectly fine anyway on the medication until the second week when I developed nausea and vomiting.  I took the pill with a small amount of food (like applesauce) which prevented the vomiting but not the nausea.  The Lyme rash cleared in about 4-5 days but the medication took about 36 hours to stop it from spreading (it started at about 3 inches and reached 7&quot; before it stopped growing on the doxycycline).  Check for ticks. :(
Other	cuzicar, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	2	Female	25-34	5/14/2008 7:51:12 AM	I was given this medication to take after surgery for endometriosis. I was easy for mr to remember to take with food but I am still sick every time I take it I was vomiting the first two days I had to take the medication. I have been taking it now for five days and have five days left I can't wait till its over. You may want to take pheneragan with this medication so that you do not feel ill. 
Non-Contagious Disease due to Actinomyces Bacteria	thank goodness, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	45-54	11/14/2007 5:08:49 PM	My bacterial infection was completely irradicated as best as I can tell. And I found this medicine very effective considering the fact that I have been allergic to penicillin my entire life. Being some one not use to a scheduled life, nor my not being practiced in taking medications the requirements of having to take this medication one hour before eating or two hours after twice a day was somewhat problematic but the results were still very favorable, thank goodness.
