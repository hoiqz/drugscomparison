My dermatologist never told me to gradually wean myself off the Raptiva - she just said to use my remaining doses as usual.  About 2 weeks after abruptly stopping the Raptiva, I experienced a massive flare-up of psoriasis, from head to toe (covering at least 75% of my body).  Now I'm taking Methotrexate and applying topical steroids, and have started taking Humira, but after a month there's only been about a 20% improvement.  It may take months before I'm back to where I was before stopping Raptiva.  MAKE SURE YOUR DOCTOR HAS YOU  GRADUALLY STOPPING THE RAPTIVA (if you're still using it).  This is the worst experience of my life.

Raptiva has been a miracle drug for me it cleared me. I have not had any side effects. I am now trying Humira about a month into. I did get a reaction to stopping the Raptiva.

He passed away May 07 after being on Raptiva for 18 mths.  This was the only medication he was on.  I am convinced his symptoms were masked by the medication,  DO NOT take this drug.  It should have been recalled 3 yrs ago.  I have filed 3 complaints to the FDA.  His doctor continued to dismiss his symptoms. He had a BSI of 80% and should have been hospitalized but was not.  His condition worsened after taking the med and told his doctor of his concern.  He also was not told his condition would worsen when he stopped taking the medication.  DO your own research - do not rely on your physican for all the answers. If you are not getting better find another doctor dont wait. . . .

Raptiva will no longer be available after June 8, 2009.&quot;Genentech estimated that approximately 2,000 patients in the United States may currently be using Raptiva (efalizumab) for chronic plaque psoriasis. Since it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2003, approximately 46,000 patients worldwide have been treated with Raptiva, the company said.&quot;Our decision to remove Raptiva from the market reflects Genentech's commitment to patient safety,&quot; said Dr. Hal Barron, Genentech's senior vice president, development and chief medical officer. &quot;Although we believe that many psoriasis patients are benefiting from Raptiva, the balance between benefit and risk in the psoriasis population for which Raptiva was approved has significantly changed.&quot;In February, an FDA advisory noted there had been three deaths of people taking the drug. Two involved people with confirmed cases of a rare brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The third death was a person believed to have contracted the brain infection, according to the advisory.http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/advisor y/efalizumab.htm

Though I was off the medication for 2 months and it came back twice as bad.  I've had migraines, flu like symptoms (hot/cold chills, achy joint, bad migraines lasting 3-5 days).  I've also noticed that I easily get sick and the cold last for a long time (hard to get rid of).

After nearly seven years, I am about 95% clear and hope to be completely cleared by next summer!  This is a great product and I recommend it to anyone with a severe case.  The only setback is the fact that it lowers you immune system.  Now I catch every little cold, flue, etc. when thwe grandchildren come around!

I've been extremely happy with the results.  Psoriasis was also on my hands making it embarrassing to get change from store clerks, etc.  It is gone.  I guess I'm one of the lucky ones.  I've been using Raptiva since May of 2007 and continue to use it.

He had been on the medication for 4 years.  I would be interested in e-mailing with the person who posted on 1/8/08 in the same situation.  Please post a response if you would like to do the same. 
Plaque Psoriasis	Long Term Raptiva User, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/5/2008 11:46:01 AM	I was a part of the clinical trials for this drug so I have been taking it since 2000.  It has been a life saver for me.  Without this drug I am covered 90% of my body with it I am totally clear.  I am not sure of the side effects for other people but I have none.  Even if I did have side effects they would be minor compared to the debilitating effects of my psoriasis.  I am SOOO grateful.  If you cannot afford the medication contact Genentech, the manufacturer, ask for their Access To Care foundation.  You can get the medication at no cost or little cost based on your income.  Without them I would not be able to afford it. If you are thinking about stopping the medication, I would tell you to ask your physician.  I tried to discontinue use and had a psoriasis flare that I needed to be in the hospital for.  It was so awful.  I am resigned to giving myself a shot once a week for the rest of my life and I am more than ok with that.  My life is better today because I have Raptiva.  If there are serious long term effects that will remain to be seen for me.  I will have to trade that for the quality of my life that I am having now because of the wonderful effects I have while I am on it.

We have not confirmed it, but believe it was indirectly related to Raptiva through a co ndition called Progressive Multifocal Leukoencalopathy (pml). He had been using Raptivca for just shy of three years

It was somewhat intimidating to give the injections to myself but after a few i was an old pro.
