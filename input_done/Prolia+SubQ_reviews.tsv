Dr. said should get over problems in a couple of weeks.  If this continues don't know if I will take thrid shot.  Don't have any energy and lymphadema seems worse. Would like to know how to contact others taking this medication to learn of side affects of others and how long they lasted.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/4/2012 7:40:25 PM	I have been taking this medication regularly for a year and a half following treatment for breast cancer.  I have no side effects.  This medication has not been found to cause many of the symptoms that others have reported here.  Possibly they are experiencing symptoms completely unrelated to this medication.
Other	22fish, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	8/29/2012 6:03:00 PM	My oncologist ordered Prolia due to chemotherapy related bone loss.  Had my first shot last Wednesday.  Almost immediately began having heart pounding,indigestion, and minor nausea.  Waited it out to see if I was imagining the symptoms.  When the symptoms did not subside a week later I called my doctor but she does not believe they are related. I trust her but I can tell something is different.  I'm going to follow up with my family physician so we might monitor what I am experiencing.  I will also keep a journal.  I know I will probably put off my second injection to see how I feel off the drug. I hope this drug is a good one but only time will tell for me.  I would like to know if anyone else has had these syptoms.

Other	CAS4061, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	7/31/2012 8:30:40 PM	On January 26, 2012 I had the Prolia shot.  In February, I began having back problems, along with sciatica pain.  Twenty years ago, I suffered 2 herniated disks in my lower back (diagnosed with an MRI) and this pain now is just like that pain.  Following recovery 20 years ago, my back has been in remarkably good shape and I am in excellent health.  My last two bone density tests have shown no osteoporosis in my back and a slight bit of osteopenia in my hips.  I have had 21 physical therapy sessions so far and there has been some improvement in that I can now roll over in bed without excruciating pain, but walking seems to be getting worse.  I can sit in hard-backed chairs and lay on the floor on my back and be fairly comfortable, but when I stand and start to walk, I can take 20 to 25 steps and the pain down my leg gets bad and continues to get worse each step I take.  I can think of nothing that might have caused this pain, and then I remembered that one of the side effects of Prolia shots was the back pain.  I cannot think that would be this severe, but I do wonder if the Prolia could aggravate the back pain, and I'm hesitant to take the second shot.

I am one of the lucky ones as I was also aprehensive after reading some of the posts on here.  I am beginning to think that some of the reactions that others may be experiencing may have occured regardless of the Prolia injection and may not even be connected to the injection.I attended a seminar on osteoporosis recently and after reviewing all of the medications (by pharmacists), Prolia was touted as the drug with the least side effects.They had it classified as almost the same as the placebo. The clinic that I attend are doing a number of injections with no adverse effects.

I have had absolutely no side effects. It has been just like the flu shot - once you get it you don't think about it and life goes on.  Not like the Fosamax!! I was at a osteoporosis forum last weekend and Prolia side effects were very similar to placebo. I am glad that I had the injection but before I went ahead I did have some reservation like everyone. My clinic has now given a number of injections without any side effects.

Took first Prolia injection 4 months ago - awoke in the middle of the night with excruciating spine and bone pain throughout my body.  Flu like symptoms - no fever.  Dr.'s diagnois is fibromyalgia - prescribed meds to inhibit pain receptors to brain - still have some pain and constant drug hangover.  Not sure I will take upcoming Prolia injection.  Has anyone else had this problem?

The oral osteoporosis medcations I tried made my gastroesophageal reflus disease much worse even though I take Nexium daily. I am not post menopausal, but genetics and the Nexium have made me osteoporotic. So far, so good, I highly recommend this medication for those who cannot tolerate the orals.

I have no osteporosis, just fractured my wrist.   It was only after Prolia has sent me a letter that the nurse told me to go to ER she feared I was having a stroke. Had cistitus, reflex acid, sore throat, very sore spine, rashes, lumps, itchiness, very hot and cold during night, not sleeping well, been over 6 months, have not received another injection, also had cat-scan for head, have water in the ear, the new bones growing over the old teeth and won't go away - dentist told me. Might lose a tooth.  Sore all over and very tired.This is a dangerous drug.  If it helped anyone, they must be very lucky. 
Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	lorac, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	3/17/2012 1:15:15 PM	I took Fosamax and stopped with all the bad reviews.  My bones got worse so I went on daily injections of Forteo and that increased my bone mass but I could only take it for one year.  I am a very conscious about my eating habits and I work out 7 days a week lifting weights and walking for an hour.  You can imagine how frustrated I am that my bone density scores keep dropping so I had the Prolia injection about 3 weeks ago and have had no side effects.  The injection was painless, too.  Just taking calcium and Vitamin D for a year after the Forteo injections and nothing else, resulted in my bone density numbers to get worse so my doctor recommended Prolia.  So I opted for the shot.

I asked my doctor about that since it was one of the conditions in the warnings.  He said it was ok since I had mine removed.  I have had upper back pain, bladder infections, cholesterol jumped from 193 to 230.  I also develop ringing in my ears.  All could be coincidental after only one shot.  Leaning towards not taking another

My sister is a physician and she went over all the side effects with me. The only real concern is a rash since Prolia does NOT go through the kidney or liver like all the other drugs. This is by FAR the SAFEST osteoporosis medicine. And its the easiest too. When looking at the side effects also look at how many people in the placebo group had. mostly the same. I hope that helps..

Since my immune system has been compromised because of Lyme Disease, I asked him if this was a problem.  No, he said, just wash your hands more. Two-three months later, I felt awful. Back pain, joint pain, muscle pain, gas, acid reflux, etc.  I ended up in the ER with pancreatitis in November. By March I didn't need a heating pad for my backpain nor Vicodin for the pain anymore. My second injection was due March 30.  I again asked my doctor if my sympotoms could be caused by the Prolia; he said no.  Got the second injection and wish I never had.  Within days, the pain returned plus it was in my legs and toes as well.  I called my doctor; he said it wasn't the Prolia; take Advil and call my primary care doctor. I then went to the Prolia website and found that all my symptoms were side effects of the Prolia.  My chloesterol went from 186 to 233 in 6 mos., after just one dose of the Prolia.  If I had been given the proper information from the prescribing doctor before hand so I could make an educated decision, I would NOT have taken this new, just off the market Prolia medication. My primary care doctor, my GYN doctor, my gastro doctor, my allergist, and my general surgeon cannot believe my doctor would even think of putting me on such a new medication with my medical history of Lyme Disease and food/medication allergies.  We are all hoping by September the Prolia will be out of my system and I will have not any long term effects or damage.  Take it off the market, FDA.

I was walking 3 miles/day &amp; now cannot walk without limping (no exercise for me). I feel it is very detrimental to my health to not exercise. I have severe pain day &amp; night.

Have had 3 instances of muscle cramps in my legs but blood test shows no low blood calcium. So is this a normal side effect of Prolia? If it builds bone, then the leg cramps are no big thing.

I'm in worse shape now than before I had prolia--will NOT take any more.  Stomach and digestion problems all the time, can't sleep.  6 months of hell for me.  Cholesterol went way up.  RA got worse--Dr. said it would help it--a lie! Dr. treated me as a guinea pig--used a sample she had in office--did NOT charge ins. for it.  She gave me NO info and now will NOT believe my problems are caused by prolia.  My back hurts worse than it ever did--I live this every day now--I hate my life since prolia--will not go back to that dr. I count the days til the 6 mo. are up, but I wonder if my body and life will ever be back to what it was or if there has been permanent damage or change in my body.  I've had RA for 8 yrs. and that is enough to deal with. I had a severe reaction to Embrel for RA and prolia is made by the same co.  So I don't think I should ever have been given prolia.  I have been an FDA statistic for both drugs now.
