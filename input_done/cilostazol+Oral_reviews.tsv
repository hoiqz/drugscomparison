It felt like an ice cream headache but did not stop. The doctor explained that blood rushed to my head as well as thru my legs. I cut the pill in quarters and took one quarter in the am. I continued to add slowly over weeks until I reached the prescribed dosage of one pill in the morning and one at night. I can walk for miles now and even hike. I would recommend easing into the dosage so as not to get headaches.

I have noticed no improvement.  I have PAD in both legs.  the large vein in my right leg is completely blocked.  I can only walk about 10 yards without starting to feel pain in my calves and shins.  I did have slight headaches, not disabling, and did have loose stools, but they both went away. I also had my chest start hurting when I exerted myself too much.  I'm going back to the DR and tell him I prefer to have the surgery to correct rather than stay on a medication that has no effect.

Leg Pain when Walking; Absent at Rest	TOPWOPJOY, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	65-74	2/18/2009 4:54:38 PM	I had chronic leg pain for many years, along with them being very cold from the knees to my toes. Even with our hot summers here in Florida. heehee  One day 3 yrs ago while drying off from my shower I noticed 2 toes on my right foot were black...I immediately went to hospital. There I found out it was (perifial artery disease)that is when my first by-pass was performed. I also was put on Pletal/100mg, Plavix/75mg, Baby Aspirin 81mg. I have had 3 operations on my right side &amp; 2 on my left. I'm not sure if it's all thanks to Pletal, or the combined use of my the drugs, I am very satisfied, it's been ongoing for 3 yrs &amp; seems the operations come just about every 6 months.I at first was having headaches,so I'd lie down for about 1 1/2 hrs and it would be gone. Thats all I noticed as far as side effects,the headaches subsided within 2wks. Also the biggest thing in taking any of the meds is to:STOP SMOKING I'm sure all of you doctors tell the same thing as mine does. I haven't stopped yet but,have gone from 2pks per day down to 2 pks per wk. It can be done, but it takes time along with the WANT TO. My doc has had me on numerous ciggy stoppers,none worked. I'm doing better on my own, and NO!NO! a thousand times NO! I don't want to quit haha Good Luck to all

This still caused diarrhea. It took me about three months to get up to full dosage but after about 4 months I had no pain in my right leg but still some in my left leg but this allows me to walk more.
