No serious side effects except a little back pain at night that may or may not be related. No increase in glucose levels although I'm type 2 diabetic on insulin and another injectable for control. I've taken several BP meds and strengths but taking just one of the 100/25 mg. is working fantastic!!!

After doing some research I found that both of these can make you hyperglycemic. Great! I have stopped the niacin but with little insurance I will stay with Losartan/HCTZ because it does keep the b.p. within range and I have not experienced any side effects.

My headaches are gone, but I have dry mouth through the night and my nose is so stopped up that I thought I had a bad cold - but I had no other symptoms.  I'm sure it's this medicine.  I hadn't thought about my newfound back pain as being caused by this script, but after reading these reviews, I'm beginning to wonder.  It's time to go back to a cheaper, older med that worked better for me.

I have no side effects from this medication.

I thought I was having a MI but all cardiac workup results were negative.  I got off the HCTZ &amp; within 4 days I felt like a new person.

These symptoms are not included in the PT info.

It has kept my extremely high blood pressure within the normal range, which is exactly what its supposed to do. Since my prescription recently expired my M.D. prescribed Losar which I was unfamiliar with...until I came here and found out its the same as Hyzaar. I do however occasionally take an additional medication as a diuretic (Lasix) because the Hyzaar doesn't seem to do the trick for me in that department anymore. Overall though I am very pleased with Hyzaar/Losar (but don't even get me started on that darn Lasix!)

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	4/29/2011 5:47:31 PM	No reason why I was switched from Diavan/HCT which was perfectly effective except insurance wouldn't cover it. It seems less expensive, but I think it is causing me to be more dizzy &amp; I dehydrate much quicker.

High Blood Pressure	Fred, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	9/16/2010 4:01:36 PM	I have tried various blood pressure medicines over the last several months.  I had the bad cough one, the headache one, the constipation one, etc.  If Doctors really knew the side affect they would not prescribe some of the drugs.  Been on this one about a month and what an improvement.  So side affect that I am aware of.  After about a week the medicine dropped my blood pressure down into the 'good numbers'.  My only problem is staying hydrated.  I guess it is the HCTZ but my system wants more fluids that I normally drink.  I consider this a good problem as I probably need to drink more fluids anyhow.  Good medicine for me and I would recommend you to try if the others are not bring down your pressure where you would like to see it.
High Blood Pressure	amandagonzo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	9/9/2010 5:04:35 PM	I have only been taking this medicine for the last two months.

I had feelings of &quot;death&quot; hanging over me everyday. It had the same affect on my sister and my sister-in-law.  If you are taking this drug and are experiencing these symptoms. Tell your doctor you want a different drug.  He won't believe its the medication but IT IS!

All the other meds that have been prescribed have made me feel worst than how I feel when my BP goes up, to the point where I can't proceed with my daily activities, like providing for my three kids. After a week of taking this medication, my BP has normalized. I even went a day without taking it to test its effectiveness and my BP stayed normal. Additionally, I haven't had any side effects. I am very pleased with this medication.

I changed to losartan-hctz100/12.5 which is the generic for hyzaar. It is every bit as effective as benicar with no side effects. My blood pressure without medication is 150/95. With losartan it runs 115/70. I highly recommend this cost effective medication.
