I will now put this drug on my medical information card to alert medical staff NOT to give me this drug due to severe side effects.   
Severe Pain	lynnc1265, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	45-54	5/31/2012 10:59:30 PM	I was recently hospitalized with a perianal abcess which required immediate surgery. While the dilaudid helped with the pre-surgical pain, I was unprepared for the post-surgical effects. The morning after surgery, my poor nurse (bless her soul) gave me a dose prior to checking my dressing so I wouldn't suffer. While in the middle of her task, I suddenly couldn't take a full breath. Ten medical professionals ended up in my room and could not figure out the problem - they had me on oxygen, my vitals, including oxygen, were reading fine. Why could I not draw a full breath? They finally got me down with a shot of Ativan. Later that day, after another shot of Dilaudid, they tried to to a CT on my chest, thinking I'd thrown a clot which caused my earlier episode. The CT team was a bunch of yahoos and managed to blow two IV connections in my face, which threw me into another panic attack. I will now put this medication on my list of &quot;allergies&quot; in the future.

Acute Pain Following an Operation	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	4/5/2012 11:11:03 AM	The first couple doses were fine. Put me in a groggy state and right to sleep. Last two doses I broke out into hives on my arm. Last dose reaction was worse than previous. Rash got more intense, redder and spread further. The pumped benadryl into my IV immediately.
Severe Pain	SRondaS, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	2/22/2012 1:09:38 AM	This is a powerful drug and is very unlikely to be given outside the care of a medical professional. I was in the E.R. for SEVERE pain, I was temporarily relieved by this drug. Be prepared for the side effects:I was hallucinating and couldnt sleep and seemed to be in a eurphoric state until the pain returned. I must say I experienced a problem with the amount of time the drug worked. It seemed I was given doses every 1-2hrs for pain: This may have been due to my particular problem(burst ovarian cyst) or my tolerance. I doubt however that this iscommon or normal. Overall you will be satisfied with the results despite the side effects.

Severe Pain	AK, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	1/9/2012 4:19:12 AM	Severe pain in the abdomen sent me to the ER. Turned out it was incarcerated bilateral hernia. Before it was diagnosed, I was given IV dilaudid to ease the pain. It was fast acting. I felt it going in. I had an unpleasant muscle sensation in EVERY muscle in my body accompanied by muscles tightening(spasm?). My vision got affected with color/contrast/brightness changing. The pain subsided within probably 15-30 seconds at which time I collapsed, muscles relaxed and started crashing. Heart rate dropped to 28, BP dropped and I was paralyzed. I couldn't respond to anything although I was still conscious. The monitor alarms were all beeping loudly and people came running. My shirt was cut away, defibrillator attached and another drug injected into the IV to counter the effects of the dilaudid. It worked, I started being able to interact and all the pain came back. It was terrifying. I felt really tired for about 24 hrs. My hernia had to be reduced without pain medication (couldn't give me anything else after what happened). Very painful, very 1850's style, very loud yelps coming from me. I'm told I can NEVER again let anyone use dilaudid on me again as I am hypersensitive to it.

The last 2 (not including yesterday's) were severe to the point for me to go to the hospital. I was given a combination of Dilaudid, Compazine &amp; Reglan, which immediately gave me relief. Was in the hospital for 7 hours and given all but the Dilaudid. Finally got the injection and was headache free within 20 minutes!
Severe Pain	ERIN, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/10/2011 12:33:02 PM	I was in the ER for severe pain from Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which I deal with on a daily basis, this was a SEVERE attack and I was given Ativan to stop my hypervenitlating and then a dose of Dilaudid. I felt the relief within minutes!  Works fast and very effective. My colon and bowels were spasming and hurting so bad, and I could finally get GOOD relief from this drug!  I was sent home with a perscription for 6 dilaudid tablets for other attacks, I took one this morning, cause I was still sore and in mild pain.  The IV Dilaudid gives you a heavy feeling in your shoulders and legs and then instantly takes the pain away, I was able to lay completely STILL and rest, amazing! I got the 2nd dose right before I Left the hospital.

Acute Pain Following an Operation	davidreno, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/6/2010 1:36:52 AM	I had surgery on my leg and then subsequently had a wound vac attached to my leg for 5 months. While in the hospital when they came in to debride my wound, and pull out the foam packing, and re-pack the wound they would give me a shot of this drug just so I could stand the repacking. Without this drug in my IV, I would have been a very unhappy patient. This is the only think that kept me from wanting to cut my leg off. It is a great drug for major pain.

About 4 years ago, I spent 5 months in the hospital due to surgery &amp; complications. I've suffered w/ monthly flare ups &amp; intense pain.  Dilaudid is the only medication I'd recommend for severe pain. I'm 105 lbs., petite, but have a high tolerance so 2mg was administered w/ phenergan &amp; it ALMOST helped me forget I was sick. It works wonders; Nothing else can compare. It may cause you to feel sleepy, &amp; maybe nausea as well. So usually they can give you something for the nausea along w/ this medication. Sleep is not a bad thing when you feel so sick, so I don't mind the drowsiness. I prefer to ask for the no-fail pain reliever when I'm hospitalized and my pain is through the roof... It lasts between 4-8 hrs depending on the dose you're given. Good luck &amp; enjoy the relief!

Started at low dose and up to .4496mg/daily. We had hoped that by using Dilaudid it help to stop taking 4 other pain pills. But now it has not resulted in stoping my pill intake. My neck is in a terrible shape again and another operation is scheduled for April 30th,2010..C3 through T1 is severe and only a little spine fluid is getting through. Removal of c-7 is the plan in the back of neck inwhich prior operation removed top layer of spine c-3 thru c-6. My daily pain level 8-10. Out come unknown but its very hard coping with such a high pain level.Medications DAILY,, TRAMADOL 50mg 2 x 6hrs/Hydrocodone 5/500mg 1 x 8hrs/Gabapentin 300mg 1 x 8hrs/Cyclobenzaprine 10mg 1 x 8hrs thats a lot of medication to take for 1 year an 3 months without any type of pain relief 3/13/2010...very very poor results.... 
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/8/2010 8:59:22 AM	Works wonders for IBD pain but gives me side effects like a bad hangover when it began to wear off. It also gave me the itchy scratchies. I will say the pain was 100% gone and worth the side effects. I was also given Morphine for IBD in the past which worked wonders as well minus the side effects dilaudid had. Both are fantastic for major pain.
Severe Pain	jimmy377, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	3/5/2010 10:34:16 PM	I am a Chron's Disease patient and have been given this drug during an attack at the ER.  It gave me instant relief.  I was very satisfied with the effects as I was in extreme pain.  I was amazed how well it worked.  My blood pressure was sky high due to the pain.  After the injection my pressure was back to normal.  I was very thankful for the relief this drug provided me.

They gave me a shot of dilaudid and the pain was eased. Now after seeing the Dr. I am taking dilaudid by mouth. The injection worked better but sure it was a bigger dose. The pills seem to be helping the pain quite a bit.

While in recovery, broke out in severe sweats and temp spikes. Was given 4mg then down to 2mg. Apparently I have a low tolerance to this med. Also developed miminal air sac collasp in left upper lobe of lung. Was told I was breathing shallow in recovery and that caused that problem. Overall, I was not in any pain after that incident, do seem to have some up and down low grade temps. never heard of this drug and did not hear about it until after my procedure.

This med worked better than the morphine. It gives you a warm feeling but takes the pain away pretty quickly.

Severe Pain	PainfullyFrustrated, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	35-44	11/28/2009 3:44:27 AM	I received Dilaudid in the ER to relieve severe pain from Kidney inflamation caused by a kidney stone blockage to the kidney (this stone will need to be passed later on). The pain was the worst I have felt and I broke my back 6 months earlier. The injection took effect quickly, but the effect is not complete, as others on this review site have stated. Worst of all the relieve only lasts from about 15 min. to a max. of 25 minutes, then wears off almost completely, leaving you to return to your severe pain and the doctors stating they can only give it to you again in another 3 hours. They have to find something more lasting! -PainfullyFrustrated

I have grown resistant to most other pain medications and was told to &quot;tough it out&quot;. A couple of months ago an ER Dr. gave me dilaudid w/phengran for a level 10 migraine. It was amazing at how fast the relief came!!  The only drawback was how long I wanted to sleep afterward.

I was given 5 mg. morphiene. That didn't touch the pain. I have never had dilaudid before and was skeptical. 1 mg. of Dilaudid along with 50 mg. of Phenergren (for nausea) worked amazingly well! I left feeling like I could run a marathon!

Docs gave me muscle relaxant which did nothing and kept me in the waiting room for a while.  I eventually got into a room and after a few painful exams, they gave me dilaudid - I was in tears before the drug.  It gave me almost instant relief.  I had no ill side effects - I was never so relieved to have the pain gone!  It turned out I had burst ovarian cysts...

Severe Pain	unhappy nurse/mother, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	5/25/2009 1:03:31 PM	Give at local hosp. er to my 19 yr old daughter following a 10 ft fall she had experianced. We were told probably nothing fx, but have recheck in 3 days in case of missed dx. Then told that the 2 unlabeled syringes nurse carried in were Dilaudid and Zofran.Were to be given &quot;to help w/ the pain otw home as she was to be d/c'd. Zofran pushed first, then Dilaudid. Within 20 seconds of the iv push my daughter began shreiking w/ pain, c/o first severe pain in neck, then to head, neither of which had been earlier c/o's, she had injured her lower back. The staff totally unresponsive-I had to request that her Bp be checked and I put the pulse-ox moniter on her myself-&quot;88&quot; it read, pulse 136-144, Bp shot up from initially 161/90 (adm Bp and only Bp taken,approx 1 hr before) to 233/126. Meanwhile, she has gone from a painscale of 2-3 while lying still - to 10+ while lying still, because of the pain in her neck and head. Her skin had become bright red and later said she'd felt she was paralyzed because she couldnt move.       The ER doc looked our way down the hall -probably hearing the agonizing sobs coming from the room , never walked down to look at her, did write 2 scripts-IV Benedryl stat, and for later, a script that was to help counteract clonic seizures and spasms as a result of her reaction to the Dilaudid. Talk about adding insult to injury! My daughter didnt know which hurt her worse for the next week-her neck or her lower back.  Ther should be an easier way to contact the FDA than old fashioned fax and snail mail. No doubt another brilliant lobbied effort by the drug companies to line our fearless leaders pockets and ensure their companies increased product consumption...afterall-if word doesnt get out about the additional risks-guess who's drug gets prescribed in the risks vs. benefit analyse that your neighborhood MD is required to ask before determining your next drug?!

Severe Pain	mkaraffa, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	1/19/2009 10:43:25 PM	I went to the ER for abdominal pain, later found out to be a bowel obstruction.  I regularly take Vicodin for back pain.  For pain relief and the calm me down for insertion of a NG tube I was given a dose of Dilaudid by IV.  I became very hot and my arms and head felt extremely heavy for about two minutes.  After that, it elped relieve my pain and calm my anxiety about the NG tube.  I had no problems with taking this drug or any side effects.  They said since I am a regualr user of Vicodin, morphine would not be as effective.  So I gave the go ahead.  Very glad I did as this drug worked as planned.  If I ever need this drug again, I will not hesitate to accept it again.

Acute Pain Following an Operation	45-54 Male  (Patient) 	2	3	1	Male	45-54	12/29/2008 10:17:34 PM	After major back surgery, I was being given Dilaudid in an IV drip, along with a Morphine PCA.   The Dilaudid made me &quot;goofy&quot; and hallucinate.  I demanded that they stop giving it to me, but it took about 3 tries to make it stick!  I will never use it again!

I was given a shot of dilaudid and within a few minutes, the pain had become bearable, and within 1/2 hour, I was very comfortable. The rekief began to wear off a bit after 6 hours. I am very happy with my experience with this drug.

However extended use has weakened it ability or strength at times which requires more to be effective. My Pain management Dr.is not good on increaseing dosage when I have a high theshold of pain relief. I have a high tolerence to pain medicines. I have been using this for 5 years.
Severe Pain	soldiermedic1318@yahoo.com, 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4		19-24	12/9/2008 4:51:38 PM	I recieved this drug in the ER during a visit where I was diagnosed with gall stones. I recieved 2 doses of morphine IV that did next to nothing for the pain. I wanted to die. The doctor prescribed dilaudid and it worked like none other. The pain relief was immediate and very effective. There was euphoria followed by drowsiness, which was not unwelcome. The effects are not especially long lasting and I also got nauseous, something not uncommon with narcotics but the side effect is well worth the relief the drug brings. Overall I would highly recommend this drug in cases of severe pain when other narcotics do not give enough pain relief. I am a US Army combat medic and wish we carry this drug in the field instead of just morphine 
Acute Pain Following an Operation	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/6/2008 11:54:20 PM	I received this drug after going to the ER with severe chest pain from an inflamed gallbladder.  The ER Docs tried morphine first but that didn't do the trick.  This did.  I took the drug intravenously before and for a day after surgery.  In regard to people who have experienced blood pressure drops, oxygen level drops, etc after taking the drug, I believe it.  Whenever the nurses administered the drug they watched my vitals on the monitor as they injected.  My pulse would dropped as low as the 57/105 after receiving the drug.  Overall the drug did an excellent job managing my pain.  I would describe it as a warm fuzzy feeling, and then becoming drowsy - which was fine with me, it made time go faster.  Regardless, satisfied customer. 
Severe Pain	tlh, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	45-54	11/24/2008 12:57:21 PM	This med may take away pain, but it can be a killer. This med caused resp arrest after 2 doses, I don't remember anything until the next day. I would rather tolerate pain than take this IV med, life is more important! This med caused my oxygen level go down to 40% and the level of carbon dioxide in my blood was off the charts. If I had not been found in time, I would not be here today. I was given Zofran with this med. Please if this drug is given, ask many questions and have someone with you at all times while this med is given. Now I feel tired and week and weird at times, hopefully it will go away soon.

Severe rib brusing and mucle spaz. I received this drug via IV. It worked great! for all of 5 min. I was very dissapointed in this drug, I literaly hurt more after each dose wore off, I received 5 doses in a matter of 7 hrs I was released from the ER that same night and was given 5mg hydrocodone they worked better in the long run. I was not pleased with this drug at all. Or the hospital for that matter.

I MADE IT AS FAR AS THE RECOVERY ROOM WHICH WAS TO BE ABOUT A 1 HOUR RECOVERY. MY BLOOD PRESSURE TOOK A NOSEDIVE TO 35 AND I KEPT PASSING OUT. IT TOOK THE DOCTORS OVER 4 HOURS TO GET IT BACK UP A BIT TO LEAVE THE RECOVERY ROOM.(50) THIS DRUG ALMOST KILLED ME AND I DON'T EVEN SEE THE SIDE EFFECT OF SEVERE LOW BLOOD PRESSURE LISTED. BEWARE OF THIS MEDICATION AND TELL YOUR DOCTOR TO NOT USE IT IF YOU HAVE NEVER HAD THIS CLASS OF DRUGS.  IT IS VERY DANGEROUS. IT DID THE SAME THING TO A FRIEND OF MINE WHO WAS GIVEN IT FOR SEVERE ABDOMINAL PAIN SO IT IS DEFINITELY THE MEDICATION THAT DID THIS. FOR THOSE OF YOU UNSURE, JUST SAY NO TO IT OR ASK THE DR BEFORE IT IS ADMINISTERED TO YOU.  I'M LUCKY TO BE ALIVE TODAY BECAUSE OF A RECOVERY ROOM NURSE THAT WAS ON HER TOES.

My father had 2 knee replacements and morpheine did not take the pain away so they gave him this. He stopped breathing and they found him by mistake. He is now very tired all the time. His blood pressure is fine if he lays down by very low when he sits or stands to the point of feeling faint. Then has to return to bed.

Severe Pain	Worried Spouse, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	9/23/2008 10:30:54 PM	Morphine was not helping (I am the caregiver).  It's been one week of treatment.  He is still in the hospital on 4mg every 4 hours, plus 6 Vicoden HP/day, Flexerill, Prozac, Xanax... not including BP medicine from pre-existing conditions.  He has degenerative disc disease.  Went to the ER for an abscess on his inner thigh which was diagnosed as MRSA.  After 10 days, he is becoming paranoid, swelling is still severe with not so much drainage.  Fever seems under control but white blood cell count still high, 19 down from 38.  He is calling everyone he knows to &quot;break him out.&quot;  I have spoken with the nurse on staff and very concerned for his safety.  He also suffers from sleep apnea which scares me due to the side effects of this specific medication. His mood swings are hateful and disoriented.  I have commented to the nurse tonight and will be calling our family doctor tomorrow to hopefully get him more help.  Something is not right but I don't know if it's the dilaudin or interactions of everything else.
Severe Pain	Matt, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	1		45-54	9/19/2008 5:58:44 AM	I received it IV while hospitalized for kidney stones. While pain relief was immediate, I was told to add this drug to the short list of those to which I am allergic. I didn't exhibit the traditional allergic reaction, however (difficulty breathing, rash, etc.). Instead, I started vomiting violently, sweating profusely, and the only other thing I can recall clearly is the room filling with nurses and doctors, one of whom said, &quot;I think he's having a heart attack.&quot;

I had told the doctor that I had problems after a previous surgery, &amp; apparently he did not take me seriously. Luckily I had a roommate who called the doctor in (he refused to look at me; said I was &quot;asleep&quot;), &amp; then called for the nurses. I was not given anymore pain killers except for aspirin subsitutes. I was truly in serious pain. Horrible experience. Apparently this experience is not all that rare. Nurse's comment was that she did not think dilaudid should be used anymore.
Severe Pain	joeyjoejoe36, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	7/29/2008 7:53:00 PM	I received Dilaudid in the ER to relieve severe pain from a kidney stone. The pain was the worst I have felt and I had open heart surgery at the age of 29. The pain relief was instantanious, but not quite complete.  The effects are short lived, but the relief is the best I've come across.  The side effects are not difficult to deal with either.  Only mild tingling and dizziness, and maybe slight nausua. As with all pain meds though, BE CAREFUL.
Severe Pain	merryfgdwn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/17/2008 8:35:55 PM	I went to the emergency room diverticulitus was given 2mg injection of Dilaudid and had almost instant relief.  Was given 1-2 mg every four hours for 3 days in hospitol via IV.  It worked great but wore off before the 4 hours so I was given 15 mg of percocet every four hours offset two hours after I got the Dilaudid.  The combination worked great and there was no OD on the Dilaudid.  I did sleep about 24 hours after I got home but then was fine with oral percocet.
Acute Pain Following an Operation	75 or over Female  (Caregiver) 	5	1	1	Female		6/15/2008 6:44:42 PM	My mother received dilaudid after total knee replacement surgery.  She received a mg or 2 after surgery and it worked well when morphine did not.  The next day, her primary (not the surgeon)prescribed a 4 mg dose.  She was not connected to any kind of monitor. The nurse administered the drug and left the room.  Within 2 minutes my mother was in respiratory failure.  Had I not been in the room, she would be dead.  Luckily there are no apparent after effects from this overdose. She's getting an new primary...
Severe Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/1/2008 4:47:08 AM	For an unknown reason, I have been experiencing SEVERE pain in my lower abdomen related to my irregular periods.  My doctor gives me narcotic pain releivers but sometimes they don't work.  When the pain gets more than I can bear, i end up in the ER and this medication is given through an IV.  Within a minute, the pain is completely gone!  It does make me drowsy, but to be pain free... it is worth it!  I would love to be able to inject myself when the pain gets bad instead of always having to go to the ER!!

I only need the medication every few month when I can not take the pain any more and have to go to the hospital.

Had my husband not found me when he did, I would have died.Be VERY careful with this drug if you have alleries to penicillin, there is a cross over reaction. I am allergic to penicillin and go into anaphaltic shock from it.Please be your own best advocate and ask the Dr.'s tons of questions to ensure you get the best care possible-despite however much pain you are in. It can be a matter of life or death.

Severe Pain	blueeyzmeme, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/5/2008 11:50:00 PM	I have Neuropathy in both legs and feet along with permanent nerve damage in my lower back due to a severe motorcycle wreck five years ago.  I went to the ER expecting the usual morphene, but was pleasantly surprisd to be given dilaudid instead. I was admitted to the hospital for three days and given an IV injection of dilaudid every hour. It was the most pain free three days of my life in the last five years. I suffered no side affects whatsoever.  I highly recommend asking your doctor about the use of this drug for severe or chronic pain.

Severe Pain	Nadia, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	2/11/2008 1:12:12 PM	In ER for severe Pancreatitis. Worst pain I've ever experienced! Morphine was given which did not work. Dilaudid was then given IV about 2-4Mg. Given every 2 hours. Pain returned about every 1 hour. On this for 2 days until I OD'd. 10 minutes after last dose my fiance walked in and I was not breathing and not responding. They revived me with Narcan which is used to overcome Toxic Amounts of Narcotics in the Body. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU ARE ON A MONITOR when on this drug. I was not. The nurse said if my fiance did not walk in at that time I would be dead from respiratory failure which is somewhat common with dangerous narcotics. More common than reported.

This one was completely different and all my old &quot;tricks&quot; didn't help.  Ended up in the Er and within 30 minutes of receiving this, felt much better.  Does come with side effects-extremely dizzyness and some nausea.  Be careful also-if you're allergic to codeine, you may have a reaction to Dilaudid.  I got stomach cramps just like with codeine but in the long run, it was worth it!
Pain	Non-e-mouse, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	35-44	12/25/2007 11:48:31 AM	DELAYED Allergic reaction.  I was given this medication in an emergency room for severe headache.  As with such medications I was kept for observation after the injection for approximately 30minutes.  Towards the end of the 30 minutes I had a mild itching but was sent home.  The itching became severe and I became sick to my stomach.  About 45-60 minutes after the injection I had severe vomiting, itching and hives.  My advice: if given this med, keep yourself under observation longer than you would typically think and be sure that mild itching is reported and taken very seriously.

I felt drugged and completely out of control to stay awake after 24 hrs. It just kept me down and I slept for four days being awake for brief periods of time. It really did work on my pain though imediately and I was GRATEFUL for that!!! I'm just not use to being so groggy for soooooooo long!! I'm just now starting to feel a little better and it's day five??... I have drank a TON of water and so forth but I have five kids and being down for four days has been a beast of a job, thank goodness hubby didn't have to work as much this week !!!

Dilaudid was like a miracle drug to me. It had been so long since I had gotten any relief for my condition, but Dilaudid relieved the pain allowing me to get up and walk, perform daily tasks and just enjoy life again.
