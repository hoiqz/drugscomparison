My last blood work showed increased LDL, total cholesterol, glucose and decreased kidney function which I am attributing to this drug. I have never had these problems before using this drug

After three months of taking it, I developed a high blood sugar (135)and Acl Hgb was 6.67. Does any doctor out there know if this is just coincidence or a cause of diabetes which my doctor says I now have.  HELP

The cause was dehydration. This prompted me to look up the other side affects which are too numerous to list. I've decided to stop taking it and just drink MORE WATER.
High Blood Pressure	mammyred2000, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	12/7/2010 12:29:03 AM	I took this med for about six years, then a new doctor changed it and I had to take something to relieve the asthmatic attacks the new one caused.  Eventually I was taking more of each and finally threw them all out for a few years.  Kept my BP under control with diet for a few years, then it started to rise again.  Docs tried me on two differnt beta blockers, which didn't work, so I begged my doctor to put me back on Chlorthalidone.  he did, and my BP has been normal for about a year.  I have to rehydrate often, with dry mouth, but it's worth it.

High Blood Pressure	debjs, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	8/9/2010 11:41:58 AM	I am very glad that my B.P is back to normal, but I went through some problems with this med. I am on 25 mg.'s and the first week no matter how hydrated I was my mouth had sore, not tomention the painful cramps and diarreha .I called my Dr. and she told me to cut in half for one week and then go back to full doasage and it worked.I no longer have the mouth sores, but I do have terrible dry mouth. I no longer have cramps, but I am now constipated.Too bad, I had a flatter belly than I have had in years, but now I am bloated, as Rosanne Rosannadana said, &quot;it's always something.&quot;
High Blood Pressure	jred, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	55-64	7/18/2010 4:02:29 PM	Just started this med a month ago.  I take half a pill (12.5 mg) a day along with Bystolic 5mg.  I have been on HB med for 5 years and have been switched to different meds a number of times. I believe this one is giving me some stomach discomfort. I am trying to get past this, but endurance for me is usually a period of time. We'll see......otherwise my HB is running 135/90.

Other	Chloi, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	65-74	12/5/2009 2:28:46 PM	I've just started taking this pill last Friday. I'm having to cut it in half as it only comes in 25 and 50mg's. And was wrote for 12.5mg Plus take it 3 days aweek M-W-F. When I took it Friday, about an hour later I felt odd but didn't think to much of it. As I was driving I noticed I couldn't read the road signs till I got on top of them. They were blurred. And this was like that for 5 or 6 hours. Really strange feeling. I will give it time to work as it was only my first one. I'll just have to wait and see if it keep doing that. I hope it clears up and works for me.
