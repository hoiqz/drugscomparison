Asthma	blossom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	7/14/2012 6:00:47 AM	Since Aerobid is no longer being made, I needed a replacement (I took it with Serevent for many years).  I tried this medication (Flovent) and got no benefit - only bad side effects.  It caused uncontrollable, nonstop cough, rapid heartbeat, asthma attack, and wheezing.  Also caused me to have almost lost my voice, sore throat, and leg cramps.  I could only take this twice before stopping.  Had to use my nebulizer to stop the coughing/wheezing caused by this medication.
Other	Nell, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	65-74	6/13/2012 12:23:00 PM	My pulmonologist prescribed Flovent HFA &amp; Ipratroprium for heavy phlegm.  I used it for about 1 year and developed Atrial Fibrolation. After many heart specialists, there was no diagnosis.  My heart was healthy.  I searched WEBMD and found that Ipratroprium causes irregular heart beat and in these reviews I discovered that an 8 year old had the same problem.  Also I became very hyperactive and couldn't sleep.  After discontinuing use of these two medications my A-Fib is gone.

Asthma Prevention	3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	5	1	Male	3-6	4/4/2012 7:08:57 PM	My three year old has been on it for about two months.  Since he has been on it he has experienced severe night terrors and behavior changes.  The dr. says that his lungs are quite clear now.  We have decided to go down to one puff a day and see if that helps with the night terrors and behavior.

It has changed our lives.  He started kindergarten this year and at this same time last year he had already been out of school twice for colds with his Allergic Asthma.  I would never had thought that his symptoms would just go away and have yet to come back.

It very often sounded scratchy and like I was getting laryngitis.  And I developed a sometimes heavy phlegm build-up.  I was lucky that I didn't also get thrush.  It was effective in the beginning, but after a year, my doctor put me on anew medication that I start tomorrow.  I could never quite shake the cough I had most of the time.

It's been 5 days and he now has trouble sleeping-no energy-nose is stayiong stuffed. I am decreasing his dose back to one puff a day-2 puffs twice a day is obviously too much!

Asthma	sk8ter, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	12/23/2010 6:51:44 PM	Flovent HFA has changed my life. I actually forget I have asthma now, which is a true miracle considering that I was having so much difficulty that I was going to have to file for disability and was having to take sctroids like candy. Guys, I caught a cold which turned into bronchitis on this stuff and NO coughing up blood, NO breathing problems, and NO steroids needed!!! What's weird is that the powder form of Flovent did not work for me; just the aerosal. My doctor told me that the powder can be a problem for some people. I have tried all kinds of inhalers including Symbicort, Advair, Serevent, Asmonex, you name it. Nothing worked. I was in despair. You know how it is ... anyway, now I am like a normal person. One thing I will say is that for the first week or so, it did make me a little jumpy, but now I have NO side effects whatsover. I do the Flovent, Claritin, real sudafed, Flonase, and Singulair and I am good to go. Only use the albuterol once in a while.The only drawback is I hate having to clean the inhaler with a Q-tip once a week. That's why I gave ease of use at 3 stars. But even that is not so bad.
Asthma	mom, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	4	1	Male	3-6	12/21/2010 9:04:31 PM	My son is 6 years old and was taking Singular, had developed severe behavior problems so the doctor put him on Flovent HFA 44mg and since he has been taking it for the last 2 months he is having even worse problems.  Aggressiveness, hating everything and everyone, always wanting to be alone instead of with his friends.  Do not recommend.
Asthma	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	65-74	6/28/2010 11:03:45 PM	I have used this med for over 6 years and it has managed asthma very well and only need rescue inhaler occasionally.  My Dr. said I could try going off it after the allergy season was overbut I immediately got conge so have been on it ever since. I do bruise easily and bleed under the skin from a minor bump, but I can breathe!
Asthma	charl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	3/25/2010 12:55:58 PM	My 3 year old son has been on this inhaler for over a year and it has made a huge difference. We have not had to go to the ER since starting, have not had to take oral steroids, and it has greatly reduced the need for Albuterol and use of his nebulizer. It made him a little hyper at first, but now that he has used it for a long time there is no difference in his behavior. (he still gets VERY hyper if he takes the Albuterol of Xopenex)It is difficult to know if he is getting all of the medication because of the aerochamber, but all in all his asthma has improved. 
Asthma	Leigh, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	3/16/2010 3:43:36 AM	I have been taking the Flovent HFA inhaler once a day as prescribed for a little over 5 months now.  It has not improved my asthma symptoms.  I am still having to use my Albuterol rescue inhaler.  In addition, I have had more colds and/or upper respiratory infections in the past 5 months than I've had in the past 5 or 6 years!  I counted them up.  Since November, I've had 7 total, every 2-4 weeks.  Whereas, if I EVER got sick, it used to be maybe once a year.  This really concerns me.  After reading the mouse-print drug info that accompanies the inhaler, I saw that it will likely decrease cortisol and/or adrenal levels and that your Dr. should do labwork to test these levels. Decreased levels can result in colds and upper respiratory infections. My Dr. has not ordered or performed tests to check my levels.  So, I've significantly reduced my dosage and use of Flovent and plan to see my Dr. very soon.  I still have respiratory congestion, but over the past few days, I have noticed that I have a bit more energy. At this point, I'm very determined to stop using this medicine altogether.  
Asthma	jmay, 3-6 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	4	3	4	Female	3-6	1/29/2010 10:38:24 PM	My 5 year old has been on this med for a little over a year. Now only uses it in peak allergy months. Does cause a change in her mood and behavior for the first couple weeks, and makes her a bit hyper.  But its not so bad as long as she can breathe.  My other concern is that since beginning this med she has gain 10 pounds in just about 1 year.
Asthma	londonrain, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	12/24/2009 9:56:16 AM	My 8 year old daughter is on this medication to help with her asthma and I do not like this medication.She started complaining about how it makes her heart feel funny right after taking it and it has caused her to be this really hyperactive child who doesn't sleep.When I informed her doctor of these things he accused me of giving her the wrong inhaler because 'Flovent does not make a child's heart beat fast'.Her doctor,despite telling him five times that it was a red and orange inhaler with a counter on the back,brought in two inhalers covering the name and made me show him which one it was I gave her.When it was determined I was giving her the right inhaler he just brushed off these symptoms and told me to continue to give her the medication.And on top of that the medication does almost nothing to help control her asthma.So I have a hyperactive, child who does not sleep,who looks tired and acts tired in that she is grumpy a lot of the time,and her asthma is still not under control.Very disappointed in this medication not to mention we will be switching doctor's.

Have noticed that I bruise easily and develop reddish patches under the skin and wonder how they got there.   I use a spacer, but the Dr only wrote a rx for one after a friend noticed that i wasn't getting full use of the drug.   Current dr has not ordered any tests, need to ask about tests.

Asthma Prevention	Darth42, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/8/2008 7:42:58 PM	Been on treatment for only 3 days (2x per day) and have noticed a considerable improvement. I have not had any major asthma triggers while on Flovent. For the first time since I was diagnosed with asthma, I did not use my inhaler during exercise yesterday. I have had no side effects whatsoever, and I was concerned I would have major throat/upper respiratory tract irritation (Advair did that to me and I had to stop taking it). The only negative thing about Flovent is the retail price of approx. $235 for a 2-month supply.  However, many health insurance providers cover some of the cost like mine. Other than that, I have been extremely satisfied with Flovent and able to enjoy living without the anxiety of wondering when my next flare up will occur.
Asthma	jerzie7, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	12/8/2008 5:31:39 PM	My four year old son has been on this medication for only one month, but it has been the craziest month ever. He is a totally different child. He is always super hyper, and before he was the calmest kid ever. Everyone sees the difference. He gets upset easy and back talks about everything. He also just doesn't look like he feels good. He has dark circles under his eyes, and he isn't eating very much so he looks pale and skinny. He has always been thin, but he is really showing it. All the doctors say he is normal, but I am really bothered by it, but afraid to stop it because he has really bad asthma attacks without it.

I didn't know why at first, but I had to take more than the reccommended dose to get the same effectiveness as the inhaler I had been taking.  Then, over the next few weeks and months, I got side effects including: bruising on my arms, rise in blood sugar, and increased susceptibility to infection.  By the time I had figured out what was going on, I'd had pneumonia and my asthma was worse.  By the time a doctor finally said that research showed Flowvent could cause bruising, I had deduced that it had got into my blood stream somehow and caused these symptoms.  Clearly my experience is NOT true of the majority who use Flovent.  It is a wonderful solution for many asthmatics.  But if someone experiences bruising and/or symptoms similar to oral cortico-steroids, my personal experience suggests that some other cortico-steroid inhaler would be better for that individual.  :-o (PS: it tasted like hybiscus to me, but you just can's go by my sense of taste!)
