Sneezing	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/1/2012 8:50:21 PM	I have chronic allergies and I found that Benadryl is the only over the counter medication that I can use that actually works. It stops my allergies and has me feeling better within a short period of time. The only problem I actually have with is is the fact that if I take more than two doses of it and go to sleep, some time during the night I will stop breathing for a few seconds and find myself waking up breathing heavily. This only happens when I take benadryl.
Other	Sara H., 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/1/2012 9:32:16 AM	ANXIETY: This is the only medication I have found that actually stops anxiety and panic attacks, I have tried everything on earth and this stopped it completely. You will have to take small doses if you need to be awake like me, as I have a job and drive alot. I learned to take hald of a table and it makes me a bit sleep but atleast the anxiety is finally gone.

They would always give me some kind of pills and a shot or two. I finally asked what it was that they were giving me and if they would give me a script for it because the Cogentin I was taking just wasn't working enough. The Doctor told me it was Benadryl and a pain drug. I asked if I could use a pain med that I was already on and OTC Benadryl and what dosage. When I had my next BAD episode of EPS, I did as directed and I was amazed that 25 minutes later, my muscles were almost totally calm. This time no trip to the ER! To me Benadryl is a real miracle worker!

Itching	Penelope3, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	5/3/2011 1:12:10 PM	I was taking Benadryl for relief from Poison Ivy contact, but after a week, the rash seemed to spread, not diminish.  I developed a secondary rash from taking the Benadryl and ended up twice as miserable.  My MD concluded that I am allergic to diphenhydramine, the active ingredient in Benadryl. After 10 days of Prednisone (for the rashes) and Percocet (to sleep), I was able to resume my life.
Other	Hollyms, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	4/24/2011 8:42:22 PM	I used this off and on for several years for insomnia. I will no longer use it for several reasons. 1) Tolerance develops so quickly, and I end up having to take 6 pills to get to sleep 2) Too many side effects have become noticeable, mainly intense itchiness, confusion, anxiety, concentration problems, etc. 3) I've learned it can cause long-term side effects. The risks and poorer quality of life that are involved with taking this medicine make it not worth it for me. I tried to go off it when I had been taking it for several weeks, and experienced withdrawal (mainly in the form of excess salivation). Hope I can maintain the willpower to not take it again!

I'm glad that there is something I can take OTC as soon as I have a reaction to a med. I take it right away and than call my doctor.Benadryl is the best OTC med there is in my opinion.  It covers a wide range of help for many causes of needing it.  I just love it and highly recommend anyone talking to their doctor about using the drug.

I had to use the generic, waldryl which did NOT contain alcohol and worked VERY well. I ranked the Benadryl for its alcohol content. However, I've been dealing with Asthma issues, ever since the allergic reaction.

I didn't know that Tylenol PM is benadryl.  I've been told that older persons should not use benadryl.  I've taken Ambien which gave me frightening side-effects, so I don't know what to take to get a good nights rest.  Also I'm experiencing a terrible rash on my neck and chest. Has anyone else experienced this?
Other	mom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	10/27/2010 9:53:02 PM	My 16 yr old son was given Benedryl by IV while hospitalized for familial pancreatitis.  Why, is still unclear to me.  Sleep aid or reduce his agitation. There are as yet, no formal findings by specialists yet but my son's vision, memory &amp; neurological system are not working properly.  At times he will feel thickening in his throat, other times he feels &quot;weird&quot; and agitated - that's when his pupils are so dilated and he says his heart feels &quot;weird&quot;.  He also experiences visual hallucinations during these &quot;weird&quot; episodes.  Over all, he does not enjoy how he feels anymore. So, while this report is not supported by the findings of a doctor; it has been 15 weeks and as the patients mom, I want to report this reaction. He exhibits most of the listed symptoms for acute anticholinergic syndrome which is a toxic reaction.

I suppose I have become allergic.  Anyone else have this happen?  I went to the ER yesterday morning thinking I was having a heart attack, but checked out fine.  The only correlation in the two times this has happened is when I have taken a medication with Diphenhydromine.

One issue is chronic insomnia. Having awful results with prescription sleep drugs, I appealed to my transplant doctor and hence Benadryl entered my life. Often I must take 2 tablets for results but the only side effect appears to be cotton mouth in the AM and this is easily remedied. I recommend it for effectiveness and safety.

I have taken this now almost every night for months and it helps even when I take it every other or 3rd night. I feel more refreshed in the morning too. I do wonder about the long term effects, as I have not seen any posted.

The entire right side of my body became paralyzed as if I had had a stroke.  This medication IS a paralytic to those of us allergic to it.  I was not able to use my arm, I had total right sided face droop and had trouble using my right leg.  Be aware that this can happen!!  I had used it per doctor's orders for severe reaction to poison oak and had been using it for about 3 days when this happened.  I stopped using it and the symtoms cleared up in about a week.

I do have a slight hangover in the morn but don't work so, not too big of a problem. Dr. said it was a safe drug &amp; been around for a long time.

Benedryl is great for occasional insomnia, but I found it causes rebound insomnia the next night. If I take Benedryl on a Monday night, for example,I have lots of trouble sleeping Tuesday and Wednesday, which makes me want to take more of it. Not a good thing. I cut out caffeine and diet sodas, take B-Complex, magnesium and calcium supplements, and now I sleep like a baby.

I believe that the reaction is called akinthesa, but I am not sure of the spelling. Taking this medication more than six hours before going to bed helps to alleviate the twitching.

I tried Ambien butthe side effectI experienced was sleep walking,which was frightening. I also took Tylenol PM, but I was concerned about the possible side effects. My doctor recommended benadryal. If I don't get at least 8 hrs of sleep, I will feel drowsy for quite a while after waking up. Other than that it seems to work just fine for me.

This is also combined with a stuffy nose, and severe headache. Antibiotics seem to alleviate the condition, but the earache returns within 2-3 weeks afterward. I have tried every sinus medication on the market which slightly alleviate the pain. Normally, I have to take 2-3 different brands together. Only after taking 2-3 doses of this &quot;mixture&quot; do the symptoms subside. I have always avoided Benadryl because I lead a very active lifestyle, and this medication makes me very drowsy. However, after taking just 1 benadryl, the pain was gone. I am amazed, and relieved that I have finally found something that works!!!!
