I wish I had known about it after my C section 7 years ago. Other than the mild stomache cramps this was a very effective. I used two half doses one in the pm and the other the next morning.

Even a drug call Amitiza didn't help.  My colonoscopy was normal. MOM is the ONLY thing that helps me have a normal stool.  Other than constipation, I have no kidney or heart problems.  My doctor doesn't want me taking it every other day. He says it's not &quot;good for me&quot;. Well, having a small pebble BM once a week was not good for me either!  I take it any way and I feel much better with no diarrhea or ill side effects.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	9/7/2011 10:39:12 PM	I took milk of magnesia for constipation that was not responding to stool softeners and fiber. It did not work the first day so I waited 24 hrs and took a full dose of 4 Tbs. It helped me go to the bathroom (diarrhea) but brought some unpleasant side effects. Sour stomach, nausea, gas/bloating, and vomiting. I do not recommend taking this because I feel it is too harsh. I have had better experiences with Smooth Move herbal tea for serious constipation.

Other	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	13-18	4/30/2009 11:18:06 PM	I use milk of magnesia on my face as a way to help manage blackheads. It doesn't necessarily get rid of acne, but it helps keep it under control. My mom read about it somewhere and got it for me about four or five months ago, and I have been using it ever since. Basically, all you do is complete your facial regimen as usual, and after putting on your moisturizer, finish up with a cotton ball and milk of magnesia! Hope this can be of some assistance to someone!

Inc the Caribbean we can purchase this in the solid form. I'm never been constipated, even before I had these cravings, no stomach acid or any of that so I can't speak on those issues.  But I am reading now that it draws the liquid out of your intestines so I will have to reduce my intake of it but I must also say I do drink a lot of water even when I not craving it.  I can't say really if a specific time of the month, week or year I just feel for it and I try to have it in stock.

Other	Gerrick, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/10/2008 1:56:24 PM	I read about using Milk of Magnesia for chronic and persistent scalp problems, itchy scapl, flakes of skin and patches of scaps and small amount of peeling skin on face, on my nose. I tried Nizoral and other treatments with small success. Milk of Magnesia, and the generic brands have all but cured me, my scalp has never been better. I wet my hair in the shower, put some on my scalp, rub it in, then put some on my face and in my ears. I then use shampoo, Nizoral, let it alll set while I soap up. I use the shampoo to wash my face with, rinse my hair and its done. I know how this sounds, but nothing else worked for me. Besides, a small bottle of generic Milk of Magnesia is a small price to pay.

Is this safe, my side effect is diarrhea for a coule of hours, then ok. But my kidney function is fine, so am I safe to use regularly if it does the trick?  Every other day or so?
