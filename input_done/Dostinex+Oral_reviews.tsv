In follow up we found Prolactin levels over 100 and a 5mm pituitary tumor.  I started Testosterone injsections and within a week had increased energy, libido, and mood.  Saw the Endocrinolgist who started me on Cabergoline.  Been on it 2 weeks and though Libido back I dont have the energy to do much about it, to my wife's dismay.  Seems like depression comming back too.  I guess im wondering if its endogenous depression or side effect of Cabergoline.  At this point am pondering re starting anti-depressant (Effexor worked well in past to an extent) and hoping to normalize hormone levels.  Time will tell i suppose.

Needless to say my hormones were out of wack. My doctor prescribed Dostinex and what a change. My sex drive is back and my hormones are in balance. It's worked for me and I recommend you ask your doctor about it.

My endocrin doc said I could never have children and put me on Parlodel.  I took one pill &amp; became so ill I refused to take any more (vomiting and severe head pain).  I went several years w/out menstrating.  After I was married and wanted a second opinion on ability to have children, I had my prolactin levels tested again.  They were high and diagnostics found a pituitary tumor.  I asked my doc about the Parlodel but explained I did not like the side affects.  He said that's all there was.  I stuck it out and eventually had a baby girl.  When I decided I wanted my 2nd child, I asked another Gynocologist (female) about a Parlodel alternative.  She said of course, Dostinex.  It has been quite a blessing.  Shrunk my tumor to almost nothing and I actually take less than prescribed (due, in part to cost but also because it's difficult to remember to take only a few times a week).  There is hope for babies on Dostinex.  I also take the generic now and it works fine for me.

As you can imagine the level of decreasing is very very slow. I am using now max.dosage. But i think it is the best for this,and we have to use it unless there is better.

Being a male, that was very wrong. They found that I had a pituitary tumor about 4 years ago. I was placed on the medication because I didn't want to do the operation that the doctor said I should have done. I can't say it was just the medication, but the tumor is now gone. It has completely vanished. My prolactin levels remain between 5 - 7 which for a male is just fine. It did make be a bit sick when I first started using it, but it was so worth it now.

I have been taking dostinex for about 5 years now and my prolactin level went from 75 to 20. I did have some side effects when I first started taking it, nothing major. Now I have no side effects. My tumor has not grown at all. I do still lactate, but not as bad as before the dostinex. 
Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood	jescalex@aol.com, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	4/6/2009 6:27:21 PM	I was diagnosed with a pituitary tumor when I was 15 years old. Can you imagine what my parents thought when I was lactating at 15? My GYN prescribed Parlodel. I tried it for 2 years and it made me horribly ill the entire time, and it never lowered my prolactin level. Finally, I was referred to an endocrinologist. He put me on Dostinex. It is well worth the price. For a couple years I had no insurance and could not afford the medicine. After I got insurance again and began the dostinex again I could tell an amazing difference. When I was first diagnosed at 15 I had never had a period (a secret I managed to keep from my mother). I was told at that time that I would never have children. I put the hope out of my head then and decided I never wanted them since I couldn't have them. When I was 22, to my amazement, I became pregnant. My husband of course took all the credit for &quot;curing&quot; me. We now have a 4 year old son. After I had my soon, my tumor did get worse but I am still taking my Dostinex and my prolactin levels are normal, they used to be 1,300-1,400. Dostinex is they best thing that has ever happened to me. For all the women who are told you can't have children because of this, keep believing and keep trying! If it happened to me it can happen to you!! Good Luck!!
Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood	Daffydrake, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	4/3/2009 1:47:36 PM	I'm atypical, a male with 5 cm macro adenoma. Went on Dostinex/cabergoline a year ago. Within 3 mos., tumor shrank to 1/3 original size (from hen's egg to bird's egg size!) Prolactin levels went from 12,840 to 75.Started at one 0.5mg tab, twice a week. Now I take 4 of them, twice a week. Huge, compared to many of you. Reactions were terrible last year, much more bearable now. Moods, memory problems have stabilized, etc.True, cab is EXPEN$IVE. Drugstore statement said with my health insurance, I &quot;saved $2,041&quot; on one bottle. Why so costly? Just Google the drug's name -- it's sold on the internet as a sex drug, for $30 a pill. If drugmakers can get that much from selling it as aphrodisiac, they don't care if YOU have to pay a bundle. My Pituitary Chat Friends support group talks about the drug (and much more) at pituitarychatfriends.multiply.com so stop by and visit. We had a great community on MSN boards, until they discontinued. Join us and meet dozens of friends who know exactly what you're going through. Admit it, even your family sometimes doesn't have a clue what it's like.
Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood	Brunneria, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	3/7/2009 4:20:13 PM	Turns out I had microadenomas (mini tumours) in the pituitary gland pumping out prolactin for the past 25 years, with attendent weight gain, facial hair, lack of periods, etc.  Once diagnosed (I will avoid the long story of patronising medical professionals who blamed every symptom on the fact that I ate too much), I was put on this drug.My prolactin levels have dropped from 5x that of a lactating woman to merely 2-3x and I feel MUCH better.  I still get vague aches and pains, blood sugar fluctuations, and various other symptoms, but I have lost 3 stone, mestruate, and feel much more 'normal'.Have had no side effects, but my consultant has said that he won't up my dose from 0.25mg 2x/week, because that would drastically increase the risk of side effects.Have been on it 3 years now, no sign of the microadenomas shrinking, but am very grateful to have access to this drug.

I wasnt sure how to handle this but my dr. was awesome! I've been on Cabergoline 0.5 mg (generic for Dostinex) for about 2 months and hope that I will be a lot better. The only downside is that it does make you a bit depressed, tired/drowsy,and is kind of on the pricey side, especially if u dont have insurance. For all of those out there that do have the same condition as me, dont worry your in good hands. =)

Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/30/2008 3:57:51 PM	I've been trying to get pregant for 4 yrs. Then found out my prolactin was 90, also have a pit.tumor. Within 3 mths my prolactin is now 22! Very effective. Ovulated the first time on the 2nd mth. This is my 4th mth on the treatment and I look forward to my next MRI test. First 3 wks I was super tired and dizzy but it  went away once my body adjusted. My doc told me this is the best drug for high prolactin at this time and other drugs have stronger side effects.

Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood	OZZY, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	2/13/2008 4:27:11 AM	In 1995, to my dismay I was diagnosed with a prolactin producing brain tumor.  What a Terrible shock the news was to me.  My porlactin levels were in the 1200 to 1300 range, and to make matters worse I am a male and my levels should have been from 0 to 26.  My doc started me on Parlodel 30 mg PO daily.  I became VERY sick and extremely depressed, both of which are side effects to Parlodel.  I changed endocrinologists and my new doc put me on Dostinex 0.5 mg PO three times a week.  Just last month my porlactin level was 14.  This drug has saved my life.  My tumor is managed by taking this medication.  I assume I will take Dostinex for my entire life or until the medical field comes up with a better way to manage my condition.The downside is the cost of the medication, even in generic form.  I have held several different jobs and insurance can be tricky at best.  But well worth any and all hassle I have had to put up with.In my best estimation this drug is a MIRACLE!!I am an RN and try to stay abrest to any new treatments available, but as of late I have had NO surgery to correct the tumor due to the size and location.Wishing you all the BEST!!Male RN in Wichita, KS
Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood	 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	5	5	5	Female		1/24/2008 6:40:41 PM	I had a cyst on my pituatary gland and had it removed in 1995. I was initially put on parlodel and it made me so sick that i couldnt handle it so I had the surgery. After my surgery the cyst started to grow back and my doctor put me on Dostinex. My level was 121 when I had the surgery and I went down to 60 afterwards. Once I was put on the Dostinex it went down to 26 in a short time. I am happy with that result. I still have to have an MRI each year to make sure it has not came back. The only disadvantage was that I didnt have any children, many doctors told me that i couldnt so I finally accepted it. I am now 36 years old and still on Dostinex, will be for the rest of my life but that is okay because fortunate for me the only side effect that i have is the dry mouth. There was a comment that someone wanted to know if there was a chance for children and I would like to say &quot;yes&quot; there probably is, dont ever give up on that...go to every Dr. you can until they say you can have kids. I dont even think you need to get injection (not sure of the name). I had another surgery back in Dec. of 2007 and had my left ovary and fallopian tube removed and my Dr. told me that I could have kids now. I was obviously confused since all my Dr's said that I could never have kids. Keep trying, never give up!!
Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/23/2008 2:05:10 PM	Dostinex is very expensive, It costs me 200.00 for 8 pills but this is the best medicine for this condition i've tried bromocriptine and it didnt work as good for me!  I was amazed when the doctor told me my tumor had totally disappeared after being on dostinex for a while.  I'm 31 and havent had kids yet i'm hoping i can have some one day with this disorder. My Endocronoligts told me there are some women that was able to and i just have to see a fertility endo doctor when i'm ready.

However, it caused my heartrate to speed up randomly and now I'm at the point where the cure is worse than the ailment, and before this, I was pretty healthy without any medical allergies or anything.  Please be careful taking this.

Now, I am having a difficult time finding it. I've tried the generic form as well as Parlodel, but they are not nearly as effective. 'Any news someone can give me regarding why it is so hard to get?
