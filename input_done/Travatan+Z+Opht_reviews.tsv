Increased Pressure in the Eye	blessed813, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	8/22/2012 8:46:26 PM	I started taking the medicine in January, using 1 drop per night. In about 3 months, my eye was red,dry, very painful and very sensitive to light. My eye doctor sent me to a specialist who've since then taken me off the medicine and gave me other eye drops. I even had to take a pain killers, because the pain was so bad. The problems still exist, and I'm having a little trouble reading and focusing even with my glasses on.

Sometimes it stings when I use it and other times, it doesn't. Also, I sometimes have sinus issues after using this drug. Other than that, I haven't had any significant issues with it.

Very expensive--ask your dr. for samples if you don't have ins. coverage.  Pull lower lid down a bit and drop the solution in the lower lid pocket.

Wide-Angle Glaucoma	75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female		2/26/2011 9:44:51 AM	I have some trouble gettihg the drops in exactly on the first try. Also I am an early morning person and when I am ready to settle down for the evening to read, watch TV, etc, I often fall asleep and then it's 1:00, 2:00, 3:00 am and don't know if I should put in the drops then or skip a day. Also, it stings a little when I put in the drops and I have a constant red lines in the whites of the eye that I've never had before I started using Travatan.

Increased Pressure in the Eye	7-12 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	5	4	4	Female	7-12	1/26/2011 12:34:59 AM	(caregiver writing) my daughter has juvenile glaucoma and has used travatan z for 10 months.  she has had side effects like bloodshot eyes, longer/thicker lashes, and maybe dry eyes.  IOP has slowly gone down which is very encouraging.  we like the 1 drop per night ease of usage.  here's a great tip from doctor to apply the 1 drop onto the corner of eye with eye closed, then allow drop to absorb down into eye (can blink a little if needed).

Wide-Angle Glaucoma	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	3/29/2009 10:57:23 AM	Used travatanz &amp; vision declined rapidly before cataract surgery.  After surgery L eye 20/20 R 20/30 but eyes red, felt like sand in them, with pain behind eyes.  Dr. recommended lubricant drops.  Vision decline now L 20/30 R 20/40.  Didnt consult Dr. and discontinued using Travatanz.  Have excluded nonocular side effects!  Will vision improve after discontinued use?  Unable to see rxlist terms &amp; conditions.  Disconnected when tried to submit this review the 1st time.
Increased Pressure in the Eye	Goodboy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	45-54	2/17/2009 10:00:19 PM	The first day I used this product my vision was very blurred and my entire eye and the area around my eye was red and swollen. The pain in my eye was so intense that I had a headache with nausea all day.  I will never take this product or any like medication again.  It has discouraged me from using any drops at all.  Not sure I want to chance this terrible experience again. What is the chance of this damaging my eye?

My eye lashes have grown and my IOP has gone down. I am happy about the lowering of my eye pressure but I am not too happy about the price.  It is very expensive! But it has less side effects. For now. I think.
