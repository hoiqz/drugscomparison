It burned when I put it in my eyes and in about 5 minutes, the itching was maddening!  This is my 3rd day using it and I really can't tell if it's helping.

No more goop in my eyes, just watery drainage. Only on it for 48hrs, but it seems to be helping.

This treatment was horrible.  My symptoms wer 10x worse over night.  When I called the doctor, he put me on a z pack.  Did nothing!  I am out of work for 1 week and I am in worse shape than the day I went to see the doctor.  Next stop will be the emergency room.  They are putting me on new drops. Hopefully, the new ones will b better.  As for this drug.......it is in the garbage!

Pink Eye from Bacterial Infection	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	4/15/2011 9:15:05 PM	I went to a walk-in clinic and was prescribed this medication to treat my pink eye.  After two days, both my eyes become worse. I went to my PCP.  The NP told me that this drug has been shown to be ineffective in treating the bacteria that causes pink eye and that the practice I went to no longer recommends this RX.  I was provided another Rx with two different drugs that have helped to clear up my pink eye quickly.

Pink Eye from Bacterial Infection	lily, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	45-54	11/8/2008 11:03:44 PM	I can't tell that this medication helped me at all. My right eye was very inflamed when I started using it so I didn't expect an overnight cure. However I started it in my left eye as soon as the first symptom occured. It didn't make any difference in the severity.
