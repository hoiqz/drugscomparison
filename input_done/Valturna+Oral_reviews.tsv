High Blood Pressure	karl, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	45-54	6/7/2011 9:05:54 AM	I have been on valturna for 1week and now I have a dry cough, swollen legs and tingling sensation in right leg. Headache and nausea with feeling of throwing up, stomach aches and cramps, my urine smells too. I am getting off this med before it kills me. I can't believe that for one medical issue, I would end up gaining multiple negative reaction from 1 drug, so much for preventive medication.
High Blood Pressure	chucker, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	65-74	5/18/2011 9:23:30 PM	Thanks to my drug prescripyion plan I was switched to Valturna from Avapro. I also take amlodipine. After taking Valturna for 2 days my blood pressure fell to 97/51. I cut the dose in half and after 2 days my blood pressure went to 188/89. Going to try the full pill again and see what happens. If pressure falls as it did in the beginning I will be dumping 90 day supply in the toilet. My thought now is, it's a shame the drug companies use the unsuspecting public a guinie pigs.

Lowered my BP within a week.  I haven't experienced any of the side effects mentioned in some of the reviews.  It has been a miracle drug for me.
High Blood Pressure	tt, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	45-54	12/27/2010 8:29:07 AM	One dose of 150/160 is way too strong for me.  Even half a dose gives bad side effects such as blurred vision, drop in blood pressure, nauseam headaches, and diarrhea.  It is difficult for my cardiologist to find any blood pressure medicine that does not give me these side effects.  One fouth of the 150/160 Valturan controls my blood pressure without many side effects.

After a week, it helped lowered my blood pressure as well as my pulse rate.  Around third week, I started coughing, having post nasal drip. Got worst and now my cough sounds like whooping cough.  But my doctor said it was due to my bronchitis. My dr. had given me 3 different antibiotics but none seems to work.  I do not know if this mysterious coughing is related to this medication but this is the first time I ever had this type of cough.

Doctor has not reduced other meds and I have to pay close attention or bp will go to low. I take my bp before taking the other meds as I really believe the Valturna would be the only one needed.

The only negative is I had a severe headache the first day, went to the doc and he said it was fine and keep on it, haven't had one since. My BP is back to my high school levels and helped lower my heartrate so overall I'm happy with it. I'm not sure if my sustained weight gain has anything to do with it though.
High Blood Pressure	Judy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	9/22/2010 7:13:18 PM	I've been taking Valturna for about 4 weeks.  My home blood pressure machine registers low pressure.  A couple of times it was very low, but I don't think it was correct.  I go to m.d. on Friday.  One or two evenings I felt like I was going to faint after I bent down, but that passed.  Sometimes get sleepy but that seems to be passing also.  Hope it works! Lisinopril made me very sick with one dose!
