Even sleep through the night on a regular basis for the first time in years. Have used the drug for one month with total satisfaction.

When I used as directed, it took a very long time for it to work. When it did, I only got one hour worth of relief. It made me restless, and I could not sleep. I also had headaches. I do not recommend this product. If it works for other patients, then I'm glad it did. But for me, it did nothing to help me. I found that over the counter medicines are more effective.
Other	Dragon, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1		45-54	8/25/2010 11:01:53 PM	Very disappointing.  I use it for nose allergies and it does not clear up my nostrils.  I feel like I am drowning when I take it, i.e. like water up my nose - awful feeling.  This is a generic in place of my Beconase AQ Nasal spray.  I miss my Beconase, but the insurance will no longer pay for it.  The Beconsase AQ worked the best at clearing my nose and head.

Fluticasone makes you verry hyper - don't use at night or you won't sleep!! You have to use more of it to get the same effect as Vancenase. I'll gladly pay more for the Vanceanse.

Odd side effect...I smell roses whenever I use it.

I started to use on groin area and it worked so well that I tried it on a minor iritation that I had since a kid (I am 55 now) it cleared right up and hasn't been back for a couple of years now. My insurance doesn't cover it and like a lot of drugs it is far more expensive than gold. It has been on the market for a long time now and the FDA needs to change its ways on generics.
