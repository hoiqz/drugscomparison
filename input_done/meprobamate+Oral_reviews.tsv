Anxious	worryless,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		7/18/2012 9:00:20 PM	Meprobamate has worked like a miracle for me. It effectively quiets my mind so that I am no longer stressed and anxious about so many things I cannot stop worrying about.  It's truly been a life saver and I have not suffered any negative side effects from using this drug.  There is no comparison of between Meprobamate and Zanax even though they are both used to treat anxiety.  I have found that Meprobamate is not always easy to find as many pharmacies have to special order it, and I hope it stays on the market.
Anxious	Thankful, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	2/15/2012 4:50:38 PM	I have used this medication for over 25 years. I work in an extremely stressful environment and I can't say anything but good things about the product. It is very effective in reducing the anxiety and the medicine has saved my career and has saved my wife and children from living on disability income!  In addition I continue to get high reviews on my work!
Other	Sylvia, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		10/3/2011 7:18:11 AM	I have been taking meprobamate for 45 years off and on when I was unable to sleep due to stress.(50 tablets a year?)I sleep. I wake up rested. No side effects. Recently I tripped and injured my back.(there were no drugs in my body, just a bump in the sidewalk)Relaxed Sleep is essential. Meprobamate relaxes my muscles so they can heal.Now my medicare won't cover.But will cover sleep drugs which cause sleep walking and loss of memory. It frightens me. I think the pharmaceuticals have done a hatchet job on this mild and safe and once cheap drug. Why?
Other	Coco, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	9/13/2011 8:50:58 PM	Was prescribed this medicine for frequent earaches from TMJ/clinching jaw from my ENT dr.  Used it regularly in the beginnning, but was also advised to stop chewwing gum (which I picked up when I stopped smoking).  Well, I cut back on the meds until taking it so infrequently because when I stopped chewwing gum- it made the biggest difference.  I have found that I can take this medicine when i have bouts with insomnia (which i deal with since I take ADHD meds too).  It does help to shut my brain down to ease into resting, so i'll finish this prescription. (but I have no refills)   
Other	waterslide, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/22/2011 2:58:31 AM	This is an old drug that was given to me 20 years ago for pain/insomnia.  I just started back on it about 9 months ago.  It is the best!!!  It helps me sleep and also takes anxiety/depression away.  I have several Painful illnesses that make sleeping tough and I also get anxious/down when I can't do what I want to do physically. My Pharmacy has to special order it.  They can get it from Watson Lab. in Corona CA.  I take one 400 mg in the afternoon and two 400 mg before bed.  But be very careful with alcohol... it really makes you sleepy!  Best not to drink anything while on this med.
Anxious	Bill B., 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	6/17/2011 1:18:51 AM	I have taken this drug for many years with no side effects. Very good drug especially with long term use. I take the pill and within 20-30 minutes I feel very calm without making me tired. I can drive and work without any problem. I have read some of the reviews on this site and some has said this drug maybe taking off the Market, I have not had a problem getting the drug. The mfg. of my memprobamate is Watson Pharma. If you are having trouble finding it ask your Drug store to try Watson. hope this helps.
Anxious	CarolWD, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/28/2011 5:26:10 PM	This medication is hard to find and may be pulled from the market soon, I find this extremely upsetting!I started taking it after several other meds failed to shut my mind down so I could rest at night, this med saved my life and sanity..no one wants me to stay on it and I'm so scared that I will become suicidal again.  It's been 11 years and I feel safe because this med shuts down my mind at night so I can rest and I have zero side effects.  I've tried to remove myself from this medication and my mind went right back to the racing thoughts and lack of sleep, I hate that my mental health will be sacrificed for the benzos which I cannot take without anger issues.  What do I do?  I gripe at family members for being addicted but this is different this medication allows me to be the me I always knew I could be and the alternatives don't work, please give it some thought before removing this medication.

I had a problem with panic attacks and found I could take one tablet and be relaxed within 30 minutes.  I was able to take one even if I was driving when I had an attack.  No side effects what so ever! Sometimes the old standards are the best.
Anxious	zoesmommy10, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/21/2010 9:49:19 PM	I've had anxiety for years (PTSD) and I just got prescribed this med a month ago. It is by far the best working antianxiety drug I have ever taken. It kills all of my anxity within a half hour, and has enabled me to leave the house and actually go into stores AND buy things, stuff I would of never of done before I took this. I have no side effects from it which is nice. One of the reasons I was prescribed this drug is because I am a recovering addict, so traditional benzos are out of the question. Because of that I did not think it was too addictive...who knows. It doesn't matter because I've finally found something that works well and quick even though I am on a baby-sized dose. Hard to find definitely, which sucks but at least my insurance covered it with a PA. All in all, good experience so far..
Other	Dianne, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	3	3	3	Female		2/2/2010 11:30:39 AM	My Mother has used this drug for many years.  She is now 90.  I am talking 30 or more years.  She has been on a very strong dose 400 mg daily for 3 to 4 times per day.  We have been reducing the dosage due to age.  Seems to be doing fine but could this reduction cause sudden sickness in stomach followed by a weakness?  
Anxious	moekub, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/21/2010 5:57:27 PM	I have been taking this medication for thirty years with no side effects. My doctor didn't want to prescribe it because it was &quot;TOO ADDICTING&quot; Apparently she had never experienced constant panic attacks and did not realize how effective this drug is. She tried a number of others such as Zanax, Valium, Paxil etc. but they made me feel awful-to the point I developed agoraphobia and would not leave my house. Fortunately, she sent me to a great psychiatrist who would continue to prescribe the meprobamate. I am back to normal but have the same complaint as others. It is becoming difficult to find and very expensive as well. I don't understand why something that works should be so hard to find. The pharmaceutical industry is trying to force newer drugs on us that do not work. I'm sure almost all medicines in this category are addicting so why stop producing one that works? I don't know what will happen if I can no longer find it- nothing else has worked for my panic disorder.
Anxious	kitty, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female		1/18/2010 10:48:43 AM	My mother was given this over 40 years ago and she says the same thing others have said in reviews but her doctor wants her off of it and she absolutely does not want to....is it that addictive??  Sure sounds like it and to top it all off my mother has a problem with alcohol which doesnt help any of this. She has been hospitalized several times over the last couple of years due to alcohol abuse and by the sound of it this drug isn't good for her but she refuses to stop taking it even when it is so difficult to find!!  And she notices it when she isn't taking it either--the hospital has tried to put her on something else but without success because she knows!!!  It certainly seems very addictive to me. This is so frustrating but interesting to know the comments from others. Oh and by the way my mom is 79!!!!Thank you for your help.
Anxious	levittowner2, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	12/9/2009 9:32:54 PM	Meprobamate helped me tremendously because I had insomnia, anxiety and tension headaches. It cured all of them, and in one pill. I brought it up to my Clinician and he exclaimed, &quot;I totally forgot about that one!&quot; The pharmaceutical companies continuously come up with new &quot;better&quot; drugs but they leave something like Meprobamate in the old world. It works, but use caution when on it... and you CANNOT drink. I'd started with barbituates, moved to benzodiazepams and this is by far the best.
Anxious	Veronika, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	11/1/2009 3:38:16 PM	I have been on this medication for 45 years and now I am having a hard time getting it.  What is the sudden supply problem?  Also it is not covered by any drug plans any longer.  Why is that?  Is this medication so dangerous that it is being withdrawn from the public?  If it is so dangerous, why have I been able to take it, without side effects, for so many years?  Does anybody have any answers?

It is the only one that works for my anxiety.The only drawback is that the Mfg. &quot;Wallace&quot; is the only one that really is effective and I have a very difficult time getting it.  The last refill was from a different Mfg. and it does not work.

I was prescribed it by my doctor for a nervous condition and it was the only one out of four drugs that I tried that worked for me. I have tried going off of it and my nervous condition returns. Now my pharmacy says they are having a very hard time ordering this drug from their warehouse. Are they manufacturing it any more? It is a generic--What is the brand name?
