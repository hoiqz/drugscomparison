Sprains and Strains	Wildthangrn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	6/22/2012 10:20:01 PM	I am an RN with lots of neck pain. Used this product on recommendation if pharmacist on my tight muscles. The only reason I am not in the ER is BC I have most everything here to treat the side effects. Worst burning I have ever experienced!!! Tried removing according to directions it has made it worse! I have coated my skin with topical lidocaine, taken Benadryl &amp; pain med! Needs to be removed from over the counter purchasing! I will tell everyoneU I know to stay away!
Pain associated with Arthritis	sandra, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/29/2011 7:49:25 PM	bought 3 hours the capsaicin cream, and it started burning right away, it was burning so bad that after 2 hours I had to go to the emergency room.I just got home with a bag of ice, they gave me benadril in the hospital and told to wait 24hours to go away this burning sensation.I never felt so much pain like right now, its the same sensation when you burn your finger or hand in a pot with hot oil.The doctor in the emergency room described this medication like &quot; having a hot peper in our mouth for 24 hours&quot;. AVOID THIS MEDICATION if we can call this &quot;thing&quot; medication
Pain associated with Arthritis	christinajjenkins, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	3/27/2011 3:41:36 PM	Umbearable continued burning sensation that could not be remedied. Washed site, applied ice 12 hours still burning. I had a choking sensation for several hours. 
Pain associated with Arthritis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/11/2011 2:46:51 AM	I purchased the ointment to apply to my knees.  The severe burning was not immediate, it started gradually and continued to burn.  I tried to ease the burning with cold water, then cool washclothes layed atop my knees, then I tried to wash it off with alcohol, it never stopped burning.  It has been 4 hours of intense burning, with No relief.  This is a very dangerous medicine to have, especially if a child or elderly persons gets ahold of it.  I will not use it again.
Pain associated with Arthritis	gatlingal, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	3/1/2011 8:59:19 AM	I used the roll-on to see if it would help the arthritis pain in my hand...  OMG the burning sensation was TORTURE. It felt like my hand was on FIRE. I washed it according to the directions, but it did not stop. After enduring this excrutiating pain for about 5 hours I finally went to the ER. They treated it like a chemical burn and applied silver-dine cream and gave me pain meds. They should have WARNING labels ALL OVER THIS PRODUCT or better yet take it off the market!  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT 
Nerve Pain	Hot Foot, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	11/8/2010 3:10:59 PM	Put this stuff om my toes due to nerve pain. I experienced what many others did: INTENSE BURNING. I tried to wash it off, no go. I did put vinager on the area and it helped greatly to reduce burning. The original nerve pain has subsided, but I think the cost of intense burning was too high. If I ever use this again, the nerve pain better be off the charts.
Nerve Pain	ellenwolfie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	65-74	10/15/2010 10:15:30 PM	I was recommended to use this by a pain management physician for nerve pain in legs.  I applied it and a half hour later, I tried to wash it off with cold water and dishwashing detergent.  It is still burning a lot.  I will not use this medication again; in fact, I am going to throw it out.  It probably should be removed from shelves.  I think it could be dangerous, and I read that this stinging and burning will go away 'in 48 hours' - i wanted to try it but believe it is risky.
Nerve Pain	SassyEclipse03, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	10/1/2010 4:56:39 PM	Was put on this med at an attempt to find pain relief and lower my need for narcotic pain meds. It did burn for about a 1/2 hour after applying but has since subsided and seems quite effective. I can handle the burning over the pain I have from Trigeminal Neuralgia. I did experience some brief dizziness/lighteadedness but it was very brief and hasn't returned.
Pain associated with Arthritis	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Male	45-54	9/26/2010 5:43:44 PM	I put on a patch to relieve an arthritic shoulder. Left the patch on for about 8 hours.  It relieved the pain with no burning.  
Other	DAS, 45-54 Male 	2	1	1	Male	45-54	7/11/2010 11:03:02 AM	I wanted to try this because I heard that it was good for pain relief. It was just about the worst day that I ever had!! The pain from the burning did make me forget about my other pain.I applied it to my big toe(gout) ankle(arthritis) and knee(degenerative) and if it worked I would use it on my other ankle, knee, thigh (pain) and back(spinal fusion). I applied it liberally as you would with any other cream. A hour later my leg started to burn and it only got worse during the next several hours. I ran home and jumped into the shower. The water from the jet spray felt like hundreds of little flaming needled jabbing my leg. I will give it one more try, but I'll only use a very small amount and stay very close to some ice.
Pain associated with Arthritis	JR, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	7/1/2010 1:59:11 PM	Used the roll-on version.  Within 3 hours I woke up with extreme burning in my knees which had a bright, sunburned-red look to them.  Sat in a cool tub of water and washed them repeatedly with a mild soap.  After about an hour the pain died down to a mild burning.  I was very worried about doing serious damage to my skin and underlying tissue.  Will never use again.  
Other	SUZIE	5	5	5			2/17/2010 8:30:53 PM	I USED THE ROLL ON CAPSASIN (CAPZASIN P) ON MY PSORIASIS SKIN PLAQUES. IT STOPPED THE ITCHING, WHICH REDUCED THE INFLAMATION. 
Pain associated with Arthritis	DJ, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	2/8/2010 6:44:56 AM	oh my god, used on knees in early morning before getting dressed, burning started that night, red and on fire.. and I'm up till 3am putting Neosporin plus pain relief on my knees. Burning like H---. why could this have EVER got on the shelf? I'm really hurtin here. Do not use this product. 
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	1/26/2010 3:53:10 PM	I got some of this to use for chronic tendonitis in my left rotator cuff and biceps.  Applied it and fell asleep; woke up to the worst intense burning I have ever had!!  My arm was bright red and felt like it was on fire.  I washed my arm and immediately applied aloe gel.  I then became extremely dizzy and nauseated which lasted for several hours.  I will never, ever use this again and will be telling all the patients I work with (I'm a registered nurse) about my experience with this dangerous medication.  I cannot imagine what it would do to the skin of an elderly person or a child.
Backache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/16/2009 4:11:18 PM	The people who have chastised this drug for being too hot are clearly morons.  What do you expect from a cream or back patch crafted from chili oil?  It is supposed to be hot.  I have grade 3 spondylolisthesis and the patch seems to help immensely.  It feels quite a bit like tiger balm, but last a lot longer.  I do, however, recommend (like stated clearly on the packaging) that one avoid showering or bathing as the product only seems to get stronger.  For some with deep nerve pain, this could actually be a plus.
Pain associated with Arthritis	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female		10/21/2009 10:35:14 PM	The burning was unbelievable. I have a very high pain tolerance and I don't have sensitive skin, but this stuff was intolerable. Wouldn't recommend it.
Backache	topmole, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	45-54	9/8/2009 12:41:42 AM	HOLY MOTHER OF GOD!!!...please stop please stop PLEASE STOP!!...It's 30 minutes later and an ice pack barely cuts through the intense burning pain. I don't know if I am just sensitive? I should have started with just a little in a small area first. I am sure that's what my doc told me to do but I of course forgot. Trying anything to get rid of neck radiculopathy...it sure made me forget about it but not a good solution! WOW! If I had enemies this is the shit!!! I guess you get the point - not recommending it!!
Other	Sugarplum88, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	4	Female	35-44	8/22/2009 1:20:52 PM	It burns like rubbing a hot pepper on your skin, but it seems to disrupt nerve impuses. The only point to this is if your pain is worse than the burning, I have trigeminal neuralgia and it is much worse than the burning from this cream. Like hitting your hand with a hammer to forget about the pain in your toe I guess. I rub it in deep and then have to sit for 45 min. with an ice cube in a washcloth over the spot, but I get several hours of pain relief which is worth it to me.
Other	cherrios09, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	8/9/2009 1:21:47 PM	I feel like the infected area is on fire, it's really red, and just wont stop burning. The side effects says this will last several days, but I am getting dizzy and feel absoultly terrible from the application of this product.
Sprains and Strains	Jack, 55-64 Male  (Patient) 	5	2	4	Male	55-64	8/5/2009 1:40:25 PM	unexplained long term relief, (months and years) from Bursa and other arthritis pains in fingers toes elbows as well as strains and pains
Backache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/31/2009 12:11:38 AM	Burned my skin badly.
Sprains and Strains	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	6/29/2009 2:31:39 AM	This product should be removed from the shelf!  I applied it to my right quad for soreness and tightness.  For a fairly small area, 3&quot; x3&quot;, it made my entire leg burn badly, even where I did not apply it.   I tried a heavy dose of dish soap and water as well as milk to make the burning sensation subside.    The milk seems to have helped.  I have also taken a couple of Benadryl since other areas of my leg became very red and rash like (and to help me get back to sleep.)
Other		1	1	1			5/25/2009 9:36:43 PM	OMG! I put his on my hands due to carpel tunnel while pregnant. I put it on at night, and it did not burn, until you take a shower or do dishes or something in that nature. Then it feels like your hands are on fire. NOTHING HELPS!!!!!!!!!! It takes like an hour for the pain to subside. IT IS AWFUL. I WILL NEVER USE THIS MEDICINE AGAIN. I COULD ONLY IMAGINE A CHILD GETTING THIS ON THEM. This product needs to be removed from the shelf. 
Pain associated with Arthritis	ws50599, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	5/21/2009 1:07:17 PM	Hint...don't use this where the skin is close to the skin...wrists, top of ankles, hands, etc. if you use the jell use rubber gloves. this ointment masks the pain nerves to the brain, putting it on to liberally will mask it so much you will forget about the soreness and worry about the burning. Hence...it did work  lol!  Use it for shoulders, knees, elbows and lower back pain and use it sparingly. 
Pain associated with Arthritis	jirvin, 55-64 Male  (Patient) 	5	2	5	Male	55-64	5/8/2009 9:45:08 AM	I used aspercream with capsaicin on the arthritic knuckles of my left hand every night and the tube is gone. the tube has a sponge applicater that makes it easy to control the application of the product.It burns alittle when it gets. My body tolerates it well and I'll continue using it.

Sprains and Strains	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	13-18	4/29/2009 8:52:46 PM	So if you got to this site because of the horrible burning pain - here's the answer... if you feel like you're gonna die and it hurts so bad you think you should go to ER try this first... it sounds weird but it works... squish a banana and rub it on the areas you're burning...we used a frozen banana which made it even better.. this will cut the burn... (same trick works if you eat too many jalepeno peppers and can't handle the pain in your mouth or lips...)  Really brings relief... and then throw the bottle of this nasty stuff in the garbage so you don't forget how bad it was and use it again!!!
Other	Rich, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male		4/6/2009 9:30:44 AM	Prescribed by VA Doctors following vaccination caused Shingles outbreak on upper right body, neck and shoulder. Applied small quantity to rash. Burned like fire. Immediately jumped in shower and washed off with soap and detergent. Pain remained for over 1/2 hour. Later found package directions (covered by Rx label) stated DO NOT USE ON RASH OR IRRITATED SKIN. (No such warning was on written documentation provided with medication.) 
Pain associated with Arthritis	Hot Stuff, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	3/17/2009 9:40:21 PM	Who knows if it relieves pain....the burn is so intense that you can't feel anything else!  My kneecaps are melting as we speak.  This is day 2 of my fun....I fully expect to wake up in the a.m. with 3rd degree burns. Can't say I would recommend it.  Jack Bauer could use this stuff as a torture technique.   
Other	mittif, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	3/14/2009 5:35:26 PM	I had put on my wrist the night before, and the next day it started burning.  Pharmacy could not tell me what to ease tnhe burn. I tried washing in cold water, did not work.  I did try noxzema, that seemed to help a little.   They need to remove this product off the shelf.  It could burn a child or elderly person if not used carefully
Backache	Firebranded, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	3/1/2009 11:09:59 PM	my boyfriend needed something for his shoulder..the pharmacist recommended capsaicin.  Off we went with the miracle cure in hand thinking this will definitely help cause the pharmacist raved over it.  well we rubbed it on liberally and within seconds HOTTTTTT.  We tried cold water, shower, vaseline, everything.  Lets just say this did NOT help but rather maybe it did cause I don't think he remembers he has pain in his muscle any longer.  I called the ER and they said to try milk to counteract the peppers.  It took the edge off at least.  We will NEVER use this product again!
Backache	hawaii lady, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	2/20/2009 9:11:36 AM	Used this .1% cream for sacral pain.The initial burning was severe, then I read I should have used a smaller amount and worked up to a larger area of use to minimize burning.So far this has been a very cost efficient method of treating severe pain.
Pain associated with Arthritis	angel22, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	2	1	Female	45-54	1/22/2009 9:10:27 PM	I too have had intense burning from using this product.  It was reccomended by the pharmacist so I purchased it and used it on my hands.  that was almost 24 hours ago.  Everytime I put my hands in water the pain comes on and doesn't subside for quite awhile.  I will not use it on my hands again.
Pain associated with Arthritis		1	4	1			1/16/2009 11:11:15 AM	I have used Capsaicin for planters fasciitis. It made my heal and arch feel like it has been on fire for 2 days now after the application. I only used it 2 times and will never use it again. This product should not be on the market.

The liquid came out and leaked on my other toes and now thye burn severely and I can't get rid of the pain. It didn't give me any relief for my pain.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	11/17/2008 1:30:36 PM	Tried the roll on to see if it would help my carpal tunnel. The severe burning kept me up for hours. Running cold water over the area gave temporary relief. I will never use this product again.
Other	Kiki, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	10/30/2008 8:41:59 PM	I have neuropathic pain in both feet.  Shortly after application of Capsaicin cream 0.1% on both feet I developed an intense burning sensation. It felt as if my feet were on fire, and that the skin was off. I didn't want anything to touch my skin. I decided to go in the bath tub and run cold water on feet, also had to add ice this provided some relief.  I spent over two hours covered in cold water. Each time I would get up the pain was so intense I had to go back in the water. Had to take prescription medication for pain &amp; sleep to get relief. The intense burning lasted well over five hours in total. I have not used again and would not wish this agony on anyone. Felt like I went to hell and back.
Backache	Face, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	10/29/2008 1:59:21 AM	At first it worked fantastic, but lately it's been less effective due to me growing a tollerance to it.  
Other	Debrajean, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	10/8/2008 3:19:11 AM	I used this cream on my akiles tenant, from the bottom of my foot, around my ankles and up the back of my calf...it burned, took the original pain away..However, after I showered the next day, in mostly luke warm to COLD water...I started burning again, it got so bad I went to the ER. I could not let ANYTHING touch my legs...even lose cloths and socks HURT...I am still burning...after being at the ER for 5 hours..all they could do is give me pain meds and stated this will last for a week...it may be an allergic reaction since the burning is not subsiding...I feel like I was am on FIRE!! SO far no blisters, but ER said there may be!! I read all the directions BEFORE applying and even did a spot test....it was all ok....NOTHING is stopping the burn, not soap and water, dish detergent nor the cooking oil, AS stated on the Capsaicin directions, IF IT burned to much! SO now I will have to take pains meds for the week and just hope it will go away sooner than later. DONT USE THIS!!! IT REALLY HURTS!!! I fell as if I put my legs into a HOT FIRE!!! This is Really, really painful and nothing is making it subside...I had to take a 10/1000 Vicodin that the ER gave me. it has subsided the pain SOMEWHAT, but really is only masking the burning!!! ANd after all the pain med dosage, I am still burning and awake from it, at 3 in the morning....I have been in a car accident and when they gave me this high dose of pain meds, Ifell right asleep...With this pain, even with the high dose, I still cannot sleep, since I still feel BURNING!! DONT even look at this cream in the store...RUN!!! IT IS HORRI\D PAIN!!

I used it nearly 5 hours ago and my elbow feels like the skin is going to burn off. Degree of Pain 10, I would rather be in labor. Can't wash it off either, nothing is helping. I am taking some sleeping pills to sleep and hopefully the pain will be gone in the morning. Not recomended by me.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	3	1	Female	25-34	3/7/2008 10:01:02 AM	My grandmother has used this cream for about a year now.  She swears by it.  However, my experience has been less favorable.  I used this cream, as directed, and I am in more pain than I was before.  The area I used the cream on burns!  That is one possible side effect...but the extent of my burning is near unbearable.  Not only does the effected area burn, but my hands burn as well.  I have tried washing, but to no avail.  It has been almost 24 hours since I have used the cream and the warming sensation is still intense!  My suggestions would be to test a VERY small area to make sure the burning is not to intense for you.

A little expensive for a small tube but last as long as the others because you need less of this. I use it on my back, hips and my left thigh when the sciatica acts up.
