I was given Actiq to try along with my long acting med. This is the ONLY drug I've used that gave relief enough to be able to get up and move within my own home. With it I can walk and without it I can barely get out of bed or even think of walking within my home. I'm so thankful for this. I plan on trying to see my daughter graduate college and my son's wedding. Without it I could not even think about going to either of these special events. I do wish it was not so expensive, and I could not afford it without my husbands insurance.

I am taking 3-600mcg suckers a day PRN and it is the only thing that touches the breakthrough pain that is just intolerable. You've got to have really good insurance...this stuff is $1280.00 for a box of 30(that's what they bill our med plan-I copay $10). Stay away from oxycontin and suggest this...my pain mgmt dr. says very few plans cover it however

Breakthrough Pain in Opioid Tolerant Patients	MMJ Patient, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/23/2011 6:27:26 AM	I was told that I was a &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; of &quot;The Lollipop&quot; for 18 months.  Due to it being an opiate, I became dependent on it very quickly due to having severe chronic pain in the penile area.  When insurance was covering the 12K cost every 30 days, it was &quot;very easy&quot; to use.  Once the insurance seized (terminated from work) I found that I crashed ...very hard for 3 months.  I knocked on several doors, only to be turned away, since it was a &quot;prescribed Med&quot;, and not a street drug.  Those were the toughest and longest 90 some days for both my family and myself.  Side effects; Like most of the stories, I lost my smile.  The remaining 7 teeth (as of this post) are black and ready to fall out due to being so black and full of cavity.  I did the mouthwash and preventive care, all to no avail.  I also believe that either this, or the current &quot;Fentynol 100 mcq patch 72 hour release&quot; that I am now taking for breakthrough, is/did cause some hearing loss (especially certain sounds) like hearing my 5 year old grandson, and my daughter talking on her cellphone when she calls.  I have found that, for me, MMJ (Medical Marijuana) works as a great break through reliever.  Only drawback is, here in Maine where it is legal (State Only), I can not use it upon admittance at a Hospital, nor I have to use my discretion in Public places.  At those times, I again, am forced to use a phama drug, in this case Oxycodone 5mg.  Overall; It works, highly addictive, costly to both parties, and has various side effects as most drugs do to each individual.

My insurance company still pays for this drug when most stopped if you weren't a cancer patient. Being a veteran is paying off. Tri-Care, our insurance, is paying for the generic brand, $900 a box per month vs $3,800 and my co-pay is $3.00 a month and I get 4 boxes a month. I've tried a dozen different Opioid class meds and a combination of morphine and Actiq is the only thing that works. It took three years just to diagnose my condition. My advise- brush your teeth after use. The medicine is mixed with powder sugar!

This medication has been my #1 savior. I unfortunately did lose all my teeth and had All-On-Fours put in. Now because the FDA and the local DA's are &quot;TELLING&quot; Doctor's what and how to prescribe medications. They have even come down on my local pharmacy (a national chain) and now they have problems dispensing. So now my Doctor of 5 yrs one day decided he was no longer going to write me, with NO-WARNING! This medication is by far the &quot;BEST&quot; medication for severe-chronic pain ever created! Although it can very easily be abused, its important that the Dr make sure the patient is (and remains) compliant, so be careful. It has been just over 2 months since I was cut off and my new pain Dr won't write it, or any other Drs. They are afraid of the FDA and others. My wish is for all chronic pain patients that are compliant, that they all have access to this medication, if the Dr agrees. To all the FDA agents &amp; DA's that are telling Doctor's how to prescribe, &quot;SHAME ON YOU!&quot; The Doctor went to medical school, not you! Let the MD's be MD's! I've spent the last 60 - 75 days going thru horrible pain 10/10 level, and constantly doubled-over since I was cut off! My quality of life (which was very diminished to begin with) has fallen to severely lower levels since being cut off, this is an excellent medication. If youre a chronic pain patient and are compliant, this may be just the medication you need, IF YOU CAN GET IT! Best of health to all!

Roxicodone and Actiq are the perfect combination that works for me. I have tried many other drugs with no relief or horrible side effects. I have not had any problems with my teeth and I have been on it for 3 years. I do rinse my mouth with a restoring mouthwash or water after use each time. I do believe you can use this medication without tooth loss if you are proactive. My problem is now finding a doctor that will continue to care for a chronic pain patient and prescribe these meds. My doc abandoned me after 3 years and I cannot find a new doc that will continue the meds. I don't understand why a pain management doc would refuse to write these scripts. I have called so many doctors lately only to be told they are not taking on chronic pain patients. Where do I go from here pain and withdrawal? I just don't get it. I need a pain management doctor. HELP

It has been very effective, but it is true that it is very detrimental to your teeth.  I have lost quite a few teeth due to this medication, however, I don't know of any drug that is even remotely as effective as Actiq.  I also had a problem with my insurance company wanting to cover it, however with 2 appeals and just explaining to them that by them covering it for 2 years, and then suddenly denying the claim that it was unethical at the very least.  I explained that going forward, if they wanted to deny the claim to member's that never were prescribed it before, that is understandable, but by me having been on it and them covering it for 2 years, I should be &quot;grandfathered in&quot;.  They ultimately agreed, and continued to cover it.  To anybody that is having a problem with their insurance carrier, try to appeal to their sense of decency, and mabye they will reconsider.  Let me repeat, I had to appeal 2 times before they would cover it.  Don't give up!!

But, I didn't know that I was destroying my teeth. I lost at least 8 teeth and my dental expenses are great (even with dental insurance). Then my insurance co. quit covering it for me since I didn't have cancer. I didn't have withdrawal, but nothing else has worked for me as it did. I don't understand why it has to be so expensive.

It allowed me to continue living my life, despite a bad migraine, so that I could do things like celebrate Christmas or birthdays with my family.I think that it's been 1 year since my neurologist stopped prescribing it for me because of the black box warning against using it for migraines or bad headaches.  The people who made this decision do not get chronic migraines and obviously do not know what it's like to literally be disabled by migraines.I haven't had any problems with my teeth because of this drug.Being disabled from migraines has ruined my marriage and damaged my relationship with my teenage daughter, not to mention making me depressed and anxious that I won't be able to live up to commitments or be able to simply enjoy my life.

It's extremely effective for severe breakthrough pain. As with most Rxs that offer real relief, it is expensive beyond belief. If you can find some way to afford it &amp; find a Dr. willing to help, I wish you Luck. God Bless &amp; take care of yourselves.

Like a lot of people it was the only combination that gave me a quality of life after 3 years of therapy &amp; the meds. I was walking without crutches,braces , or a cane.Now I'm back in severe pain using my leg brace &amp; cane to keep from falling!  I guess when I fall &amp; mess up my new implant that is a 10 year rechargeable the insurance company won't be happy when they have to pay for the surgery to replace it sooner.I have had my Dr. speak on my behalf in the stage one appeal and was denied because I don't have a history of cancer it is considered &quot;off label&quot; &amp; my pain is a chronic nonmalignant. So even knowing it is the one thing that gave me some quality of life back since I don't have cancer then I can go back to sitting in front of the TV in pain &amp; not sleeping again. I can do a stage 2 appeal but after reading all the other stories I don't think I will put myself through it again even though it states they must reply to the appeal within 72 hours they took 7 days . To sum it up I believe it is all about the cost of the Actiq that is the bottom line.  Good luck to everyone I feel your pain.

I have taken the suckers for over 4 years and yes they work wonderfully for pain. The problem came in about 6 months ago when my insurance wouldn't pay for them and I had to come off of them, it was the most excruciating thing I've ever been through, I had to check into a detox facility to get off of them it was so bad. They also made all of of my teeth basically turn so soft they fell out!! I had to spend over $20,000 fixing them. If you have no other choice this medication does work great, but if you have another option the benefits do not outweigh the risks.

It works extremely well for me, and I can no longer afford to pay for it out of my own pocket. Thank you to anyone for their help in this matter! Kim
Breakthrough Pain in Opioid Tolerant Patients	kimkimby9, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/21/2009 5:21:21 AM	I was diagnosed with RSD and 3 herniated discs due to a work injury 10 years ago. My doctors tried numerous procedures and physical therapy, and nearly every pain medicine known to man. Due to severe allergic reactions, or no relief, they finally put me on the Actiq suckers. They worked amazingly. However, workman's comp. refuses to pay because I don't have cancer (like it is a work-related illness(?). My regular insurance paid for it for a whole year, $7999 a month, then took it off their formulary. So now have appealed to numerous insurance companies to pay for it-but they are all worked up about the price, even though I can get it compounded by a pharmacy for only $900 a month-yet they still won't pay. Waiting for the new year of insurance formularies to see if any will now cover it for non-cancer patients. I've paid over $9000 out of pocket just this year and lost all my teeth but it is the only medicine that has worked for the past 10 years, so I can have a life outside of bedrest and severe, non-relenting pain. Again, I would like to see those insurance people who are denying coverage of this lifesaver drug to get the dsease themself-and try to live without helpful medicine. Heck, they will cover ERECTILE DYSFUNCTON- NOT a chronic pain condition, and they will cover AIDS patients that shoot up drugs and their medicines are very expensive-yet they won't cover pain medicine to people who just got hurt doing their job or living life-because it costs a lot of money. They want us all to get CANCER before they will cover it! It is ridiculous!

I use it &amp; have Medicaid alone.  I've been warned that if I go on Disability or Medicare, or get extra insurance assistance, It will be taken away.  I've gone without the help a Disability payment would help me &amp; my family &amp; that I deserve just so I could continue to receive the help that Actiq has given me.  All I can suggest is that if possible, try to apply for Medicaid &amp; maybe the patients who need Actiq can get it.  I wish I could help with a suggestion that would definately work.  Good Luck &amp; I will pray that all those who need help getting any medication needed that is being withheld from them for chronic pain.

I use 800mcg.(every 2 hrs) &amp; 1600mcg.(every 4 hrs) for breakthrough pain which has been a lifesaver.  Of course, I don't have to use it that often, but it is nice to have if needed for those really bad days.  The major drawback is that is devastating to your teeth.  I had beautiful healthy teeth &amp; within probably 6 months to a yr, they just began to rot from the inside out &amp; just break off.  I now have 3 teeth left.  Please be aggressive about tooth care if you choose this medication.  Also, please keep out of the possible reach of children because it does taste &amp; smell exactly like candy &amp; a child could mistake it for candy which could be very dangerous.  Good Luck with anything that helps all the people who suffer from chronic pain.  Thank you for listening.

I've been on the Fentanyl Patch for years now (high dose) but, still needed something for breakthrough pain.  My Dr. gave me Actiq &amp; it worked fairly well for additinal pain relief. However, listen to the remarks regarding YOUR TEETH!! This medicine will without a doubt - ruin your teeth!  I've lost 4 teeth so far, &amp; the front ones are the first to be affected (that's right were the Lollipop goes - behind your front teeth). I thought maybe it was just a coincidence because it's was a while since my last visit but, my Dentist said he has seen more than a few patients loose their teeth because of this medicine. I can't imagine in this day &amp; age, with all of  the artifical sweetners out there, they would make a medicine that helps your pain but, destroys your teeth! In closing, my sister was also placed on this Rx and she now has only 20 of her teeth left! Heed The Warnings!!!

An allergy specialist recommended fentanyl because it has the least &quot;mast cell.&quot; I have chronic pain, spinal stenosis, and pay out of pocket because insurance will only cover cancer patients. I always use lowest dose I can and one to two a day. Now I fear my neurologist will stop writing prescrips due to FDA. I will have NO OTHER OPTIONS. I even had an allergic reaction to my allergy shots! What are folks like us to do? This gives me my life, and I have never felt high, only relief. Prior to Actiq, I tried muscle relaxants, Cymbalta, Lyrica, spinal injections, PT, yoga, biofeedback, acupuncture, chiropractic and now do Pilates. EVERYTHING alternative (and not covered by insurance. These, I can suck a few minutes and get on my way. I do also take Topamax. Allergists won't test me for less expensive narcotic options for fear of the risk.What will I do?! I beg that the FDA allow for cases where people are allergic and opiod tolerant and responsible. I tried the patches, but prefer the sticks so I can only use as needed.
Breakthrough Pain in Opioid Tolerant Patients	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/9/2009 5:42:15 PM	In 2000, I slipped &amp; fell at my job (yeah..worker's comp claim..but what else could I have done?). I &quot;shifted&quot; by saccrum, right hip, &amp; tailbone &amp; have severe, chronic low-back pain &amp;, because I'm Hyper-Mobile (meaning my joints are looser than the average gymnast), the results of the fall were worse than what would be considered normal. After starting out on Lorcet &amp; Flexeril, in 2007 my pain management doctor put me on the 200mcg &quot;lollipops&quot; &amp; they worked pretty good but, after about almost a year, he had to up the mcg to 400. They worked GGGREAT for breakthrough pain while I waited for my Lorcet/Norco to &quot;kick in&quot;. Then, in early 2008, work. comp. denied payment for them any longer because I didn't/don't have cancer so my doc is BACK to &quot;trial &amp; error&quot; trying to find something that works and so far, nothing does. I am taking Kadian SR(morphine sulfate), Roxicontin, &amp; Lyrica &amp;, all 3 combined, don't even come close to doing what the Actiq did!! My doc, attorney, &amp; I are fighting to get the Actiq back but I don't know if it will happen. Like so many others who's ratings I have read, it just blows my mind that these insurance companies have NO CLUE of the effect that non-payment for this med is having/has on people who are in chronic, EVERY DAY pain! God forgive me, but I PRAY that ALL OF THEM &quot;will have their day&quot; when something that works so GREAT for pain is denied to them!! Let THEM see for themselves!! GRRRR!

However, the combination of Methadone &amp; Actiq was the worst on my teeth. By the time I realized there was problem Id already lost several teeth to decay that turned them so soft they could be pulled apart with my fingers. ive been devastated at the loss of my previously beautiful straightened smile. Heed this warning &amp; See your Dentist for prevention rather than repair! Good Luck with Actiq- Resoect how it helps but Be Wary how it can hurt

I am a 33 yr. old female whom is disabled.  I have used every pain medication that is available to control my pain that stems from more issues that I have time to explain.  Before my Dr. prescribed the Actiq 1200mcq to me I would visit the ER 3-4 times a week for pain relief.  After I spent almost a month in the hospital diagnosing all of my issues he has tried me on Oxycontin 20 mg 3x a day and then when that didn't seem too work he put me on the Fentanyl patch 100mcg.  During the trials of these two meds he also gives me 8 1200 mcg Actiqs per month.  It ended up that the Oxycontin and Actiq seems too be the best combination for me.  I hope that if there is anyone else out there who is struggling with chronic debilitating pain that you can find a doctor as compasionate and caring as the one that I have that has been caring for me since 2001 and will do anything in this world for his patients!!!! Good Luck.

I did physical therapy, water therapy,multiple epidural injections, 2 surgeries and many different medications for break through pain.My pain management dr. placed me on Actiq and it worked. After 2+ years my insurance company will no longer pay for it. They denied the perscription and I went through withdraw. I am in my thrid appeal to get reapproved. Insurance companies have no right to say what you should have or can't have!! It should be up to your Dr. and you. Now I'm back to suffering. Can anyone help???

I have suffered chronic, unrelenting pain (neck &amp; back) for over 8 years, had numerous surgeries and been through the gambit of treatments, Epidurals and have an Implanted Drug Pump that is filled with Fentanyl so I thought it might be wise to use just 1 medication (in the pump) for chronic &amp; breakthrough pain - I have noticed 2 serious side effects in just over a month: 1.) pain is worse when the Actiq wears off usually in 2-3 hours and worse of all 2.) a significant change in mood - have had several bouts of Rage (I don't mean simple anger but all out Rage to the point where my wife has been afraid of me.  I have been on all Pain Medications (Dilaudid, Oxycontin, Oxycodone, Morphine, Ultram, Methadone ad nauseam and this is the only medication that I have such a significant change in mood, I'm going to switch off of it for this reason unless my Doctor can counteract this.

I'm taking it at the lowest dose of 200mcg.  The &quot;lollipop&quot; form helps it act faster, but of course this is less convenient than a pill.  Also if you have children make sure to lock it up.I have herniated discs with stenosis and will probably be getting surgery later this year.  The Actiq helps when the percocet isn't working as well.  Neuropathic pain can be difficult to treat, even with powerful opiates, and Actiq helps me control breakthrough pain.  Often I'll combine it with 1/2 the normal breakthrough dose of Percocet.  I also take Lyrica.One other reviewer rated this drug badly because she claimed her sister was addicted.  Look, if she is taking it without a medical condition then get her help.  If she is taking it for legit reasons, and it helps with her pain, I suggest you be a little more sympethetic.  Also, you need to understand the difference between tolerance and addiction. If you've never lived with chronic pain, consider yourself lucky.

The first two years I felt like a new person but I believe my body has built up a tolerance to the mg's and now it no longer helps my pain. I need the dosage increased instead of feeling like a human pin cushion from all the pain blocks I have done.

It changes entire chemical makeup of your saliva and continues to do so even though you are not actively using one.  I get mine sugar fee- by a special compounding pharmacy.  Ask your doctor to write &quot;OK to compound&quot; on the prescription.  ExpressScripts has paid just like always.  I did have to appeal though. My husband takes 500mcg lollipops that are 1555.00 for90.  The painn doctoor should warn patients that a regimine of mouth washes and soaking your teeth frequently in medicated trays is very effective if using sugar-based Actiq.Don't wait until dentures are the only option!
Other	non addicted migraine sufferer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/22/2008 5:06:51 AM	After dealing with chronic migraine headaches since I was 12yrs old, I am now 48 yrs old and my headaches went from bad to worse. I thought going through a total hysterectomy would help ,but it did not. Also, my headaches changed location from the top of my head to also behind my eyes. They became so severe that I was vomiting constantly and if I went to the E.R.,I was accused of trying to get drugs and told that I had a drug problem! I ended up with 5 bleeding ulcers do to all the motrin I was forced to take and with little or no relief. I finally went to a wonderful pain specialist, and he did try many other treatments before starting the Actiq. It was a miracle and today I don't get them nearly as often and when I do,I can usually stop it in just a few minutes. I just wish the &quot;MAJORITY&quot; of physicians would send patients with pain that does not go away by normal treatments to pain specialists! And I also wish that every one of them would go through some kind of pain like a migraine because they would hopefully be more compassionate. I wouldn't actually wish this on anyone ,but thank goodness for Actiq!! It gave me my life back!! thank you

My insurance is now dening it because of the cost.  It doesn't matter to them (Express Scripts) that I'm back to being in constant pain with nothing even coming close to helping.  Typical insurance company; it doesn't matter how bad you are and it doesn't matter if there is a drug out there that gives you back some of your lost quality of life because it's expensive.  I'd like to trade physical conditions for a month with them and see who is singing a different tune after the month is up.

I've been using the Actiq for breakthrough pain relief for over 4 years. It does a pretty good job at controling my pain.I would recommand it to anyone with chronic pain.

I had four stomach surgeries. I am now 60 yrs old and I am dealing with systemic scleroderma and raynauds syndrome. I actually have CREST SYNDROME in which each letter in the word crest is a disease and if a person has two out of the five diseases they are considered to have crest syndrome. Unfortunetly I have all five. I also have neuropathy in my feet and I have had a major back fusion. When I first tried the Actiq lozenges it was the first time I felt some releif from the horrific pain I am continuously in however my pharmiscist gave me fentanyl lozenges one month and I had difficulty breathing. I don't understand WHY there is a difference between the two medications?

This medication seems to be the only thing to relieve my breakthrough pain.I only wish there wasnt such a stigma attached to narcs in this country.
Breakthrough Pain in Opioid Tolerant Patients	UMBrynn, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	2/9/2008 8:45:56 PM	I have been on Actiq 400mcg x 6 per day now for approximately 6 months.  It worked incredibly well when I first started the medicine, but again, as with every other pain med I have taken (Oxy, Vicodin, Percocet, Roxicontin, Morphine Sulphate, Tramadol, etc) it has become virtually non-helpful.  I'd say by taking one, I receive about 1/2 the original relief (bringing severe chronic back pain from my nerve degeneration, 10 dissocated discs and 4 herniated discs along with severe muscle and tendon tightening/cramping to a moderately tolerable level) for approximately 30 minutes.  I require 2 of the lollipops to get myself out of bed and moving in the morning.  I am also on 80 mg Oxycotin every 12 hours for constant pain, while the Actiq is for breakthru pain.  I hesitate to move up to the 800 mcg dosage due to the inability to anethitize (sp) for the soon to be required back, neck and ankle surgeries.  I worry that there is not many drugs stronger than Actiq to rely on if my tolerance continues to strengthen.  Even as a child, adult-dose pain meds after my 2 surgeries did not work.  I am simply extremely tolerant.  They do work extremely well for everyone else I have personally known to take Actiq.  The side-effects mentioned have not affected me: no teeth issues whatsoever.  Maybe I haven't been on them long enough?  I did notice some gum degeneration at first, but with good teeth maintenance combined with restoring mouth wash, the problem dissappeared within weeks.

Unfortunately insurance companies such as mine are refusing to pay for actiq for non cancer patients. I guess constant chronic pain just isnt severe enough for them. I dont get how an insurance company can take this drug or any drug away from a patient that has made their life managable and able to function with the pain. How could they want to take a persons life away?
Breakthrough Pain in Opioid Tolerant Patients	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/21/2007 3:07:14 PM	I have chronic back pain and have tried many medicines. I like the Actiq because I can suck on the lollipop and then put it down when my pain subsides. This is more effective than other treatments like Norco, Morphine, Dilaudid and the very ineffective Methadone. I would highly recommend this medicine to anyone suffering from severe chronic pain!
Other	Kim, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	1	1	1	Female	35-44	11/27/2007 8:37:15 PM	My sister takes this drug for &quot;neck pain&quot; and now all her teeth are rotting out. She will have to get dentures now. She loves this drug and is very addicted to it so I would suggest to anyone not to take it. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	11/17/2007 1:45:55 PM	Actiq is important for me to function because I suffer from sereve pain and have life-threating allergies to codienes, morphines, and there derivatives. Unfortunately, I had a very difficult time finding a doctor who would put me on this medication. Most doctors that I consulted told me that if I could not take a codiene or a morphine then I would not be able to get treatment.
Pain In a Cancer Patient When On Pain Medication	ttyler@midwestheart.com, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	11/12/2007 6:57:09 PM	I am a cancer survivor, it's been yrs! However, due to surgeries, my back is pretty messed up. After trying many diff things(alt trmnts &amp; Meds),this one seems to hit the spot! However, I am having the same teeth problem. A suggestion is..you can get fetanyl in a pill dissolving form. It's sugar free and fizzes like a mini alcisolser,(sorry, cant spell that). It works well, I prefer the Actiqs more though. The fact that teeth are rotting out of people's heads are freaking me out I must say! The other problem with the Actiqs are that it is VERY easy to exp. withdrawl symptoms. This is a strong med so if you are prone to addiction, I HIGHLY reccomend that you NOT start this Rx!

Am now starting another medicine due to deaths this year reported caused by inproper dosing.  It is listed for break thru cancer pain.  This drug really worked great for me.
