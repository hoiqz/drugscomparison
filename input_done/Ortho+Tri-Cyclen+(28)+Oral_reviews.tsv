Painful Periods	JessieBS, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	9/25/2012 8:44:54 AM	I was on this pill when I was 19yo for help with cramping.  I started taking it September, by May I had had stroke.  I would not recommend this medication for anyone.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	19-24	9/13/2012 9:55:42 AM	I started taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen about a year and half ago. For the first 6 months everything was great. After the 6 months I started noticing a change in my personality. I have always been some what sensitive, however this intensified those feelings. I cry over everything and anything. If something makes me extremely happy, I cry. If something makes me sad (but not I would not normally cry over) I cry. I feel as if it really just intensifies my mood x1000. I have also had problems with re-occuring yeast infections. I get one about every 6 weeks. I did not gain any weight at all. I had moderate amount pimples before...now I usually only get them around my period. I have just recently switched pills to see if there is any difference but I am currently having trouble with high copays. I honestly think that no BC is good for you, you just need to pick and choose which side effects you are willing to deal with. 
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	9/10/2012 1:10:05 PM	I started using Ortho Tri-Cyclen for acne 2 months ago. So far it hasn't helped my acne at all-I think it may actually be worse. I have had some spotting in between periods, but I think that's normal when starting new birth control. I have been somewhat more emotional and depressed but its usually right before my period. I haven't noticed any extreme side effects but it just seems like its not helping acne! I'm going stay on for a few more months to see if it helps then.
Birth Control	Manning60H, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	9/6/2012 7:41:57 PM	I was on Lutera for 5 years. Absolutely loved it. I never had any negative side effects (no weight gain, mood swings, baby-free, etc.) I have recently been under a lot of stress and developed some mild to moderate acne. Of course, I wanted that to go away so when my annual gyno appt. came up I asked about different birth controls that would help with acne. My gyno suggested Ortho Tri-Cyclen (I got the generic form called Trinessa). This is my first and last month on this pill. I cannot deal with the negative side effects. I was sick to my stomach the first week. I've also had terrible mood swings the entire month (crying at the drop of a hat, freaking out over little things, depressed) and NO sex drive whatsoever, which is not like me. It's starting to put a strain on my relationship so I called my doctor and switched back to my Lutera. I'm sure my acne will clear up on its own since it's due to stress. To me the side effects aren't worth it. I've talked to three different women that had similar experiences on Ortho Tri-Cyclen and now I'm reading a lot of reviews of the drug that say the same things.
Acne	CashierGirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/3/2012 7:41:53 PM	Ive been taking this drug since 2008, its been very good. No issues :) Only thing that is a down fall is its $79 for me... :(( Periods are short, acne is low. 
Birth Control	rouge17, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/25/2012 10:41:37 PM	I have been on ortho tri-cyclen for about 5 years. Never really had any major side effects. The one I didn't like was the weight gain. Nothing I did took it off. I recently changed doctors and even though I have never have a problem with ortho she said she has never been a fan of the tri-phasic pills so she has switched me over to junel fe 1/30... hopefully it works out just as well as ortho did! IF not i will definitely request to switch back! Wish me luck! One thing I would like women reading these reviews to remember is everyone's body is different which means everyone is going to react differently to different pills. There's always risk involved with birth control. If you are using this to decide what pill is best for you, don't freak out about negative reviews.. your body will review it for you. If one doesn't make you happy, talk to your doctor. Thats what they are for.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	6/19/2012 4:19:55 PM	I've been on this pill for a long time now, and I am so relieved to read these comments; I'm not alone. The week before my period is intense; I cry constantly, I become distant, a shut-in, extremely depressed. That is not my personality...my boyfriend can always tell when it's the week before my period. I'm definately talking to my doctor to switch. 
Birth Control	1990, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/18/2012 12:55:33 PM	This was the very first oral form of birth control I've ever taken. I had been on it for over two years and the first year and a half I experienced no negative side effects other than mild weight gain, 5 pounds. Then the remaining six months I noticed a change in my attitude. All of the sudden I'm beyond sensitive, I cry at commericals that aren't even sad. I find myself on the cycle of pills the week before I start my period to be at an all time low. I get depressed and violent. I find any excuse to fight with anyone unfortunate enough to be in my company. EVERYTHING hurts my feelings. I'm typically I very passive person with a very outgoing attitude and all of the sudden I  become Mr Hyde and lose control of myself. Take with caution.

These pills have been very effective in preventing pregnancy for me. I have gone off the pill a couple of times and have noticed the difference in my body good and bad.The pros while taking it for me have been: Not getting pregnant and having fuller breasts.The cons: I get moody easily, angry easily, it lowers my sex drive, and I'm more emotional.I have come to realize that it is time for me to switch to a non-hormonal pill because ortho tri-cyclen is just not working out anymore and not worth it with all the bad side effects.

I am fifteen year old and I have been taking the pill for about a month now. The day I began taking it, I had problem leeping. I began my period the next week and have been on it for three week now. I have about fainted from how much ive bled. I havent been able to get rid of my weight, the pill had me at a locked in weight. I hae tried droppig the weight but I couldn't. The cramp were killing me and mood hit rock bottom. DO NOT TAKE THE PILL!!
Birth Control	chrys, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	5/26/2012 7:35:44 PM	Took this pill for 2 yrs and it worked wonderfully until the beginning of the second year. I started developing symptoms of depression which I thought were just winter blues. I then started to become severely depressed and sought therapy. After a couple sessions my therapist recommended me discussing changing my pill with my GYN. Almost immediately after the switch (about 3 days) I noticed I was back to being &quot;me&quot;. This pill was fantastic for the first 1 1/2yrs and the only side effects I had were bigger breasts( a pro as far as I am concerned). However when the depression happened I didn't even think to attribute it to my pill. I was having suicidal thoughts and became shut off to everyone. I almost started taking anti depressants when I decided to try switching my BC first. I am now on a monophasic pill (only into the 3rd month) and so far so goo. 
Acne	Jen, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	5/26/2012 1:58:45 PM	I went on Ortho Tri-cyclen in the hopes that it would treat my moderate acne but after my 3rd pack, it has done little if nothing to clear up my skin. I might just need to be patient and give the drug more time to decrease my body's androgens, but I'm going to switch to a different BC because of the severity of my symptoms. The first month and a half was fine for me but after that I started noticing that I was becoming more and more socially anxious and depressed. I feel &quot;out of it&quot; most of the time now and last week I was crying for no reason. I do have a predisposition to depression but I was shocked at how much this pill has negatively affected my mood. Pros: weight gain (I am very thin and have always tried to gain weight), larger breasts &amp; no babiesCons: feeling zombiefied, anxious, weepy and overall depressed mood, feeling fatigued, and occasionally feeling nauseous

Birth Control	ash00, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	5/18/2012 4:03:04 AM	I've been taking this birth control for 2 months. It has done the job of not getting me pregnant, but the side effects aren't worth it. Since I started taking the birth control I started getting more headaches, had upset stomach a lot, always feel bloated, depressed, and very moody. 
Painful Periods	HealthSavvy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/15/2012 12:06:53 PM	When I was 19 I started this drug for birth control. I did not know at the time it would be a miracle pill for my extreme painful periods, which is the reason I take it now. I have always taken the brand name with the exception of trying generic as a trial, TriSprintec. I started to develop melasma on my perfect skin. I know only the compound ingredients are different. I do not know if the generic was to blame or moving to an area where the sun is stronger. Perhaps the sun rays caused increased sensitivity. I went back to brand name. For me this drug has been wonderful and the doctor said if it works well stay with it. If anyone else has had a similar experience with trying generic, please share.
Birth Control	bc, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	5/14/2012 8:00:03 PM	When I first started this medication I had horrible headaches and very heavy periods.  My doctor said to take two alieve everyday to get rid of the headaches.  This did work, but then I started having terrible stomach pains and didn't want to eat.  I called the doctor again and she said to give it a month before I decide to switch to a different pill.  It's been one week and I feel sick all the time.  I still take the pill and now I'm beginning to feel very depressed and I'm not on my period.  I'm calling the doctor again tomorrow to see if she'll switch me to a low hormone pill.  This just isn't the right medication for me, esspecially with the side effects I've experienced just within the first week.  I understand it takes your body time to adjust-- but having headaches, not eating, and feeling depressed is just too overwhelming for me.  
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	5/9/2012 1:16:40 PM	I began using this drug when i was 14 years old. I was having very long and strong/heavy and EXTREMLY painful period cycles. I was only on it for 2 years but I believe the damage was already done. Now I'm 25 I am divorced with no kids (due to the endometriosis) and my pain is worse EVERY NEW PERIOD! Some one needs to compensate US WOMEN for this! 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	4/26/2012 12:37:02 AM	Do not take this drug! I only took it for two days and began to experience a variety of extreme side effects. Including: insomnia, severe depression, anxiety, abdominal pain, irritability,and nausea.There are other hormonal birth control pills that are just as effective with out the horrible side effects!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	3/2/2012 11:16:33 PM	I seemed fine at first but after about 6-7 months of taking trinessa, I developed horrible side effects. I would have hot flashes, painful cysts under arms near breast, unwanted hair, mood swings, headaches, nausea, etc. I've never had this type of problem with any of birth control. It did seem to clear up my face, but def not worth it with the horrible symptoms I had because of it. I start a new pill Monday and am hoping this clears all my symptoms up. I'm posting this to maybe help someone who has had similar side effects. This pill might work for a lot of people but def not for me...and it took me a long time to figure out what was wrong with me!(Now off to stand outside in the cold because Im having another hotflash!)

Then about 6 months into taking this pill I started having 2 week long, heavy bleeding periods with such intense cramps. Also, I am a very reasonable and logical person and since taking this pill my emotions have been all kinds of messed up. If you like feeling paranoid and crazy, this is the drug for you.

It took care of my long/heavy periods and my acne disappeared while I was on this pill. The weight gain occured suddenly and I've gained approx. 30 pounds. This pill has also made my blood  pressure very high. 
Birth Control	Icare, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	35-44	11/28/2011 11:58:06 PM	I was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen for over 10 years.  It was great until I hit 35.  When I was younger, it did exactly what it should: prevented contraception, kept my skin clear :), and did not affect my sex drive.  At 35, I assume that my body changed and this drug affected me HORRIBLY.  The minor effect was high blood pressure, which was strange, since I'm very athletic and careful about what I eat.  The worst symptom was depression - SEVERE depression - suicidal depression.  It took months to figure it out, and when I started testing:  I could literally feel my mood sink 15 minutes after taking the pill.  I would not write this drug off, since it worked so reliably for years.  Just be aware and share the information that the side effects can be SERIOUS to some people.

It helped with my skin, too, and no weight gain. However, I had almost no sex drive and developed inflammation (caused by the medication-everything else has been ruled out) &quot;down there&quot; so horrible that it was impossible to have sex. I'm stopping immediately and praying it goes away. I'm very disappointed.

Birth Control	Nikki1978, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/9/2011 2:58:03 PM	I have been on this for a very long time. I have tried some generic forms and seemed to be on very long periods when I switched. I just continue on the name brand. Its great for acne and birthcontrol in general. I did try two other kinds of pills where you arent supposed to get your period..UH NO THANKS! Those made me crazy and depressed big time. Give this one a chance for a few months. its the best in my opinion, I just wish insurance would cover it more.

I actually lost weight when I went on it (about 30lbs over 6 months) but I unfortunately got super super irritable. It just kept getting worse, and worse and worse. I developed anxiety and depression, and went through a bit of a personal identity crisis. There was something wrong with me, and I hadn't even considered the pill as being the cause, which thus left me questioning myself a tonne. Why couldn't I figure out what was causing my feelings? Finally, when talking to a friend about my feelings, she said, maybe it's the birth control? Sure enough, after about a month of being off of it, I was 100% back to my normal self. Unfortunately, my normal self also meant re-gaining about half the weight I lost when I went on it. Would never take it again, it messed with me mentally wayyy too much.

I purchased it from planned parenthood, they were constanly rude and unfriendly when I went in so I decided to go through my insurance. My insurance didn't pay much for Ortho-Tri so I was left paying $72. I decided I'd switch to the generic Tri-Sprintec which made me so sick and moody. After 2 months I switched back to my beloved Ortho-Try-Cyclen. I've decided to try for less periods so I'm starting Ortho-Cyclen. It's made by the same manufaturer and has the same blue pills I was taking in Ortho-Try. So far so good.

I have night sweats at night too, and just don't seem interested in sex too much.  I started bleeding the day I started and have not stoppped yet. Although it is a light period, I am not liking it at all. My Dr. told me to wait 3 months to let the pill get in my system. But I just wonder if it would be better for my hubby to get fixed and I can stop taking these and go back to normal.....

I also have been extremely emotional. Im not sure if its birth control in general or just this pill. I did not especially enjoy being on it. Although I did have short light periods with little or no cramping. And it has been effective in preventing pregnancy and acne.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	8/15/2010 5:15:53 AM	I have been on birthcontrol for 4 years. Last year I had been on the generic version of this drug which worked perfectly good. However the periods were not light at all. I have just recently switched to the name brand because of my insurance.I use to have bad acne but since ive been on this pill it has helped drasticly. However my face broke out pretty bad within the first 2 weeks of use,  i recall the same results when I first started th generic brand. The acne eventually clears up and stays that way. I have always had my period on same day, every sunday, every 28 days. Its amazing. However with the start of the name brand I have noticed intense mood swings and the pill case is unattractive and very odd.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	ThisPillSucks, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	8/11/2010 12:20:07 PM	I had been on various birth control pills for about 9 years before I became pregnant while using Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo (and with perfect use, too). I stopped taking the pill for a year, but I have suffered from ovarian cysts in the past and a particularly large and painful cyst that burst led my gyno to prescribe the pill once again. Ortho Tri Cyclen was my gyno's recommendation since, other than becoming pregnant, I was very happy wih OTC Lo in terms of side effects. However, OTC does not seem to be a good pill choice, after all. While waiting to start OTC, the first day of my period happened to be a Sunday, so I started my first pack on that day. Not only did it make my period heavier and last longer, I had breakthrough bleeding once I began the third week of active pills. In a few more days I begin the week of inactive/&quot;reminder&quot; pills, which means I will start my period. 3 weeks of bleeding in one month?! No, thank you! Furthermore, this pill makes me crave carbohydrates like no other pill I have ever taken. It's ridiculous. I was expecting this to some degree, but I wasn't prepared for such an abrupt and noticeable change in appetite. I have not gained weight because I have consciously altered my diet and increased my physical activity, but who wants to crave sweets all the time?! Not me. I will switch to a new pill ASAP, or, better yet, not take any hormonal birth control at all. These side effects interfere with my life much more than ovarian cysts!

I am going to have to change, my breasts have been tender for the the full 4 months, very irratable, depressed, low self esteem, moody, crabby, etc.  I have gained 10 lbs, makes me hungry all the time.  The only benefit is the birth control and lighter periods.  I am going to have to switch to something as this is making me a completly differnt person.  I wish it could have worked for me as it has for so many others.  :(

Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	1/21/2010 4:59:23 AM	I've been on this pill now for about 2 1/2 years. I decided to take a small break from the pill because I have been getting menstrual cramps agian while taking it. Which is the sole purpose I went on the pill 2 1/2 years ago. I'm planning on going back on the pill soon, but am thinking maybe I should switch the pill to something different to see if my cramps will lesson again. After doing a little bit of research on this website I learned that a pill with levonogestrel and less estrogen are more safer to use (side effect wise) so I might switch to a pill that follows those guidlines. To see what that will do... Overall though this was a great pill-it helped me a lot with my cramps but lately they have been coming back so I think it's time to switch it up.

My periods are light, my skin has cleared up, and I don't have any pms or mood swings. I think it works great.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	10/27/2009 11:08:23 PM	In 2000 in my early 30s, I was switching from Depo Provera to Ortho Tricyclen under the care of a very experienced ob/gyn team after having my two children when I was stricken with DVT that I shouldn't have survived except for the care of my internist and a vascular surgeon who simply would not give up on me despite all the initial bad decisions of the emergency care team. On the Depo, I had weight gain and was having to drive monthly to another town to have my heart checked as a recommended precaution while on the Depo, though I had no prior history. All users of either of these meds should proceed with extreme caution. I belive the medical field needs to begin more rigorous routine testing for blood clotting factors in BC takers. That incident created lots of long term complications, a lifetime on blood thinners, and I was no longer able to have children in the prime of my life. I had always hoped for one, maybe two more.

I have short, light periods, no acne, no cramps, minimal PMS.  I have a five year old son, when I decided I wanted to concieve I simply stopped taking my pills and within 6 months I became pregnant and had a perfectly to the book pregnancy.  After giving birth and breast-feeding for a year, I went right back on my pill.  I love this product, I trust it, and I will never switch or use generics!

But then out of the blue i began to have the worst stomach pain ever. My appetite was gone.Everytime i would eat i would vomit.So im not saying it's a bad birth control but just really watch out for it because the side effect will creep on you.

I just switched to this one from Depo-Provera. I do however have some concerns. My period returned and is lighter which is awesome. I haven't gained anything like the 40 pounds I gained from Depo. However I am 21 years old and I have had the most severe pain in my abdomin for about three weeks now. I am not sure what it is and I cannot afford a doctor as I am currently unemployed. I also for the first time in ten years got a nose bleed tonight by bumping my nose lightly which may or may not be due to the pill. Please someone help me. I am not sure what to do about the abdominal pain (not due to menstral cramps). My email address is aapger1988@hotmail.com. Please email me if you have had the same problems. I would appreciate some feedback. Thank you so much!

Birth Control	frag, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/14/2009 10:40:30 AM	I have taken this pill for about 8 years. No problems until this last year...weight gain (prob my fault though?), major bleeding between periods, clotting, mood swings, and the return of acne. I do have a thyroid condition, so not sure if that may have contributed to anything. Also had a child 3 years ago (by choice), so changes occur in the body from that. I had no problems for many years, but now I have to switch to mircette to try to correct all those side effects, but overall was very satisfied.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/10/2009 9:53:34 PM	Have used this medication for 8+ years.  Never experienced any negative side effects or probelms.  Shorter, predictable periods, clear skin, zero weight gain.  I only take the brand name, as I don't trust generics, and have always taken this right before bedtime (when I first started on OC, advice I was given was to take at bedtime would help you avoid experiencing any unpleasant nausea symptoms)
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	4	5	Female	13-18	3/17/2009 10:43:58 AM	I love it so far and it's my 2 day of using it!I feel like it puts my mind at ease, periods can be regular possibly i have to wait for another month lol but I think anyone should give it a try but maintain their own personality and understand it is a pill that u take everyday but it is not going to control mood swing if u already are moody which a lot women get just like any ordinary person and u can choose to eat more or less it is your choice and has nothing to do with a pill.Thanks and Good luck to anyone willing to give it a try!

My mood swings have lessened, and I am very regular. I barely ever cramp now, and when I do, it isn't painful enough to take medication. 
Birth Control		5	4	1			3/4/2009 1:52:36 PM	I was on the generic version of Ortho for a while.  I was getting two periods a month on that pill so my doctor switched me to the regular version.  I have had the WORST mood swings ever and I don't know how my fiance has put up with me.  I just called to get changed back to the generic.

Absence of Menstrual Periods	RachelS, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	2/3/2009 12:41:18 AM	I began taking this because I had not had a period in 6 months.  Within a few days of starting the pill, I became so depressed I couldn't function.  It was horrible.  After two weeks of hell, I switched to Yaz, and got my period.  It was absolute torture being on this pill.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	1/26/2009 12:33:38 AM	I'm nauseous all the time. I've been on it for about three weeks, and as soon as I take it, I start to feel sick. I'm probably going to switch when this week is done

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/21/2009 8:40:07 PM	I am on the generic version of Ortho-Tricyclen and I have had no major problems. The very first month I was on it I was hungry all the time-- it felt like the week before my period the whole month. After that, I have had no problems. The only time I have ever had any breakthrough bleeding or mood swings was when I skipped the in-active pills to skip my period that month. I had breakthrough bleeding and my hormones were all over the place so I am never doing that again. Other than that, it has been great.

I am right on track with my periods, I know when I am going to be on it, it always lasts for exactly 5 days, and I only cramp a little about a week before my period. The only thing I have a problem with is taking it at the same time everyday. I got a pill box to help with the doses and it seemed to help a little. I thought that I might try just getting one of the IUD's, but when I read about the hair loss associated with them, I realized that taking a pill everyday just isn't so bad..lol.

Major PLUS, sex drive is ridiculously high and my boyfriend complains! lol. Only time it is normal is when my cycle comes and even then it isn't completely suppressed.For the sake of staying additional kid free, thinking about the ring so i won't forget but then again i really don't know what that could do to my hormone fragile body! Wish me luck!
Birth Control	Unsatisfied Patient, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	13-18	12/20/2008 9:41:01 PM	It works well, but I had horrible side effects. I already suffer from depression, but my symptoms got much worse after a few weeks of being on the pill - which  sucks because I just started my first semester of college. I had pretty serious breakthrough bleeding for the first month or two, and my skin has started to break out- I haven't had acne in two or three years. I've also gained about 15 pounds that I cannot for the life of me seem to lose. I'm done with OTC. It definitely wasn't worth the side effects!
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	12/8/2008 2:37:40 PM	I switched from Depo back to the pill and was on this drug for 3 weeks.  With every week, my side effects got worse.  I suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, gained 15lbs, and had horrible cramping (the one thing I was trying to get rid of).  I ended up in the hospital because of the side effects.  I have never had depression or anxiety before in my life!  It went away when I got off the pill.  Four months later, I am still trying to loose the weight!And I work out every day and don't eat sweets!  I would not recommend it for the new user.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	19-24	11/26/2008 2:32:58 AM	Great for birth control. Make me very nauseous when I start a new pack. Hard to remember taking the same time everyday as well.

(It's cheaper..)  Anyways, been taking it for 10 days, and I'm on the 12th day of my very painful and depressing period.  We'll see if this helps.  I'm still HOPEFUL!

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	9/24/2008 9:52:50 AM	I have recently switched from YAZ to Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo and I love it! Before the YAZ I was on another low dose hormone birth control that I loved but I listened to the advice of my friends and switched to YAZ (BIG MISTAKE and all of my friends soon realized that YAZ was terrible). The YAZ made my face breakout terribly and I had the worst periods, major bleeding for at least 8 days and terrible cramps. Now that I am on ortho I can tell a HUGE difference already and it has been a little less than a month! I hope everything continues to go smoothly. So far so good!! 
Birth Control		5	5	4			8/6/2008 1:53:49 PM	It has been easy to use, my boobs have gotten bigger, my skin looks great, no spotting ever, no more cramps, and minor mood swings. The only bad part about it is that it increased my appetite and I have been gaining weight!
Birth Control	 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female		8/5/2008 1:52:06 PM	I was on ortho for 10 years.  I recently switched to a generic oc and it's been a huge improvement.  Ortho always worked but for years I thought I happened to be an irritable person.  Now I realize alot of that was due to the ortho as I am far less irritable now that I'm on a different brand of daily oc.  I suggest trying alternate brands if the oc you start on isn't working right for you.
Birth Control	25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1		25-34	7/12/2008 2:20:11 PM	I had been on ortho tri-cyclen lo for 4 years and was completely satisfied, but I started experiencing break through bleeding, an indication that it was no longer working  effectively. My doctor suggested switching to ortho tri-cyclen because it had a stronger hormone.  BIG MISTAKE, I'm normally a very calm, low key person, this medication turned me into an emotional wreck.  I'd never experienced PMS at all, but I started having severe mood swings and low self esteem, I found my self crying uncontrollably for no reason and flipping out over ridiculously minor things.  I stuck it out for three months before switching to lo-overal, hopefully that works out better.

I have lost my sex drive, and half the time I dont want to get out of bed because my stomache contianously hurts. I did not know it had so many side effects and i would prefer not to be on it whoever is looking to get on it check out you side effects first before you doctor tells you that the one for you, because I did listen to my doctor and now I am suffering.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	4/24/2008 12:44:12 PM	I have been on OTC for eight years now and it worked wonderfully up until about 1 year ago when I started noticing some hormonal changes.  It was effective, easy to use, and cleared my skin in the beginning.  However just recently I have noticed shortness of breath, dizziness, weight gain, numbness at times, visual floaters, and headaches from the withdrawal onto the sugar pills.  I feel tired &amp; bloated all the time.  I am considering a switch to ortho-lo or nothing at all.  These hormones are having negative effects on my body and I feel like I have been on this pill for just too long.

I have gained weight since switching to ortho-tricylcen and my periods have been horrible!  I have terrible headaches, cramps and extremely heavy periods now.  I forgot to take my pill one night and less than twelve hours later, I was having a full-blown period - not just a little spotting.  I gave it three months like the doctor told me to, but now I'm off to try something different.

I took OTC for about a year an just recently tried Generic for this cycle.  I have had horrible side effects from it.  I started biting my tounge in my sleep terribly and I feel a general malaise I have never felt before on any type of BControl.    I will not continue on the generic version of this medicine.  I will go back to OTC.  In general, I have experienced breast tenderness, increased sex drive, breast growth, mood changes, hair loss.....all in all, my Generic experience has not been good......!

The only thing I didn't like was remembering to take it at the same time each day.
