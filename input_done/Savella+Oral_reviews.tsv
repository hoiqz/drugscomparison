Start slow and do what the doctor says.  It does help the pain but after a while you add other pain meds.  I know I hurt really bad if I miss a day of taking it.  I can not function.

Prescribed for Fibromyalgia pain, but because of almost immediate excessive heart rate I was not on the medication long enough to determine if it would help my pain.

I had a HORRIBLE experience with that medication!! I had cr@zy dreams every single night, along w/a handful of other side effects. My current Dr changed me over to Savella over 2yrs ago-thank God! I have to say, I haven't had any major side effects w/this med.(Besides the $$ it's costing me that is). I'm suppose to take 100mg 3x's daily, but have never followed that order. Instead, I take 50mg 2x's daily, because if I take the whole 100mg, I will get veeerryy sleeeepy-I'm a mommy &amp; can't be getting sleepy during the day! I tried taking the 100mg 2x's daily once I got my system use to the dose, but didn't see much difference. Just in price and tiredness! I do get very hot very easily. But I've always tended to sweat easily...think this med adds to that. I have memory problems and difficulty thinking of particular words that I'm trying to use @ any given time. Aggrivating! When I first started the med, it took a good week or so to get going good. I felt all out of wack, and not myself. It's mood altering definately. So if the dose you are prescribed isn't working, don't give up so easily! It's DEFINATELY worth hanging around for. I stopped taking it for several weeks, and felt pretty bad instantly. Could tell such a difference in my total body pain and fatigue right off hand, and definately in my mental and mood states of mind. I'm just waiting for the generic version to come along now...  :-)

On the 25 mg. dose twice a day i slept well at night but noticed after only a few days treatment that I felt like I was in a stupor or trance that lasted two days. Doctor said I needed to stick with it but since being on it at 50 mgs. at night and 25 mgs. in the day I have had feelings of being hostile, angry, crying, aggressive sometimes all in one day.  I have had depression problems for years but never experienced anything like this.  Moods are disproportionate to situations I have been in and I am concerned because I don't know what will trigger these moods or how serious they will get.  I did mention this to the doctor but I don't think it is being taken seriously. I think I will wean myself off this drug, side effects are to much and not worth it in my case.  I can manage better in my life without this emotional roller coaster, feeling more depressed, my behavior isn't characteristic for me. I would say this drug needs to be looked at more closely regarding these type of side effects.

The manufacturers note weight loss as a possible side effect, but not in my case.  I have cut down to 1/2 pill daily and in 4 days have lost 6lbs.  I am urinating normally now, where as on savella I urinated only at night.  It did seem to help my pain, but it is summer and my symptoms are never as severe.  I am going to forgo this drug due to the risks of weight gain and high blood pressure.

After 10 days the severe pain in my testes was too much. Also inability to urinate, and feeling of urination after I left rest room. Cold chills and heavy heart beat. Found out several thousand people petitioned FDA to remove this drug..

The problem grew very slowly and my optometrist had told me I was developing a cataract in that eye, so I blamed the problem on the cataract.  By the nine-month point, when I started to get a little tired, I could not focus my right eye on the screen at all, although it was somewhat better when I was well-rested.  I went in to have my eyes tested. This was the beginning of three months of changes to my eyeglass prescription, which is extreme to start with (astigmatism).  They would make me new lenses, I wouldn't be able to see any better, so they'd test me again and my prescription had changed since the last time.  I finally figured out that it was just taking an extremely long time for my right eye to adapt to different near focal lengths.  They couldn't get a stable prescription because it depended on how many minutes I had been staring at eye-chart distance before they started.  I mentioned the fibromyalgia and the Savella, but the optometrist had no thoughts on the matter. He speculated that perhaps my problem could be ocular myasthenia gravis. Upon scouring the web to look for side effects of Savella, I noticed that &quot;loss of visual accommodation&quot; is a rare but statistically significant side effect. I cut my dose by half and my vision problems mostly resolved over the course of the next couple of weeks. It is still difficult to read labels in a grocery store though, for example, since my eyes do not adjust quickly enough for scanning at different distances.  Regrettably, I am now stuck with a pair of glasses that matched my last test while on the drug. I need to wait to replace them until I am eligible again for new glasses, given that the prescription ends up costing me about $600 each time.

A back injury in 1983 (27 years ago),has caused much suffering since. In 2000 L4 was fused, and since then I have had stenosis, bulging disc and DDD (degenerative disc disease). I was also diagnosed with OA(Osteoarthritis several years ago). After a complete hysterectomy when I was 33(1985)I have suffered with clinical depression trying several different drugs for the depression and pain over the years. I have been on Cymbalta for several years now. It was working fine for the depression. When I was determined last fall, 2011, that I have FM,I was placed on Lyrica along with continuing the Cymbalta because I was told by the dr., and I also read that it is also good for body pain and anxiety as well as depression. The Lyrica worked well for the FM, but when I noticed a sudden weightgain I wanted to discontinue the Lyrica because I didn't want the weight, plus, I didn't want any future medical problems from extra weight.  Boy, was THAT a big mistake.  I have felt like I am living 'hell on earth'. I have wanted to die,tired of the soreness/stif that has returned have been unable to function. With Lyrica, I had gotten back a quality of life that I had not had for a number of years. I have also been having some suicidal thoughts. I was taken off Cymbalta because it is in the same group as Savella so u can't take both, aso doctor is hoping the Savella would help the 'clinical depression' as well as the FM. I have another week to go before it will be a month. If the spikes of depression, crying, irritability does not subside I will drop Savella and go back on Cymbalta and Lyrica or something else for the FM. I experienced 5 days of queasiness when I started the pack beginning w/12.5mg. There has been some ligh dizziness, laziness, and just feeling unable to do or a desire to do...or even live. I don't know what the future holds for me, but I hope I can get some relief soon with Savella or by going on to something else.

However I could not tolerate it only because it raised my blood pressure and I already have hypertension. Even just a half tablet every other day helped the pain.  If you dont have BP issues I think it would be worth trying.  I wish I could take it. Im a nurse and it was the first thing that helped.

Day 3 of taking Savella I noticed a difference.  It was working.  Day 5 I was having a pain in my chest radiation to my left side.  Day 6 and I could not take the pain anymore that I went to the Emergeny Room.  They could'nt find anything wrong with me.  Day 7 I noticed blood in my stool with diarrhea.  It was getting worse.  Back to the ER.  They could not find anything wrong with me.  The ER Physician looked up the medication Savella and told me that with this medication there is a risk for bleeding.  I stoped taking Savella and I am feeling much better.

Other symptoms I have are constipation, blurry vision, brain fog, difficulty with my memory, neck pain, and headaches.  I am wondering if a study has been done on patients who have been on Savella for as long as I have?

I suffered for years with fibromyalgia and was just diagnosed then. At first, I had much success with the drug, and then the pain returned in February. After going through all of the medications I was taking and dismissing the ones that would be a cause, he finally narrowed it down to my zocor which I had been taken for years. I had told him a long time ago that zocor can cause muscle pain. Since I've stopped taking the zocor, I've been almost pain free. I have the energy to live. I had been on cymbalta for the last two years and the combination of cymbalta and savella seem to do the trick for me. However, it's one day at a time.

My doctor suggested Lyrica, but I was leary of weight gain, as my Fibromyalgia is worse with more weight on me. Savella was his next suggestion, but was cautioned on the side effects. I was quite willing to try it and I am soooo glad I did!!!! My pain is much less now. I can start my day practically pain free. My side effects were sweating and flushing, which subsided after a few weeks. Every now and again I get a little sick at my stomach, but I can handle this. Very greatful for this drug!!!! Very greatful for my doctor suggesting it. I really don't like the price of it, but I do have good insurance, thank goodness.

I take a number of medications, including gabapentin and Lyrica.  My neurologist was concerned that I am taking so many drugs--for various disorders, so he tried to take me off Savella.  The nerve pain got considerably worse when I was no longer taking the medication.  I contacted my physician and starting taking Savella again that day.  My arm pain isn't gone, but it's better and I'm able to function.

Keep in mind that it takes a while to work, as it did for me.  Some people may experience weird side effects.  For me it was breast milk, but that went away.  I would say after about a week and a half I started to feel better, I just didn't hurt as much anymore, and my migraines and headaches were less and less.  One thing I do worn is that it does raise your blood pressure.  I was only on 25 mg.  It was a god send.  The only qualm was that I had to get off it immediately because I had suicidal ideation. But about after a week I went on a smaller dose and it has been working ok.  I have not felt the effects of the 12.5mg.  I am quite sad that it made me feel this way.  This was a great drug, it helped me get off of all my opiate pain killers for a month and half!  I was so sad to restart them again.  I wish people with fibromyaglia would give Savella a chance.

Although it worked wonders for my pain, I began to get extremely irritable, easily agitated and very aggressive.  It also caused my blood pressure to shoot through the roof and made me sweat like a pig.  My doctor has weaned me off of it and the side effects have left. Next up, we're trying Lyrica and after the unsatisfactory experiences with Savella, I confess I'm very leary of taking the Lyrica.

It doesn't make me pain-free and/or clear-headed, but most days it does bring my symptoms down to a manageable level.  I discovered just how much it does for me when I ran out &amp; didn't have it for 4 days - my pain levels were UNREAL.  Once I got my prescription filled, I sang the &quot;Hallelujah Chorus&quot; for a week!  I know some folks can't tolerate this medication, but I don't think I could tolerate life without it.NOTE: One undesirable side effect that I have noticed is that Savella seems to deplete my potassium.  After talking with my doc, I started taking 2-3 potassium tablets per day... Problem solved!

Please remember that it will not work the same for everyone. I am frustrated when I read some reviews saying how bad the drug is or &quot;take it off the market.&quot; Savella has been a life saver for me. I could hardly get out of bed each day because of the fibromyalgia pain before I started taking this medication. I had tried Lyrica, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and a couple others of which I forget their name...I couldn't tolerate those other medications and they were much less effective if at all on the fibro pain, insomnia, brain fog, etc. I understand if Savella has not worked for you or made you feel rotten but please don't forget there are other people out there who wouldn't know what to do without it. And if your just starting out and your having a little trouble adjusting, try to stick it out unless you just can't do it. You may find out like I did that it is the best thing out there for you.

I have suffered from these and getting worse for over 25 years. I have had full evaluations and tried almost all medications recommended.Savella improved my symptoms about 40 % which was great, except I had severe side effects, most serious arrythmia and increased Blod pressure. I decreased the doses and the relief went way. My doctor wanted me to try to increase it again, but to follow up with my cardiologist. I have CAD and bradycardia. My cardiologist ordered a 24 hr monitor and brushed it off as one more medication that aggravated my cardiac symptoms. Before I could get the monitor I ended up in ER and 6 days on anticoagulants, a cardiac cath where I had a cloth( most likely due to the arrythmia caused by the Savella). I am tired of trying medications. Klonopin worked for the first decade or so. My PLM is so bad( an average of 36 times per hour ) that I live sleep deprived, tired, and my muscles and bones hurt from the kicks. Basically, I can not work, sit thru a movie or stand for long. I know the lack of sleep is affecting my memory and concentration, but I do not want another close call with a clot in my heart.  Please, do not live with bad side effects, RLS or PLM will not kill you. Many of these medications are dangerous, especially to people with other health issues .

The severe headaches, hot flashes, like a continuous blast furnace. I don't feel it was suicidal tendecies just still a feeling of redoing my life. Hasn't helped living with a depressed person for 40 years and always blaming you for everything. At this point, Dr. said don't take for 5 days and restart at 25mg to see if that is tolerable.

I begged my doc not to put me on this drug, then finally agreed to take it.  I did the sample titration package first, then went to just 50 mg per day for about 3 weeks.  Was prescribed by my doc for fibro and depression.  Starting becoming HOSTILE and more and more and more DEPRESSED and anxious.  Had 3 severe panic attacks.  Starting thinking about how I could kill myself.  The thoughts would pass but not for long.  I came home one afternoon after work, was angry with my husband about a home project he was working on, then rounded up enough drugs that I knew would work to kill me.  I swallowed them all, cool as a cucumber, wrote a quick note that I knew my husband wouldn't find right away and went to bed around 6:30 p.m.  I became aware of my surroundings nearly one week later after having been in ICU on a ventilator for 3 days and having no recollection of anything during my nearly one-week hospital stay.  I had reported the suicidal thoughts to some people but kept telling them I wouldn't act on them.  Well I was wrong about that.  I don't remember if it helped my fibro pain but I'd rather have pain then to do something so irrational.  SUICIDE ATTEMPT IS a side effect of this drug, especially if you have depression.  The drug was probably within 5 minutes of causing me to die.

None of which helped, but actually made me worse! Savella is the only medicine that I've noticed a benefit. I had 2 months of really bad nausea-all day long! Much better now, gotta have something in tummy b4 I take med., for me animal crackers help. Sweating is not as bad either. Heart rate is high though, in 110-120's so I need to talk to doc about that, hate feeling like I'm racing and not even moving. HUGE concern for me was fact that I couldn't take my migraine medicine (relplax)anymore. They don't mix...this leaves me suffering through the migraines! And a BIG benefit for me was that this is the only medicine that helped with my depression, and I've tried a bunch, all of which gave me thoughts of suicide. This is probably the biggest reason I still take the Savella! I agree with other posts that if you miss some dosages you quickly feel the pain of FM, so it must be working. Although I still hurt, no magic wand for me. No big difference on fatigue, sleep quality or fog. Like I said helped with my depression and with that heavy feeling lifted some, at least now I can try to move in a positive direction to feel better, really wanting to find strength to exercise and see where that takes me with pain and fatigue. Unfortunately, fibro is not my only concern. God Bless and I hope this helps...

In 2009, I went into a detox to get off the narcotics &amp; try Savella. I didn't think it was working well until I DIDN'T take it one day! The pain in my joints became fierce &amp; I was totally stiff. I'm on 200mg a day &amp; still have to use Hydrocodone for breakthru pain, but wouldn't give up the Savella for anything! It causes some mild nausea for a short time &amp; it makes me sweat differently. It took over a year to find a deoderant that made it possible to not pass out from my own smell! Otherwise, I don't see it causing me any problems. Certainly NOTHING compared to being on a grip of narcotics, that's for sure!

No one could touch me without pain and I hurt all the time. My primary doctor diagnosed me with bulging discs and osteoarthritis(degeneration of my lower spine)recently. He recommended I go to an orthopedic doctor for shots in my spine.  I opted instead to go to a rheumotologist to get the correct treatment rather than cortisone shots which I have read do not help after awhile. The rheumatologist told me that the fibro is what is causing the pain and not the bulging discs or the degeneration.  He recommended Savella due to the other medicines causing weight gain which I cannot handle due to losing weight slowly with a medical weight loss program. While taking the starter pack so far, the best I felt was on the two 25 mg tablets a day rather than the 50 mg two times a day.  Once on the two 50mg tabs, my heart started racing and pain seemed to come back while I have felt more nauseous.  The slight nauseousness is not a bad thing for me as it has killed my appetite a bit so I'm sticking to my weight loss plan better.  While on the 25mg part of the pack, I felt fatigue but felt less pain so I'm waiting and seeing what is going to happen. I now have severe pain in the neck and lower back stiffness/pain but have had trouble with them both for a long time. I am feeling better while sitting because before, I could not sit on a chair for hardly any length of time without pain in my tailbone.  That pain has diminished greatly. I'm going to try going to a massage therapist for my neck and back I am also using moist and dry heating pads.  The moist heat really helps the most right now.

I have depression &amp; anxiety and have been on Zoloft and Wellbutrin for years. My doctor made a HUGE mistake, he took me off the Wellbutrin cold turkey and cut back my dose of Zoloft from 200mg to 100mg and then I was to stop taking it. Four days later, I was suicidal, confussed and felt like I was in thick fog. Was going to be admitted to hospital, but I had a melt down because of that. I know a lot of you know what I was experiencing and it's a horrible, lost and uncontrolled feeling. I don't feel like the Savella is helping my Fibromyalgia. But, I have been put back on the Wellbutrin and hope that once everything has been regulated I will have some pain relief.

Joint Disease (D.J.D.)&amp; herniated discs &amp; vertebraes in neck &amp; back~~chronic pain issues. I was first given Cymbalta, but couldn't take that due to the side effects &amp; it wasn't helping. The Dr. switched me to Savella. I've been through the started pack &amp; am now taking 100 mg. a day (50 2 x's day). I haven't noticed a difference. I'm still in constant pain all over &amp; still have some of the side effects. I'm beginning to think doctors think Fibro, CFS, etc is all in your head since they are quick to prescribe anti depressants. I have been taking pain meds, muscle relaxants &amp; pain patches. These worked so much better for me, but in a lot of states doctors do NOT want to prescribe meds that help and are for pain. I'm also worried about long term effects of fairly new drug, as well as , the cost since there isn't a generic yet.  More awareness, research, education is needed on Fibro, Lupus, CFS &amp; other Neuro Immune Endocrine Disorders~~as these ARE NOT in our head. We have a neurological illness. If this is working for those of you have said you got relief in 2 wks, that's great, but it is NOT working for me.

I have had fibromyalgia for years and had gotten to where I couldn't function through the week or the day on some days. Savella has made a tremendous difference in my life at this point.  I now have an increase in bp and heart rate that we are monitoring to see if it is due to the med or what...I hope I don't have to stop this med because it has made such a difference in my life.  The difference in body temp is a bother but I always was a little on the cold side anyway.  Overall, the benefit has been worth the side effects.  Good luck to those who try it and don't give up on it too soon.  Make soda crackers and ginger ale your friend for a while and see if you can get through the nauseousness.  It does go away.

I am in my second week on the 2 week titration pack and feel so much better already. As for the side affects I was worried about nausea but I've only experinced it one day and that was the day I went from 25mg to 50mg that morning.  I actually had dry heaves but it went away.  I do have terrible hot flashes and some sweating but it does go away as quick as it came.  I was just told by my Doctor that I have fibromyalgia.  I've been living with this pain for over a year and just thought it was because I was getting old...43yrs old. Do not hesistate to try Savella it is worth a try. Thank Savella for giving my life back!!!

Tried to get up to the regular dose of 100 mg/day, but due to severe side effects (headache, nausea, general overall sick feeling) I was only able to stay at 12.5 mg/day for several months. Was ready to throw in the towel within the first week, but then I noticed more energy/less pain. I have had leg, hip, knee, back, neck and shoulder pain for years, and this was the first time I was pain free from the waist down! I do have the hot flashes and sweats, rapid heart beat, nausea and occassional headache and sick feeling within hour of taking Savella, as well as right hip pain in a.m., but for the most part this drug allows me to live a normal life. I dont wake up feeling like I have been hit by a truck anymore. In Sept, 2011 I increased to 25 mg/day, but side effects returned - but tolerable. I am hoping that the side effects will lessen in a week or two. I increased dosage since I still have neck, arm/shoulder pain, which I am hoping Savella can take care of, since from the waist down I feel pretty good. My brain fog has also been better, but not totally gone. My migranes have also lessened. I still require medication for sleep, since Savella does keep me up at night if I dont take it early enough in the day.  I believe that for most people, increasing the dosage quickly (like in the starter pack) is just too much too soon.  Try the low dose for at least 2 weeks to a month-maybe longer, before increasing if you are having side effects, that definetly helped me, or I would have given up on it.I am glad that I did not, since I feel better than I have in years. It may not take all symptoms away, but at least I am able to walk without pain most of the time.  I also have Lupus, so I have to take that into consideration. My only concern is how new this drug is, and that we may not have all the info necessary to see the long term side effects down the road and the price

I have taken it as directed, working up to 75mg twice daily, until I started having nothing but blood in my urine. I backed off back down to 25mg once a day while trying to contact my Doctor, which has been very hard to do. I know this is not a UTI because I know what that feels like and this it totally different. I have since made an appointment to see another Doctor and get off this medication before perament damage is done.

After Lyrica provided little relief, my PCP started me on Savella; within days of starting it, I could tell a major difference! That was underscored recently when I ran out of Savella for 4 days - by the 2nd day, I realized how much of a God-send Savella is!  It doesn't completely stop the pain, but it definitely makes it manageable for me.

I had horrible nausea and battled it for 5 months although I was only on Savella for 3 weeks. I couldn't get off of Savella fast enough. I call it the pill from HELL!!! I found the side effects to be totally debilitating. After weaning off the drug I still had nausea and continued to lose weight. I eventually ended up having gallblader surgery last week. So far the nausea has subsided. After I had my experince with Savella I read the side efects.....the very first one is NAUSEA!!!! What a surprise!!!

After Lyrica failed to do me any good, my doctor prescribed Savella.  He told me it could be a couple of weeks before I started getting any relief: imagine my surprise when I started feeling better within days!  It doesn't completely take care of all of the symptoms, but the &quot;fibro fog&quot; was improved a LOT and the pain diminished by at least 75%. Due to a pharmacy snafu, I have not had any Savella in 4 says &amp; I can tell the difference... it's a huge, excruciating difference! I'm looking forward to being able to get my refill tomorrow!

Needed to pair it with a medication to reduce heart rate but greatly decreased fibro-fog. Hang in there if you are just starting - it's so worth it to be able to function so many more days.

My doctor recommended Savella and I figured why not try it. The pain has definitely gotten easier to deal with however, the side effects is like trading one for the other. I get extremely nauseous to the point where I will start to throw up. I also experience a fast heart beat and hot flashes. Right now I'm still on a low dosage of 50MG and it does give me more energy but I seem to crash pretty hard early in the night getting extremely tired yet its still hard to sleep. I am hoping these side effects will lighten up over time. I would say try it if you are having a hard time finding the energy to do anything. I started going on daily walks and stretching all throughout the day which seems to be helping a lot. This medication will not solve all your problems but it will help you get your life back and start living healthier.

I have a cervical fusion from C4 to C7 and it is constantly in pain. I am on 75mcg/hr fentanyl patch for this pain. I have a bulging disc at L4 in lumbar spine that is very painful and prevents me from walking very far. Since I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia a number of years ago it has progressively worsened over time. In the beginning 150 mg Lyrica twice a day helped but in recent months it did nothing as my entire body was in severe pain to the point I was spending over 20 hours a day in bed miserable with pain. Was prescribed Savella on 1 august 2011 was given the titration package. After only 4 days at of taking 50mg am &amp; 50mg pm I have say 65% to 75% of my fibromyalgia pain is gone. So far so good. No side affects yet. Keeping my fingers crossed too. I am sleeping better and now awake feeling rested whereas before Savella I might sleep 6 hours but when I awakened it felt like I had not slept at all. I am hoping the improvement continues as I am starting to feel human again after feeling like a miserable useless lump of pain for so long. I never gave up but I can understand how some do. Savella is working wonderfully for me so far and I wish I could have been on it so many years ago. I realize it is still quite early in my reviewing this drug but if there are any changes I do promise to update with more reviews as needed

I had to stop after taking it for 18 months because of severe sweating. The sweating stopped in a few days after I stopped taking it.  The pains returned very mildly.  When it rains it hurts the most.  All in all, my life improved from the severe sweating when I stopped the meds.  It worked to stop the pain but I gained 10 pounds and my skin developed tiny bumps that are taking months to go away.  It works but has side effects that disrupted my daily life and made it miserable from sweating.

The hot flashes I still have but the muscle pain is sooo much better and I am doning things I had not done it years. I was diagnosed with both chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia both and have undergone 4 spine surgeries. I have been able to lower my pain medicine by 30 ./.

I don't know but why can't they make a drug without so many bad side effects?

Taking savella for two years but does have side effects. Hotflashes and vomiting with physical exertion. I am going to try adjusting dosage and times taking it to see if that helps. Good luck fellow fibros.

I decided not to follow the mfg dosing directions as I know my body and started with 12.5mg a day for two weeks and then added 12.5 every two weeks until I got to 100 mg a day. It took me several months to get there. I know if had started with 50mg a day like some people have I would have ran screaming too from it. My biggest complaint about this drug is the hot flash/sweats. I think it helped relief the nerve pain but I still have pain in my muscles that I take other medication for and of course exercise and watch my diet. If you sensitive to medication better to start with a lesser dose and work your way up like I did and you might just find that this is a good drug for you. I took Cymbalta for 18 months before this and just didn't get the relief I needed. So as I was lowering my dosage of Cymbalta I was increasing my dose of Savella. It was a 4 month transition from one drug to the other. It wasn't horrible but there was a couple of days I did feel a little odd but doing it 12.5 mg at a time made it more tolerable. If I had listened to my doctor and just went from Cymbalta to Savella without tritating down on one and up on the other I would have been at the hosptial. No drug works in a day and if you are sensitive to meds and if it is a drug you can split with a pill splitter like this one then do so and take it slowly to increase to the full dose.

I just had my dose raised to 150mg and I am hoping to see more improvement .

Today was day number 6 and I won't take anymore.  The trade off is not worth it.  Horrible hot flushes (worse than menopause), dull headache, slight nausea, feeling off balance, overall spaciness (simply put:  being &quot;out there&quot;), feeling disconnected; gained 2 pounds already.  Not worth it to me.  I will figure something else out but this isn't gonna be it.A real shame though because I got pain relief and sleep for the first time in months.

However I was in extreme pain every single day and decided to try it.  My doctor gave me the trial pack and I started out on the 12.5 mg and I am now on the 50mg. two times a day.  The very lst day after starting the night before I feel great!  Most of my stiffness, and pain has gone completely away.  My only issue is being &quot;HOT&quot; !  I looked up other comments and noticed being hot was a side effect.  I hope and pray it goes away as I continue the medication.  When I am hot or sweaty I feel like a french fry dripping in grease.  My pain is very extreme and I did not or am not able to do anything worthwhile.  Hopefully the sweats will decrease.  Not sure at this moment which is worse.  The pain???  or being sweaty all the time???  I am thinking I would rather sweat though than be in pain!  I have a spray bottle of water in the fridge and spray myself with cold misty water often.  It feels refreshing and I stay cool after that for a couple of hours.  However, I just started this medicine 10 days ago and we are having a heat wave here in Florida.  No other side effects noticed and I am pretty sure I feel so much better all over!   Good Luck to everyone.

(Probably 4-5 months ago now.)  My main initial side effects were occasional headaches and feeling hot/sweating.  At the very beginning there was a little nausea but that passed pretty quickly. I work in a child care center and my main continuing side effect is the sweating/feeling hot. I move around a lot anyway but the heat is miserable. After 2 months or so at full dose I asked my doc if there was anything else I could switch to, but he said this is the best we have right now. I finally got tired of it and weaned myself off of it (slowly) but then realized just how much the medication had been helping me. The daily pain and stiffness returned and needless to say, I'm back on it. I do worry about what the medication might be doing to me long term though ... I tried to donate blood and my heart rate was too high. It needed to be under 100 to donate and it was 112. They took it 10 minutes later and it was up to 119. I thought it was probably the Savella, so I skipped it that night and figured I'd take it after my appointment the next morning. Went back and tried again and it was 104, then 10 minutes later 102. I've stayed off of it and will go back one more time to try to donate tomorrow, if not I'm giving up because the pain is returning and I need to get back on the Savella at least until I can see the pain specialist I'm being referred to. I guess it's a matter of if you can live with the side effects or not. I'd love to not feel like I'm burning up all the time but I sure don't like hurting so much and being so stiff. Good luck!!

Most other medications taken would bring the pain between the 5-7 area, which is not a very functional range. Thank You for Savella.

I would rather have the stigma associated with being a &quot;druggie&quot; because I need to take Percocet to get through the day.  I cannot fathom getting intermittent improvement with such serious side effects that no one seems to know whether or not will be lifelong, i.e. heart problems.  I don't want to suffer through the withdrawals of this nasty drug.  So far, extreme bloating from first week, weight gain, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, extreme agitation, benefit of leg relief however now have extreme tender points in upper body, pulling aches in arms worse, resting heart rate 100+, heart palpitations, cannot exercise without suffering the consequences, manufacturer has drug on backorder, not only is the drug not working - the company cannot even stock it - not to mention the price - Maybe this time the insurance companies are on to something.   At least Percocet and the generics cost me $10.00 and they help.  Good luck folks and be careful and forewarned.  This drug is perceived as safe but actually dangerous in my opinion.

I have taken 2 days and slept poorly- I can live with that, but felt so bad this am called in sick at 0400. I thought maybe I should stop, but after reading this site of well organized fast and easy to read reviews: http://www.askapatient.com/viewrating.asp?drug=22 256&amp;name=SAVELLA&amp;PerPage=80&amp;sort=sati sfaction&amp;order=0Everyone said to keep going!! The side effects are the worst the first week or so, and you need to give it 1-2 months to know for sure. Wow- I am really glad to hear the hot flashes, sweating, even nausea will decrease. Also, just felt awful this am, bit of a headache and don't know how to characterize yukky :)) But before you quit ,if you are just starting like me check out this site in addition to this one. Another site with many pages of reviews, slower to read like this site is:http://www.prescriptiondrug-info.com/Discuss /ANYONE-ELSE-TRYING-SAVELLA-FOR-FIBROMYALGIA-1954 24_s2.htmI will post an update of my results. I am just glad I decided to review nonscientific patient anecdotal comments, because nowhere in the prescribing literature did I see that side effect symptoms may be worse initially and taper off, just keep going unless life threatening! I really did not realize how debilitating the side effects are for many. the numbers show 35% have nausea 19% headache and other side effects are less. Maybe only those with side effects are posting, however many with side effects state they decrease with time and the beginning is the worse; they also report a great decrease in pain. My pain decreased tremendously on day 1, but mine varies a lot so I didn't know if this is the med or just me.Keep reading before you decide to quit!! :)

My Rhuematologist gave me Savella and told me to get to 50mg twice a day. The morning after the first night, I awoke with NO vision in my right eye. It was one of the scariest things ever. Thankfully, it did clear up in an hiour or so. The nausea was horrible. I am now up to 50mg a day, where I will stop and I still have the ugly nausea feeling if I don't eat soon enough. I was already on Nortyriptylene for Migraines which I had to stop. My headaches &amp; migraines are every day now. I saw my dr last week and she said for me to start the Nort. back up one every other night but NO more than that. I think the biggest side effect that is hampering my daily life is the lack of sleep. It has worsened a great deal. My old go-to remedies such as Tylenol PM or Excedrin PM are no longer of any assistance. My dr suggested to try Bendaryl before bed before she gives me a script for something stronger. As far as helping with pain, the med has helped most areas minus my right hip which seems worse these days.Good Luck to All!

I take 50 mg. @ night. my heart rate goes up to 125-135 beats a minute. And if i take the full dose it goes up to 165 beats a minute. I do not have any other side efects except this. That is why I take @ bedtime because I do not need to worry about getting out of breath. And I sleep much better with hardly any pain from my fibro. I take amitriptline &amp; clonazapam @ bedtime to. So I sleep like a baby. Ialso am on Wellbutine. I did just take codeine cough syrup for a bad cough. And I do not know if it mixed with my drugs but I had no pain most days. so that might be something Dr.'s might want to try. I take tramadol for breakthrough pain does not work as well.

Disorder characterized by Stiff, Tender &amp;amp; Painful Muscles	CSS in FL, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	45-54	5/18/2011 3:13:10 PM	Hello,I was given this medication for my undiagnosed, until now, CSS (Central Sensitivity Syndrome.)  My doctor said the aim of me taking Savella (SNRI) is to up the   norepinephrine levels in my brain.  Serotonin is not why I am taking it, but the SRI in Savella swapped nicely for the 10 mg prozac (SSRI) migraine prophylactic I discontinued.  I have been on Wellbutrin (SNDRI) 150 mg twice a day for many years.  The literature I read on CSS - of which fibromyalgia is one of a dozen+ manifestations (including chemical sensitivity!!!) clearly urges starting patients on the lowest  dose, then slowly titrate from there.  My doctor told me to take it (12.5 mg) only once a day for two to three weeks, then begin two dosages a day.  The last night of week two I could tell that I had not yet plateaued from the 12.5 mg I was already taking and needed to wait another week before going to 2 doses/day.  By morning, my cognitive function  frustrated me, so the heck with it.  I took a morning dose.  Well that lasted only a day!  It was too much to go from 12.5 mg to 25 mg in one jump.  (I hope some docs are reading my testimonial!)  I used my new pill cutter!  Now I am taking 6.25 mg AM &amp; 12.5 mg PM.  Why are patients receiving dosages far from the lowest as their starting point on this drug?  The literature with Savella clearly states slowly titrating the dosage.  Are these patient's doctors reading the Savella dosage instructions?If patients are starting this drug at 50 mg twice a day, as I have read of here, no wonder people are having such bad reactions.  Dosage wrong?My pain has decreased significantly and I have had no major side effects - though I can definitely tell when the drug kicks in.  I do have a wave of &quot;reorientation&quot; as my brain/body adjusts - but this passes and I may eat something if my stomach is empty. I have had 9 or 10 CSS conditions for 30+ years.  I may never exceed 25 mg a day. I am drug sensitive. Less is more for me which may work w/Savella.

I have noticed a significant decrease in my pain and my depression has eased off as well. There will always be people with really bad off the wall side effects as I have read from other reviewers... but that is because EVERYONE will react to the same drug in a different way, even if taking it for the same problem. Do not let people scare you away from this drug if your doctor thinks it will help you. Try it. If you have problems from it, stop taking it. I've been dealing with Fibro for years, and I've tried nearly everything. But I wasn't afraid to give this a try, and I'm glad I did.

I would wake up screaming from pain some nights and was never,(pain free). I also take tramadol, xanax, and mobic. but the Savella was like a miracle drug. I still have lots of fibro symptoms, but none of the debilitating pain I experienced for so long.

Seemed I'd been taking more and more to get the same results...no pain/stiffness.  The neuro put me on this and I'm only up to the .25 x2 daily and I've noticed the pain is gone and just a tad bit of the stiffness remains. No side effects so far. I have high hopes that this will help others too.

If you don't suffer any of the bad side effects this could be the perfect fibro drug, unfortunately I experienced pretty much every bad side effect possible.  The bad ended up outweighing the good.  I was on it for several months and instead of getting better the side effects got gradually worse.  Severe anxiety, depression, irritability, sweating, hot flashes, urinary problems, heart palpitations, occasionally rapid heartbeat, increased blood pressure.  I tried to out last the side effects but couldn't do it, I am taking myself off this drug and feel better already.  I'm in pain but don't feel insane.

When i started this drug i had terrible side effects, they subsided after 3 months. It has helped with the Fatigue and Fibro Fog. I still have sleep issues wake up every 2 hrs, and really not getting the rest i need. My Dr. increased my doasage to 20mg x2. I imediatly noticed an increase in agitation, i am having anger issues now too. I will be asking to get off of this drug at my next appointment due to the increased agititation.

I started taking savella several months ago with diet changes ( very little sugar and limited starch) and currently have almost no stiffness or pain. I can still have a painful day when very bad weather moves in, but those days are rare. I also have some side effects, but I will take them over the pain that kept me in bed for days at a time! I am taking way less than my Dr perc, (about half) but if less works, no need to take more.

I was ordering this drug from England when it was named Milnapricin.  I showed it to my dr., and he said it wd be safe.  Also used in France, China &amp; England.  My gosh I used it for 2 days &amp; I was pain free.  It was like a miracle.  It is now in the US.  I cannot understand why Canada is behind the times.  Why don't we have it here in Canada?  It works, as proven by the above countries.  My son forgot to reorder for me and it was on back order, when I started using it again after about 10 wks it failed me.  However, when Canada finally wakes up and it is available I will be using it again.

Then after that was mad at the world and hated everyone/body! 3rd mth I end up in emergency room because blood pressure spiked to 180/157 and continued to climb until the dr put a nitro patch on me...stayed in hospital 2 days and took every test in the book and they all came back normal...put me on blood pressure Rx(never had HP before) started weaning my own self off this potential lethal drug and feel much better.  If you are starting to take this med please watch for all the heart related symptoms and being so ill at yourself and the world(believe me, people will tell you)

Begun with a titrated increasing dose, I am now at the regular dose he wants me to take. Sound like a lot? Fibromyalgia itself is a lot. I feel better than I did with just the Cymbalta and Lamictal. The one thing I worry about with all the drugs is in the future, what will it be like? Alas, I am going to go ahead and live for today, since it makes me feel better.

Having significant sexual side effects, I asked my doctor about an alternative.  She gave me several sample packs of Savella.  I've now been taking it for 4 days and although my libido has improved, I think the side effects are more than I can handle.  It has caused extreme nasea and dissiness, hot flashes, sleeplessness and numbness on my skin surface.  I'm seriously considering discontinuing all meds and looking for a natural alternative.

The first 2 weeks taking this med I had the nausea side affect pretty mildly and was pain free.  It was like a miracle drug for Fibromyalgia pain.  The med leveled off in my system and I continued to take it.  After about 6 mos I started having severe IBS attacks which I blamed on the Fibromyalgia.  I went to an internist and many tests were performed over the next several months.  After 12-13 mos of taking Savella I went on medical leave and my PCP took me off all meds to see what was happening to my body since there was nothing physically wrong with my gastro system.  My BP was through the roof, I lost at least 3-5 lbs a week and couldn't leave my bathroom.  I went off the Savella and approximately 7 - 10 days later my body started to recover and the IBS had stopped.  My FM pain was through the roof and the migraines were terrible and my BP was dangerously high.  The Savella had ravaged my body far worse than the FM had ever affected it.  I was off work for 10 weeks and spent literally thousands of dollars in medical tests to see what was happening to my body with them all coming back in normal range.  My stomach lining was very irritated and I was on some hefty stomach and gastro meds to try to alleviate the symptoms.  Stopping the Savella was what worked to alleviate all of the issues.  I am now on 2 separate Blood pressure meds because of what the Savella did but I am off all gastro meds.  The risks and side affects far outweigh any type of benefit from the Savella.
Other	skyler, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	2/15/2011 6:58:24 PM	I wrote a review on this before but after reading more of other reviews I realized I had a few more side effects that I didn't realize could come from Savella.... the vision issue if I was stressed or extremely tired and weird dreams.  I do state, once again, this has been a miracle drug for me.  The brain fog is almost gone and my fatigue is so much better. I still have pain and am still taking tramadol but the Savella helps the tramadol work lots better and has helped me cut the dosage. I do wish the headaches would go away permanently but I'll take those over all the other symptoms Savella has helped.  I also haven't thought about taking my dosage 3 times a day instead of 25mg in the morning and 50mg at night.  I think that will help.

I have been on the max dose of Nuerontin and Lyrica, recently my Ins. refused my Lyrica and I was forced to try something new. Since I have been on Savella I have been dizzy, sleepless, bruised and have had a constant headache. Now I am vomiting, have the hives, and have had a decrease in sexual desire. I am not happy with how I feel while on this medication. I can not keep the medications I NEED to take down and have feelings of loss of self. I would not recommend this product to anyone. The side effects for me are just not worth it.

Other	Stacy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	2/3/2011 10:41:54 AM	I was recently diagnosed with fibro.  I have only been taking Savella for two weeks and havent had much releif yet but my Dr. told me it could take about a month to start releiving some pain.  I have noticed that I am always cold and have had headaches, nausia, and constapation but nothing I can't handle.  I will continue to take savella and hope for the best because i'm so tired of being in constant pain. I pray that this medication will releive my pain and constant fog.  I haven't had as many really bad days but not sure how well my medication is working yet.  To those of you who expect instant relief  some medications work wonders but you have to give them time..  Your system has to adjust.

When I first starting taking it it was like a miracle, really. I felt so much better. It took the edge off of my constant pain, and cleared my head, allowed me to function almost at my pre-fibro dianostic level. But, unfortunately, it started to cause horrible sweating, which became my breaking point. I would sweat all the time, no matter what, and it was uncomfortable and embarassing. I was so angry that side effect started because it had helped me so much! Also, I agree with a lot of the reviews that it made me hungry all the time too, whether the docs say that's a side effect or not. I gained a significant amount of weight, despite being more active. I would totally recommend trying this drug, and I hope you don't experience any of the negative side effects like I did. I would still be taking it if I hadn't experienced them!

This is my second day on the 50mg 2x a day.  I'm not sure what is going on.  I have been on paxil 30mg a day for a year.  Weended myself off per Dr. instructions.  I feel horrible!  I have the brain zaps like crazy!  I don't want to do anything.  I don't even feel like cleaning my house, taking a shower, or even being around anyone.  i used to be a very fun person, great personality, and want to do stuff all the time.  NOT NOW!  I'm also a clean-freak. NOT NOW!  I don't feel right at all.  Just wondersing how long this feeling lasts and if it ever goes away.  i have fibromyalgia and i think I felt better on Paxil.  i would pull muscles all the time and just wake up with pulled muscles, my Dr. would put me on vicoprofen (short-term) that is the only time I feel like the old me.  Why can't I just take my Paxil and vicoprofen?  I also take flexeril .5mg at night.  i have a tempurpedic mattress and I wake up feeling like I have slept on the cement floor.  My neck, back, shoulder,elbows, and hips hurt every morning.  That's why i started taking the flexeril @ night to help sleep and feel better in the morning.  Since I've been on Savella, my body and muscle aches are worst!  I just want me back and so does my family.  i look pale and sick.

It's helped with the some of the pain,  exhaustion and morning stiffness but the best part has been no brain fog.  Bad symptons:  Headaches, nausea (peppermint helps that), dry mouth and a metallic taste, BUT something that my doctor says is not a side effect is HUNGER. I'm hungry all the time and did gain about 10 lbs. I thought it was just me until I had a problem getting my prescription filled and didn't take it for about a week.  No hunger at all. I was just wondering if anyone else had this side effect?  I do experience chest pains some and palpitations but I've had that with the fibro so unsure if it's from savella.  I also can't take the recommended dosage.  I have to take 25mg in the morning and 50mg at night because of the headaches and nausea.

I had been taking lyrica and cymbalta but when the doctor increased lyrica, my legs swelled.  I slowly got off lyrica and cymbalta but my pain got worse and worse.  Last year I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia.  I began acyclovir.  Helped some but pain was still there.  Less than a week ago I went to an arthritis/autoimmune specialist.  He gave me Savella.  I took one pill and my pain started to diminish.  The following day I had no pain.  I am still in awe.  I consider it a miracle.  After 4 years of pain I now am pain-free.  I only hope this continues.  I am on 50 mg once a day for the first week, then I go up to twice a day.  I pray that I will be able to take this and that it keeps working for the rest of my life.

I was only on 25 mg. I wasn't aware of any of the side effects only that it may causse nausea.  I reported symptoms to my doctor but I wanted to try to make it work. Continued with pack and up to 50 mg with increased symptoms. By the time I took the 100 mg. the chest pressure and shortness of breath was too much. It felt like someone was standing on my chest. Contacted doctor and they decreased back to 50 mg a day since I could feel there was some progress with my pain. I did report to my doctor my right big toe went numb after only on medicine 10 days. Doctor seemed to think it was from the savella but numbness should stop.It never has. And, two toes on my left foot also became numb and are still numb. I really wanted this to work so I stayed with it until the first of November when I had an episode of severe chest pain and increased symptoms. Doctor decreased medication over a period of a few weeks and I'm glad to be off of this medication. However, I still experience symptoms and had two additional episodes of severe chest pain. If you are able to take savella without the side effects that I and others have had you are lucky. I did feel that it was helping me.

I didn't notice any side effects upon starting the med but looking back I did have some hot flashes that went away very quickly. I no longer have any fibro pain, I sleep better and feel rested the following day. This was a great combo for me!

I've tried it less than 2 weeks and am getting off of it. It has already raised my blood pressure 20 points and I am waking up with daily severe headaches, and I am not even up to 100 mg dose. Am I alone in believing high blood pressure is not a good idea?  It just doesn't seem worth it and it isn't even helping with my pain. I will not take a med that requires more meds to treat the side effects. I guess I'll be exploring something else. I'm already on 2 different pain meds, flexeril, trazadone and klonopin to help me sleep and really wanted something that would help me REDUCE my meds, not increase them.

Titration period was awflu including intense sweating. But did help with leg cramps and hip pain . Problems came up 3 months into Savella- increased BP ending up with heart attack one hour after my normal swim routine....I got lightheaded and eventually fainted in back of ambulance. they found clog artery that had escaped detection several weeks earlier when I had complained of headaches/pressure. Taken off Savella immediately. This drug did help symptoms without a doubt but obviously the side effects make it undesirable. I cannot imagine that so many reports on the sweating, BP and increased heart rates are just occasional side effects.

Other than the side affects of using it.  My headaches were so horrible that I debated if it was worth it.  Another side effect that is horrible is the fact that I sweat so bad.  I never sweated unless exercising.  I have long hair and just the slightest activity and I am drenched, the underneath of my hair will be soaked.  I will wake up during the night and be the same way. Another side effect is rapid heart rate.  I'll be sitting completely still at my computer or watching tv and it will just start racing.  I also can not be out in the sun for any length of time without feeling sick, and my face turning beat red and my heart start racing.I have had some relief of pain during the days that I don't work.

Muscles in neck have finally let go after being locked up for over five years.  Temperature has risen about 1.5 degrees.  This is a good thing considering my temperature was stuck between 96-98 degrees and the lower my temperature, the worse I felt.  Hope prostate symptoms go away.  If so, then, for me, B12, Fish Oil, Turmeric, Minocycline, Acytl L-Carnitine, and Savella are a godsend.  This is not medical advice.  If you wish to try such medications always seek the advice of a trained medical professional/Dr.Pill 10:No pain at all and I feel normal again.  At least how I felt before given vaccinations.However, seems to be causing prostate issues.Pill 11:No pain, cannot urinate very well.Pill 12:No pain, cannot urinate very well.Hopefully some adjunctive can be added to aide the prostate issues.

Like brain freeze headaches, (when you eat ice cream to fast).Off the stuff for two months &amp; still get SEVERE HEADACHES when I cough, sneeze, roll over, sit up, yell. No relief from the pain, increased hip and shoulder pain and HEADACHES. I am going to revisit with my Dr. and then see about contacting the maker of this crap....it is a waste, not worth fighting your insurance to get it paid for, it belongs in the trash can. I want the BRAIN FREEZE HEADACHES to go away. I am more limited as to what I am able to do now then what I was before taking this medication. Sorry for the long, graphic post but I am totally frustrated.

This is the worst! I can't take this medication. I thought if I could just get through the first 4 weeks, I could handle the side effects. I'm not going to make it! I've always hung in there and toughed it out to get through the side effects of other meds. Dr prescribed anti-nausea pills at day 3, this stopped the nausea.  Can't sleep, pharmacist tells me to take Benadryl instead of my normal allergy meds to help me sleep. I feel depressed, have no appetite, forcing myself to eat. I've awakened every morning drenced in sweat (not like night sweats from menopause), to hip pain that never existed before. I've experienced dizziness every day. I feel weak and thought perhaps my blood pressure was running high, have always had low blood pressure and a low pulse rate. Truck driver husband came home on Day 4, not happy that I feel so sick, wants to talk to the dr himself on Monday. Day 5, I wake up at 6 a.m., can hear blood rushing through my ears. Hubby pulls out blood pressure cuff.  Blood pressure HIGH! Pulse rate at 94!I don't want my pulse rate at 94 when I wake up, I want it back down to 70, where it should be.  I feel as if I'm being poisened, honestly.  I won't take these meds any longer.I'm going to ask Dr to put me back on my Cymbalta and baclofen. I'd rather deal with the little bit of pain! I was pretty happy with the treatment plan I was on.  I'm going back there! I'm happy to read this med has helped so many people, I'm not going to be one of them though.

I've tried many, many medications.  I've had some relief from pain with vicodin and some relief from anxiety with klonopin.  I've tried several antidepressants over the years.  I don't remember the last time I woke up and actually felt refreshed after 8 or 9 hours of sleep.  I was up to 4 vicodin a day and realized this much was actually causing more pain and sleep problems.  Dr. prescribed Savella.  It caused nausea, cold symptoms, insomnia, increased anxiety, horrible dry-mouth and weight gain.  I believe the titration pack is too fast and not everyone needs 100 mg/day.  I worked up to the 100 mg/day along with enduring the bad side effects, thinking I had to give it a chance to work and maybe the side effects would go away.  I decreased down to 50 mg/day for a couple weeks and still had no improvement, then down to 25 mg/day for another couple weeks.  I gave this drug a chance for 2 months.  This med did not help me and I am angry that the co-pay was $125.  I want my money back.  I think this med can work for some people, but ask your doctor to titrate you more slowly and reconsider the recommended dosage.  Also ask you doctor to give you enough trial packs to get you to the point where you know it is actually helping, before spending money on getting a script filled.

Lyrica was by-far the most effective however I gained over 50# in less than a year so had to discontinue. Cymbalta seemed to cause sudden drenching sweats with or without exercise. Savella has helped without the wt gain but sweats continue. Thyroid tests have come up borderline/low so Dr. tried Levothyroxine and then Synthroid both with bad side effects...also taking Extra Calcium, Vit D and B Complex...not sure what else to try..some days it's hard to even want to deal with this. Family is supportive and I think they are all that keeps me going...good luck and prayers to all my fellow fibros...

My doctor gradually increased my dosage up to 100 mg. After a few weeks, I broke out into excessive sweating while doing minor activity, like normal walking. My worst experience was while in physical therapy doing five minutes on a stationary bike. I was sweating like I had run a marathon, couldn't cool down, my BP &amp; my heart rate shot up and I became light-headed. My physical therapist was so concerned she wanted me to see a doctor right away. My BP normally runs really low. So, I can only imagine what this medication must do to people with high blood pressure. My PCP had to decrease my dosage by half. It is not as effective for the pain and I don't sleep. I still have excessive sweating on occasion from minor activity. About two weeks ago, I walked around my yard &amp; broke out into a sweat, couldn't breathe and my heart rate shot up.

The first thing that improved was my energy-no more fatigue, then my sleep, then my pain. I have been taking it for 3 years. There are many side effects including a drippy nose. The worst is the hot flashes and high blood pressure but the benefits out weigh the side effects. My doctor just increases my blood pressure meds. It is expensive and my insurance has a high deductible.  Good news-I can work because I am not suffering much anymore so I will pay the price they want for it. The great thing is I do not gain weight with this drug (like all the others) in fact I lost a little weight! I take 75 mgs. 2 times a day and I started at 25mgs -had to increase as time went on and i can still go up to 200 a day but do not want to.  Again-there are side effects and i had most of them but I feel like a person again I am out of the fog and on a scale of 1-10 pain level is at a 2 most days. I still have a flare periodically but it does not last much longer that a few days and I can still function. At the end of my trial period they wanted me to participate in the tapering off program and I refused--I will not give up this medication.  I am alive again!  Thanks to the makers of Savella.

Just took my first pill. My main concern is interactions and precautions. Almost everything it warns you against I have!! I had a heart attack 2 months ago. They found 2 dozen ulcers in my stomach 5 days after that. I am on Dextroamphetamine salts for fatigue. I have borderline personality disorder w\ Bi-polar tendencies, I am on high blood pressure meds, aspirin daily (for heart), and Plavix among other drugs after my heart attack. Since starting my heart meds you can look at me and I will bruise. I told her when she gave me the starter packs that it &quot;acted like an anti-depressant&quot; and I stopped her right there. &quot;Whoa, don't go messing around in my head. You know what disorder I have. Only a licesensed Pyschiatrist should be in there&quot; She assured me it would be OK. I was doubtful. Now I read all of the precautions and side effects and wonder what in the world this woman was thinking? BTW this isn't my Physiatrist, it's her PA. I've been trying to demand an appt. with the actual doctor for 2 months now and she's always out. I do not want to see her flunkie. Especially after this. I do not think I will take another one of these pills tomorrow. This woman must of lost her freaking mind. Why not just up my Norco one pill a day?? Why risk someone with a history of mental illness, a recent heart attack, a prescription for Dextroamphetamines and meds that cause her to bruise easier and keep her BP low on this stuff?? I don't think she even bothered to read the full set of precautions etc. I am printing all of this out and taking it to my next appointment.

I stopped taking the Lyrica-though extremely effective due to extreme weight gain, and was forced to stop taking Ultram due to insurance issues. I also take Topamax as a maintainence drug for severere migraines. Savella has caused me to suffer chronic severe migraines and headaches, enough so, that I was unable to continue with the medication. I am not even sure it is safe to mix both together. It does warn against certain migraine meds together, but I believe it should be very specific when it can be potentially life threatening. It also states non-habit forming, but the reviews I am reading show otherwise if you experience withdrawls, and withdrawls, when you have to go through them people should be a BIG RED FLAG that a medication is indeed addictive and can be hell if you need to withdrawl from it. TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.!!!

The worse was hot flashes and sweating bad.  I am a cook and new that was not going to work, so I switched to lyrica.  I am now going back to Sevela, I will deal with the side effects if they return, but with sevella I was in no pain, had no trouble sleeping and it didnt depress me.  The lyrica is doing all the oppositte, I am in constant pain, bruising like crazy, having trouble sleeping and am depressed.

Savella has helped all my pains tremendously (Fibro, arthritis and RLS), however it has increased my BP and have bad headaches. Doc slowly built dosage up, I've been on full dose (100mg day) 2 weeks now, hoping side effects go away because Savella has helped me so much I don't want to stop taking it. I don't sleep as soundly but when I'm awake I'm not hurting and I don't have to get up and walk the floor.

My daily pain level is now about 10% and I have been able to take myself off pain medication.  I do take Tylenol or Advil on a particular bad day. The only down side is the hot flashes and lack of sexual interest but in my opinion, to be almost pain free is worth it.

The Dr. had warned me that this would take 48-72 hours to take effect, and this was the case.The next few weeks things got better.  I had aching legs at night, but the severe pain decreased greatly.  After three and a half weeks I went up to 100mg twice a day.  The aching legs stopped, but I started having extreme pain at night and in the morning, especially in my elbows, shoulder blades, knees, and ankles.After 6 weeks the Dr. said to go back to 50 since the 100 didn't help so much.  I did and the next morning was in extreme pain so I took the 100 again.  Waited two more days and took the 50 again and same effect.  Took 100 again for a couple of days.At that point I realized I was going through withdrawal symptoms when I  went from the 100 to the 50.  I also noticed that about 6 hours after taking the 100 I was in severe pain, but couldn't take my meds for another 6 hours.So, now I'm going off of it because as I increase the dose my symptoms get worse in between uses.  The Dr. said I shouldn't be having withdrawal symptoms, but everything else I read says I should expect severe withdrawal symptoms.

I have been able to do more than usual, but am still extremely tired yet unable to get a good night's sleep.  The first time I took Savella, I slept surprising well, but since then, it has been hit or miss.  My sleep problems seem to stem from not only fibro, but severe back pain &amp; sleep apnea which has not been resolved, so things can get confusing...i.e.my medical history is very complicated!  I gave &quot;ease of use&quot; *** because with I have arthritis &amp; carpal tunnel syndrome, &amp; with the starter pack, the pills are very difficult for meto push out -- even removing the cardboard in the back to make it easier is difficult.

Unlike Lyrica, it did nothing for pain and my body had an adverse reaction.  While on the trial pack I began to get extremely weak until I couldn't get out of bed.  My body literally felt like it was shutting down the more I took.  I went off the medication after 5 days and began to feel better.  Lyrica definitely worked better for me.  The reaction my body had on Savella actually frightened me.

This along with Vicodin has been a real, true miracle!  I can sleep all night now, I can get my house picked up/cleaned, my mood is much 'softer' and I can focus!!  These are all things I couldn't do for years.  My pain threshold is tolerable now and doesn't stop me from being as active as I want.  I've only been taking this for 2 weeks!  So the 50 mg. works wonderful for me.  I hope everyone else finds this the case for them. Best wishes. M.M.

Sweating all the time, constipation so bad I bled when I finally went,confusion and finally vision problems.Dr said to cut in half and take 25mg a.m. &amp; p.m. Pain was back but not as bad,vision improved and not as bad with the sweating.Constipation lessened. Now I have rapid heart rate, cold hands and aches in joints. Is it worth it. I don't wake up happy either.

I take Maxalt or Immitrex for migraines and had a severe reaction the one time I tried Cymbalta and my doctor ruled out Lyrica for me also. I am still taking Celexa for depression. Have had no adverse reactions and actually a possible decrease in migraines.  It has helped my overall pain levels and I seem much better able to cope with work and tasks.  Only side effect that bothers me is increased sweating.  I guess I can live with that.  Better than having to lie down every couple of hours.  Much better than not being able to work at all.

I weened myself from fluoxetine and mirapex.  I am so glad I did because I do not like putting drugs in my system!  I noticed no difference in coming off the fluoxetine and mirapex, so I am wondering if I ever really need them.  I have been taking Lyrica for about 10 months.  I was still having severe upper leg muscle pain and could not even put on tennis shoes and tie them, get out of bed, sit down and get up, get in and out of a car without just wanting to scream.  I went to the doctor last week in tears.  He put me on sevella...a miracle drug for me!!  My pain level was 8/10, now I would say it is 2/10.  I have been on sevella for 8 days and could tell a remarkable difference on day 2.  I have more energy and am sleeping lots better.  I was hoping to get off Lyrica, but I may need the combination...I will have to wait and see how everything plays out.

The muscle pain has decreased but the nerve pain was not affected and actually increased. I am weaning myself off of this drug to see if symptoms improve.

Dr. pulled me off concerned I was reacting to the Savella.  No problem getting off of it, more pain but weekly massage and lymphatic massage therapy helps.  The biggest plus since getting off the Savella is my energy level has increased ten-fold.  My husband has even told me to take a break. I think Savella helped for a few months but side effects increased as did fatigue.  I was really upset when Dr. advised I stop taking it, now I actually feel better than I have in months.  Only taking Advil, Flexeril as needed and Ambien nightly for sleep.

This has evidently triggered migraines which have lasted for that time. I have not had a migraine headache for over a year.  I did not connect them with the Savella because I had changed another med, but this has been eliminated.   My blood pressure has also increased.  I am going off the Savella as soon as I can.  The mere inclusion of &quot;headaches&quot; as a side effect is not enough.  In my opinoion, no one who has a history of migraines should chance this product without being specifically warned. BTW, I take Savella with food, and do not have severe nausea problems, especially after about two weeks.  So for some people with fibromyalgia this may be the answer, but not if you are being treated for high blood pressure or tend to have migraines.

I experienced slight improvement for the first month, then had 14 trigger point injections, hoping the combination would give me some real improvement. No such luck. The trigger point injections sent me into the worst fibromyalgia flare up I've ever experienced. From May 18, until now (June 12), I've been in agony. The muscle spasms are relentless. This time it feels like they are trying to crush my rib cage and rip themselves free from where they attach in my back. Nothing fazes them. Lortab 7.5 750 helps some, but I can't take the stuff 4 times a day, and I still feel worse, even on Lortab, than I did before starting Savella. I'm weening myself off of it starting immediately. Of course, anyone reading this who has fibromyalgia knows that the disease itself my be the culprit. That's how fibromyalgia works. We may do pretty well for a time, then it grabs us and slaps us down. Time to suffer for a while. That's what makes it so hard to find something that helps. We never know what is causing our present condition, be it good or be it bad. After suffering like this for over 25 years, one would think that I would know better than to start thinking something might help. Thankfully, 20 mg of Flexeril still knocks me out for 6 hours so I get to sleep some.

So apparently, that wasnt working for me cuz I was always in pain, couldnt get out of bed, couldnt make it to restroom in time, couldnt hardly even walk. I was then put on Lyrica.  I had an allergic reaction to it so the doctor then put me on Gabepentin and that did nothing at all for me. NOTHING!! except weight gain. I finally found out from another doctor that savella was a med for fibro but it wasnt put on the market at that time or fda approved for fibro.  I started taking savella and about a week or so of taking it, it was a miracle drug for me.  I was able to walk up and down the stairs, do every thing i couldnt do.  I was simply amazed and so happy that this dr. put me on it.  I couldnt believe at the difference it made. It was like I had no legs and then woke up to legs. It was god sent. I was even able to go back to work, brush my hair, lift my drink, get out of the bed by myself, I could go on and on at the things I couldnt do.  Thank god for Savella, that's all I got to say about it cause it was definately the med for me.

Then the profuse sweating, worsening palpitations and nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain set in. I experienced red burning facial discomfort and felt feverish.  My skin, however, was cold &amp; clammy with goosebump appearance.  I have tried so many different medications: Neurontin, Lyrica, Cymbalta, and seemingly countless antidepressants, muscle relaxers, pain killers, etc.  All were tried with high hopes of &quot;this has to be the one&quot; just to be disappointed...again.  I am a Registered Nurse forced to retire early due to this terrible condition. I KNOW there has to be something out there that will help.  Still searching for the right medication and/or combination.  Please be careful when trying this medication.  I hope it works for you.  I have been off of it for over 5 days now and am still experiencing gastritis symptoms.

After experiencing significant nausea for several weeks, the pain/fatigue significantly improved for months.  The problem I encountered involved my migraines...I had a significant increase in numer and severity, with no apparent cause.  Until the only possible thing I could try-I went off Savella.  The withdrawal, even though I went off it VERY slowly, was miserable, but the migraine I had suffered for several weeks went away.  The headaches became much more manageable and less severe. My neurologist concluded that the Savella had been the new &quot;trigger&quot; for the migraines.Savella was great for the fibro, but was terrible to &quot;go off&quot;, a trigger for my migraines, and I have felt poorly since I went off it 5 months ago.

I have read a lot of posts on other sites and they suggested taking it early.  I take mine at 7 am and 4 pm.  I also take neurotin.

The only side effect I notice are hot flashes. Too bad it took the FDA so long to improve it. France had it 10 years before we did.I had this severe pain for 39 years. 20 years of being prescribed a steady regimen of narcotic pain meedicine caused me to now have clinical depression. It took six years of hospitalization to get that under control/ I had 4 surgeries, all injections known to neurologists, most who think they're God.I wish the people at the FDA could suffer like those of us who always have to wait on them-it's not just safety that slows down the process9As if we didn't know).

I have only been on med. a month I won't give up yet.

I have two side effect.  Sweating with cold hands and feet and hallucinations at night waking up and seeing people, horses, dogs and spiders.  It is working on the muscle pain I have had for over 20 years but still have arthritis pain in my hands, elbows and left knee.  Overall I am very satisfied even with the things I see at night.

This has generally reduced pain level from a 7 to a 3-4.  Also tried accupuncture which had absolutely no help. Started this medication as part of a study.

No pain after taking for two weeks but the side effects were so bad, I had to stop taking it.  I ended up calling in sick for 3 days because I got so irritated and angry and cried all the time.  I spoke to my family and friends in a very aggressive manner.  Do not take this medication if you are taking any other antidpressants.  I felt crazy and like I had no control over my actions.  I work as a teacher and I couldn't go to work feeling this way.  I personally do not recommend this medication.  Percocet on occasion worked much better for me and didn't give me all of these strange reactions.  I became another person..a very mean and angry person.

Its hard to believe that one pill twice a day can make such a difference. The only drawback to Savella is it is costly and my insurance refuses to cover its cost.

I feel like my old self again.  It wasn't without problems though.  The side effects were horrible.  I had rapid heart rate, very bad anxiety, and nausea.  I went to my doctor and he said since my pain was gone, we needed to temporarily treat the side effects.  He put me on ativan for the anxiety, zofran for nausea, along with a mild beta blocker to slow down my heart rate.  Once he did that, it was like a light switch came one and I felt 100% better.  I am now beginning to reduce these the medicines for the side effects as they are beginning to subside.  With Savella, I have also been able to stop taking Ultram and Zanaflex.  I am completely satisfied.

I cannot take any drug for fibro due to extreme side effects.  I am currently on Savella 50mg twice daily. My pain has not gone away, infact I feel it became worse.  I have days that my face is so red and hot like I was burned.  I feel warm and sweaty.  I need to ask my doctor how to go off this med.

Soon as the dose got to 50mg and then jumped to 2 times 50 per day, I have had nothing but side effects.  Resting blood pressure 150/100 and my face has felt like it has been burning up even though I have no fever.  I get light headed, cannot deal with any type whatsoever of stress as the side effects get even worse.  My ears have been burning, constipation, extreme thrist but not urinating as much I think I should since I been drinking more water.  I don't think I can deal with this med.  Yeah, some of the muscle aches have gone away but I think pain meds work better with more tolerable side effects.  I called my DR. and of course she was gone for the day, so I got 2 different associates, the last one told me I had to keep taking the 50 mg till I could see my dr on Monday, I can't...see myself doing that with the way I am feeling today, since when I missed the dose yesterday, I felt better this morning and didn't feel bad again till after I took another dose on Dr.s orders. I say take at your own risk but maybe if you are already on HP meds tell the Doc, NO THanks.  Also read that there is letter from patients to the FDA to pull the drug back off the market as it was approved too fast. http://www.drugs.com/news/group-urges-recall-fibr omyalgia-22134.html

I thought they would go away but they never did. My family did not want to be around me because I was extremely angry and emotional. I did feel like it was helping with pain but it was not worth it for me to keep taking it. I am back on cymbalta, with a big sigh of relief!

I have been on Rx pain killers for 3 years, and was able to switch to Ultram and cut the dosage in half. No side effects at all. Take Ambien for sleep for the past year.  Savella for the past 4 months.

I felt relief the first pill, (am I crazy) but with increased dose I am having crazy dreams, insomnia, sweating, increased heart rate (100) at rest and anxiousness.  I'll probably go down to 25/day and if that doesn't work I'll stop.  I'm so sorry as I have almost pain free.  I enjoy exercising but can't do it on this medication.  No nausea, thankfully.  But it's hard to work feeling so jittery and tachycardic.  Guess I'll go back to my Lortab.

I instead have a condition called myofascial a-typical pain syndrom with neurological head and neck pain. I have found this medication to be extremely helpful. The myofascial diagnosis was made over seven years ago.  I praise God that this medication came out last year. Now, what's in store for us down the line seeing as we are the &quot;guinea pigs&quot; has yet to been seen. Just have hope and faith. All these meds are certainly a scary journey. Very scary.

Although it's not perfect this is the most normal I have felt in years. I can think clearly now(no fibro fog). I can get out of bed in the morning without help. I still have pain but it's not like what it was. The side effects are still an issue sick to my stomach but it helps if I take my 1 pill in the morning and 1 around dinner so it doesn't keep me awake. I always take it with food. The sweats (hot flashes) come and go and not as bad as it was. If they find a way to perfect this med I will so happy, but for now the benefit out weighs the side effects for me.

With the 2-week starter pack, I was told to &quot;stop immediately&quot; yesterday after only 6 days. Side effects: severe nausea/abdominal pain, chest pain/tightness, severe headache/pressure, severe muscle pain/burning, leg cramps, chills, sore throat, stiff neck, irritability, anxiety, weakness, insomnia, coordination problems, eye pain. I feel terrible. The side effects are much worse than I could have anticipated.

I've now been on Savella for about 5 months, but was diagnosed with fibro almost 20 years ago.  I am still amazed at the feeling of well-being I have had since on Savella.  My pain and stiffness is virtually gone.  I still take Savella on a full stomach so I don't get nausea.  I am still sweating, which for me is one of the worst side effects, but I do think that's getting better.  I have gotten rid of all my sweaters, that's for sure!  I also have freezing cold hands and feet - I feel like all the heat is directed to my face, head, and neck, leaving no heat for my hands.  I think I am most surprised that my thinking is almost 100% clearer!  I can concentrate on tasks and actually finish one before I start another.  The fibrofog is gone!  Another side effect I've noticed is my skin feels and looks like I have goosebumps all the time.  I still have tingling in my scalp, but I'm wondering if anyone else has this skin thing?  My constipation is much better - I eat 1 Activia yogurt a day and it helps.  My heart rate is faster, but my BP is stable.  My pain/burning/tingling comes back only if I am over-tired.  After reading all the comments I realize why it's so hard for drug companies to figure out if drugs work.  Look at how many of us have such different reactions!  I can understand that some of you want this taken off the market because you feel the side effects are so dangerous, but for those of us for whom it works, I thank God every day for this drug!  I wish it worked this well for everyone. Good luck to all of you - something will come along that will help you - hopefully soon!

I took 12.5 mg twice a day for three days,then 25 mg twice a day for two days. I developed profuse sweating, severe dizziness, severe shakiness, nausea, feelings of confusion, loss of coordination, and felt 100X worse than before I took it. I quit taking it. I have looked into Cymbalta and Lyrica, but am scared to even try them, since the side effects of them are so similar to Savella. I guess I just have to suffer, because the side effects are much worse than any benefit it may give.

However, my family has stated how much improved my mood has been which I attribute to not being miserable in pain.  I felt this worked within two days.  I am now on 150 mg but I think I will have to go back down to 100 mg due to feeling like I have no feelings.  ONLY bothersome side effect was nausea (usually I get all the side effects).  Also, I was suprised to find out I can eat ice cream &amp; dairy which previously gave me diarrhea.  Miracle Drug.  I wish they had it for my mother who died at the age of 50 from accidental overdose of pain meds for her fibro.

Due to the severity of my fibromyagia, I kept taking it as I experienced symptom improvement with fatigue, overall pain, and stamina.  After 4-5 months, I noticed an increase in the frequency of migraine headaches.  At 6 months, I had a severe migraine for 3 weeks, and was hospitalized.  I couldn't resolve the headache, and finally started looking at all of the side effects to all medications I was on.  As a last resort, I titrated off the Savella.  Migraine is gone-frequency of headaches is way back down.  As a migraine sufferer, I couldn't tolerate Savella-but it decreased many of the fibro symptoms I had while I was on it.  The nausea was always a minor problem-but if you can get through the first few weeks-it gets much better! Monitor headaches closely if you have migraines! What a huge disappointment that I had to stop it!  I didn't even realize how much it was helping until I went off it. Now my pain level is unbelievable (high)!  Just thought I would pass on my experience...good luck and hang in there!

I have used savella for 2 weeks now and have had nausea, hot flashes and for the past 2 days a feeling of being sick. The good thing is that a lot of my pain is gone. I still get quite stiff at times. I am hoping that the side effects will subside in time. It's quite early to tell if this is going to work but if it keeps the pain down I will be happy.

I was taking Cymbalta, I was being weened off Cymbalta while I started taking Savella. The side effects are ALMOST enough to make me stop taking it! Here are some of the things that are so bothersome: VERY angry (to the point of where me family does not want to be around me); emotional; nausea; anxiety and panic  attacks; sleeplessness; pounding heart; extreme sweating and being flushed; stomach ache; loss of coordination; and itchy skin. I'm not sure if I will keep taking it unless the side effects lighten up SOON!

Nortriptylin has always controlled the pins and needles and more minor aches, and Topamax the migraines. Not now. Dr decided to try Savella. So far the pain is 50 to 70% better and only dry mouth as a side effect. I did NOT like that the starter package incert did not include a list of known side effects to look for, only the standard drug company(CYA)&quot;anti-suicide&quot; warning required on all anti-depressants. I take beta-blockers for a rapid heart rate, so you have all been helpful to red flag that. Thanks. Also the BP. I hope you all report everything to the FDA via the helpful number provided below. Maybe then newbees will be made more aware, and some with serious risks told to steer clear. Thanks for sharing.

I am very happy with it. My fatigue has decreased alot! My pain has decreased some too. My co-workers noticed me getting around better without my telling them of the new meds. My side effects are leg cramps and constipation. The doctor gave me Mirapex for the leg cramps and told me to get something over the counter for the other. I also take Coumadin. I have a Type 1 Chiari Malformation as well as the Fibromyalgia. I had 2 herniated disks in my neck and fusion surgery for that. I was thinking that I would always be in pain. I am so glad that I found this medication!

The muscle pain relief is fair to good; the joint pain / stiffness relief is poor / fair. I'll have to wait for at least another 2 weeks for full evaluation of effectiveness.

I am on blood thiners so I can not take most pain medication. This was the first drug I tried. I've been on it for a little over a month. I am very happy instead of my pain going from a 5 to a 9 throught the day it now hovers between 1 and 2. (just enough to let me know it is still there.) My nervous twitches are mostly gone as well. I have more energy and my wife says she has seen a big change in me for the better.I have a history of stomach problems so I was supprised that I did not have any nausea issues. I have notice the anger thing a few times mostly during the first week but still a little here and there. (A trip to the DMV did not help.) From time to time my forehead will get really warm and I will start to sweat. I also have night sweats. As much as I sweat becasue of it I can not see how I would ever gain weight taking it.

The side effects include,depression, anger,irritableness, red flush on face and chest, sweating, night sweats and cold hands that are stiff and achy.  Does anyone else have these side effects.

My mood lifted and the pain diminished by about 70 percent.  It didnt do anything for my energy level or sleepless nights but I wanted to give it at least 2 months to fully work.  I was taking 100mg a day but after 2 months I noticed that about an hour after taking them I lost all concept of time and just didnt care about doing anything.  I knew I had things to do but it was like the day wasnt going to end and I would get to it.  I never did.  I was usually in the same clothes in the evening that I wore in the morning and didnt even care to shower.  I didnt want to do anything.  The sweats got worse and worse and were non stop.  It took me awhile to relate my feelings with this pill until I forgot to take it one morning and I felt normal.   I then started skipping my evening dose and I really noticed the difference.  The fog went away at night.  I told my Doctor today I want to wean off of it and he prescribed me tramadol.  To me the pain relief was not worth the mental fog and laziness/sweats that the savella caused.  I can deal with pain better than dealing with feeling out of my head.  Its sad because I heard such good things about this drug.  Everyone is different though, give it a try, it may work for you.

I still have bad days, but they don't put me to bed like they used to. Depression is much better. Fatigue &amp; down days are less frequent, and the fibro fog is virtually gone. Only problem is nausua/vomitting. I have to be careful of when I take the med; with dinner each night works best. The nausea I can live with as long as the pain is gone!

The cold sweats stopped as soon as I stopped taking the drug. I was so miserable while I was on it.

I tried it for almost two months hoping the side effects would go away.  I experienced rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure (never had that problem prior to taking Savella), itchy rash on legs, chills, blurred vision, headaches, sweating and trouble sleeping among other side effects.

I noticed a definite twitching in my right hand/arm.  It was something I did not notice right away, until a nurse friend commented on it.  I stopped taking it for that reason and my doctor switched me to Wellbutrin.  The Wellbrutrin works for depression but has done nothing for me pain.  In fact my pain is much worse than when I was on the Savella.  I had fibromyalgia, which returned after my car accident.  Before the accident, I was using a natural juice containing the acai berry and 18 other fruits and all my symptoms went away and I felt awesome for the first time in years.  My traumatic accident seems to have set off the fibromyalgia agian.  Now, the fruit juice doesn't seem to working.  Not sure if I will go back on the Savella because I don't know if the twitching will become permanent.  I notice no other side effects with Savella.

At that time I was walking everywhere with a cane. I have degenerative disk disease, Fibromilgia, and arthritis.  I felt as though my life was on a down hill slide.  I had tried every other fibromialgia drug with no success.  This was my last resort.  I had the same problems in the beginning as several other people and was ready to give up.  My doctor suggested to crush the pills and try it in small doses several times a day until I felt as though I was adjusting to it.  It took about 3 weeks and then I was able to take the pill in small pieces as I adjusted to the medication.  I am happy to say I rarely need the cane and am 90% pain free. I have more energy, and a much happier outlook.  Please give this medicine a chance.

I arose from bed, went to the bathroom, did my business, then upon walking out realized how easy I just walked. It was like a miracle, no joke. I thought I was going crazy. I decided it must be a fluke or something. No medicine works that fast, or that effectively. Throughtout the day, I continued to notice the ease with which I was performing tasks of all nature, so I called and requested a visit with my rheumatologist for that week. I went in, explained to him and shared my worries of maybe it just being &quot;psychosematic&quot; and he laughed. It's not in your head, it's in your body. This drug really worked that fast! He shared that several of his patients had reacted to this med just as quickly and were having as good of results as I was. I have never had such good reslts from anything before and the side effects for me were just icing on the cake. I lost 20 pounds in the first month, gained so much energy, I'm more alert, and happier than I've been in years. I am only 44 and felt like I was older than my mother. Now I can swim and actually keep up with my 7 year old daughter.

I hope the side effects will subside soon, cause the drug seems to be effective already, any hints on dealing with this would be great. I have tried eating a full meal before taking it, also tried 400, then 800 mg of ginger for the nausea with little relief. Plus I can't take my Imitrex for migraines-rock &amp; a hard place!

I knew when I got home from the dr, I took my first dose that evening and the next morning I woke up and actually felt like I had slept for the first time in years! The fibro fog is gone, now dont get me wrong, I still have good days and bad days, but this had definitely improved my quality of life. The few side effects are worth it to actually feel better. I think the side effect that is the worst is the hot flashes and flushing. I am almost always hot and my cheeks always look like I have spent too much time in the sun.

It took a while to get used to. It was better than Cymbalta. At first I had nausea, excessive sweating, and dizzeness. But, I started sleeping better after YEARS of not sleeping well. The dr. took me off all anti-inflamatorys, sleeping meds and muscle relaxers I had been on for years, and I thought the doc was crazy for doing this. But, my son who has the same dr. told me to trust him &amp; I did. Now after months, the pain is much less, only my oesteo arthritis pain remains, I am less nauseated, hardly ever sweaty. I take 2 50mg a day and divide the dose into 4 times with food.  That helped a LOT. My dr. also put me on NO exercise for a month. I again, thought he was crazy, but it worked and my muscles healed. Now I can do a little more and more each day. Hang in there folks, it does get better. For me the alternative medicines are much, much, worse. Good luck everybody.

First, I miss the cymbalta terribly. The mood swings are awful. I'm afraid I'll alienate my husband if I take this much longer. Stomach pains are more than I can take. Shooting pains down my legs into my feet. I wake up with my left shoulder, arm and hand deformed and quivering - hubby says looks like nerves. I have no idea if it's the fm or the side effects since I had to stop the cymbalta at the same time. The pain is different tho. If this is my choice, I'll be asking the doctor to take me off this. I agree with others here, I'd rather have the original pain.

Itchy skin was the most bothersome. To others trying this, don't give up. The side effects were over-whelming at first. My doctor decided to start me at an extreme low dose for thirty days, and up in increments of twenty-five mg's every thirty days. Much easier to adjust.  After eleven years, this is the first med to help me with a chronic pain problem. Ask your doctor for meds to combat the initial side effects and try to continue taking the medicine. I have been to countless pain clinics, neurologists, spine centers and  much more. I've lost count of how many meds I tried that I could not take because of the side effects, or they just plain didn't work for me. This one works. I have less pain and generally feel better about life.

I have every side effect possible on this medication to make it worse weight gain was immediate!!! I am taking myself off the medication and notifying my Dr. to put me back on Cymbalta.  This medication does not work for everyone.

I don't have to nap everyday anymore. I'm able to stay up a little bit later now and my stomach issues are going away. I have less muscle spasms and &quot;fibrofog&quot; too. I'm going to keep taking it.

The first time my stomach hurt so bad even with food also dry mouth,rapid heart rate.  The 2nd time out of desperation night sweats, no sleep, rapid heart rate no change in pain scale.

I have had no nausea or headaches. I do have migraines often but since starting savella I havent had any what so ever. For me this drug is amazing. I have more energy and no pain. I do agree with everyone that said not to take the second pill after 3.

Other than that, it seems to be working, atleast i am more relaxed and sleeping a little more. I hope the best for everyone, just remember, we are not alone!

That said, stopping Cymbalta and starting Savella has been wonderfully effective for me, very nearly miraculous, after 5 weeks of use. Suggestions: take w/food; take dose 2 no later than 3 p.m.; give it a chance to work, i.e., longer than a week). Because I take a number of other meds for pain management not associated with Fibro (retired on disability at age 46 due to genetic spinal disease/6 surgeries; 2 hip replacements; etc.), the only side effect I could discern to be associated with Savella was dizziness (gone). I am energized, my pain level is way down, I am more ME again than I have been in years. Family and friends are astounded. Am I painfree? No. But do I expect to be? NO. It has taken me years to get to this mind set and believe me, there are times I slide into &quot;why me.&quot; Time will tell whether Savella helps me to continue to feel so much better! Wishes for good and better days to all!

The Lyrica was prescribed in a pain management program; the relief from FM was an added bonus which was sorely missed when i was forced to discontinue.  Hoped that Savella would be as helpful, NOT!! Headaches, sweats - both hot and cold, vomiting and severe stomach pain were experience within 12 hours of the first small dose... i wonder how some medications receive FDA approval when so many of us have such severe reactions... am back to square one... ugh!!

I started the regular script and all went down hill.  I was getting sick, having headaches, severe mood-swings, sweating, sleepy after taking,etc. My body wasn't hurting  but otherwise I was in terrible shape.  I stopped taking this and my body is killing me again.  I don't know what to do.  I called my doctor and was told that I was fine before and asked if I would rather put up with the &quot;mild&quot; side-effects or hurt again.  I was also told that they never heard anyone complaining about mood-swings.  Does anyone else have this?

Besides FM, I also have RSD (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy).  After being weaned off Methadone, Celebrex and Lyrica, I have found that Savella has not helped me as much as I need it to.  I have severe sweating, migraines and pain in my  lower back and both legs down to my toes.  Not sure if this med is worth all of the side effects!  I just kept taking it, hoping that it would eventually help me with my pain!

It sent me to the E.R. I also stated vomiting. I guess it just isn't the medicine for me after all. Good luck to everyone else though! My doctor put me one Topamax for my nerve damage, fm ,oa , and migranes. Seems to help so far. Peace and Health to all!!

I did not realize how much the citalopram was helping me.  Pain came back with a vengence.  My doctor gave me a script for Savella for my FM.  I no longer wake up 3 or 4 times a night with back pain.  At first, I didn't sleep well, but it's getting better.  I really like the lessened pain aspect.  And the energy.  I used to take 2 to 3 naps a day so I could function...not anymore.  Yes, it's pricey...holding judgement on that.  I will decide in a couple of months if it is worth the $62/month for 1 50mg tablet daily.

The side effects of terrible agitation, poor concentration due to feeling &quot;rushed&quot; anxious,anorexia,loss of taste, and an almost uncontrollable agitation far outweigh any of its intended benefit. I still have headaches and they seem worse because I am unable to sleep due to a racing mind from this medication. I am an APN, and I would not recommend this medication for fibromyalgia w/o thoroughly reviewing the terrible side effects. I trialed this medication for a full month and now need to see my physician to effectively wean off. I am not 25, I am 56 and the feelings of agitation and poor appetite  and suicidal ideation far outweigh any benefits this drug may promise. I would highly suggest further drug trials and studies be done. The FDA needs to be made aware of this potentially highly dangerous medication.

Had just stopped taking Zoloft a week and went to Dr for pain and he gave me Savella. Since 01/2006 lots of tests for chronic nausea, mri's, ultrasounds all negative &amp; never diagnosed with fm. Sent to psychitrist given many depression meds until I said no longer. Can't tell yet if Savella has helped. Still nauseated, pain, terrible sweats &amp; at 65 over menopause. Thirsty, no appetite. Seem to get a lot of UTI'S. Take Xanax &amp; Lunesta to sleep. Mirolax was working great, but seems to have slowed since starting Savella. Seem to be more irritable. Hard to tell since have been going through this for four years. Seeing a new internal med dr this month that specializes in fm. My pcp doc doesn't really have a clue. Noticed a lot of reviews have shoulder pain. Mine started 2006 with a torn rotary cuff and went down hill from there. Two months ago started with plantar facisitis. Savella hasn't helped that, got supports &amp; new tennies. Seem to have more headaches now. I will be checking out reviews for Lyrica &amp; Cymbalta since these seem to be popular. Hate this, retired 08/2005 healthy, active and lots of plans. Depression meds really made situation worse. Really slowed me down and symptoms started compounding. Not what I visioned my retirement. Forgot to mention stress level really high. Will let you know what new doc says in Feb.

I got the 4-wk titration pak and started taking it.  On the second night of taking 2 50 mg doses per day, I had the most severe headache, complete with flashes of light. Soon after, I felt like I had the worst case of flu ever. After a week I still have horrible nausea, headaches, dizziness, hot flashes, emotional, and feel like I won't be &quot;around&quot; much longer.  My hands and feet are freezing, but I feel hot and sweaty.  I am always angry, have brain fog.  My blood pressure shot up past 140/110 and my pulse is at 110! I am tapering off starting with the next dose. I would rather deal with the pain!!

My doctor seemed so hopeful because this one was supposed to work differently.  His enthusiam made me enthusiastic.  From the first day, I had headaches that began about 30 minutes after each dose.  By the time I had been on it a week, the headaches were pretty constant. After the first three days, I began to have problems sleeping.  Then the chest pains started.  My heart began beating extremely hard.  Not faster, it just seemed to be contracting harder. That was a scary feeling! I lasted nine days before I finally gave up. I was very disappointed but I would rather experience my usual muscle pain and exhaustion than deal with the side effects.

For the first month I felt no better. I started Savella in August 09. It is now December and I feel amazingly better. I am able to go home after work and not just lie around in my pj's with the heating pad. I have had weight gain also, but I attribute that to being less active, not because of the drug. I am so happy to be feeling &quot;great&quot;!!

I am now on the fourth day and I have had no side effects what so ever. I think it ios starting to help with my pain some, but not where I can say a great improvement. I hope it starts helping soon. I am worried about weight gain, but so far no change in appetite either.Also was worried about not sleeping, so I took the advice of another reviewer here and I take the evening pill no later than 3pm. I sleep great. BUT, it has only been four days. My hope is that this med. will make a difference. I am so tired of laying on the couch in pain everyday, all day. Yesterday, I only laid down for 1 hour, so that was good. Since reading the negative side effects, I seem to catch myself waiting for something bad to happen. I stay positve about it though and so far so good. Good luck to all. I just hope next time I check in, I can tell you guys that this med. is a life saver for me.  Oh and I am taking up Yoga (in my living room). It will be hard, but I am going to try to fight this pain. Maybe the combonation of the two will improve me. I hope I don't have to high of hopes. I have been in severe pain for 10 years now, in and out of hospitals, fm,nerve damage,and OA.(other smaller things to.) This has to help or I will be stuck back in that dark hole that I'm sure you guys know very well.

My morning stiffness is almost 100% better, and my other pain symptoms have all but disappeared unless I don't get enough sleep.  If I get overtired they will flare a little.  My thinking is also much clearer, and I have much more energy - fatigue is much less.  Side effects include tingling/burning of the scalp which has almost disappeared, and nausea unless I take it right after meals.  The most annoying side effect, but getting better is excessive, extreme sweating.  This may be worse because I was having hot flashes before the medication.  Wish this worked as well for everyone.  For me, it's miraculous!

I guess FM was given because they don't know.  Wheni started the medication i was wanting to give it 100% effort...I want it to work!! But i am in my second week and all i notice is that i am more depressed and short with everyone. I don't want to be.  I also have seen NO relief in pain at all!! I is almost like it has gotten worse?  I feel like I can't say anything because the doctors get short with me so I will keep taking it. I just want to be a mom, wife, aunt....Before all this i worked 60-70 hours a week.  I can't work.  This is the 1st time in my life that I have not worked.   Does any one else feel like I do?

This first time I stayed on 12.5mg once daily with supper, but wanted to eat constantly, gained weight, I also had mild hot flashes but wasn't sure this had caused it.  I stopped on my own.  Then I noticed no more hot flashes,but my body was wracked with pain and my arm/shoulder area were in pain and had limited range of motion.  The Dr. put me on this again, thinking I need to try 12.5mg twice daily for 2 wks, then go up to 25mg twice daily for 2wks.  I haven't gotten there yet.  This time I have nausea about a hour or so after eating, no hot flashes have reappeared yet...so far I'm not hungry like before...but have noticed I'm feeling frustrated with people around me....I already talk wellbutrin for depression.  Will post more after a couple of weeks.....I'm sure this crazy winter weather is not helping my situation.

This drug has helped me have more good days then bad. The first think I noticed was the clarity of my thinking, second was the fluidity of body movement returning.  I recommend this drug to anyone who has chronic pain in multiple locations, stiffness in neck, joints...

I've been on Savella a little over a month.  I didn't think I was going to be able to continue due to the nausea, stomach cramps.  After some self education &amp; reading these reviews, possibly taking it on a empty tummy is easing the tummy issues.  Pain is much better, energy seems to be better.  Very thirsty, drinking more water.  Blurred vision due to dry eyes, artificial tears improve dryness &amp; vion. Only sleeping approx. 4 hours at night.  But if I continue with improved pain &amp; energy, YAEH FOR ME !  My doc was always OK with me trying the latest FM meds.  Before Savella, Wellbutrin (for pain &amp; energy) &amp; Amitriptyline (for sleep &amp; pain) was the VERY best out of all the FM meds I had tried throughout the years.  Always went back to that combo.  After another month or 2, I will give another review.  Here's to a pain free 2010 for us all !

I hurt everywhere and was tested for everything and it all came back negative. Even my skin hurt to be touched. This med has given me back my life. I had the nausea and hot flashes in the beginning. As for the nausea, I learned when to take it and what foods to avoid. For me, waiting one hour after a meal was the best way to avoid the nausea. I still experience the hot flashes but they are a small price to pay in exchange for pain relief! When I returned to my doctor for followup, he was thrilled when I told him I could kiss him. This medication has made such a difference in my life.

So now everyone knows its a real illness, but there is very little help. Savella was given to me along with Lyrica. I felt like i haven't felt in yrs. But the sweating and heavy feeling in my chest scared me. I stopped Savella a few days ago and the chest pain is gone. I'm not taking that risk! Bu tit might not have this affect on someone else. Fibromyalgia is a very difficult thing to deal with and treat. My thoughts are you should give it a try. Any Rx that has to be gradually introduced in to the body, has a risk of being very dangerous later on.

It made my head pound so bad I was stuck on the couch for two days.  It didn't suprise me though I've tried all of this type of medicine and it all has made my head hurt or feel like there was a blender in my brain, or affects my chest making it feel like my heart is doing sommersaults.  I have been diagnosed with Sjorgens Syndrome recently and I'm hoping the docs can find something soon.  I hope this helps someone, I have looked for 15+ years for what is wrong with me and finally I think I got the right diagnosis.  It takes time, occasionally half your life.

I was called a pill seeker, when all I needed was relief. Thanks to products such as Lyrica, people are now recognizing the symptoms and disease. I guess it takes a TV commercial for the public to be informed. I now have a wonderful doctor I have been seeing for five years now, who put me on Savella six months ago.He told me I have the worst case of fibro that he has ever seen because it went untreated for so long. He did tell me there's only a 50/50 chance the Savella will help me. The side effects were horrible at first, but it was helping my pain, so I was determined to get though it. The nausea went away after two months, but the excessive sweating never stopped. By the time I got to work, I looked like I got stuck in a rain storm. The night sweats also got worse and the pain returned.I couldn't take it any more. I am gradually cutting down on this medicine so I can go back to taking Celebrex and will never take Savella again. The Celebrex helped me more than the Savella and am willing to risk it's side effects, than the side effects I experienced with Savella. I do hope it does help some people. The drug administration needs to work on the side effects, such as the excessive sweating. Good luck to all of you with this horrible illness. Maybe, with all of the media exposure, they can perfect a medication just for us with less side effects. I would not wish this illness on anyone.

My body had a horrible time getting used to it, it aggravated my existing acid reflux to the point that I would vomit 30 mins after I took it every time. However, I stuck with it, learned what to eat with it, take gaviscon with it and now don't vomit at all. The misery was worth it! My life has been at a halt with fibro, I can't function. For the first time in years though, things are starting to slowly change. The longer I take the medicine, the better it is starting to work. The best for me is that the fibro 'fog' has lessened, and that was always very tough for me. I shake with my fibro as well and with the savella that is starting to lessen, which is thrilling to me because I am an artist and haven't been able to draw for five years because of fibro. I recommend to anyone who is going to try this, even if you are miserable on it at first, stick with it for at least six weeks. A short amount of misery is worth the possibilty of this helping the rest of your life be better.

I have never experienced anything like this in my life. I would rather have pain and depression then total suicidal thoughts and so close to action in those thoughts.  I lost weight but who cares about weight if you are that bad feeling and I wondered why my head etched so much. It drove me nuts!  Please be so careful using this medication.  I feel a lot better since I have been off it just 4 days. Not totally back but much better!

During that time, I've only had 2 days of pain. I have had side effects like itchy scalp, trouble sleeping, constipation, hot flashes, nausea, etc. These seem to be getting better with time.  I have lost almost 20 pounds since starting the medicine mainly due to a decreased appetite.  I have no interest in food so I have to make sure what I do eat is good for me. It is worth it to tough it out through the side effects.

I added one last week saying I had horrible side effects.  I did and I had to quit taking the meds because I feared I was going to hurt someone or myself.  However it did lessen my pain while I was on it.  So if your thinking about trying it,  I would say at least try it.  I have read the other comments about how much it helped people and if it can work for you with no or minor side effects, go for it.  I would have kept it up if I could have safely done so.  Would be nice to be able to function again.

This medication has changed my life.  I am now pain free, energetic and just overall so much better.  Believe me, in the years I have had FM, I have tried everything.  Even flew to Maryland to see Dr. Titlebaum who wrote &quot;From Fatique to Fantastic.&quot;  Nothing has made a difference like this medication.  I had no side effects when I began taking the medication.  My physician said that 50% of patients would have some of the side effects that have been mentioned in others blogs.  I was fortunate to not have these.  If you do have the side effects, I believe that what the medication can do for you ultimately is worth adjusting, or giving your body time to adjust to the medication.  It's awesome and has changed my life in such a positive way.

After getting off Cymbalta due to the migranes it gave me. I had no side effects while titrating up, or after being on it for some time.  It is very effective in decreasing my pain/stiffness.  My energy is increased and I can do so much more now.  Before I could barely get through my day at work, I would come home and be exhausted. Now I have energy to exercise everyday, this helps to decrease my pain greatly.  I still have bad days, when I have to take a volteran also.  But mostly I am very happy with this medication.  I did go back for a check up after three months of being on Savella, and my cholesterol was EXTREMLY elevated.  She said it was a side effect of this medication.  I was already eating well and exercising to lower my cholesterol, and it was coming down before I started Savella.  I go back for a recheck, but I'm not sure if it will stay elevated.  I'm not sure if anyone else has this problem.  It is the only one I have with this medicine.

This is the only drug I have taken for fibro and Im not on any other medication. At first the side effects were pretty bad, nausea, sweating, chills, my face would flush and turn bright red. However, now that Im on the third week the side effects have decreased. I hardly get as flushed and hot as I used to. I take my doses (two 50mg a day) one in the morning, about 7am and the other about 5pm. Taking the night dose early in the evening keeps me from staying up, I can hardly stay awake past 9pm now. Although I havent noticed a decrease in my pain level yet, my energy level has increased and Im finally starting to sleep through the night. I no longer have brain fog and dont feel like I need a nap at the end of the day. My doc had explained to me that Savella is better for treating the fibro fatigue while Lyrica is better for the pain. To not feel like total crap at the end of the day and getting a full nights sleep has been wonderful. I suggest that anyone on this drug stick it out past the side effects, its does get better.

A must read for all who want to play the guinea pig. On second week now, pain and burn decreasing, appetite is nil, but that was a problem before. Energy level is up by maybe a third. Sweating, insomnia and nausea the primary issues. Hoping these can be managed by  careful dosage adjustments and very slow titration. 50mg seems to to be the tipping point for nausea early on. Try night dose 6 hours before bed to help with sleep. Sweating/hot flashes are really bad. I'm willing to tough this med out as it has potential to help those of us that have had FMS for a long time. Maybe the newly diagnosed with obtain a better quality life much earlier than I have. FMS/MPS since 1988. If its been made, I've tried it!

I just started taking this med for my fibromyalgia, while it helped with the muscle pain, the side effects are horrible for me.  I am now depressed and cry for no reason,  I was not before starting the meds. I have no appetite at all, my family keeps trying to make me eat, but I have no interest in even trying.  My eyes are blurry and so far I have fallen twice from the dizziness.  So now I am in more pain than when I started taking it.  Has anyone else found it hard to even look at food since taking this?  Most of what I have read has been about increase in appetite, not loss of it.  I am thinking about just quitting it now, I can't take this.

Hard to tell since I am on so many meds which are the ones helping the most, although at this time, I prefer to take the Savella in the morning and no lyrica, as that was making me too tired.  I think overall I'm satisfied with Savella, but did take a few months for the side effects to subside.

But now that I have not taken it for a week I realize it did help with the pain and tender, stiff muscles, so I am going back on it.

My fibromyalgia pain and pain from my disk degenerative disease is a little better, but I hope that as I continue on the medication my pain level will keep decreasing. I have not not experienced any loss of appetite, in fact I seem to be eating more...especially sweets.

The only med that helped was Mobic. When I first started the titration pack of Savella I felt less overall pain, with the muscles in the bottoms of my feet feeling less painful.  I also felt more clearheaded.I still have a headache in the morning, and wake up sweating like a pig.  I sweat at every change in temperature or exertion, from my scalp to my feet, while my hands are like ice.  My make-up slides off my face and my hair goes limp and stinks, as does my body.  Savella must affect the hypothalamus or whatever controls body temperature.I continued taking 50mg 2x per day but found myself getting depressed and not doing the things I wanted to do and the things I needed to do.I still sleep only 4 hours and can only be on my feet for 4 hours without having to lie down.  This is no improvement over the Mobic, which is much cheaper.I am disappointed because I had heard of this drug before the FDA approved it and thought the drug companies would have eliminated, or at least reduced, the negative side effects, since it has been on the market in Europe for over 5 years.I hope it works for other people, but I am tapering off as I type.  There has to be a better product to be developed.Good luck to you.

I went through the early stages of doctors telling me it was all in my mind, so I dealt with the pain. Thankfully doctors are now recognizing that this is a true disorder and not just a &quot;mental&quot; issue. It took several yrs before I would discuss this problem again with my dr as I had been made felt that it was &quot;my&quot; mental problem. I tried Lyrica and could not deal with the wt. gain, then Savella came out and I started on 2 50mg twice a day which had to be increased to 100mg 2 x day. I had almost given up when it finaly started working after about 2 wks on the increased dose! Finally, no more pain!!! I never had side effects. I was a bit disappointed that I had to read about 25 comments before I finally saw the positive reports on this review on exactly how wonderful this drug is. So thankful that I did not have the side effects others did. If I had read these reviews before taking Savella, I'm not sure I would have even tried it with the negative side effects that were reported. It has been a miracle for me!!

I have excrutiating pain in both knees and could not find anything to relieve the pain for more than a few hours.  When I began savella the pain was relieved almost immediately.  I have used it now for a little over a month and am astounded at the pain relief it has given me.  The only problem I have is the expense is outrageous.

My doc recommended this med and although as with any med, there are potential side affects, I have found the benefits to outweigh the risks.  Every person is different in their response to meds so one should be very cautios when taking ANY medication and do their research.

I have a clear mind again, energy, stamina and reduced pain. The side effects of nausea, sweating and jitteriness wore off after about 2 weeks. I started the titration pac and currently take 25 mg in the morning and 12.5 in the evening. Occasionally I experience a rapid heart rate and my BP is higher than normal. I feel like I have my life back and can be fairly &quot;normal' again. It has been over 13 years since I've been able to say that.

The only side effect from Savella was my scalp itched for a few weeks!!  It works!  I have so little fibro pain anymore; it's a blessing!!

I was miserable.  I was on it for 4 months.  Side effect weren't bad at 1st then....The sweating was actually embarrassing,it was so bad.  I was covered in bruises for over a month (same bruises that didn't go away).  I had trouble peeing.  Constipation was, at times, unbearable.  My shoulder &amp; neck muscles felt like they were on fire.  I had 24/7 &quot;tension&quot; headaches.  My migraine meds (for when I get one) didn't work.  I couldn't &quot;focus&quot;/concentrate...always felt like I was running in circles...scatterbrained (which cost me a new job, cuz I just wasn't &quot;catching on&quot;).  The only positive thing was that it completely wiped out my appetite &amp; I lost 38lbs...now let's see if I can keep it off...appetite hasn't reappeared yet (cross yer fingers).  I tapered my dose to 1/2 for abt 1 1/2 weeks, then stopped.  Caused a little nausea...other than that, doin ok.  Within 2 days of stopping, no more headache, shoulder &amp; neck muscles somewhat loosened up (prob take a massage to get it back to normal), MUCH more clearheaded (not so...&quot;chicken w/my head cut off&quot;), rest of the stuff easing towards normal.  Been 1week now.  I go back to the prescribing doc tomorrow...yes, I quit w/o telling him 1st cuz I couldn't get in before my already scheduled appt.  So I planned it to be off abt 1week when I saw him again so I could see if things were better &amp; let him know &amp; go from there.

But the side effects of this drug were to much and to dangerous for my body to bear. I have had fibromyalgia for 7 yrs. Was previously on Lyrica which was little help except to take away the flu like symptoms. My doctor decided to try me on Savella. I did the starter pack and worked up to the 50mg dose twice a day. Within one day a lot of the side effects hit me. I began suffering with headaches, chills and hot flashes, sweating profusely(so much so I was drinking tons of gatorade to keep up with the fluid loss),flushing, and I became irritable and hostile. I also got the decrease in appetite along with a bad case of constipation that required me to take stool softners,laxatives, and eat lots of fiber just to go. And when I did go it was so painful. The most drastic side effect was the increase in my heart rate and a massive increase in my blood pressure. Every week I was on this drug it kept rising til I was seen in the ER with a BP of 200/140. No joke. The ER doctor was scared I was going to stoke on him or have a heart attack. They injected me with blood pressure meds in my veins to get it back down and now I have to take blood pressure medicine til I am totally off Savella and my BP is back where it was before. My doctors and I have decided this drug is not worth the risks I have experienced. So now I am decreasing my dosage every week til I can get off this drug. The DT's are fun too. Trust me on that one. Hopefully I will feel more like myself again even if it means I am back to square one with just dealing with my Fibro symptoms on my own without these miracle drugs.

I have fibro and suffer from constant pain. I was taking Prozac for several years and I feel the effect has worn off. My pain management doc encouraged this med. Wow! The side effects are terrible! I noticed it after the first week. I had terror dreams, increase heart rate, night leg cramps, brain fog, terrible sweating and blurred vision. I also had an emotional breakdown. I was crying at a drop of a hat. With all this I actual had a decrease in pain but could not tolerate the side effects. It just is not worth it.   
Other	mcqueen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	10/22/2009 1:00:04 PM	I was given the 2 week tritation pack by a pain doctor for spinal stenosis. Don't know for sure if it's working or if it's the epidurals I have been given twice.  I experienced the hot flushes and excessive sweating on day 2.  I am also in menopause so some of that may be due to it but it is worse than before.  Doctor had me go to just 1 50mg tab/day to see if they improve.  They seem to be a little less but I can deal with that if I'm pain free.  I've also noticed the dreaming but it's not bad. I'm anxious to see what happens when the epidural wears off to see if the savella is working or not.  Doctor said I can go back to trying 2 a day to see what happens.  Was on tramadol for a while and it quit working after a while as did naproxen. Just hoping this works for me cuz the pain was unbearable at times, not in my back so much as in my hip.

I had wiplash 3 times in 3 years in 99. I have been misserable! I also have severe anxiety, have been on 120mg of Cymbalta for 3 years, plus Buspar and Xanax. I also take a med for fast heart rate and was takin Vicodin for pain. In order to start the Savella I had to ween off of the Cymbalta due to Serotonin Syndrome! Since going off my Cymbalta and starting the Savella I feel as though I have completely lost my mind! I feel like crap, no energy and several anxiety attacks a DAY! When I use to only have the attacks a couple times a week! Just over a week ago I brought up the fact that I had done some research on Fibromyalgia and was wondering if this could be my problem. That is when he decided to try the Savella! I'm going to see my Dr tomorrow and I'm hoping that he can help me because I can't stand this feeling of wanting to stay in bed and not do anything but lay there in pain and cry!

My doctor then switched me to Savella (titration pkg). I took that for a week and felt absolutely wonderful; no jitters, no sweating, and best of all...fatigue was gone. However, on day 7, I experienced a mild anxiety attack (which I get on occasion). My heart rate would speed up a bit and then it would pass. However this time it didn't; my heart started to race, I wasn't getting oxygen circulating, my face, hands &amp; arms started to feel icy cold, I had difficulty speaking and moving. My husband took me to ER where they clocked my heart at 210 beats per minute. I was released within a few hours, no problems. I seem to recall that it was a seratonin issue. Needless to say, I stopped the Savella immediately and when I saw my doctor two days later, he put me back on Cymbalta. If I can resolve this anxiety attack issue, then I would love to give Savella another try.

I have reduced my Cymbalta to 60mg. once a day (I had been taking 2 a day) and also still need Lortab 2 or 3 times a day. I take 2 meds for blood pressure and a very small dose of xanax in the eve which helps me sleep. I was taking Ambein but feeling too fuzzy in the morning.

This is the first time I've had no pain in years. Lyrica turned me into a balloon. But Savella...I cried the first 3 days afraid it wouldn't work, cried the next 3 because it did. There is relief before you raise the dose from 12.5. It just gets better from there. It has worked best with NO food 2 hours before or after taking. It is not perfect. Some sleep would be nice but my pain was so bad anyway that Ambien gives me only 3-4 hours continuous sleep. I've lost 4 lbs in 2 weeks due to loss of appetite so make every calorie you injest a healthy one. This medication will get you off the sofa!!! If you've tried Cymbalta or Lyrica and have given up hope of ever having a life again, try one more time. Do it for your family. Do it for yourself.Your life is waiting.

Early headaches and nausea disappeared within 1st month of treatment.  More effective than other medications in relieving pain associated with fibromyalgia.

Cymbalta did not do anything for me and I was on it for 4 months. I have taken Lyrica for at least 2 years and it does help me but not enough. The doctor just up my pain meds to Percocet which I dont want to be on heavy medicine like that but no choice and I am hoping Savella will be it. So far it hasnt made it worse and maybe it will be better, I hope.

JUST RECENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH RA AND HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH SEVERE NECK AND LOWER BACK PAIN. THIS IS DUE TOO BULGING DISCS, HERNIATED DISCS, AND DEGENERATIVE DISCS IN UPPER AND LOWER BACK. I HAVE TRIED CYMBALTA FOR 3 YEARS AND GAINED 60 LBS. GOT OFF CYMBALTA 2 MONTHS AGO. LIVED WITH DEBILITATING PAIN FOR 2 MONTHS WHERE I COULD BARELY MOVE. I DID NOT WANT TO TAKE ANYMORE SSR DRUGS. I HATE THEM AND THE WAY THEY MAKE ME FEEL. MY DR SUGGESTED SAVELL-- I FORCED MYSELF TO TAKE IT BECAUSE I WAS FEELING SO BAD, I AM NOW ON DAY 9 OF THE TRATION PACK. I'M FINALLY FEELING LIKE I'M GETTING MY LIFE BACK. MY PAIN HAS IMPROVED BY 70%. I AM HAVING A FEW SIDE EFFECTS--SOME STOMACH ACHE, NAUSEA AND HEART PALPITATIONS.I WILL DEAL WITH THE SIDE EFFECTS AS LONG AS I'M NOT IN CHRONIC PAIN. FOR ANYONE WHO IS IN CHRONIC PAIN, PLEASE GIVE THIS DRUG A TRY.

I just finished the titration pack so up to 100 mg / day.  I really have not noticed any reduction with pain.  I do have increased hot flashes, major dreaming, a little stomach pain after I take it.  Vomited twice and a little more restless.  I plan to continue to take it in hope that I will find some relief I will live with the side effects.  Tried Lyrica gained 35 pounds in 3 months with no change to eating and it really did not relieve my pain.  So as long as I do not gain weight I will continue on Savella for now.

My Dr was getting very hesitant to let me continue with Darvocet anymore. I tried Lyrica and 2 wks later up 15lbs. Heard about this and begged my Dr. to let me try it. I noticed a lower level of all over pain with the titration pack. Side affects-stomach, severe sweating, nausea are worth continuing with little options. I take neurontin, flexeral..etc.. I am sure my mom had this and now I. I now have acid reflux, IBS, arthritus, Interstitial cystitus, asthma,hypothyroid, 5 day long migraines, degenerative disc disease,bulging lumbar and cervical disc's and allergies up the wazoo! This sucks at 50 I feel 100! It was bad enough when first diagnosed when trying to get disablity the judge said I needed a shrink(pain all in my head) but few meds to get rid of this awfull pain! We with fibro have a pain scale 1-20 as the rest of the world 1-10. Just wish I could remember stuff!

I've only started the 50 mg./twice a day.  I have to say my pain has lessened somewhat but I have been having side effects:  sweating, headache, nausea, diarrhea.  I am going to stick with it after reading testimonials and hope side effects lessen.  I've tried everything else so I am hoping that by giving it time, my body will gest used to it and the side effects will lesson and hopefully go away.  Having to take the med. twice a day is new to me and I have to make notes for myself to remember the evening dpse.  The ratings above are where I am now and I'm hoping the side effects will diminish and I can give a better score.  Blessings to all of you in pain, I wouldn't wish FM on even my worst enemy!

Compared to how I used to feel, like I lost the fight, so sore &amp; beat up I thought I must be going nuts! Lyrica sent me to the ER I was so messed up on it. I have been on every drug for Fibro for over 5 yrs. now I am feeling more human. Please ride out the 1st 3 months of this drug because my experience (RA at 19) with new meds is to give them and your body time to get to know each other. For me so far so good. The dry mouth led to me drinking more water &amp; have not had constipation and also fixed the dry mouth. Be patient and above all tell your Dr. everything. They can't effectively treat anyone who is not on the up &amp; up.

Now, on day eight, I am almost pain free, which has not occurred for me in years, having been diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 1999.  I am so hopeful that this medication will allow me to get my life back, as my pain and fatigue have controlled my life for too long.

Was also experiencing a lot of fatigue over a long period of time. Decided to try Savella because my Rheum seemed very positive about it.      I have had a really bad experience with it. Severe side effects right from the beginning: nausea that was unrelieved by anything I tried for it, headache, chills, hot flashes, crying jags, intense dreaming and constant awakening all night long, diahrreah, and to top it off, my migraine rescue meds seemed to stop working. I stayed on it for 4 days and ultimately decided that something that made me feel as bad as this did could not possibly be good for me. The pain and fatigue are easier to cope with than feeling so sick.    With chronic daily migraines and fibromyalgia, I have tried lots of different meds. Never have I experienced such intense misery from a medication! That said, I have to concede that Savella might be somebody else's salvation. We've all got to keep trying, right?

I have had great success with it so far. When taking the titration pack I did have some of the noted side effects, however I am giving it a chance and on the full dosage, and side effects have diminished. The only thing I still have is the constipation, which I also had with the other drugs. My pain and achiness has decreased and will continue to stay on Savella, the best one I have found to work so far.  Don't Give up in the first couple of weeks, the side efeects will lessen. I was attempted to not try it, when reading other reviews, I am glad I did go ahead and try it.

Savella seems to be working after the two week trial. It lessoned my abdominal, back and all over soreness pain. I hoping the longer I take it the better it will work. Although I still need my pain meds and injections to be able to move my legs. Overall the only side effect I have is sweating (alot) added on to the hot flashes from my hystrectomy 10 years ago. I'm drenched most of the day and carry a towel with me wherever I go

I think this could be my savior. I was admitted to the hospital for depression recently, where we talked intensively about my meds. Lyrica was not working AT ALL. Just making me fat, miserable and sore. I have been on (1)12.5mg for 4 days and (2) 12.5mg for 2 days.I feel less pain already and so far no side effects. If there are any. They can't be as debilitating as the pain was. I was totally imobilized to a point I couldn't and wouldn't go anywhere. Sad, because I had always loved being around people. I have great hope for my savior Savella! Positive thoughts all the way!!!

Once I upped to two pills I am now sleeping most of the night and have NO more numbness or tingling in arms, legs and Head.  I actually sleep pretty soundly most nights.  I noticed the head pain was the first to go almost immediately after me starting this pill.  It has worked wonders for me so far and just pray that it continues to make me feel GREAT and full of energy. I feel like Savella has given me my life back -- I now want to do things and don't feel tired or achy or have pain all over.  I was told by my neuro to gradually increase but I feel so good at just taking two I don't feel the need to increase it at this time.  I take them both before I go to bed at night and it seems to work for me.  I occassionally in the mornings get a little nauseous feeling but it goes away as fast as it comes.  I AM SO THANKFUL THAT I'VE FINALLY FOUND A PILL THAT ACTUALLY HELPS MY FIBROMYALGIA.

It has been a blessing. I have been on for approximately 2 months and I am beginning to have a life again. Difficult to adjust to at first (nausea &amp; mild headache for about an hour after taking), but this subsided after about 2 weeks. Still have &quot;bad days&quot;, but now they are just an occasional day - not several days in a row. I still take Tramadol on very painful days but overall I am extremely happy. I take 200mg of Savella a day. I actually am beginning to feel like exercising and my husband and kids say they can see a tremendous difference in me.

I have a UTI and didn't even know it, it was causing some really bad pains in my lower back, but I also have chronic thyroid disease and have had random back, hip, knee, wrist and general muscle aches on and off for two years or so. I have only taken the first 3 doses of the two week titration pack but I am going to stop taking it, get rid of the UTI and then wait and see what the specialist says when I see him. I'm already feeling really dizzy, ears are buzzing and I really just feel weird. Its 2am and I felt so weird when I tried to go to sleep. If I do try Savella again I will not take it in the evening with dinner, but with lunch instead. I took the first dose without food and felt nauseated, but then I took the other two with a decent meal and it wasn't as bad. My back definitely feels a little better already so I hope its just taking it with antibiotics that is making the side effects so annoying.

Now on day 8. Side effects starting to get better. The first 4-5 days were like the flu: nausea with &amp; w/o food, crazy sporadic sweating, insomnia (waking every 1/2 hour). Everyone says to hang in there and take properly (with food &amp; early am/pm doses to help with insomnia and nausea). I must say the last few days are finally better. Nausea better, insomnia getting better (take 6-8 hrs. before bedtime), sweating much less, pain 1/2 of what it was from head to toe, finally a little bit of energy. Hang in there.

With my doctors suggestion, I decided to try Savella because Lyrica has cause me to gain weight.  I am only on my second week, but the side effects are horrible.  I have profuse sweating and hot flashes, nausea, head aches, irritability  and just a feeling of being &quot;out of it.&quot; The constipation is also bothersome. (I starting taking Miralax to counteract the constipation) I am curious if the side effects lessen as you continue the meds?  I do notice a slight increase in energy and less fb pain and weakness.  I will try to decide if it is worth dealing with these side effects in order to have more energy.  Perhaps this drug is not for everyone with my condition.  Possibly, it does not agree with my chemistry.  So far I am not too pleased, but I am willing to see if things improve.  I will discuss other options with my rheumatologist.

My depression is actually worse, however, but that is because I was taken off of Lexapro, which has always been the most useful for my depression.  I just put this together this week, or made the connection. I'm pretty certain I can take them together as they act differently.Lyrica made me crazy, sleepy all the time, and Cymbalta did nothing.  I was hopeful, and am pleased so far.  Finally...a possible &quot;cure&quot;, although I am not completely off pain meds, but think I will be within another month.I would highly recommend anyone who is diagnosed with FMS to try this medication, even if Cymbalta did not work.  They are similar but not identical.

I had to walk with a cane.  I have been taking Savella for approximately 3 months, and it has been a miracle drug for me.  I am completely off of all narcotic pain medication and muscle relaxants.  I no longer need a cane, and have more energy than I have had in years.

I saw improvement after 2 days.  I hurt very little, only take pain meds, because my back is out and need to go to chiropractor.  I felt like a fog was lifted two days after I started taking it.  I do believe I am not eatting as much, I am more active, more alert, and sleeping better.  It is a miracle drug to me.  The only side effect I have noticed is a queezy stomach once in a while.

I began using Savella about 4-5 months ago.  I weaned myself off twice, and then got back on, thinking my agitation, hot flashes excessive sweating and worse pain was a result of other drugs I was on.  Now I am convinced that many of my symptoms are due to Savella. I have a Dr. appt. today and will inform her that I will no longer take this terrible drug and that I need something to help control this aggravating and overwhelming pain...oh, and even with insurance, one month of Savella costs $80! From what I have read, many other fibromyalgia patients are dealing with the same symptoms I am...and worse!

So far, there has been some restlessness. I found that constipation is not an issue, I eat properly and with fruits and vegetables.I am curious about the interaction with celebrex. I feel more energetic and less throbbing pain. I have very severe arthritis and I think that people who are debilitated by chronic should give this med time and it probably needs more research on the conbination with other drugs. It is well worth the wait and I am happy to have a pain pill for pain itself. I am encouraged and will report back.

I have a wonderful fiance who understands &amp; encouraged me to go back to dr for treatment. My dr has been great to help.Was on Cymbalta &amp; side effects were bad.After several months,neither pain or side effects improved.I am now on Savella.I don't have the side effects I had before and it has helped my pain tremendously! I have more energy &amp; feel better overall. Lots more good days than bad.I finally feel good &amp; can function normally.I'm so thankful to my fiance &amp; dr for their help &amp; support. Savella is a blessing that's given me hope &amp; my life back. For all FM sufferers, The pain is real. You're not crazy! Pls don't give up trying to get the help you need. There is a med right for you that can make a difference.Talk to your dr &amp; family for support.Good luck to all. I wish you the best.

Worked on the pain but nausea, headache, severe dizziness, heart palpitations, and insomnia. It acted on me like anphetamines. I just couldn't take it any longer after I started vomiting after taking. And this was on only 50mg once a day!!!! I have never had such an extreme reaction to a medicine. Was a big surpise for me. Can not function this way.I'll take the pain over the nausea anyday.

I have been on Sevella for 2 months.  It has helped a great deal with pain and stiffness, I can do things again that I had given up hope doing.  The side afects are aweful though.  I have constant headaches(had to go to Urgent Care to have a Demerol/Phenergen shot to break the headache cycle and stop the vomiting last week.) Thought I had the flu I was so sick.  Can't get the headaches to go away, have one everyday, some days worse than others.  Always feel a little sick to the stomach, other days really nauseous.  Has helped with an underlying depression problem though.  I keep having a stiff neck and also have the sweating problems off and on. Keep having upper respiratory infection and sinus infection, can't seem to get over it.  Think this medication has something to do with this issue.  The itchy scalp lasted about a month and finally stopped...tried every shampoo and conditioner on the market thinking it was that only to find it was the medication side affect.  Not sure the feeling sick and the headaches everyday are worth the pain reduction, but after 10 years of living in pain I've just learned to deal with it anyway.  I'm going to ask my doctor to wean me off of this.  Lyrica caused my pain to increase beyond anything imaginable.  Think I'll just go without meds and stick to living in pain again.

This is only my 3rd day.  I was weaned off two other drugs for fibro and just began my tritration pack of Savella.  I am having a difficult time with the side-effects.  I am VERY nauseous and lethargic.  Today I woke up EXTREMELY irritable (not at all fun for my family) and I am living on ginger ale.  I have not had any constipation (quite the opposite) but, have had the scalp itchiness and sweating.  I am trying to be &quot;hopeful&quot; and am not going to stop taking Savella just yet as much as the nausea is making me want to stop!  I am hoping to see a change in my pain and side-effects in the next week.  We will see what happens when I return to work tomorrow.  I was lucky to be home today to deal with the on-coming effects.  Good luck to all of you!

I am on week four of Savella. I do have more energy - jittery energy - and I do get up in the A.M. with less pain BUT - and this is a big &quot;BUT&quot;: my heart rate and blood pressure are up (I take Verapamil and will probably have to increase it), the hot flashes then cold chills make sleep difficult so now I sleep in 90-minute cycles, I have a persistent headache and am horribly constipated. And really nauseated - the type which makes you pray to vomit. You all know what I mean. And the itchy scalp! (Thank heavens it is not just me!) And while I am not foggy, the jitteriness makes it difficult to concentrate so it is the opposite end of the same problem. I am still taking two daily doses of Ultracet and believe me, the titration off that is pretty miserable anyway. So less pain but more other problems. I am not working right now - thank heavens - so I can stay at home. It is difficult to compare this to how bad I used to feel but I do remember sleeping in the bathtub frequently because the fibro pain was so terrible. I think it is worth trying and if you have a good doctor who can help you manage the side effects without too many other drugs with side effects, this may be as good as it gets. I'm also guessing that the &quot;one size fits all&quot; dosage probably won't work for everyone either. But it has to get better than it is today or otherwise it will simply be another drug to cross off the list and I'll go back to Ultracet only.

I had increased energy and less pain from my fibromyalgia.  Then I started having stomach discomfort/nausea whenever I took it.  Now I have to take it only at night just before bed so that I don't get nauseous.  Also, other side effects that I've noticed are constipation and inability to sleep when I take this medicine---I have to take a sleep aid with it.

This drug was great in lowering my pain level but the constipation almost killed me. The only way I could have a BM was to drink the Phosphate stuff. enima's didnt work. Itried everthing, I really wanted to take this MD but I could not get rid of bowel problem. I think they should warn you that the side effects might kill you. I will call FDA because of my bad experience. I am glad to see the great reviews because it really is great and worth the try. just be careful of the sides effects. I had most of the side effects like itching, weight gain, leg pain, sweating, irratabilty. since quiting this md, I have more pain and less side problems.

Savella was strongly suggested by my great rhuemtologist. I'm not sure if all the side effects were the new drug or coming off the old. I had nausea,hot flashes,no appetite, lost weight(good thing) its back now(a bad thing). I wantd to encourage new users. I am less fuzzy, I have more energy, trigger point pain initially was reduced may be similar to before now but I'll take the clarity anytime! I got through the first 30 days by increasing the mg titration slower. With my Dr's blessing I did 25mg longer by cutting the 50's, then I went to 25 in AM and 50 at night, then over a weekend I did the 50/50 and managed not to retrigger the nausua. Soft peppermints and saltines were my friends for over 30 days. I'd be more positive on effectiveness if I had more back pain relief but with the Lumbar facet problem I can't hold it against the med. Ease of use would be higher and I think they should give new users a longer start up time. Give it a 30 day + trial and anyone with the nausea should ask their dr to go slower.

However, things began to get worse in the past 6 months.  My doctor prescribed Savella.  I'm on the 2nd day of 50mg, 2 times a day.  My doctor took the infromation about the side effects out of the titration pack.  that was a great idea.  After reading these reviews, I have had some of the side effects, but my pain is GONE.  I will continue with the Savella.
Other	Dee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	35-44	8/6/2009 3:14:32 PM	When I first began Savella I had a problem with falling asleep on a moments notice. After a week and i was up to 50 mg. twice a day i was fine.  Within the first week of taking Savella i notice all my muscle spasm where almost gone.  Every now an then i will get a small spasm hear or there. But the severe spasms in my arms that created weekness and made my arms feel exhausted where gone.  My side affects are hot and cold flashes. And it has somewhat affected my blood pressure.  It has lowered quit a bit since starting Savella.  Overall. I like how it works.  By the way.  I tryed all kinds of muscle relaxers to stop the spasms and none of them worked.  My diagnoses is severe tendonitis with fybromyalga(SP)

I had no luck with Lyrica or Cymbalta because of the side effects.  The side effects from this med started out as sweating, headache and trouble sleeping.  Then I became extremely depressed and had blood in my stools.  Savella did not relieve my pain at all.  It's only made things worse.  I'll stick to my combo of Lexapro, Trazodone, Vicodin and Flexeril!

Just to see what it did for me, I laid down, felt like I had an electrical storm in muscles with twitches/spasms etc, took Savella, storm quieted down, hang in there folks, the side effects go away then you really feel what the meds are doing for you.  I take it with Lyrica (450Mg/day), the Savella works with Lyrica, but you have to give it time 30 plus days.  I have Fibro and ankylosing Spondylitis.  I did experience strange things, but they pass once your body adjusts to the meds, your nights sweats will lessen, crazy dreams go away, and many other minor things, I have been helped tremendously by the combination of meds, hope this helps others.

I'm hoping the Savella will work because I am so tire of this pain I don't know what to do I feel like cutting some parts of my body off to take the pain away. I am having alot of side effects but not sure if it's from the Savella yet. Lots of sweating for no reason, lightheadness, and other.

The past 3 weeks I have had very excessive sweating. Even while sitting in 72 degree A/C with a fan running on me I sweat profusely. It's very embarassing. Otherwise the drug works wonders for fibromyalgia. It's brought my pain level down about 50-60%.

Savella, along with another new medicine has helped bring the pain back to tolarable-but I had to ask my Dr. to keep me on a low dose because of my other medical problems. The higher dose rose my heart rate and bp to high, and I am already on meds for both of those. I am able to do more than three months ago, but the nausea and increase in heart rate is hard to get around. I have gone from non-functional to very low functional. It is an improvement, I am out of the wheelchair, but I still am unable to much.

My doctor has extended each phase of the levels of Savella to try and avoid the nausea, which I have not had.   Pain is improved-- My side effects have not.  I'm anxious, depressed, have insomnia, sweating, breathlessness, tireness and super irritable all of which the doctor says will get better with time!   I'm going to continue until I have reached the recommended dosage and beyond and pray that the side effects will get better.  Have tried many different drugs all with side effects and no pain relief for Fibromyalgia (other than Vioxx which was taken off the market).  I'm hoping Savella is the new and improved Vioxx!!

It's been AWFUL. Irritability, agitation, insomnia, nervous shakiness, decrease in visual acuity, transient dizziness, constipation, sweating, sensation on skin surface that I am hotter than I really am (hot flashes? which I do NOT need in Texas in July), leg tightness / restless legs (which I NEVER had before), bad acne breakout (I am 42), extreme thirst but finding it hard to stomach some of the juices I normally drink with no problems, eating like a cow, Oh, and did I mention irritability?? And the med has NOT helped my pain IN THE LEAST. I will go back to Lyrica ASAP. They are allowing these meds out onto the market much too soon. They need to know much more about how they affect more people first.

I dont think I can stand the sweating to the dehydration point, frequent unination and the fluid retention. Just took the 50mg and it is worse. I really need to take some weight off and thought this drug will help with pain so I could feel like exercising, live without the brain fog, and be who I would like to be without the pain. Dont think this is the drug for me. The pain is better but I think the side effects are worse than being in pain. 
Disorder characterized by Stiff, Tender &amp;amp; Painful Muscles	SavellaIsGREAT, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/16/2009 11:35:47 AM	Savella works great. But the first week of side effects while titrating are a bit uncomfortable. After that, it's WONDERFUL for energy, pain &amp; brain fog, although it takes a couple of months to see a dramatic improvement. IGNORE any reviews from people who stopped taking it after the first week, because they most likely didn't take it properly &amp; just aren't giving it a real chance to work. Savella isn't a pain pill; it doesn't work instantly. Very important to remember: TAKE SAVELLA EARLY &amp; TAKE IT WITH FOOD; always take it with food. I take it at 5 a.m. &amp; 2 a.m. (for 7 weeks now). If not taken correctly, it'll cause headaches/nausea. Don't give up; just give it at least two months to work.I take my doses halfway through my meals. If you take the second dose too late in the day, it'll interfere with sleep. The second dose should be taken before 2 p.m.Unfortunately, doctors also aren't telling patients that Savella is an SNRI so it SHOULD NOT be taken w/ other antidepressants or it'll make you sick (serotonin syndrome). Take it properly &amp; give it a chance - because Savella helps A LOT for fibro sufferers! Wonderful for pain, energy &amp; fibro fog. TAKE IT RIGHT, AND IT WILL HELP! DON'T DISCOURAGE OTHERS IF YOU DIDN'T TAKE SAVELLA CORRECTLY. IT TAKES LONGER THAN A WEEK TO FULLY WORK. IF YOU'RE NOT TAKING IT LONG ENOUGH, YOU'RE CHEATING YOURSELF!
