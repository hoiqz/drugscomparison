Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	8/29/2012 9:01:10 AM	I have been on multiple pills for the past 10 years and only just started this one about 9 months ago.  It took 6 months for me to get &quot;used&quot; to it but now I know what to expect.  My period starts on day 4 of the placebo pills usually and only lasts for 2 - 3 days and is super light.  I'm always a bit crampy about 1 week prior but don't generally cramp at any other time.  I am much more emotional around period time, have unexplained crying fits, and don't really want to get out of bed.  I am not sensitive to missing a pill for 8 hours or so; I take the pill before bed but if for some reason I forget and don't take it until the next morning my body is fine.  It's okay as far as a pill goes and I have never had a pregnancy scare.

I have irregular cycle with regular flow and I get pms.  Both are much better and I have had great luck with this pill.  It keeps my emotions level and my periods regular.  ***My daughter took it also. She has very heavy periods and with stomach issues and pms.   She has had the opposite experience with it.  It has been horrible for her.  She had severe anxiety mood swings and nausea.  It was so bad she stopped mid cycle on the second month.  She also got a yeast infection.  Its been terrible.  It really depends on the person.  I would recommend this if you have very heavy periods.  But I would if you have very irregular with lighter flow.

I have little to no cramping and my periods last 3-4 days and are pretty light. My period is predictable to the DAY (I was very irregular before the pill). It has also helped with my skin. I have less acne (which runs in my family) and well, lets be honest...I'm not pregnant yet and I've fairly active for years now. I did not gain weight until I started taking pro-zac with it about 6 years ago. Other then that, I'm very satisfied.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	4/28/2012 6:32:47 PM	I was put on regular birth control after developing extremely long periods after the birth of both of my children.  It did the trick of getting me on track, but I then started getting horrible migraines during my periods.  My doctor suggested I try taking Low Ogestrel continuously, skipping the placebo pills and stop having periods and the migraines associated with them.  It took many months for the complete absence of periods to take effect.  It's been a year and a half now.  About every 2 months I get severe cramps and light bleeding.  My doctor instructed me to stop taking the pill for 3 days to &quot;reset&quot; my body.  This does work - at least for a couple more months.  My major complaint is an almost complete loss of libido and it seems hard to lose weight.  I still get migraines, especially when I have to stop the pill every couple of months, but overall it has &quot;fixed&quot; my major problems.

Since I first began taking it, I have never used a back-up form of birth control other than the pill itself.  I've never had one pregnancy scare.  The pill is very effective if you take it everyday at or near the same time.  I love this pill.  It regulates my periods to the tee.  It lasts the same amount of time every month and has for ten years.  As your body gets used to it, you do begin having minor cramping, but nothing severe.  I would definitely reccommend this pill for birth control use because it is very effective in playing the role.  If taken correctly, I do not believe you will get pregnant.  I love this pill and will continue to take it until I am ready to get pregnant.

Can anyone tell a good birth control that wouldn't affect the stomach, like this one does? I've taking birth control from a different country and never had stomach problem. 
Birth Control	LaLoHa28, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/29/2012 3:25:50 PM	I have been on various oral contraceptives for the past 11 years, with varying experiences. Some higher dose medications made me experience 'morning sickness' on a daily basis (woke up every morning at 4am to vomit), while other low dose medications left me with my period for 3 weeks out of every month. Other medications made me extremely moody. This has been the only birth control I've been able to take for 3 years with very few side effects. My periods are VERY regular (starts and ends on the same day every month) and very light (only need to use a tampon one or two days, and then a panty liner thereafter), virtually no PMS, and no pre-menstrual cramps. My only complaints are that it doesn't help clear my skin as other medications might, and that it does negatively impact my sex drive a bit. But I'll trade an occasional pimple and a lowered libido for all the benefits I've experinced with this pill.
Endometriosis	 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	4	4	Female		2/2/2012 3:22:00 AM	I have endometriosis and I get horrible cramps and really heavy bleeding. I've tried a few other pills before but lo/ovral and low ogestrel have worked the best for me by far. I take the pill continuously and when I do take a few days off, my cramps have been so much better and my period has overall been easier to deal with. The only con is that my face definitely breaks out more.

Four months later i was in the ER with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.  I almost died.  That I shouldn't even be alive.  Thank God I am for my 2 kids.  I am now on blood thinners for who knows how long.  They say it was from the birth control pill. Everyone please be careful. Not only on this one but all birth control pills.

I do experience migraines, breast tenderness, light cramps a week in advance, and also a lower sex drive.

If a woman really wants to know how a pill will effect her, she needs to get her hormones checked before taking a pill! I have low progesterone , so I am estrogen dominant. I NEED high progesterone. This pill is wonderful because it has just what I need. If I had been put on any other pill with high estrogen I would gain weight and be in big trouble. The pill is 5 $ on my insurance and works fantastic. Light periods, no cramping, very safe.
Other	Patti, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/4/2011 11:28:46 AM	I am 55, have been taking these pills since I was 30 for breast tumors. I have been taking them without the placebo pills. No periods unless I miss a pill or two. I feel great, no side effects at all. My Dr wants me off now because of my age. I did stop 3 weeks ago and now feel horrible. Tired, weak at the gym, NO sex drive at all, and now it hurts to have sex. I have begged her to put me back on. She wants to try hormone therapy instead. I have no risk factors for a stroke. Im have 3 months worth of pills left I am going back on Sunday. I f I have to I will buy them online. I feel the pros outweigh the risks for me!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	10/24/2011 4:41:43 PM	I switched to Low-Ogestrel after basically having two periods a month on Microgestin. Low-Ogestrel did an excellent job of controlling my periods, they were very light, little cramping, and only lasted 3-4 days. I have always gotten pimples now and then, but over the 4 months that I took this pill, I developed severe acne; nothing like I have ever had before, my face was covered. I would not recommend this to anyone who is concerned about their skin flaring up.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods		5	5	5			10/3/2011 1:07:16 AM	I am 21 years old and have been taking this pill for years now. I have not had any problems. I often do not take it with breakfast and it does NOT make me nauseous. I never have spotting in between periods. I did not gain weight when I started taking this pill. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to other women. Easy to take and no terrible side effects!!

I get a little moody and sensitive right before my period starts but other than that I'm fine. No weight gain, so severe cramping, no sickness. Great pill. Had to switch because my pharmacy stopped carrying it-wish they didn't

I really enjoyed using this pill to regulate my period and as a form of birth control.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	5/16/2011 7:05:10 PM	Low-Ogestrel worked great for me since I've been using it for about 8 months . I had no symptoms besides getting a bit more emotional a week before my period. When I missed the pill, I would take both the next day and would not have any extra bleeding besides my period, which was lighter since taking this. It has lowered my sex drive significantly though, and I am in my lower 20s, it should be high. Once I stopped taking it about a month ago, my sex drive went back to normal.
Birth Control	19-24	3	4	1		19-24	5/14/2011 10:31:03 PM	I only tried this BC for about 2-3 months and realized it was god awful. It made my acne go crazy and my anxiety went CRAZY. Would not recommend. I had better luck with both of these things on Desogen, but had other problems. I am going on Yaz next and hoping that works.
Endometriosis	RitaT1219, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	5/13/2011 2:08:51 AM	I have been taking low ogestrel for about a month and a few days now and it's been alright. I was diagnosed with Endometriosis so my doctor prescribed me Sprintec because my insurance doesn't cover birth control. The first month was okay, but then i bled every single day for the whole second month so my doctor switched me to low ogestrel. After two weeks of the new BC, the bleeding finally stopped (5 weeks total), but now I am having sever breast pain on the sides. It hurts the worst in the mornings and the pain is so unbearable that it is very difficult for me to wear a bra. Is this normal?
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/23/2011 10:32:10 PM	I have been taking Low-Ogestrel for five years. It has worked great rarely with break through bleeding. It is definitely sensitive to missing a pill, I find that I will start to bleed that day. As far as symptoms go; PMS starts about a week ahead of time but I've gotten used to it. Mood swings are not severe and I have never gotten any type of cramping. Of course hunger and breast tenderness are included in the symptoms, but these are also not severe. I did notice being extremely tired the first week of pills after your period, one serious con for me. I have not gained weight either.  I would recommend this for someone who wants to take the pill for birth control reasons only, I do not have bad skin or heavy periods and did not when I originally got on the pill. 
Birth Control	clealea1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/3/2011 12:45:08 PM	I was taking this BC for 3yrs with no problems or side effects at all. It is a pill that finally works without making me irritable and moody with no weight gain as well. I got off the pill to have another child and now it has been 6wks since my delivery, I am going back on this pill. This is the only pill that has really seemed to work for me. I highly recommend this!
Painful Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	2/21/2011 4:04:24 AM	I've been on this pill for a little over two years now, having switched from Ortho-tricyclen because I was getting migraines on that. Well, Low Ogestrel was fine in the beginning for having my period on time and making the cramps less noticeable but recently I've had crazy mood swings while on it, rough cramps, horrid bloating, and noticed some patches of discoloration on my face. I'm hoping to find something else on my next doctor visit. If not, I might just go off of bc pills altogether for now.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	valkyrie, 19-24 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	2		19-24	1/31/2011 6:42:31 PM	I started taking this when I was 17. I had tried about a dozen other kinds and I had really bad reactions to them or they didn't fix my periods(3 weeks of bleeding/extreme cramps). I took this birth control consecutively(3 weeks of active and skipped the inactive pills and started new active pack). That was the only way to stop the crazy bleeding. I tried changing every so often but as soon as I started something else, I'd start bleeding and wouldn't stop for weeks(my version of period) so I'd switch back. I'm not sure when the mood swings/crying over everything started but I remember it happening when I first started taking it(everyone chalked it up to being a hormonal teen). I'd pretty much thought it was me(that I was kinda crazy) until I got health insurance back and my new DR changed me to loestrin 24 fe. I love it(unfortunately I have to switch to generic version of loestrin 24 due to outrageous price brand name) I didn't realize how crazy and bad everything was because of the birth control until I switched. I was angry or upset(even sometimes depressed) All the time and My mood swings were so bad you'd think I was bipolar. I gained 40 pounds on it(I have started losing weight taking loestrin and I've been on it less than a month). I was tired all the time and my left breast got a cup size bigger than the right and it's really noticeable. Not everyone reacts the same on everything but for me, this pill ruined my life for years(and I was too dumb to realize it was). My boyfriend and I were supposed to get married when I turned 18 but after I started taking the pill I became so crazy he didn't want to marry me. I never even realized how bad I was either. I'm not saying this pill will make everyone this bad, I'm just saying be careful. You might not even realize how bad it is until it's seriously caused problems. Everyone has noticed a difference since I changed. I'm even getting married to me boyfriend next month(finally).
Endometriosis	SloanSl,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female		12/20/2010 3:41:01 PM	I switched from Lo-EstrinFe 24 because I had been having significant hair loss. My doctor prescribed Lo-Ogestrel to save my hair. I've only been taking it a month and have been extremely irritable, moody, and I can't stop eating. Before on Lo-Estrin I was perky, cheerful and not worried about eating every time I encountered food. This BC is not worth the excessive moodiness. I'm switching back to Lo-Estrin for the sake of my mental health.

Birth Control	sarah_1221, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/8/2010 3:16:11 PM	It's been about 8 years since I was on bc pills.  At that time I was on Lo Overal and had no problems whatsoever.  So the generic version seemed like a perfect choice.  Not so much.  I have been incredibly emotional, terribly fatigued, hungry all the time and nauseous.  I constantly have a feeling of sadness and hopelessness and have been anything but productive at work.  It's no wonder it prevents pregnancy.  I don't even want to be around people and I'm certain they don't want to be around me on this pill! Maybe it works for some, but if you're experiencing these types of symptoms, rest assured that it's the pill...not you!

Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	13-18	10/25/2010 7:54:30 PM	I have been using this pill now for 2 months after switching from Necon. I got off of Necon because I had breakthrough bleeding and my doctor thought this pill would be better. Well it's worse. I'm nauseous, moody, and tired all of the time and now in my second month of taking it I have horrible cramping and breakthrough bleeding. I'm completely unhappy with my BC experience so far and I'm beginning to wonder if there is anything out there.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	10/15/2010 1:52:34 AM	I had my baby boy last November, and about 6 weeks later went on Low-Ogestrel. My periods before were about 5 days. Taking BC they last 7, but some days I don't bleed much at all. I used to get really bad cramping before using this BC, but now they are just mild cramps that I hardly notice. I don't think they have made me gain weight, but they have caused me to be more irritable than before. 
Birth Control	edgondrez, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/26/2010 5:08:04 PM	I have been on so many birth controls and none seem to work for me. Most of them my body rejected them or severe weight gain and bloating. Now that I am on low ogestrel I am very satisfied indeed, my body feels normal for once no stomach cramps in between periods or anything. Its awesome to feel normal again. I would recomend this to any woman out there that have a hard time with birth control. :)
Birth Control	als143, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	7/15/2010 12:32:07 PM	I was previously on ortho tricyclen lo, and my periods were coming early every month, only about a 2 1/2-3 week break in between. So my doctor switched me to lo-ogestrel. Needless to say, they definitely stopped the early periods. They are very regular now and very short for the most part. The only down-side is, I never previously had menstrual cramps, fatigue, irritability, and this BC seems to cause all of them. The symptoms aren't too bad, just not really what I'm used to. I'll be sticking with lo-ogestral.

Very effective and light periods that are very predictable.  -1 on ease of use because every time I take the pill my stomach cramps and I feel as though I am going to throw up (nausia) this feeling does not last long.  -1 on satisfaction because I don't always like the way that it makes me feel, slightly down, tired, irritable, night sweats, and bloated.  I have not found the right birth control for me but for now it gets the job done, too afraid to switch

Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/6/2010 1:26:01 AM	This is my current birth control and I love it!!  I used to have full-body cramps (I sometimes could feel the roof of my mouth cramping - not fun) and after a terrible run-in with an ill-prescribed bc, my doctor prescribed this to me and within a month my cramps were gone, as were my extreme mood shifts and hemorrhage-like bleeding.  My periods are so light that sometimes I can wear a petite tampon on what used to be my heaviest day!  The only problem I'm running into now is that it's becoming *too* strong at controlling the flow and I've missed my last period.. hopefully I don't miss this one as well or I'll have to find an alternative... :/
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/3/2010 2:22:35 PM	I took this for 5 years and it worked perfectly, I loved it. I switched doctors when I moved and the new doctor switched me to Loestrin 24. It was terrible! After taking it for 2 months I was miserable. I switched back to low-ogestrel and I am really glad I did!
Birth Control	anonymous,  Female 	5	5	4	Female		5/28/2010 12:42:27 PM	I switched to this birth control about a year ago after the previous birth control made me extremely emotional.

Birth Control	NoMoreBCP!, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	4/15/2010 11:00:26 AM	I'm 30 yrs old, started BCP's after my second son was born (about 2 1/2 yrs) for birth control purposes and regualting my periods.  I was very abnormal.  started this BCP about 4-5 months ago after going through severe depression with my last pill.  The first 1-2 months, it seemed to be fine.  All my symptoms seemed to start decreasing and going away within the first 2 months... BUT... after about the 3rd month, they're back... irritability over the dumbest things, moody, exhaustion -there was one day that I actually could NOT get out of bed - slept almost 16 hrs!, vaginal itching and discomfort, night sweats, hot flashes, severe headaches and lasting several days (at least 2 to 3 times a month), prefer to not associate with anyone, sex drive isn't as low as it was on the last pill but still pretty low on the scale, I don't feel &quot;right&quot;, almost like my life is spinning out of control, feel like I can't talk to anyone about it, weight gain - not so much, but I have a family of 4 plus a full time job and I haven't felt productive in months, almost as if life is passing me by and I can't seem to figure out how to enjoy it anymore.  Bottom line - went to GYN, let him know my sysmptoms - he said I was headed for early menopause and needed to gain control of this.  So he prescribed a new pill. Honestly, after hearing I may be headed for early menopause because of these BCP's, don't think I'm taking ANY anymore.  Sure it helped prevent pregnancy and my periods were ok  until the last couple of months - they've been late.  BUT... Living life and actually enjoying it is more important to me.  My husband and I talked and agreed that I am stopping the pill completely and immediately!

I noticed during the third month that I became increasingly agitated and moody. Currently, my mood swings have increased dramatically, to the point where I am having difficulty being productive and am avoiding contact with people. I plan on talking to my doctor tomorrow to see if I can switch to a lower-hormone pill.

I have taken 5 other birth control pills in the past, including Yaz, Ortho Tri-Cyclen and Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo. Of all of those medications, this one has caused me the least number of side effects. In fact, I don't have any side effects at all from it. I went from heavy bleeding to almost no bleeding at all, which is very beneficial for someone who is being treated for endometriosis. I highly recommend it.

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	happy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/30/2009 9:07:11 AM	I have tried many pills over the past 10 years and have NEVER been able to tolerate one! I thought that the pill is just not for me. Then due to endometriosis and super heavy periods, and anemia, my doctor backed me into trying the pill again. I DID NOT want to do it because I never had luck w pills.  I have to say I love this one!! I am so shocked that I have had ZERO side effects! :) Well, occasional tender breasts but no big deal. There is a pill for everyone, so if one doesnt work with your body chemistry, try another combination of hormone pills.  I am in love with this one.
Birth Control	Care Bear, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	10/27/2009 7:01:12 PM	HORRIBLE! I had an awful time on this BC. I am 30 years old, and I had previously been on Mircette for 4 years, took 2 years off from BCP, and then started on Low Ogestrel, as this was on my insurance. Emotionally I was extremely moody - very anxious, then angry, then crying and I had no idea why. I also had alot of bloating, nasuea, and swelling. I was so uncomfortable and driving my poor boyfriend crazy with the mood swings! :( I decided to go off this crazy pill immediately once I realized it was affecting my life so negatively. I hope if there is anyone else out there with a similiar experience - that this helps you! 
Birth Control	ahollowcut, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/29/2009 7:37:02 PM	I have been taking Low-Ogestrel for over 4 years, and never once had a problem.  Within 2 months my irregular period was now like clockwork.  Had no side effects, no weight gain, mood swings etc.  If you are a scheduled person (can take the pill at the same time every day) this will work well for you.  Plus it comes in a different package than those stereotypical pale pink circular containers, so it's pretty discrete!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	5	3	Female	25-34	9/17/2009 6:41:04 PM	I've been on this pill for two months now.  This pill made me very nauseous the first month and then noticed that I started losing more hair than usual.  I've read that Low Ogestrel does cause hair loss.  Still waiting for the benefits of the pill to kick in.

I have been prescribed this BC pill for fertility treatment this is the first step my specialist is starting me with.  Do take thyroid meds for underactive thyroid.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/21/2009 10:33:52 PM	I had been on 2 other pills before being prescribed this one. I have had zero side effects. My period starts to a clock every month, and it's light, and short! Amazing. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	7/26/2009 8:28:41 PM	I'm a 23 year old female (obviously), never had children.  Been on this pill for about 6 months.  Went on it for two reasons:1) Irregular/missed periods2) Contraception PurposesIt has been very effective regulating my periods.  I get them on the third placebo pill, every month, like clockwork.  They use to be horribly painful, and I now only get occasional moderate or light cramping, with MUCH lighter and shorter periods (3-4 days).So far so good as a contraceptive.  I am in a monogamous relationship, and therefore this is my only means of protection.  The only issue I've had is that it caused some nausea, particularly when I haven't been RIGHT on time with it (few hours late or something).  Overall, a very good pill.
Endometriosis	flchewy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	25-34	7/24/2009 8:26:44 AM	Before judging the medication, please understand I have only been on it for a week. SO far I have had headaches everyday. One in particular that turned into a migraine. On day two, light spotting started to happen, its been pretty consistent but very light. Im sticking with it. I will try and post again in a couple of weeks. Hope this is not unusual.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	7/13/2009 7:15:44 PM	I started taking the pill primarily for birth control but also largely for difficult PMS. Since taking Low Ogestrel, my periods are much shorter, lighter and predictable, and cramps are not half as bad as they used to be. But it hasn't made much difference in my mood swings, breakouts, and bloating. Overall I am satisfied with this medication but may eventually switch to a different pill or even an IUD.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	6/20/2009 6:36:55 PM	this pill is awesome for preventing pregnancy
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	finally!, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	6/18/2009 9:52:57 AM	I switched te Ogestrel 28 after having *extremely* heavy periods.  I tried various bcps before this, Yaz, Yazmin, Alesse, etc.  Nothing helped. This pill helped me in one month!  I take 3 packs in a row, with no periods, then I take the placebo pills for a week before taking 3 months in a row again.  This pill was a lifesaver-- I was very anemic before, and this has helped that as well.  Unfortunately, I gained about 10lbs with this pill, but overall, it it worth it.

Absence of Menstrual Periods	maslismuas, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	3/31/2009 3:28:50 AM	I haven't had a period since I was a girl and I've been wanting to have a period because I thought not having a period would be unhealthy for a women. I follow what the Dr. tells me and she say on my last week of the pack (which the pills were red) I should start my period and I did. This medication works for me I was happy that I had my period. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	2/26/2009 10:32:33 PM	This is the generic to Lo-Overal. I was on this medication for 10 months. I switched to this because my other brand caused a lack of sex drive. The Dr that prescribed this was a family dr. and not an OBGYN. Unfortuntely she pretty much went eenie meenie miney moe to pick this for me. My side effects made me think something was wrong with me as I had severe depression, tired all the time no matter how much or how little sleep I got (normal for me is 9 hours but sometimes 15 wasn't enough and 6 definitely wasn't enough), lack of concentration, couldn't sit still for more than 10 minutes at a time, weight gain of 40+ pounds, EXTREME moodiness (mostly anger/crabbiness), and I did not feel in control of myself. My family has a history of thyroid and other medical problems so we all thought it was that; however, after doing tests and bloodwork, all results came back normal. That's when realization hit that it was this med. I switched birth controls after going back to my old OBGYN (I quit going to that family Dr) and he explained that just because the drug says &quot;Lo&quot; in the name doesn't mean it's low hormone for today's times. (Maybe it was low about 20 years ago.) After switched to a different BC that was more fit for me, my symptoms started going away within a week and completely went away after a month or two. After a couple of years of being off of this med, I still haven't lost the weight or gained the sex drive back, but at least I feel in control of myself again.

Birth Control	JLA1011, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/30/2008 11:30:59 PM	I recently switched to another birth control pill after several years on this one and I regret it! I was on low ogestrel for several years with no pregnancy, short (only 2-3 days)periods, very little cramping and very regular periods. I find it easy enough to take a pill everyday, so it was easy for me. I have nothing bad to say about this medication! I'm switching back as soon as I can...
