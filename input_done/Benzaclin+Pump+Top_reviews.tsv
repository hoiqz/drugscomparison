Also because this product is very drying I've noticed that my already oily T-Zone has become oilier than a french fry because it needs to produce even MORE oil to deal with the flaky dryness of my skin. I use this product religiously and I expected to see great results because my pediatrician prescribed it to me but I guess I just expected too much from this product. And although the price is good, I'd gladly pay double it to get a product that makes my skin completely clear and not uncomfortably dry.
Acne		4	5	4			4/17/2011 3:19:03 PM	this product is great for red pimples but not so much fr blackheads and whiteheads they tend to always come back and i have to squeeze them to get rid of them.  as far as the drying and redness goes i have very sensitive skin and this medicine has not dried out or hurt my skin at all and i have been using it for years
Acne	xsandoss, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	12/3/2010 10:26:31 AM	I love benzaclin, and have been using it for years.  I have had great results, and if I get acne now, it's usually because I've been slacking on taking care of my face. Be careful because this stuff will bleach your towels and sheets if you aren't careful!

Acne	smiley, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	19-24	4/10/2010 9:40:09 AM	I started using it and it worked great then after a while it made my face so red and sunburnt feeling. I tried to moisturize which only made it worse. Now everything that i have used since this product that i have used before and has not bothered my face turns it really red and irritated. 
Acne	XD, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	13-18	2/26/2010 9:17:08 PM	I first used this when I was 13 and the doctor prescribed it to me. I had such bad acne but it cleared up pretty fast. Within 3 months my skin had improved significantly.  I'm 16 now and I still use it although not as often because I have less acne, and it can be very drying. Keep the skin well-moisturized if you use this.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/13/2009 11:35:00 PM	This is amazing!! I noticed results within the first week, it plateaued for a few months and made my face very tight and dry.  I have sensitive skin and lotions made it burn, but over a year later it has worked wonders, no itching, burning, and best of all no acne! It has even helped with some previous scarring! 
Acne	Lynn, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/29/2009 2:57:13 PM	This medication has done wonders for my face. The very first week of using it, I saw minute small results. Heading into my second week I was totally blown away. I was seeing the acne dry up and disappear. Now it does make your face very tight and SUPER dry, but it is so worth it. I was able to wear it with makeup. I also used cocoa butter to rid away the scars while using it at the same time. I have only been using it for about give or take 3 weeks and my face is free from pimples. Just use it faithfully and correctly and you will see results. Now it may not work for everyone, but for those it will, trust this medication. What amazes me most about the product is it says results will show in a couple of weeks, but before i was reaching the second week it worked. And the second week just got better and better. I recommend this to anyone who wants to get rid of the acne. It really works and i'm just excited to have my skin back to normal!

Acne	kredneck71, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	4/27/2009 3:36:17 PM	This topical cream as worked wonders for my daughter. She has been on it for only two weeks and the difference is like night and day. It has dried her skin out but a good lotion has fixed that, well worth it.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	4/14/2009 11:19:24 AM	I am just now starting to see results today. But I have to say it is really starting to clear my skin up very well. I have to say at first it dried out my skin ALOT.. I also had a lot of peeling skin. But its starting to pay off. I suggest using a good lotion with this. Cant wait to see more results. 
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	3/31/2009 5:25:33 PM	Well I just started using this medication. Its maybe been about 2-3 weeks. I also use this in conjunction with tazorac. It does make my skin very very dry. Hope thats cause its working. Will give a update in a few more weeks. 
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/4/2009 3:18:23 PM	I have both adult onset cystic acne and acne vulgaris. I've used this cream in conjunction with Tazorac (topical) and Adoxa and had unbelievable results!!  Even after discontinuing the use of the Adoxa from time to time, the BenzaClin continues to keep my skin pretty clear. I've tried everything out there except for Accutane and this stuff finally worked for me.
