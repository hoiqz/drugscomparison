I never used a laxative, so I tried Overnight Correctol. I have had HORRIBLE diarrhea, weakness, nausea, and cramps all day...I feel like death! Don't use this product...go for a tea that is more natural and gentle!

I tried this product around 5:00 in the afternoon.  I did not have a bowel movement until I got to work, which was 8:00 the next day with severe cramping and feeling weak.  This stuff is not gentle.  I took two pills as the directions stated.  I will never take this product again.

Incomplete or Infrequent Bowel Movements	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/6/2010 5:20:08 AM	I typically have normal BM however, because I was sick with bronchitis for 2 weeks I could not work out and I didn't have a BM for 3 days. I came home and decided to take 2 Correctols thinking this will help my system get moving. I regret this decision so much now. Within 2 hours of taking the pills I suffered SEVER cramping and nothing was coming out. My boyfriend found me in fetal position on the bathroom floor screaming in pain. Afer about another 2 hours I had a BM and vomitted several times. I was finally able to control the pain and went to sleep.  The next day I woke up with SEVER cramping again. this cramping has 3 days.. I will never ever ever take this stuff again. They should really pull it off the market! 
Incomplete or Infrequent Bowel Movements	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	2/19/2010 8:42:48 PM	I had not had a BM for over a week, and I was not feeling well in the bowels as a result.  I took one pill - someone recommended it, saying it works for him just fine.  But not me.  I took it before bed at night and woke up inthe early morning with severe symptons, thankfully my partner was there who almost called the ambulance. I felt hot and was sweating uncontrollably, I was cold to the touch though.  I was so weak I couldnt get myself up off the floor, or off the toilet after having diarhea.  I had the dry heaves as well.  I thought I was dying, never in my life did I feel so sick and so awful.  Next time I will just deal with it till I have a BM.  I would like to note that I regularly eat high fiber foods and have a very regular system.  So I only resulted to this as a last result, and I regret it.  24 hours after taking the pill I am still feeling sick to my stomach.

Incomplete or Infrequent Bowel Movements	MM, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	7/6/2009 3:12:18 PM	This drug is horrible.  After taking one tablet at about 4 p.m. I woke up around 2 a.m. sweating, in tremendous pain, nauseated and disoriented.  I thought I was having a heart attack.  I cannot believe this drug is on the market stating  &quot;for gentle, dependable overnight relief.  The FDA needs to re-evaluate this drug and its side effects

I may go several times but at least I'm not constipated.  Probably take once a week or less.

Just have to watch your timing when taking it.  There is slight cramping when it starts to work.  I have felt much better afterwards.

To my surprise not only did I experience severe cramping, but I was nauseated and vomited several times.  I had the worst experience using this product.  Will never use it again and would not recommend it to anyone. I only took 2 tablets. 
Emptying of the Bowel	Elizabeth, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/18/2008 3:23:18 PM	I used to take Correctol back in Febuary and March of 2007 for occasional constipation. This was before I developed Chronic Constipation. I would take 1 tablet at night or one tablet in the morning usually after I ate a meal. It was very effective in the beginning. I usually would have a bowel movement within 6-12 hours. This laxative definetly causes naseau before it causes a bowel movement just like Dulcolax.Not intended for longterm use. Do not use more than a week. Can cause diarrhea and bloating. I definetly recommend this laxative for occasional constipation and overnight relief.
