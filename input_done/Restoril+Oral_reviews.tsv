Chronic Trouble Sleeping	andy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	35-44	7/11/2012 8:30:29 AM	I have had trouble sleeping since i was a baby.My mother used to say she would come and check on me in the middle of the night and I would be wide awake sitting in my crib.I have tried over the counter and ambien with no results. Now with Restoril i can get a full nights sleep, which has made a huge difference at work for me.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Josh, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	6/22/2012 7:57:37 PM	I've had trouble sleeping for a few years now. I would go to sleep at 1 AM, cannot fall asleep, get up for another hour or two, finally go back to bed, and then fall asleep around 4-5 AM. But, I would have to get out of bed at anywhere from 9 AM - 1 PM. That said, was only getting anywhere from 3-6 hours of sleep. I also use a FitBit Ultra (it has other uses) which for sleeping purposes, tracks my motion, how much I move, not brain waves, unlike Sleep Managers like Zeo.  That said, after 1 night of Restoril I went to bed at 1:30 AM, fell asleep, for once! I didn't keep waking up like I normally do between 6:30-8:30 and slept until 10 AM, woke up, then fell back asleep for another hour. When it was all said and done, my FitBit said I was in bed for 9 hr 36 min and slept 8 hrs 17 min. This is a HUGE improvement, even after 1 pill. My doctor gave me 2 refills. I will update later. I do obviously have a lot of sleep to catch up on.  Like others have reported, though, after my first usage, I felt groggy and hung-over.  That said, this pill to me is like 1 1/2 bottles of red wine minus the calories.  I can't wait to sleep more!

I think i might need both of them. How crazy. I just am so tired of not being able to sleep good or at all.So maybe this drug would work better if i was taking my ativan  and this . Will talk to doctor so i hope.I WANT SLEEP! But i also have had numerous back surgeries and even that pain medicine keeps me awake

Dr. switched me from ambien to temazepam. First night made me feel hung over and groggy. The next few nights went well. I take 2 mg of xanax about a 1/2 hr before taking the 15mg of restoril. Some nights I get great sleep, and other times still can't get to sleep or I wake up several times during the night. I am so frustrated, and I panic about not being able to sleep. My mind wont shut off. I dont even know what to do anymore. This is consuming my life and detremental in every way. I have no idea what to do anymore!

You will experience  5-5 1/2 hours of restful sleep with some pretty interesting dreams.  If you can, use it 3x a week, it is habit forming.  But if you can't sleep take it every night, sleep is more important than a habit and everyone needs a least one vice ; )

I don,t feel as rested the next day . The flurazepam was much better as i did not reawake nearly as much and felt much more relaxed the next day.

Most of my doctors were reluctant to prescribe sleep meds although I needed them badly.  Finally, tried every one out there, and none worked.  Restoril is an old-time drug which was prescribed by my 60-something sleep specialist.  And, thankfully, it works.  Although, after a month I am developing a tolerance.  I also still get NO N3 sleep (restorative) despite CPAP and meds, over a 2 year period with 3 sleep studies.  That is discouraging.  No restorative sleep even with Restoril.

However, I was on it for several months and I noticed that I was more and more out of it during the day, my memory started to fade, and I couldn't concentrate at work.  I would find myself staring into space at my desk, and I couldn't focus on any one task.  I weaned myself off of it and am now combining Tylenol PM and melatonin, and it's working very well. I must say that Restoril had  fewer side effects than Ambien or Lunesta - those made me really irritable the next morning and almost angry.  It was scary.

I can take this drug and still function very well for up to 2 hours. I do finally fall asleep but am not sure if it is from the drug or just finally relaxing enough to fall asleep. I do awaken frequently during the night even though I am on 30mg of restoril.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	AViciousOne, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	2/3/2010 12:46:04 PM	The medication does help me sleep through the night, though I don't fall asleep any quicker. I have, however, had some very serious problems with short term memory loss, doing things without knowing it (e.g. driving to the bank, eating an entire bunch of bananas) and problems with confusion that lasts throughout the entire day. I've settled on taking it only on weekends, and a different medication during the week

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Linda, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/28/2010 1:08:38 PM	I have been on antidepressants for 10 years that I take at night for sleep.  I usually experience broken sleep.  I have taken 30mg Restoril on an as needed basis and I can tell you that it works wonders for me.  I hadn't taken it for one year and recently I had a family crisis.  Well, of course, my anxiety roared at night with worry and I've been taking Restoril for 4 nights.  I'm annoyed at this but need to let it take it's course.  It's a great sleep aid for those whose bodies can adapt to it.  Good luck to everyone....you have compassion and are in my prayers.  God Bless You

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	tiredgal, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	1/27/2010 9:54:19 PM	I have tried Restoril 4 times in the past 3 months. Each time, I wake up WIDE AWAKE after 5 hours. I cannot go back to sleep. I feel fairly refreshed but look tired all day, am exhausted by the end of the day. The interesting thing is that the next night, if I do not take it, I cannot go to sleep (I usually have no trouble going to sleep) I toss and turn all night and wake up feeling very tired and irritable. Based upon my experiences, I would not recommend this drug.

If I eat dinner, then there is no effect at all. So I eat an early large lunch and skip dinner if I want to sleep. For some reason, I have a high tolerance to meds in general, whether it be otc pain relievers or cold tabs. Even ambien, which works fairly good for many people seems to only slightly work. I even took 20 mg and pretty much felt normal. On the other hand, my husband can take a vitamin and swears he has more energy days later. Why is my resistance so high? I do not have a history of taking many meds, so this is baffling. 
Other	75 or over Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		9/27/2009 4:29:11 PM	My husband who is an MD and I think this drug is wonderful.   We always take it on long, overseas plane trips, sleep well and wake up refreshed and alert.  When not traveling we only use it occasionally.   Always works for us.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Karen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	9/21/2009 10:31:43 AM	With Fibro and bilateral hip replacements, pain and RLS has prevented me from a restful nights sleep for years.  I was constantly tossing and turning trying to find a position that didn't hurt.I took Ambien for a while, but recently I began waking up after an hour or so and usually ended up in the kitchen eating.  And I could always feel the pain (everywhere) even though I was sleeping.  I finally asked my doc for Restoril (30mg)last week and I have had some of the best night's sleep than I've had in years!!  Restful sleep helps in pain management for Fibro, so hopefully this will improve too.

My anxiety spiraled out of control really rapidly and I was having trouble stopping my racing thoughts at night. I found xanax left me really smacked out and then tried seroquel and had a raging appetite as well as akathisia and tremors... I've been taking temazepam (restoril) for about 3 weeks now and have been sleeping incredibly well but I'm starting to worry about some of the worse side effects eg. blurred vision. Has anyone else experienced this sort of side effect with restoril? otherwise, it's great

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	sleeplessinAZ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	8/15/2009 11:46:49 PM	I suffer from major migraines so am unable to sleep at night.  I was on Lunesta and then Ambien CR which after a few months both quit working.  I've been using this medication (30 mg)for three nights and I've had to take my tranquilizer and muscle relaxer in order to fall asleep.  This takes over 2 hours to work.  I will be asking my dr to prescribe something more effective for me.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Mike, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	6/25/2009 10:20:56 PM	I was falling asleep easily enough, but would always wake at around 1:30 am and then every 20-30 minutes afterward, making a good night's rest impossible. I take 30mg and it has greatly aided me in sleeping through the night - because it's for temporary relief, I did not take it last night to see if I could do without it and was back to the constant waking.  When taking Restoril I do feel slightly groggy in the morning when I wake, but it wears off quickly one you're up and moving.  I'll gladly accept that over the effects of chronic sleep deprivation.  I have had no experiences with sleepwalking or any other negative effects while taking this.  It does state that the med is for temporary use, so I still need to work on the root cause of the waking, but I am highly satisfied with the short-term benefit.  This medicine may not be the one for you if you have a hard time falling asleep - I can stay awake for quite a while after taking it if I'm working on something that holds my attention.  This is more for maintaining sleep duration than for falling asleep, whereas Ambien will help with falling asleep (per my Dr.).If you are experiencing a lot of waking through the night, I would definitely recommend asking your doctor about it.

I have been on several different medications for sleep and anxiety in the past, and none have worked for my sleep. I researched Restoril and asked my neurologist if it was possible if I could try it. I have been on it for two weeks. It has worked wonders, except now I'm not falling asleep when I take the pill. I'm on 15mg. When I take the pill, I always fall asleep. Now I'm awake for three to four hours afterwards. Is this normal, or has anyone experienced this after taking the drug for this long?
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	annette, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	5/13/2009 5:53:05 AM	I am having breakthrough pain throughout the night (I'm pre-hip replacement) and not sleeping.  My doctor prescribed this drug because Ambien was not really working for me and made me &quot;sleep eat&quot;.  I took it for the first time tonight and have been up all night feeling shaky and kind of jacked up.  This is the 4th or 5th night of no or constantly interrupted sleep and its taking its toll.  I'm not sure why I'm having the complete opposite effect with a sleep aid but this drug is just not for me and is going in the toilet!

I just recently went to full dose (15mg) at bedtime after getting off of Klonopin for sleep disorder/insommnia which I was on for a few years. Today, I feel absolutely awful after experiencing the WORST night in my recent memory. I do have Fibromyalgia and Sjogren's Syndrome so I'm on a lot of meds already, but I feel worse from side effects than I do from without sleeping at all - headache, tremors, eye pressure/pain, shakiness, and feeling really spaced out. It takes forever to get to sleep and when I do, I find myself waking up every few hours in between really weird and vivid dreams. Paying an $85/mo copay for GENERIC Restoril doesn't do too much to thrill me either. Calling Dr. ASAP to change to something else. Not worth the money or the possibility for addiction/codependence!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Male	25-34	3/15/2009 4:47:55 PM	I've been having what I believe to be anxiety related insomnia.  After about 5-6 days on about 4-5 hours of sleep I saw a doctor who prescribed me temazepam (restoril).  After about 1 1/2 hours it got me to sleep but I always wake up after about 5 hours.  It's difficult to get back to sleep when I wake up.  I was given 15mg doses and have taken 30 with no improvement with the higher dose.  That being said I've tried ambien cr and it works wonderfully for me.  I do like the restoril as I haven't woken up feeling groggy or hungover, just a little tired.  It helps to find out how long it takes you to fall asleep on it then take one pill.  Once you're about to fall asleep take another one.  That gave me about 6 1/2 hours.

After a few nights of restless sleep I take this med and really get a good night sleep and then it seems that for the next couple of nights I sleep fine, then of course back to the sleepless nights and again take this med for the one night, seems frustrating but really this med helps me sleep with out having to take it night after night. I have been on this med for about a year or longer. Works well for me with out any problems.

I've been taking it for 4 months now and don't seem to have any promblems, although I would like to know what the long term affects are.  Also I rarely dream so it doesn't interfere with dreams.  Never had a nightmare on it.  When I awake in the morning, I feel sluggish but after I get up and moving I am fine.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Bellster, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	1	1	Male	55-64	12/10/2008 3:24:50 PM	I have been taking this RX for about 3 weeks and suddenly, I started waking up almost totally disoriented and confused; but the worst problem was (quit today) it causing my heart to feel like it was going to explode.  It is very much like the symptoms I had with Seroquel and Ambien.  I agree with the person who wrote a review about finding out more about the RX you take. DO NOT just trust the doctor to act in your best interest.  I have been treated for depression and sleep disorder since about 1989.  It has been my experience that most psychiatrists do not take the time to understand your particular symptoms and how you are responding to the RX.  They seem to run you through like a heard of cattle and are far to irresponsible (in my opinion) in prescribing the class and amount of RX.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	mrandmrsdog, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/2/2008 6:13:46 AM	I love this medication. I now fall asleep within three minutes and sleep through the night. I have tried Ambien and Lunesta and they didn't work as well for me. The down side to this med is that I have been on it so long that I have become dependant on it.

Other	Sleepseeker, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	10/7/2008 8:17:14 PM	I actually haven't used the medication yet!  I'm concerned about whether or not I would wake up (like I usually do!) to go to the bathroom.  In other words, is the medicine going to make me sleep so heavily that I miss a nature call??  I appreciate anyone's response before I start the medication.  I only have trouble sleeping occasionally.  Thanks!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	hersheysmore, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	10/3/2008 7:21:52 PM	I have become a very light sleeper over the past several years thanks to a few underlying medical conditions that cause me to wake up at night to use the bathroom or because of low back pain.  I was prescribed Lunesta, which helped me fall asleep, but didnt keep me asleep at night and left me with an awful aftertaste in my mouth in the mornings. Then I was given the RX for the Restoril.  I had a few people who were on it tell me NOT to take it because it made them feel groggy all day after taking it the night before.  Well, I finally broke down weeks later and tried it.  I love it.  I take it about 45  mins before I am ready for bed and it helps me fall to sleep easy and for the most part keeps me asleep at night. The biggest downfall is the expense.  Another problem, is that I cannot fall asleep with out the aid of sleeping medication.  I lie in bed for hours if I dont take something and I do not think it is because of the Restoril.  I was like that with the Lunesta and the OTC sleep aids too.  I avoid caffeine late in the day and I still dont fall asleep.  This has gone on for years and my husband now sleeps in a separate bedroom because the slightest noise (snoring) will keep me up all night.I say give the medicine a try.  There are so many on the market now, one is bound to work.  I just dont like being dependent on them to sleep and they are not the easiest thing to wean off of when you need your rest.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	8/26/2008 12:30:28 AM	I have had chronic sleep issues for many years. I was on Ambien, but that was affecting my memory, I tried Lunesta, but I had had nasty side effects, Restoril was the only sleep medication that has worked well for me. I take it and within 40 minutes I am sleeping and I sleep fairly well. Restoril, for me, has been a great medication. I sleep very well with it.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	luvena, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	8/6/2008 3:50:43 PM	Started on this medication after Trazadone worked well only for the first night I took it.  Restoril 30mgs works for me for 4-5 hours which is OK because that is better than tossing and turning afer getting only one hour of sleep.  I now only take it every other night because when I first started it and took it for four nights in a row on the fourth night I had an awful nightmare which I do not want to experience ever again.  Taking it every other night I haven't experience any nightmares.  I toss and turn all night low on the night I don't take it.

My elderly father is taking this while on hospice, and it made him a zombie with less then half the ambulatory mobility than what he had when he doesn't take it. It did not help his sleeping at all.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	JAFUD, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	5	3	Female	35-44	7/7/2008 3:27:49 AM	I was prescribed this medication along with Valium when I was diagnosed as Bipolar.  I take 30 mg at bedtime and 10 mg of Valium at bedtime.  The medicine worked very well for a little while.  However, I have been taking this medication now going on 12 YEARS!  This medication is a HYPNOTIC sleep-aid that should only be taken for short-term treatment of insomnia.  When I told my Psychiatrist that I was having trouble sleeping and that the medicines weren't effective, she prescribed SEROQUEL 500 mg at bedtime to boot!  Don't allow anyone to cause you to abuse, misuse, or become dependent/addicted to ANY medication.  If it is not having an effect any longer...there might be a real good reason why.  Educate yourself on the medications you and/or a loved one is prescribed.  Just because a doctor prescribes the medication, doesn't mean you don't have the right to ask questions about it's usage.

I have trouble most nights w/ staying asleep,but I also do have times where I have trouble falling asleep. This is 1 of the many different meds I've tried for my sleep problems, but again I've run into a typical problem on this med,just like the others I've taken. The day after I take the med to sleep I'm extremly tired (fatigue)and drowsy, sometimes not waking up until 1 or 2pm., but if I don't take the med, like last night, I'm up the entire night never going to sleep and then the next day I'm again faced w/ the same problemssupport of the extreme fatigue and drowsiness.I really don't know what to do anymore. I am taking a few other meds that can cause fatigue and drowsiness also, so I'm sure that's alot of the problem, so just be aware, if your taking other meds, of their side effects and the possibilty of getting into this exhausting routine I'm in and don't know the answer to.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Dee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	4/3/2008 4:14:34 PM	I used this medication for about two weeks. It never worked at 15 mg so my Dr. upped the dosage to 30mg/ no help. It takes about four hours for me to get to sleep after I take the drug. The drug is no help at all.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	survivor, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	2/25/2008 4:29:40 PM	This medicine worked very well to fall asleep and worked moderately well to stay asleep.  I did experience intense dreaming.  I had side effects during and after using this medication.  I experienced tremors, confusion, memory loss, poor coordination, weakness and difficulty concentrating.  Much of these symptoms lessened  by cutting the dose in half.  I discontinued the medication but developed rebound insomnia and a severe headache for eleven days  Most of the side effects I mentioned took about 6 weeks to fully subside after discontinuation.   I still have insomnia.

After the surgery I could'nt sleep at all. My Dr. prescribed Restoril for me. It did the trick. I now use it only when I can't sleep, about two nights a week. I don't feel addicted but it works every time.

I have great difficulty falling asleep&amp;staying asleep without restoril. Many times,I am awakened with pain and find I need to put soft,relaxing music on[rather than ((mmediately taking another medication]. Without the restoril,I'd have to take a pain pill. Ambien did not help me in the least....so,for now the restoril is my ticket to a good night's sleep. We have to remember that thesemeds are very potent&amp; should NEVER self medicate!!!Katherine36502 is lucky nothing severe happened to her after her sleeping med cocktail!!! That is so dangerous!PLEASE,katherine call your doctor and tell her/him about your persistent insomnia. thank you

I have been taking this for over a year now.  I have a condition to where I &quot;wake up&quot; 256 times within a 4 hour time span when I had a sleep study done on me.  I was constantly tired and felt like I had not slept until I started taking this mediction.  It has worked wonders for me.  I had taken other medications such as klonipin, but it didn't work as well.
