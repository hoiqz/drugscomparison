Gas	Rodney's wife, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	5/28/2012 9:05:41 AM	I was mostly relieved of gas, but it was blocked in. I was very bloated and it caused severed pain in my stomach. Plus, I was unable to pass a movement while taking it no matter how much fiber I ate or even with stool softeners... I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

I started taking one pill before each meal and it has helped tremendously! I have yet to be uncomfortable after eating when I take it.

I would just pop one chewable tablet in my mouth after I eat those foods and I dont have to deal with the gas anymore. This product is good and I dont have to sacrifice eating the foods that I like.

I've been gettin gas from my RX medication and this is the only gas medication that gets rid of it quickly and doesn't leave you with a bad taste in your mouth such as maalox and Mylanta. Im 13
