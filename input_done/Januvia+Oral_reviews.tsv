Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	KODATH007, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	7/29/2012 8:37:09 PM	 I am a 63 year old type 2 diabtetes patient for the last 6 years. I also take medication for hypertension since 2001(lisnopril and Olmesezt). I have been taking amaryl(2mg) with Metformin(500mg) and Gilprimide for the last 5 years with good control of blood sugar levels. However my doctor prescribed 100 mg of Januvia with metformin-500mg made aS a more efficient alternative to Amaryl. I started taking Januvia since maRCH of this year and I noted in the first 2 months some general tiredness and my fasting blood sugar was high -130 mg/dl compared with 90 mg/dl with amaryl. More importantly after 3 months of Januvia i started having intense body pain, constipation tiredness, headache, sore throat in the morning, nauseua and trouble concentrating. i was advised to take vitaminD-3-2000iu every day. I did that for the last 2 weeks and it has not reduced these symptoms. I stopped Genuvia since last monday and my tiredness and body pain has reduced considerably. I still do not have the energy I HAD before strating on Januvia. I switched back to Amaryl and my blood sugar is back under control. Is this a common experience to the side effect of Januvia. I am convinced that Merck introduced a dangerous drug in the market and Ssome one should take this up with the FDA. I am very concerned that I will have permanent damage to my system due to 3 months of januvia. I am a synthetic organic chemist with a doctorate in organic chemistry and I know that januvia is loaded with flourine atoms. it has 6 fluorine atoms. It has a trifluoro methyl benzene unit which I know as a synthetic chemist is toxic to kidneys.No one should take this very dangerous drug. Jacob Mathew, ph.D.

I've noticed when I would walk I'd get a sharp pain in my toe/ball of foot area.  Not sure if it could be my shoes, or if it resulted in me sitting with my feet arched(look like i have heels on, but didn't) I just brushed it off like I'm just experiencing the norm, but then it happened again.  My legs would feel numb at times. Not sure if it could be my lounger..or slightly cramped. Not bad/sharp pains or anything..just the occasional stretch would do. I had stomach cramps like in my pancreas area..it would come and go when i first started, but after taking it- I do not experience it anymore. I do experience the occasional diarrhea though when taking metformin(2,000mg a day) as well as januvia 100mg. Alot of gas/air in my stomach when I first started. I felt really bloated, but not so much anymore.  I'm giving this a shot.  If it benefits me and works out fine..why not.  If not, doc and I will find alternative means. :-D

If I move around I get nauseated .  This starts 6 hours after taking med and lasts for 1 1/2 hours after eating.  I ate lunch as usual and had little change in level of activity.  I have been om metformin, which works but I wanted my  HA1c to be in the 5s.

My doctor prescribed it today in place of glimepiride. I also take 500mg Metformin. Based on the reviews I dont think I will take Januvia. I was diagnosed last year as diabetic. Initially bs was &gt;340 and A1c 10.8. After taking metformin, cinnamon pills (500mg) and ocassionally glimepiride my A1C is 7 and bs avg 130. I will continue to use cinnamon pills (caribbean antidote) and my metformin...and of course exercise and watch my diet. But at this time, I do not want to introduce more meds into my system. If my A1C rises or bs increases then I will consider going back to glimepiride....but I have opted to not take Januvia at this time. Thanks to all persons who posted reviews!

The januvia would cause food to putrify in my gut and then be vomited out. I worked with my Dr for over 1 1/2 years to find the cause. I would never take this medicine again!

The Endo said it works very well; he was right.  Still taking Metformine 1000 twice a day, but my levels are right where they should be. Be careful; your levels will drop and you need to eat with this drug at regular intervals.

This one has not done that to me and I am happy with that. It is very expensive but you can go onto merk.com and print out a perscription assistance program application. Have your doctor fill out the necessary information send it in to merk and you could get a years worth of medication for free. You can also print off a coupon for a one month free trial take it to your pharmacy and get it for free too. At my pharmacy it was going to be 279.00 for one month and I will be getting it for free. You can go online for many different drug companies and they too will have perscription programs for those who can not afford the medication. The income limit I believe is very high, a fimily of three can make, I believe, 78000.00 a year and qualify. I just wanted to get this informaion out there for those who need a little help.

Januvia controls and I have minimal lows or highs.  Since starting Januvia over 3 years ago, my A1C has dropped from 7.2 to as low as 5.4 but no higher thabn 6.5%.  Love it. Also, I might add that take Lantus insulin with it.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Blair, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	55-64	1/10/2012 2:26:44 AM	I started to take 100 mg Januvia, when my feet started to hurt and had a seering pain in my colon at night. My feet started to feel like they had a uric acid attack, and I started to feel a lot of pain if I tied my shoes too tight. I was on januvia for about 90 days. Since that time, I have not been able to get my blood sugar below 350, regardless of what I try. My feet still hurt, but they are slowly improving. I can at least tie my shoes and walk without pain, but my joints between my toes feel like they still have some uric acid crystals. The feet are very sensitive, so I have to watch what pairs of socks I need to wear. I didn't ask for januia, but a doctors recommendation. I had some surgery lately and the doctors were concerned about my fasting high blood sugar, which was 349, and after a couple shots of insulin, the blood sugar would not drop, but infact went up to 400. Even after several hours, the blood sugar only dropped to 350 +/- 10, but has consistanly been around 300-350, regardless of the medication I take now.

After 9 months on Januvia/metformin combination pill, I insisted that my specialist put me back on to Metformin and Actos, and all the symptoms, except ED/impotence, went away, and my A1C is well below 6 and closer to 5.5 after 6 months back on Metformin and Actos.

Only side effect to note is slight dizziness.I don't know about other peoples symptoms but be aware that doctors advise people to quit drinking and smoking because these two things alone can cause respiratory symptoms and pancreatic problems ESPECIALLY IN DIABETICS.Remember colds and flu also cause respiratory problems.Use an elimination process before jumping the gun unless your symptoms are acute or severe in which case seek attention promptly.No constipation, No stomach pain, No Rash or Hives.Satisfied after month one.

I am now taking it in the evening with my dinner.  I also take Metformin and Humalog 75/25 mix at the same time.  When I took it with my noon meal my day glucose readings were lower, but my fasting readings were higher.  Since taking it in the evening, my results are lower (131 this am).  However, after eating breakfast (bowl of shredded wheat, 1% milk, Splenda, plus 2 strips of turkey bacon, it was 235.  I am monitoring how my readings are affected by when I take Januvia, but would really like to get off it.  At this time it is the only medicine that has been really effective it lowering my glucose readings.

My resting blood sugar went from the 140's to from 78 to 105 range. My AC1 dropped from 8.5 to 6.1 range. My only symptom at this time is a pain in the center of my stomach and excessive stomach gas.

I went from 289 mg/dl to mid 300'smg/dl with 2000mg of Metformin, to 189mg/dl to 150's every day since. I havent had any side effects that I have noticed...if these numbers are good for the dr. on 12/06 I will continue with Januvia but if not then I will be going on daily shots...I have felt overall more even keeled on this combo of meds since being diagnosed 5 years ago.. I was very worried about side effects from reading reviews but am very relieved that I havent had any....I only have to pay $48.00 for a monthly supply, but well worth it! I am currently taking 2000mg Metformin and Januvia 100mg 1 daily.....

I feel terrible. First on Metformin and energy level dropped to zero. No energy and aching legs was terrible. Switched to Januvia and have terrible sweats. Was up all night sweating. Dr. switched me from taking my meds in the AM to PM. Night sweats are better at night, but I sweat all day. Unbearable. Anyone else have trouble with sweats? I take 100MG.  Anyone have any recommendations? I am ready to live with high sugar and off the meds. I never have a good day of feeling good. Terrible way to live...miserable. I am not overweight and slim frame. Could 100 MG be too much at a time?

Made me feel terrible! Stopped this med and problems started going away the next day. I wouldn't recommend this med, especially with the risk of pancreatitis. Don't feel it's worth the risk!!

The Januvia is very expensive tho ($220 a month), but worth the cost for increasing control over my diabetes.  Weight Watchers has been a help in helping with weight loss..and controlling blood sugars.  No side effects except in the pocketbook!

Had bad muscle and bone pain that I hadn't had since stopping Metformin. MD switched me to Januvia 4 mos ago. I read comments about side effects but since I am trying to avoid insulin I thought I'd give it a try. Things went well for about 3 weeks then started to have severe muscle and bone pain-worse than when on Metformin-that progressed over the next 2 wks. Also had constipation, vivid dreams and headache. no depression but overall not feeling up to par. After 5 weeks gave up on Januvia and after several days symptoms reversed. Pain was severe and was afraid of permanent damage but don't seem to have any. I'm calling the FDA to report. How many people go through treatment for arthritis or other problems that are caused by meds?

Now after a little over a month they are in the mid 100's!! I no longer have to deal with high blood sugars or horrible side effects from the Metformin.. I would definitely recommend Januvia!

We'll see what she says.  It is expensive but a little hint, I checked out their website and was able to get it free for 30 days to try!  Also got a coupon for the next refill, if there is a next refill!  Also check out Actos's website, they offer a $50.00 rebate if anyone swithes to that!

BS readings in AM went way up but PM did not change. Headaches and dirrhea started second day, but quit by the end of the week. Worse problem was increased heart rate. I have had past heart problems and by-pass, but normal pulse was about 66. With this drug was constantly getting pulse in the 80's and 90's (at rest) So I consider it dangerous and not helpful.

He gave me three weeks worth of samples and told me to come back in three weeks for a check up to see how the Januvia is working. For two weeks I kept a nauseated stomach both day and night. I became constipated and felt awful. Headachs were constant and it felt like my stomach was extreamly bloated to the point it felt like I had a baseball in my belly. I didn't know what was going on  I finished taking the three weeks worth of samples and the very next day I began to feel so much better and by the second day I felt like a new man. I will never ever take Januvia again.

Was able to switch back to januvia 5 months ago, since when on actos had increase in weight and sob.  Feel much better on Januvia although so far have not lost any weight.Blood sugars run around100 to 140.

I have been a diabetic for only 3 months.  When the doctor checked my blood sugar in July my blood sugar was 398 and the A1C test was 11.9.  He put me on Metformin 1000 mg twice a day and Glipizide 5 mg once a day.  After 3 months of taking my medicine and watching all carbs and sugar that I eat, my A1C ws 5.9.  I have lost 28 pounds and monitor all carbs and sugars extremely carefully. My doctor just prescribed this medicine for &quot;sugar spikes&quot; that are showing up on my meter.  I will take Januvia for a month and see if it helps me.

Two weeks later I have hives and black marks all over my body. The VA ER could not believe the condition this med put me in.

My sugars stayed high, I felt really bad, no sleep, I finally stopped eating. ( I never felt hungry and food made me sick.) My Dr accused me of not taking it, cause my A1C's were at 12. I took the darn things, they didn't work at all.

The #'s were higher while on the pill and just overall felt uncomfortable.  Stopped taking all meds and will watch my diet and exercise to try and keep the #'s down.  That has to be better than feeling like that.  No BM for days and that is after talking all kinds of pills to help.

Vision clouded and progressed to retinal bleeding after a coughing spell. Blindness corrected by surgically draining bloody fluid from each eye. This was a bad trip but better than death by pancreatic or kidney failure.

It seems to be working. I feel more energy and my eyesight has improved. I was also taking Actoplus+met (with metformin). This was a bad combination. The metformin drug was too much and caused some swelling and hard for me to breathe, restless at night. I discontinued the Actoplus+met and Januvia medication has made a bigger impact on my numbers. I was reading about 200, now reading about 150 on glucose monitor. Think the longer I use, the better it will be (also include more frequent exercise and better eating habits--I am working more on this.)

I went to my doctor on 8/18/09 because my respiratory problems had gotten worse. I could not rest, day or night, because this medicine had caused a respiratory infection with wheezing.  I told my doctor and the doctor acknowledged that this was one of the side effects of Januvia.  I was placed on antibiotics and given a cough medicine.  I am still having breathing with wheezing.  I have never had asthma or any symptoms before my staring Januvia.  I was told by doctor to stop taking Januvia. But I told the doctor I took myself off of this medication about 9 days before coming in to see doctor. I'm afraid that the side effects are not going away soon.  My body feels better since getting off, but still have some wheezing and coughs.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	dyson, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	8/14/2009 9:28:03 AM	Januvia, lowered blood sugar readings with in normal range (less than a 100) also take Metformin 5/500mg twice a day (2 pills) since taking Januvia noted tiredness, contipation, slight headaches, itching, less sleep and sinus issues at night.  Other than that Januvia works for me.  Only been taking 2 weeks.  Will make a months use my validation point to determine next steps.

I have been having serious breathing and respiratory problems with congestion. This medicine has made my life miserable. I feel worst taking it now. My daily activities have been sluggish and depressing. I am going to stop taking this medication because I think it is causing my body more physical problems than the manufacturer wants you to know.  I have had serious constipation with stomach bloathing since I started this medication.  My glucose levels really haven't changed that much. I am going back to my regular medicines, glipizide and methformin.  I think there should be more indepth research done on Januvia.  It has been too costly financially and to my general health.  My heart beats very fast and I feel so tired all the time. Very disappointed and I hope there have not been permanent side effect damages to me.

Now have kidney disease in stage 3 with filtering of the kidney at level 41. Metformin and Avandia caused this problem.  Was then put on Actos 30 Mg. daily and Novalog 70/30 flex pin. Actos has made my weight go up and now I have swelling in my feet and legs.  A few weeks ago the doctor decreased the Actos to 15 mg. and added Januvia 100 Mg. daily.  The dr also decreased the Novalog 70/30 to 10 Units daily.  Due to the headaches, tiredness, itching, muscle pain, runny itchy nose, I am now told to stop taking the Januvia and watch the blood sugars that I may need to increase the insulin again.  The Insulin (Novalog 70/30) causes more weight in my middle. Also lab work today revealed decreased iron levels. Now have to take iron supplements.

I am the person that was doing the dash diet and excercise and tried to drop the januvia.  After 5 days without januvia my physical symptoms were better.  No knee pain, no muscle  pain, i stop feeling physically bad.  One bad thing though from going cold turkey on the januvia is that i started to get depressed and could not sleep.  I felt like I had drug withdrawls.  could not sleep at all, worse than when I was on the drug.  I guess the body gets used to having the drug in the system and goes in shock without it.  i finally broke down and took one quarter tab just to have it in the system and feel better mentally.  Once i took a quarter pill i felt a little better in the head.  It seems to work so I wonder if a step approach is required in order to not have the system go into shock.  I guess after months on the drug the system changes and you cant just flip it back on the drop of a dime.  i will talk to my endo and see what they think is the best approach to get rid of the pill.  I will go back to lantus instead of this mess.  
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	l, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	35-44	5/9/2009 1:05:41 AM	i started on only metformin only.  My doc did not like the H1C reading and so he decided to have me try Januvia.  I had the usual stomach problems and it was ok.  I decided to kick into high gear my exercise routine to 2.5 miles in the treadmill and 5 miles at night on the bike.  I started a modified DASH diet. After 12 weeks in Januvia i started experiencing weird symptoms that I had never experiece.  I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 6 years ago and was an lantus and step scale insulin. I was on lipitor on an off for six years and lisinopril.  So i had never seen the weird symptoms before the Januvia.  In the past 3 months i feel like i have been in a daze.  Twice I went to emergency thinking I had heart problems. I would feel lathorgic during the day, i would get paranoid, had wild mood swings, elevated pulse, muscle pain, joint pain, problems sleeping, sensitivity to light and sound.  It would get to the point that I could not be at a store that had bright lights because I would get dizzy and have vertigo.  I decided to stop taking Januvia when I got pain in my left knee and started to have depression. My knee felt so bad that I had to quit my morning runs in the treadmill and the biking.  Not good for someone who wants to loose weight.  I started walking slowly again on the treadmill and then all of the sudden I pulled a calf muscle just from walking fast.  I went to emergency thinking i tore a muscle, but it was only a pulled muscle.  I stop taking januvia 3 days ago and have traded my morning run for a 5 to 6 mile bike ride and kept the evening bike ride also.  My calf muscle is better know since I am off januvia but I am still having sleeping problems.  The light sensitivity is gone also.  No more halos on lights and the intensity of the light has disappear.  I think i rather take lantus once a day instead of dealing with side effects. That helped me lose weight and was off all meds and insulin for two years until i started a job that required long hour

Only problem was my blood sugar went out-of-sight, totally uncontrolled.  Because my kidneys were starting to pay the price, I'm now on insulin.  Very depressing.

When I stopped takeing the medicine I got stomach cramps, a lot of gas, and the runs. This medicine is supposed to help? Oh I also take glyberide/metforim 2.5/500 3x day.  I was given the junuvea because after two years glyberride/metforim allowed my A1c to climb from 6.9 to 7.8. With No change in diet.

One night I woke up so sick, diarrhea, needed to throw up, disoriented, weak, dizzy, couldn't see out of right eye, and my b/s was very low. Managed to get a Sprite and back to bed. I could barely walk. I thought stroke, but was hoping it was reaction to Januvia. I'm a female 69 years old and it scared me so much. I stopped taking it and will call my dr. Wonder if FDA is aware of these effects and should a recall be made?

Also nasal stuffiness and chest discomfort, probably due to the fluttering.  I've also had some leg cramping and muscle tightness.  My stomach seems jittery all the time.  Glucose levels during the day were actually low, but high in the morning.  My hemoglobin A1c came down from 7.5 to 7.1 in 3 months but I do not feel well on this drug and prefer to try to control my diabetes through diet and exercise.  I even tried lowering it to 25 mg per day and have the same effects.

My intestine &quot;plugged up&quot; completely &amp; I spent two entire nights in the bathroom trying to go &amp; couldn't.  Also terrible headaches, nausea, lighthedness, &amp; waking up every two hours to eat. When I explained these symptoms to my doctor, he just said &quot;Keep taking it; the symptoms will get better with time.&quot; He's not my doctor any more. I would not be a bit surprised to hear in the future that some people have died or been permanently injured due to Januvia. I stopped taking Januvia and all meds &amp; I am getting better control of my BS with diet &amp; exercise.

Has lowered A1C from 11.4 to 7.3 in 6 mths(not really following any diet)  I have had a prescription for it for over a year, but I kept forgetting to take it. I am finally taking it regular the last 4 mths.  I think it has started Ovulation in me again. I had only had 4 periods in 2008, but the last 3 mths have been regular but very heavy(can't really leave home for about 1 week). I have pain in my fingers, ankles &amp; hips. Pain so bad at night I have trouble sleeping. My dr says its arthritis, but after reading all the comments that people have made, I'm beginning to wonder. I will continue to take it to see what happens.

During this time I went from Glucotrol XL to insulin(110ml a day two shots, morning and night. I also take Avandia 5mg. My sugars always ran high 280s. No control. then my doctor said people have gotten great results with Januvia. I thought... we'll see! I have been on Januvia (100ml 1 a day mornings)for about 10 days and the results are astounding! I went from high 280s to 140s waking reading! I stopped the second shot and decreased the first significantly 35 ml due to hypoglycemia, so Insulin and Januvia are a very powerful combo. For the first time I am greatly optimistic that I can get off insulin with this wonder drug Januvia, and maybe one more bg lowering pill! No side effects yet! I'm feeling better overall because of the lower sugar levels, and control of this condition is now within reach! A change in diet(avoiding sugar)and more excercise(just walking) is doing wonders! I am actually looking forward to my next appointment, and getting off insulin! I love the way it works by helping your body make more insulin(for type 2s)and gets your liver to decrease sugar production making your body perform close to the way it should. It's a  1-2 punch that's doing the trick! Thanks Doc,WebMD and all of YOU reviewers for your comments and ideas! Your experiences are invaluable! That's why we read them! :)

Chronic heart pain my heart beat so hard and fast I worried I was having a heart attack. My chest was/is sore I have congestion, I still have a fast heart beat off and on &quot;This worries me&quot;. Shortness of breath. I was dizzy, chest colds, Very bad headache, Both hands were numb this was worse at night I would wake with my hands hurting I still have some numbness it is off and on and and mostly in my fingers now. I was so hoping Januvia would work for me. I do not think this drug was not tested well enough before the public was allowed to use it. I hope my side effects are not long term and no damage was caused and with time will go away.

A week ago I was taking 1000 mg Metformin, 10-12 units of Lantus insulin and 5 mg Glucotrol XL. My A1C was at 6.3 which is good. My doctor had me drop the Glucotrol XL and start taking Januvia. I've always had problems with my 2 hour after meal readings. My first day of taking Januvia, my 2 hour reading after breakfast was 140! It has always been around 160-190. What a difference on the first day. If this continues, I hope to have real good control over my blood sugar readings.

I stopped Januvia for 3 months and tried again and started to develop the same medical problems within 1 week and stopped again. I will never take the drug again.  I have not recovered to the point of when I started Januvia in 05/2007 to 07/2008. I feel this drug was not fully tested before general public usage.  I feel this durg could kill.  It was my primary physician who worked with me and NOT the endocrinologist who ignored my constant complaints and said it has to be working.

I had trouble swallowing. Ibuprofen helped the pain, but ultimately I had to quit Januvia.

No more debilitating diarrhea and stupor (glucophage &amp; Metformin), no more excruciating pain, swelling and bloatedness (Actos), and no more blood sugar readings all over the chart!  I am ecstatic and extremely pleased with Januvia!  This drug is the first to successfully lower my blood sugar readings to within normal ranges after fasting and even after eating... and without any side effects!

It took about 3 months for the sinus issues to clear. otherwise no other side effects.  my a1c is 6.3% down from last test.  the medication is working.  I am very happy.it is costly even with insurance but Diabetes is so dangerous - it is worth it.  dont give up, re: the initial side effects, they will go away.

Side effects have been heart palpatations, loss of apetite, and nausia.  I take it at night to avoid upset stomach.  I Januvia along with 1500 Metformin a day.  Combination seems to be working.  I have had sinus infections that are difficult to eliminate.

The new company forced me to switch to Actos.  I gained 35 lbs and went crazy on the doctor. Needless to say, my doctor was nice enough to find a way to get me back on Januvia.  I range from 90-120 and I've lost 10 lbs.  Someone should do something about the insurance companies forcing people to stop taking meds that work and forcing them to take drugs that don't work!

I gained about 25 pounds since on Actos. Since changing to Januvia I have lost 6 pounds in 3 weeks with NO change in my diet--either type of food or amounts. I have a consistant blood reading of around 160 every day. A little high but way better than being all over the map with Actos. I have had no adverse reactions like I did with Actos either.

I have never been overweight, but have a family history of diabetes.  I was put on Januvia 100mg every day in Dec. of last year, and it helped immediately even causing some very low blood sugars.  Starting around March/April of this year, my readings started getting higher.  I also have increased my exercise and have lost 22 lbs which is alot for my size (petite).  This past month, my fasting blood sugars are almost always &gt;200 and my random's are almost 300.  I haven't had many readings &lt;200 lately at all.  My diet is not perfect, but I do follow closely counting carbs, using sugar free/low carb products, and limiting starches.  It is very frustrating that I am spending the money on this &quot;new&quot; pill and doing all the things I'm supposed to do and it doesn't seem to be doing any good.  I see my doctor tomorrow and do not plan to take anymore Januvia-will ask for glucophage/metformin.  Also, I am scared of Januvia after researching online articles related to increased cancer incidence associated with Januvia use.  Side effects I have experienced include:  low energy levels, headaches, hip joint pain, &amp; left ear pain.  Hope to find something more effective.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/28/2008 12:51:15 AM	I was diganosised with type II in januray 2008, my a1c was 9.7. The doctor put me on Janumet 50/500 1 tab BID. I also took the diabetic class through out local hospital and learned not only about being diabetic, but how to change your eating habits to a more healthy diet. ALso exercise plays a big parts in the control...medication alone will not do it. I have lost almost 40 in 6 months. At my last doctors appointment the blood work showed that my a1c was doen to 5.0 my doctor as me &quot;what the hell I was doing.&quot; He was very please with my results. If all continues on I will be taken off of my high blood pressure and cholerstrol medication. I have had no side effects at all which is really unusal as I am allergic to 9 different medications. My only drawback to this medication is the cost with it being a new medication the co-pay is high actually the highest tier with my insurance. The God my doctor can give me samples.

I feel better than ever and if Januvia works for you, it seems to work well. I am taking Metformin XR 500 2x a day I had issues with my numbers rising in the morning, I started with regular release metformin, but when i switched to the XR the numbers stablized. Januvia seems to work well for me.

Even with an occasional cheat my BS levels are well within desired range, and my a1c is 6.4.  Only side effect is mild constapation, which is cured with bran cereal.  Clearly from other reviews this doesn't work for everyone, but for me it is a wonder drug.  There are no crashes to worry about and no dangerous highs.   
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Concerned Spouse, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	3/15/2008 2:27:39 PM	My husband, age 71, was prescribed Januvia, 100 mg/day,in Dec 2007 in addition to the glipizide and metformin he was already taking. It did lower his BS somewhathe saw more readings under 100 mg/dl and fewer over 220. On the downside, as the weeks went by, he was feeling more and more lethargic; had less energy; felt cold all the time, especially at night; experienced severe nocturnal leg cramping; had persistent, severe constipation which led to his abdomen being hard and distended; and his blood pressure began creeping up. He also noticed a loss of taste and smell, also of balance and stability.  In other words, he was feeling pretty crummy. He lasted on Januvia less than three months, from 21 Dec 2007 to 2 March 2008 when he stopped taking it. Within a day or two of stopping the Januvia he began to feel like a new person. Januvia being the only new addition to his meds, it was the prime suspect. Generally, he is feeling much better, most of his adverse reactions having subsided; however his BP and BS levels are still higher than before Januvia which have him concerned that Januvia might have changed something, hopefully not permanently.  He now gets BS readings routinely in the high 200s, whereas pre-Januvia he would have to enjoy a dish of ice cream or a big meal out to get those readings. It is as if the glipizide and metformin are no longert effective and, despite cutting way back on carbs and increasing the exercising, he is finding getting back into control is more difficult than ever. Is Januvia going to be another drug rushed to market before adequate testing was done?
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/10/2008 3:06:46 PM	Am a registered nurse, not overweight (139) but with family hx of diabetes. Have taken Metformin 500mg daily since 2002.  Random BS levels varied 90's to 150's, A1C varied between 6.7 and 7.0 but I'm not 100% diet compliant.  Doctor started Januvia 100mg daily in addition to metformin to see if we could lower FBS and A1C. Instead, my BS levels have jumped from low 100's on metformin to nearly 300 by adding Januvia. I get a very strange &quot;just not quite right&quot; feeling and my energy level has plummeted.  Until adequate testing proves the long-term effectiveness of this drug, I will NOT take it again.

After adding Janument at 1000 mg per day for the last 6 months in my 3rd month I started feeling very fatigued, having cravings to eat more, soreness and body aches and swelling of my entire body but especially my legs. I would suggest anyone taking this medicine and that also has high blood pressure to not assume that your swelling is coming from that and to tell your doctor if you are experiencing more tiredness,fatigue and body aches than usual to consult with your physician concering this medication called Janumet.

My sugars were in the high 200's My medical team is using this drug to try to wake up my beta cells in my pancreas and/or to see if they were dead.  It has helped lower my sugars 50 points.  Noone can answer the question though..are my beta cells waking up?

I was skeptical that one dose a day could work for 24 hrs but it does. I finally get blood sugars of 97 to 115. Normal on metaformin was near 150. It's the best thing since baked bread.

This drug is extremely expensive and is not covered by Medicare.

They are now going above normal ranging from 140 to 300.  This drug was suppose to manage the glucose levels, both high and lows, but it is not effective in controlling the highs.

My doctor didn't want to take me off of it because he said it work for most people. Well, I change Doctors and the new Doctor stated me on Januvia 50 mg in the AM and 50 in the PM and it started to work at the end of the week, no side effects, my number was very close to normal and I feel GREAT . I even lost weight while on this medication. My husband is on 50 mg a day and doing great with no side effects.

My doc wanted to take me off Starlix (w/metformin), which worked very well but did cause some very low blood glucose after meals. I resisted but finally agreed to try Januvia. Glad I did. Once a day. Almost no super low blood sugar. My A1C dropped from 6.3 to 5.8. My average glucose is about 105. A few highs, almost no lows. Morning glucose does seem to be a little higher than before. Weight stable. No changes in energy, muscle or joint pain. No one knows the long term issues, if any, but so far Januvia is working well.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	65-74	11/7/2007 6:55:41 AM	25 mg of Januvia creates a higher than normal AM fasting reading, leaving the conclusion that 25 mg is not enough or once per day is not adequate dosage.

So far so good. I also take metformin. I have lost 16 pounds so far. Before this, I had gained 30 pounds with avandia. My feet don't swell up like with avandia. My a1c went up just a bit, got to keep an eye out on that, now it's 6.9, otherwise I am very happy with januvia 100mg once a day.

I didn't find it in WebMd though.  Is it true?

My mind seemed to become clearer. Blood sugar dropped dramatically and energy levels increased greatly. Excellent drug for me anyway.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Elizabeth, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	10/16/2007 1:41:13 AM	I have been on Metfromin for 3 years with excelent results a1c is 5.2.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	10/15/2007 12:41:09 PM	Had nausea every day all day from the 2nd week of taking this drug. When I consulted with my doctor she didn't want to take me off of it since she felt it was worth staying on. I wanted to lose weight yes but not when I am so sick to my stomach I have no desire to eat at all. I was forcing myself to eat one meal a day and that usually didn't sit well. As all diabetics know we are supposed to eat no less than 3 meals a day and with me skipping meals due to no appetite was the worst thing I could do at this point of my treatment. If your doctor puts you on this medication and you are sick like I was, don't take no for an answer sinc it is YOUR health not theirs that matters and how you feels factors into that. Since I went off the Januvia I have not been sick to my stomach at all. I didn't see much difference in my blood sugars while on it either and since switching to glipizide my numbers are going down.

Am I taking too many sugar meds? I also take heart meds, water pills and have a pacemaker. Is it possible some of my meds are causing my sugar to rise.  I'm on a strict diet i.e. no salt, carbs, sugar, etc.

Other	Diane, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	35-44	9/22/2007 9:58:56 PM	My docter gave Januvia to help loose weight before I do end up with type 2 diabetes one day since it runs in my family. She first started me off with the lowest dosage of metforin. The side effects I was experiencing in just 2 weeks were awful. muscle pain, headachs, hotflases, muscel and joint pain. Didn't even want to excersize because the drug made me very lathargic. In addition to all this I broke out with pimple like I was a teenager. That was the worst side effect off, I'm still trying to get my skin back to normal after testing the metformin for 2 weeks. Then my doctor gave me Januvia, it seems to be working ok.It's very easy to take. Other than feeling tired after I take it doesn't last very long. However I did start to break out again, so I'm going to do some research as 2 these diabetic medication and acne.
