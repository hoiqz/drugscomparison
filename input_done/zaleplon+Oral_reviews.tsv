Difficulty Falling Asleep	Rob, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	11/25/2010 10:08:12 AM	I take it after my initial attempts to go to sleep through progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, and reading don't work and I've only got about 4 more hours left to sleep.  The first time I took it,it didn't work.  The second time I took it, I followed taking the medicine with some light stretching.  It has worked now 2 or 3 times.  I don't experience a hangover the next day.  Any time I take a sleep aid, however, I have an extremely difficult time trying to go to sleep naturally the next night.

Difficulty Falling Asleep	James647, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	1	3	Male	19-24	5/3/2009 8:18:16 AM	It works sometimes but almost everyday I hallucinate for 45 min before i fall a sleep and people cant talk to me after I take these, Ill read texts I was sending laying in bed waiting for the pills to kick in and wouldn't remember sending the messages the day latter so I would read over them and I just sound mental or on hard core drugs totally not me. The hallucinations mixed with blurred vision makes me see a lot of weird things when the lights go off, the first time it happened I didn't know what was going on and looking into the green leaf leftovers of strawberries in a box and saw a bunch of green people fighting and killing each other in the plastic box, and I couldn't stop watching it was really weird from what I remember
Difficulty Falling Asleep	jeff, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	35-44	2/10/2009 10:52:09 AM	I take 2.5mg - 5 mg of Ambien a few times a month, which works at night when I can't sleep.  This was just prescribed to me because I don't have problems falling asleep, just staying asleep.  Dr. said it's short acting and short 1/2 life of 2 hours.  To me, it's a placebo.  I feel nothing.  No narcotic, no hypnotic.  I did get an hour of sleep in the AM after I took it so I'm assuming it had a little effect in getting me back to sleep, but not much.  Maybe just enough.  Anyway, I'll use it for emergency 4am - 5am sleep problems.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/8/2009 12:06:50 PM	For chronic depression, I take zaleplon if I awaken during the night; because it only works for 2 hours, I will take it if I awaken before 5:00 a.m. I have experienced no side effects and no hangovers.  I am extremely satisfied with this product. I have used it for more than 4 years and need it about 1-2 times a month.
