Started off at 150mg.X 3 daily had to be upped to 250 mg.x 3 daily seems to be doing its job now. Still go into Vtech every now and then very small attacks. So far happy with drug. 
Heart Ventricle Rhythm Problem	rowatt, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	9/9/2010 9:55:07 PM	I've had rapid and/or irregular heart rate since childhood. Was particularly sensitive to caffeine too.  Six months ago I began experiencing severe irregular heart rhythmns, sometimes feeling two or three beats together which would go on for a while. Almost fainted once.A specialist MD, an electrophysiologist started me on Mexiletine, 150mg twice each day with fantastic results. My heart  almost immediately returned to a  stable pulse. Only side effect is heartburn if I forget to eat or drink milk when taking the pill.

I have had 6 back surgeries; thinking each time it would help this along with my other back problems. Nothing has helped as much as seeing a pain doctor and he prescribed Mexiletine along with another new drug and increasing 2 others. I am finally so I can live with the burning.

I began to fall alot and even had difficulty turning over in bed. During my pregnancies the muscle spasams were so bad it was not safe to drive due to inability to respond. I could not turn my head without a severe muscle cramps.  We  have been DX Mytonia Congentia and perscribed Mexatil 150mg. I have had only 2 episides of tachicardia in the past 5 years since I began taking Mexatil 150mg BID.And the ability to walk across a room without apearing as someone needing a wheelchair is wonderful.

After a few months I noticed many side effects: Shaky hands, blurred vision, muscle cramps and trouble speaking.  I gradually tapered off Mexiletine.  It took a long time for my vision to improve.
