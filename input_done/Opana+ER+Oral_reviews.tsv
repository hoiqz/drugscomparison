When i finally decided to get the script filled i couldn't find it anywhere. I had to drive over an hour to get it at a Walgreens. I was supposed to take Lortab 10mg for break thru pain, but i ended up having to take that through out the day because i didn't have the Opana, and now i'm out of the Lortab. It was also $100 after my insurance. I was wondering if anyone has found something else to replace for the Opana that is working well for them? I don't want to go thru this every month. I take it for Interstitial Cystitis, along with alot of other meds.

Second, I have had constant headaches &amp; stomach aches. I do not want it upped.I want nothing more to do with it. I have a Dr's appointment tomorrow &amp; I'm going to ask for something else.

Needless to say I have pretty much tried all of the different pain meds out there and had continuously had pain that left me sitting at home unable to go out and enjoy my family..Finally with Opana I had started to enjoy life again my only complaint is that it does not last the 12 hours it should..Over the memorial holiday I found out that there was no longer any Opana out there..I am now terrified since my life had started to improve and now my medication that did that is gone!!!  I've tried everything else and spent 10years with little relief..so with Opana gone what am I supposed to do now??  The Pharmacist says there is nothing even close to this medication so I can switch to something else...If anybody else has any suggestions as to what to try now I am open to any help or comments...My doctor is not one that believes the importance of being close to pain free goes along with what your quality of life is going to be so I'm sure with Opana gone I will have a very difficult time with him and getting anything in a high enough does..(with 12 years of pain meds my tolerance to any medication is very high which my Dr. does not understand either..I am now very scared because I'm still young (my 40's) and have a lot of life to live but can't do it with pain.  My back is inoperable due to the extent of the DDD which effects every disk in my back but one and also causes severe sciatica..If anyone could please offer any advice please do. Thank you and good luck to the rest of you that are in the same position as me..Please send any comments to Kendrakay4588@gmail.com

Chronic Pain	TAustin, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	35-44	5/19/2012 3:22:01 PM	I changed to OpanaER from OxycontinER 2 years ago (when they were hard to find and the new formula did not agree with my IBS) and thought it was the answer to my prayers.  Now for the last few months I am back to suffering pain.  I have a problem with the additives used they flare up my IBS. I am so tired of going through this pain again and again.  There has to be a better solution for to curb the addicts and abusers than to mess up medication formulas that work for chronic pain.  No matter what the manufacturers do addicts and abusers will find a way to get their high.  I and many other will however lose even more of our quality of life. I just hope that my Dr can figure out something that will help me soon.  Although I am sure that will be messed around with sooner or later also.

Chronic Pain	Disappointed, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	5/12/2012 9:42:00 PM	Was on Opana Er for the last year with excellent results. It reduced my pain very effectively, where other opiates would not. Scince Endo changed the formula to the new Tamper Resistant Formula, similar to the Oxycontin OP, in the beginning of 2012, it does NOTHING for my pain.   It was once a life saver before the reformulation. Now it does not work at all for me. There are no other medications that can be substituted for it. I would have given this drug all 5 stars before the reformulation.

Like most people on here it has been the only long term medication that as worked for me. Let me just fill you guys in on something. The Opana ERs are coming back out, but in December made an agreement to start making them like the Oxycontin with the coating in an attempt to help stop the epidemic of drug abuse. This change has been made. 6 months ago I would have rated this with all 5 stars however, since the change for some reason they are not as effective as they used to be, and no I am not a drug abuser. Just thought I would share this information. Dont expect everything to be roses when they get back on the market in your area. They would have probabaly been a shortage had the mishap at the factory never occured, since like I said the change was approved with the DEA in December 2011. Good Luck to all of you. I hope you had better luck than I did.

Other	35-44 Male  (Caregiver) 	4	5	3	Male	35-44	3/29/2012 12:19:03 PM	As a nurse, I have really seen a dramatic effect in my geriatric patients on Opana. On the one hand, this med seems to relieve chronic back and joint pain far more effectively at lower and less frequent doses than other narcotic analgesics especially for those who have developed a tolerance to mess like Vicodin, Percocet, and morphine. Unfortunately, Opana is often prescribed for older patients who have respiratory and other deficiencies. I see adverse events like shallow breathing and increased sleep apnea all too often. Physicians seem to dismiss the correlation because the patient is pleased with pain relief. I must emphasize that the side effects are more severe and frequent which prompted my review here and I encourage people who are newly prescribed Opana to take it initially during waking hours with someone present to monitor for rapid adverse effects that may occur regardless of how/when you've been instructed to take it. Ultimately patient safety is the patient's responsibility. My experiences have been that many high tolerance people suffer severe side effects on Opana when they are accustomed to not experiencing such problems on other narcotic analgesics.
Chronic Pain	plznopain, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	3/24/2012 1:01:14 AM	After my fibro and low back and hip pains got unbearable I was put on opana er but the insurance would not cover till I tried a lower tier drug like morphine. So I was put on Morphine Sulfate ER up to 60 mg 2x day. Then that made me so sleepy and foggy they let the opana go thru the next month.Finally got up to a working dosage of 80 mg, 2x day, when it is now off the shelf! Cold turkey! Unbelievable! I was not so sure it was even covering my pain but bam when I went off it I remembered PAIN. I had almost a week with poor pain control over this mess. My doc put all his opana patients on Exalgo ER it works if you get up to a good dose. I had to titrate up to 48 mg right away and think 64 would work better, maybe even better than opana but I don't know yet..? I DID NOT have huge opana withdrawls....don't freak out everyone!! The worst was the crying but I am having major personal issues so who knows..lol. if you have break thru meds and a strong narcotic you will not fall apart. I just haven't seen much about this so wanted to try to help somebody. Good luck! OH and hope you have insurance this stuff is made from pure gold as it costs a fortune.

Chronic Pain	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	3/15/2012 4:11:16 PM	***Just found out thru Endo Website Opana ER and several other Meds they make will be in a shortage due to change in Manuf. Process, Notice Dated 01-09-2012, no info on when this will be fixed. I had my RX partially filled, and the Pharm. owed 40. They can't locate any. I'm going to have to find an alternative with my Pain Man. Dr. for the mean time. It sure creates problems since these are Sched. 2 ****I began taking 30mg Opana ER almost 2 years ago after loss of relief from Oxycontin 60mg after they changed the formula for Oxy. I read reviews on this site and learned of Opana. I have suffered from Sciatic nerve damage since 1998. I have taken Opana x2 a day with Percocet in between, have been very satisfied. I have resisted any increase in dosage, but I may have to due to increased pain, I don't like to do that since you just keep increasing the dosage. I have a PM Dr. that doesn't think you should be pain free, just be able to tolerate the pain, even though I didn't quite agree at first, I did come to understand that philosophy, and am glad for it. Some time it is better to change than take ever larger dosages.

Chronic Pain	calmante, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	45-54	3/7/2012 7:11:37 PM	I have been taking opana 40 mg morning and 40 mg at night.  I agree with some of the comments concerning the amount of time I experience some relief.  My doctor believes it should last 12 hours; each dose.  It definitely doesn't come close to 12 hours.  I do have additional medication for break-through pain, which lasts two hours (percocet).  Sometimes I actually feel like I am in more pain after I take the opana.  I have no problem with withdrawals.  Obviously, there are times when we all run out of our meds prematurely due to having an unusual amount of severe pain. During this time on several occasions I can sense myself mentally getting significantly sharper but ofcourse the pain is always there.  I have spoken with several people who have suggested marijuana for pain relief who had been taking similar meds and have given those (my meds) up and just smoke marijuana a few times a day.  I have not tried this but I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this effect.  Need to change something!!  I have plates and screws, fused joints in 6 areas of my body due to car accident and I am looking for a change.

He was in a bad car accident that cost him the use of his left arm, his career of 15 years, and enjoying family time, the is until Opana came along. He went through several other medications with many BAD side effects. His pain doctor placed him on Opana ER 20mg/2 times a day. I was holding my breath for the pain relief and the side effects. But to my and his suprise it worked! He has had no side effects at all fron the Opana and it allows him to function, he does take a stool softner daily. He is limited but that is due to the injury of the arm. He will never get his career back but he can watch his boys play football, baseball, and karate. This is a great medication for pain relief without all the side effects. We are very thankful to the doctor that prescribed it and the company that makes it. He is having at this time increased pain and has to take something inbetween the Opana but that is only on the days he is occupational therapy for his arm.

I also take Oxycodone for breakthrough pain. My pain mgmt Dr. says Opana is a very &quot;clean&quot; drug. He also told me the reason its been so hard to find at pharmacies is because the manufacturing laboratory found in-house contamination (not from ones they already distributed)in the drugs &amp; closed down the lab briefly, but are now back up, so the drug should be more widely available by now and if not, very soon.

Opana has allowed me to have a life. The pain relief compared to the symptoms it causes is the best, I have been taking this medication for almost 2 years now and recently the dosage has gone up. It has really helped. Sure when my pain symptoms get really bad nothing helps... but otherwise opana has kept me off of my bed and with some activity.

So I asked for an alternative.   My pain Dr gave me opana.  It's wonderful. And best of all I don't feel drugged.  Constipated yes.  Does cause withdrawal symptoms over time but my pain is controled.

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	Kelly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	2/4/2012 12:51:26 PM	Opana ER has changed my life.  I have suffered with chronic pain for over 12 years due to lumbar interverbral disc disease with lumbar radiculopathy along with thoracic nerve damage and myofascial pain syndrome.  As far as opioid medication goes I have tried Tramadol, Vicodin, Morphine, and Percocet.  I am still taking percocet for breakthrough pain; however, I only need 2-3 per day on Opana ER versus 7-8 per day that was needed when I was on Morphine Sulfate ER. I take 30 mg of Opana ER every 12 hours. I never thought I would know what it is like to experience no pain ever again but Opana ER works so well that the majority of the days and nights are spent in no pain!!! Unbelievable! It costs me $250 a month after insurance which sucks.  I tried the generic oxymorphone ER and it sucked, barely got rid of any pain and put me into withdrawal. I did some research on it and found out that the generic oxymorphone ER has inferior time release technology. The Opana ER tablets have TimerX -N technology that has only been liscensed to Endo Pharmaceuticals from Penwest Pharmaceuticals for the manufacturing of Opana ER. Penwest Pharmaceuticals bought the patent from Gruenthal Pharmaceuticals in Germany. I talked to my doctor about my findings and he confirmed that the brand Opana ER definitely works better! Given that it relieves 100% of my pain for most of the day and night, it is worth the $250 in cost. The only annoying thing about it is it has to be taken on a empty stomach at least 2 hours after eating or 1 hour before eating as food increases its potency by 50%! Other than that it works great! I have built a tolerance to meds over time and the Opana ER works differently enough to be very effective for me.  Ever since starting opioid therapy 6 years ago, I haven't drank any alcohol. It is very important to NOT drink alcohol while on Opana ER as it has the potential of increasing the strength by over 270% which is likely to be fatal. DO NOT DRINK while on Opana ER!!!

I also take norco for breakthrough pain.  My Dr. and I have an agreement, as soon as I feel as if I am becoming addicted I will make him aware of it&gt;  I have already have had 1 back surgery and was unsuccessful.  My Dr. doesnt recomend another one.  but for now I am pain free (not completely though) and I do contribute it to the Opana ER.

Severe Pain	jabng, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/9/2012 6:19:12 PM	I ruptured a disk in the summer of 2002. I took just about every narcotic pain reliever that there is. The medicine just became less and less effective. This was obviously because of my growing tolerance to the meds. I was stubborn and thought I was being a &quot;tough&quot; guy, thought I would someday get relief from the back pain. I tried physical therapy numerous times. My pain became so severe that it was just intolerable. My 3rd m.r.i. confirmed that the disk was completely gone, and my vertebrate were rubbing together bone to bone. It was agonizing! The only relief I got was from opana. I then got on the road to surgery. I ended up having a spinal fusion. 4 screws and rods connecting them. the spot where my disk used to be was filled with chips from my hip and a paste-like substance that became bone-like. A year later, I am in my 5th month of recovery/work conditioning, and I am just a month or so to getting to go back to work. Opana has allowed me to go through the very painful surgery and all of the therapy that has been excrutiating at times. Now I feel in better shape than I have been in years! Opana has let me fight through the pain that I have been through. Now me and my Dr. are weening me off the drug. It is a very hard drug to get off, but I am doing it and I am on the fast track to being me again, and I was able to do all the hard work because of the relief I get from the medicine.

Between the second and third I am always nauseous (as if pregnant). I get no high and it takes about one hour +for the pain to ease off . I often wake up from the pain and am uneasy (as in withdrawal). At night I also take a 10mg cyclobenzaprine it really helps with leg cramps. Opana is VERY expencive and my nezt step is to see what else there is for me.

I've been on Opana ER for 7yrs. &amp; even at 40mg 3-4 X a day, it does becomes less effective &amp; NOT worth the $$!  To my horror, I find that my body has become so addicted that no amount of willpower can control. Beware of letting an irresponsible Dr. put you on this med. too long, you will regret it. Take care

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	still want to work cop, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	10/1/2011 2:12:38 PM	Opana ER is a Godsend! Ive had four neck surgeries and one lower back surgery. Working in law enforcement for 21 years helped me undo what the surgeons fixed and now Im on full medical leave. I heard about Opana a few years ago from a co-worker as he was taking it prior to back surgery. When I asked my doctor about Opana he had never heard of it. I still have something else to take for breakthrough pain on bad days. The Opana is great because it works without the side effects of other sch.II pain medications. When you take Oxycodone it is metabolized in the liver to oxymorphone. During the time the liver is doing its thing you get buzzed, thirsty, sleepy, etc. By taking just the oxymorphone it is like taking an over the counter pain medication but it works much better. My doctor now prescribes it more and finds the people that come back saying it doesnt work are looking to get high. Of course it does take time to find the right dosage, but if someone is taking the maximum dose like I am (120 mg. per day) and they say it does not work then they want the high from other medications. Opana allowed me to work as a sergeant in patrol division for about two years before my neurosurgeon retired me before I ended up in a wheel chair. Good medicine.      
Chronic Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	45-54	9/29/2011 8:46:19 PM	I really didn't think this medication was helping very much so I stopped taking it.  Needless to say I found out that it is helping me a great deal.  Not only does it help with the pain but it helps with my attitude toward the pain.  I am much more agreeable while taking Opana ER. I take 10 mg two times per day. 
Chronic Pain	TY!, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/23/2011 10:19:49 PM	 This medication does not affect me as my other narcotic or non-narcotic presciption pain medication has in the past.I suffer w/severe chronic neck but mostly back pain.I am physically dependant,without the medication I am in so much pain I can barely walk.I am so happy to say that opana 10mg. doesn't make me feel sleepy,dizzy,naseous,or like hydrocodone,irritable and ache throughout my body.It has only been 1 week but this is truly the most comfortable I have been since my accdint in 1993! I have been taking roxicodone i.r. 30mg. since 2005. The last 3 years I have lived in Pennsylvania, the pain managment doctor is giving me injections,different types,along w/roxi ir. I have always taken a time release medication along w/the ir. I have told my doctor the ir. does not work or have the same effect or does it help as long as well.I have suffered so much,when all the time this medication was there!Now I feel like I will be able to have a better,healthier life!I have some pain,this reminds me of my limitations!I now can look forward to spending a next to normal tomorrow and the rest of my days enyoyably with my family!!I look forward in making new friends also,due to the pain,I could not go places or even shop.The normal,practically pain-free hours to me is a taste of freedom!I am  posting this in hope to help doctors understand physical dependance as well as someone suffering and wants out of the trap of medication and the prison of pain! Thank-you to anybody that is dedicated to science,medicine,and helping the sick And injured!! GOD BLESS

Chronic Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/29/2011 10:06:54 PM	This medication is the ONLY medication that finally gave me great relief from years of chronic pain following several surgeries for endometriosis, adhesions, and intercystitial cystitis. Not only does it actually WORK on the pain, but it acts for a very long time, so you don't have to pop pills all day long OR wake up in excruciating pain. I am FINALLLY clear headed and feel like myself again! This is following years of the ups and downs on narcotics and tramadol (tramadol worked really well in the beginning and got me through a lot) and having side effects such as agitation, depression, and euphoria. Oh my gosh...I feel as though this medication has saved my life and given me some sanity back! Thank you to the makers of this medication!!!!!

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	lumbar disaster, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	1	1	Male	45-54	7/9/2011 1:54:39 PM	I have destroyed my lumbar spine and hips from repetitive injuries in the fire service.  Over the yrs I have worked up the opioid ladder with oxycontin at the top 200mg 80/ 40 /80  WORKED PERFECT {aside from constipation } My pain management doctor decided to lower my dose which caused withdrawal issues. The answer was to switch to Opana ER 40 mg x 2 with oxycodone 15 mg BT ..Sheer hell !  Worst withdrawal for 2 weeks and severe pain. I just cannot get used to this medication. I have read that its because oxycodone/hydrocodone are a different animal, vs. oxymorhone Opana/ hydromorphone Dilaudid/ morphine Kadian / and heroine being of similar origin and effect. So most people complaining about the drug seem to have been on oxycodone or hydrocodone.  ALSO This drug is VERY has a huge risk of overdose if taken with alcohol or benzodiazapines such as klonopin, Zanax, Ativan,Valium etc. No second chance folks..you go to sleep and stop breathing as is the risk with all opioids..But this one is VERY sensitive to such things or  just taking a double dose by accident.  I found a story of a 32yr old injured Marine who took 2 -40s by mistake..Dead ! Also I have heard of street use killing people at alarming numbers thinking Opana is just another oxycontin.  Lastly, my Md stated that the Opana will be reformulated soon into a more taper resistant version that will lower the effectiveness as happened to oxycontin last year.
Chronic Pain	susana77, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	7/5/2011 10:57:11 PM	I started with low dose 10mg was still taking Ultram and percocet then was increased to 20mg when I noticed WEIGHT GAIN was NOT prepared for this so now having to decrease and will be switching to something else,as many have mentioned I to have tried many Opiods and wanted to try this fairly new drug it's unfortunate that the one major side effect for me is the increase in weight plus the high cost is just not worth it for ME. If anyone has had same issues and found something better I would sure love to know please share.thank you!living with chronic pain is miserable and so painful let's hope that I can find something that will work without the weight gain.

Chronic Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/1/2011 3:37:11 PM	I find with Opana ER...you either LOVE it or Hate it with a lot of people. I absolutely LOVE it. I have been on it for years for chronic pain with minimal side effects. My only complaints are that it is VERY expensive(even with insurance), a lot of pharmacies don't carry it and when I was admitted to the hospital a few times, the hospital didn't stock it and it had to be substituted with Oxycontin or MScontin which weren't as effective or potent as the Opana ER.

While it helps with the pain, I have a low tolerance with opioids and I am allergic to morphine and if I take more than 2 in a day my skin start itching so bad that I scratch until I almost bleed.  To counteract the itching, I take Benadryl.  I cannot take Opana at night because the itching keeps me up all night.  I can only take it for 2 days in a row and then I have to stop for a couple of days.  Most of the time I take 1 Percocet in the morning to help with the morning pain, alternate ice packs, moist heat, and my tens unit fill in. I wish I didn't have that reaction because it does help with my pain.

Fentanyl patches became ineffective after approx. 2 yrs, so we switched to Opana. Have adjusted the dosage a bit and still need to take percocet for break-through pain at least once or twice a day, but I don't have problems with drowsiness or dizziness.  I take the medication for chronic low back pain following 4 surgeries, including laminectomies and L5-S1 fusion with nerve damage in my left foot.

I began opana 30 2x daily , with little effect. Increased to 40 mg 2x daily w / 10/350 oxycodone 4x daily for breakthru pain. Better results. Recently my condition worsened, pain increased Dr changed to 70mg 2x daily + same breakthru med. Results are as good as oxycontin er 80 mg 2x daily. This is a very good replacement for oxycontin in comperable dosage.

I had to quit using the patch b/c i could never get them to stick.I tried everything!I sweat so much from my job and constantly shower and change uniforms I would always loose them and then stress about running out and not having any. I fought this for a year and a half. Opana is a prayer answered if you have the same problems.I have been prescriped numerous meds in the past and the Opana for me has worked better than anything! Very few minor side effects for me.Extremly happy with this med!

The nausea can be a bit inconvenient at times, but usually if I take them with some crackers or dry toast and lay down for a half hour after taking it helps.

Severe Pain with Opioid Tolerance	Hootie,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female		3/4/2011 5:18:54 AM	I've got severe case of fibromyalgia, herniated discs, ddd, spondylosis, lumbar and cervical bad pain from car accident almost 20 yrs ago.  Had to go off methadone for arrhthmia sp and ran the gamut on other meds.  I started this yesterday and wish I was on a higher dose than 20mgs but you gotta start slow I understand.  I think 40mgs will do it and we'll add the IR for breakthrough eventually.  I like how it doesn't affect my head much and I'm pretty confident that this will be a good med for me to stay on.  As soon as we get the dosages right.  Glad to see others are doing well on Opana ER.  Happy pain-free days all.

Chronic Pain	trulyhappy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/2/2011 5:41:17 PM	I was given Opana ER 4 years ago for cronic severe pain because nothing eles worked for me, I had Western Equine Incephititis when i was 12 yrs, old. i survived leaving doctors baffled as to why i had lived and the other 14 children in the neighborhood died or were permently mentaly &amp; physically damaged for what ever life they had left.I am 49 now and over the years things have been going wrong with my brain that cause severe pain,numbness in all extremities randomly,insomnia,migrains,and alot of other unpleasent things too. who knows whats to come as I get older? for aprox.34 years I have seen every doctor,of every kind about my slowly growing list of constant physical problems and have taken every drug under the sun even offering myself for experimental drug testing,just so I could make it through a day with out pain and sleep without pain. when I moved to AZ. my P.C.P sent me to a pain clinic...again...and they finally put me on opana ER, it worked! 0ne 40mg. pill 3 times daily,plus the percocet for break throughs and klonopin for the random extreme panic attacks and 2mg of xanax to sleep with. I was so happy! I was down to 4 bottles of pills that worked insted of buckets of pill bottles that did not work,and best of all I could have a kinda normal lifestyle, I did not have to go to 10-12 dr appt. a week for more tests,mri,ct,eeg..ect.. all the time. Finally!!now my biggest problem is the drug is so expensive that when my husband lost his job and insurance the cost is $3500.00 for a three month prescription,and ACCES won't pay for it I am screwed big time! I need help now and have no where to go to get it? with out my meds my life is not worth living,the pain will eat me alive!

I've had 4 major lower back surgeries, the last a 360 fusion L4-S1. Info for penquin2212. Be patient; this med will work for you. The methadone you were on is still blocking. More advice than review; give this med some time before complaining. I've taken every pain med available, the one thing I have learned when transisioning to a new med is to give it time. Changing your primary med occasionally is a good thing. It allows you to self evaluate your pain. I know there is a lot of anxiety associated with changing, but it is for your own benefit. Just be patient.

It is agony beyond words, but with Rx help like Opana, I've been able to function as a wife &amp; mother again. Until it's available in generic, it'll be very expensive. To all those who know the devastation of severe pain, I will keep you in my thoughts &amp; prayers. Good Luck &amp; Take Care.

It exposes me to infection no matter how cautious I am. Fortunately I'm blessed with a Dr. willing to listen &amp; not give up 'til we got the right combination of Rxs. I use Opana ER 3 x a day. Although I will never be pain free,I believe this' as close as I can expect. Of course, with all meds. that offer help, but is not available in generic, it's very expensive, so good luck affording it. God Bless &amp; Good Luck

I took 20mg of Opana ER about an hour and a half ago and I have a pounding headache and feel very nauseated. This is the 3rd time I've gotten a horrible headache like this. I don't think I will take this med anymore. It does not take away my pain either. Looks like I will go back to my fentanyl patch. Also, as do other narcotics, this causes extreme constipation.
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	Semtex, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	19-24	1/5/2011 8:32:24 PM	I have severe chronic back pain due to damaged discs and they want to do a spinal fusion at 22 years old i refuse to do such a thing at my age. i was started on percocet 5/325 and those ended up working for 4 hours at a time like clock work i took 2 every 4 hours just to manage.being a car mechanic did not help my situation either. they put me on Oxycontin 30mg 3x day and oxy 5's 4x for breakthrough then i switched to opana 40mg 2x a day eventually going all the way up too 40mg 4x day. with hydromorphone 4mg 4x day for breakthrough. i built tolerance very quickly to this medication. but it works wonders! it lasts so much longer then oxy. i eventually told the doctor to take my dose down each script was running my insurance company $2000 a month and i had a 5grand copay at the start of each year which made it so expensive. so im down to 20mg 2x a day and 10mg IR 2x a day but im starting to become tolerant again. i went through withdrawal  to attempt to bring my tolerance down due to the expense $$$$$ of the drug. restlessness is horrible i was up for 4 days even with some suboxone and zanaflex. restlessness and complete misery will haunt you for a week and then of course the pain comes back when you withdrawal. then the pain became worst then the withdrawal and i started back on again. but or else it works wonders! dont stop taking it the worst comes around the 3rd day. u will not sleep toss and turn and your pain will be worst then it usually is when u come off. and building tolerance will occur quickly for some especially me. but at the right dose and tolerance it works great. But it can make u sleep way too much be careful about that. i have slept through my alarm clock several times. its not that it makes you fall asleep but its when u try and wake up that its difficult.

NEVER cut this medicine it could be fatel. I never get tired.I've had 7 back surguries, several failed.I have a very high tolerance for medication and pain. I only get 5 hours relief and take 3 a day.    in case you're wondering I was hit by a car crossing the street, 35 years ago. The driver was traveling 55 in a 25 mph in the wrong lane, I went through his windshield and was tossed 80 feet.the driver, No insurance. My life of surgeries, no fun.

I was on methadone for 4 years and decreased my dose from 40mg 3x a day in 2006 to 25 mg a day in 2010.The Opana wears off at about 8 hours, and I'm in pain until I can take the next dose. I'm going back to my Pain Mgt DR in 7 days to try something else.A higher dose of this drug may work but the copays are over $100/month.

Did help with pain along with 5mg. oxycodone 4x a day and Robaxin 4x a day.  Just had surgery at Laser Spine Institute in Tampa and now it's too strong for me already.  I am happily getting off of it asap.  Run to LSI.com for microscopic laser instead of open back surgery! Praise God they cut bone from my nerve root without more trauma to my back.

Basically, I did nothing but sleep. I'm going to talk to my doctor and tell him I am decreaseing the dosage to 1/2 of one pill.

Chronic Pain	rayday, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/15/2010 3:47:25 PM	I had a horrible car accident 8 years ago and it messed up by lower back. I now have 3 bulging discs and beginning to have arthritis too, and I am only 27 yrs old!After my accident, I went to an orthopedic surgeon, who refused to do surgery b/c of my age, but told me that I would have to have surgery once I got into my 30's. My age has been a problem for me b/c Dr do not like to prescribe narcotics to young adults. I have had 5 facet injections to my spine and 3 epidural injections, all of them provided minimal relief for less then 2 weeks, and they were very very expensive. The last epidural injection I received actually made my back pain worse b/c the dr. did something wrong during the procedure. The ortho dr prescribed my hydrocodone 10mg 2x per day, which was no where near enough b/c I worked as a server and was also a full time college student. I asked for something more effective, that is when he started the injections. After my last one, the dr refused to see me b/c I said he must have done something wrong b/c my pain is a lot worse. I started going to a pain clinic 3yrs ago and they started me on opana 5mg, since then I have been gradually increased on my dose, and I am now taking the 20mg along with percocet 10mg 1xday for breakthrough. I have to say that the opana is the best medicine for people with chronic pain!! I can now work, go to school, workout, pretty much anything I want b/c of this medicine. It has gave me my life back without the horrible injections. I recommended it for anyone who has chronic pain!!! I still will have to have back surgery eventually, but until then I can still live a normal life.

Wish me luck! my pain lvl was decreased to 5-6 w/ 20 mg opana but now 7. This medicine is wonderfull if prescribed efficently for your condition.The main thing with this medicine is slight side effects.I recommend that all pain sufferers ask for this as it works well for reducing pain lvl to a tolerable lvl without sever side effects; however your dosage will need to be increased yearly or suffering a coulpel mnths so meds will be as effective. Too bad it is exspensive. Hopefully a generic is in the near future. God bless all who suffers chronic pain, may god bless you w/ a new life after the rapter!!!!

I had a disectomy in 2006 that left me with stenosis, and then had a double fusion (L5/L6) last year. I have been on hydrocodone, oxycodone, oxycontin and embeda. I also take 350mg of soma 3xs a day. I took embeda for a week and couldnt handle the nausea, so am starting the Opana 10mg 2xs a day today. I have read a bunch of these reviews and am optimistic and hoping this may be the one finally. Even on embeda and soma, i have constant, dibilitating pain. I have DDD and spinal stenosis.

This medication is GREAT...if taken a Dr. prescribes. When I first started taking it, the dose was too low, so my Dr. adjusted. If you are not getting the relief you need, tell your Dr. Be honest with the person treating you or they cannot treat you effectively.  My throat was so swollen after spine surgery that I couldn't take Percocet prescribed by surgeon.  The Opana ER was a life saver, small pill that has slippery coating. Again, communicate with your Dr., it will make your life easier and your Dr.'s job easier. Feeling some pain is not a bad thing, No medicine can take all your pain away.

Dosen't relieve all but relieves alot all the time making sleeping better. Bad side is always prone to a nap at anytime anywhere. Makes me very sleepy at random times. I guess when it kicks in. Overall better taking two pills per day with a extra vic for break thru as needed than 6-10 vics everyday. Nothing is 100% but this so far after six months is the best for me for now.

My Pain Management doctor (legit) is super cautious when it comes to prescribing meds. I live in constant pain, have a metal plate in my neck and rods and screws just above my tailbone.  Have finally been diagnosed as unable to work and am on disability.  Not only is the pain unbearable on certain days, but the depression one experiences is definitely life altering.  I feel for anyone that has back issues.

I had to quit using the patch b/c i would get a rash from the adhesive.  I have also been prescriped oxycontin &amp; ms contin in the past and the Opana for me has worked better than both of those.

Chronic Pain	penincali, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/12/2010 2:42:06 AM	 I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in '96. Also have 3 old major injuries, made worse by the fibro. Have been on every drug that is supposed to help chronic pain, got toxic twice from acetaminophen, (percocet then norco) finally prescribed Opana about 1 year ago. It is a miracle drug for me, I am able to do a lot more things with my grandkids now! The only side effect I don't like is the withdrawals if not taken on time.. there have been times I had to wait 3 or 4 days for my refills, (due to slow response at the clinic I have to go to) at which time I use Valerian Root Extract to help ease withdrawal symptoms. I only wish this drug had been around from the beginning! Sure would have saved a lot of trial and error, as my body doesn't like drugs. I used to have bad headaches due to a car accident in which my neck was injured (the 2 top vertebra. those are gone and I have eliminated the drug used for them.

So they started me on Opana ER 30mg every 12 hrs. didnt help so they up my dosage to 40 mg every 12 hrs. works a little but i still have to take the percocte 2 times a day.

So far Opana is the first thing that actually takes my pain level from a 10 to a 3-4. I can get up and do things again!!! **Can anyone please tell me what all is in this med? I have heard that it is a mix of Morphine &amp; oxicontin and I have heard that it's Oxicontin &amp; Dilantin. I just would like to know what EXACTLY I am taking.** but whatever it works great!

Opana ER brought it down to a 4 but had to bump it up to 40 mg every 12 hrs after just 3 months, plus 10 mg Opana up to 4 a day for breaktrhough pain. Most of the time pain is at a 3 and managable now. You do not get the highs and lows of a narcotic medication.Does not make me light headed...very little drug haze feeling. Constipation is a serious probelm. Take Miralax every day in combination now and finally have some pain relief I can live with.

The Dr. perscribed this medication for me but I didn't fill it because of the cost.  A few days later I could barely make it out of bed.  I broke down and went and had it filled.  I finally slept thru the night and by morning the pain was gone.  Expensive, but when you are in so much pain you will try just about anything.  I hope it continues to work!

The feeling of wanting to vomit constantly and  constipation, makes taking this medicine no more effective than Loritab.  At least with loritab I didn't have the side effects as with opana er.  Also having to time taking this medicine with eating is really hard to keep up with for an older person like myself.

It hurt so bad to get out of bed some mornings and the thought of having an intimate relationship with my husband couldn't happen because of the chronic pain. Since starting the Opana ER, I am able to function and I still hurt but not to the extent of which I was hurting before.

I have taken many many many diff meds. and the perocet 10/650 2 4xs a day was what I was on then I was put on Opana and my head has not stop pounding since I have started taking this med. The pain in my right leg has gotten worse. Opana has done nothing but cause me more pain. I have never been on oxycotin but I have heard that it has helped alot of people. Has anyone switched from Opana to Oxycotin? and if so did the Oxycotin help more with your pain? I have also been told that there is a 30 mg oxycodone that is time release. Has anyone tried that? If so did it help with your pain?

Norco just wansnt helping me as it use too. They switched me to Opana being a time release for longer relief and can say my pain is still there but is an easy 4/5. I grew concerned since I was on Norco for a long duration that it wouldnt take effect like it maybe should, but it does.

Chronic Pain	SunnyBSling, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	4/26/2010 9:44:47 AM	Thank you all for writing Reviews, I am hopeful that Opana ER 40 mg. will work for me. I begin taking it today (after getting it cleared by Ins.Co.) I had to put the stars beause it was a requirement but I have yet to take the first dose. I will write again after I take it for a while. I am currently an the Fentynal Duragesic patch and experiencing too many side effects so I took it off last night around 11:00pm and slept badly. I also take hydrocodone for breakthrough and took some this morning. I will pray for all of us who suffer chronic pain. It is worse than natural childbirth (herniated, slipped discs and impinged siatic nerve)! Get back to all later. Wish me luck and God bless you all who read this. SunnyBTucson

I was given a prescription for Methadone but it made me sick and I ended up having stomach issues from not being able to go to the bathroom. So, my pain specialist gave me Opana 10mg 2 times a day. I have feel some relief an hour after i take it but it lasts only a few hours and I can't take the other for 12 hours. The breakthrough pain is horrific and is pretty much all day. I'm soon switching medications. Opana was a waste of my time and money.

Chronic Pain	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/15/2010 10:55:37 PM	I have arthritis and it is the perfect medication for long term pain relief, i take 15 mg extended release 2 times a day and it completely take my pain away. Opana is long acting or me and I felt absolutely no side effects... which is rare in me, I have an extremely sensitive body. I would recommend it to anyone to struggles with long term, ongoing pain that doesn't going away with other medications. My Doctor also gave me quick release Opana 5 mg for &quot;break-through&quot; pain, this didn't work as well as the extended release. I don't recommend the quick release for sudden pain, but while taking Opanas 2 times a day I rarely need to take another type of pain killer.

Chronic Pain	ld1956, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	4/7/2010 11:57:42 PM	This drug takes too long to &quot;kick-in&quot;. I take 40mg 2x a day, but still have severe pain before the next dose is due. I did try taking it before the next dose was due. I did get very dizzy. I have had back pain for several years, and I had taken Talwin. My pain management doctor felt I was on Talwin too long, and switched me to Opana. I started @ 10mg which did nothing for me. I ended up @ 40mg twice a day. I need to find something that is strong enough, but is stronger than Opana, and lasts longer. It does help, but too little for too short an amount of time for severe pain.

Pain persists. This Rx was a life saver. I was up to 20mg ER twice a day and a breakthrough. After 5 months or so my tolerance peaked. Doctor does not want to go higher than 20mg. We tried ER morphine. It works ok but the Opana is the best. With my new health plan it costs me $160.00 per month. Ouch.

They have had me on everything from loratab to Morphine! This really works!! It last for 11-12 hours with no side effects. I have been taking it for about 6 months and it is the only med that I have had that I can actually get up and at least get back to some of the things I was doing before. Sometimes I get a head of myself and Over do it because it works so well. I am on Oxycodone for break through pain which I rarely use but get just in case!!

Chronic Pain	wolfing, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	1/13/2010 10:00:09 AM	  I have just started Opana ER 20 MG one tab every 12 hrs starting about two weeks ago.Before starting Opana my family doctor had prescribed Hydroco/APAP 7.5 every four hours. Explaining to my family doctor the Hydroco/7.5 was all but worthless and left me unable to do just the most normal of things in life, she sent me to a Pain Management Center.   In 2003 I was operated on for bulging L4 and L5 disc. A new MRI shows severe disc protrusion; sever degeneration L4/L5, causing low back pain, radiculopathy to the hip, both legs, right foot.The pain being so incapacitating, just walking or laying down was an exercise in how much pain I was able to stand. I have been living on one an a half, to two hours of sleep for years. I would awaken as if someone had hit me in the lower back and legs with a hammer, take two Hydroco/7.5. Enhance it with a shot of whiskey, just to be able to get a little more sleep! Yes; I understand; a not so smart move, but I was at the end of my line.   Being prescribed Opana has been a God sent; I have had the first good nights sleep in years. No side effects at all, so far!

My frequency and severity of breakthough pain is minimal and well controlled with the short acting Opana as well.

At first I thought that it wasn't helping and so the doctor gave me Opana IR  for the break-through pain. When I started taking both of them together I was over-joyed! Finally something is working!  I have 3 herniated discs, 3 impinged nerves, and an AC joint seperation in my right shoulder. I had taken all sorts of pain pills including percocet, vicodin, methadone, etc.. My body became immune to those. Nothing was helping! And finally I found a medicine that is AMAZING!!!!Please if your doctor gives this medicine to you do yourself a favor and try it!

Now I use Opana 15mg ER ea 12 hours and 1 - 2 oxycodone 10/325 as needed.  This is a much better cobmination for me with a better over all pain relieving result, and I no longer miss doses.

Diagnosed by 3 different doctors.  Referred to a Pain Specialist and have been treated there for approximately 8 years.  I have tried many different medications including Vicodin, OxyContin, Methadone, Morphine, Duragesic Fentynal Patch, and many non-narcotic meds.  I have been taking Opana for almost 2 years.  I take 120 mg/twice a day.  They wear off before the 12 hours, like many have said, but I have Xodol for breakthrough pain.  I have developed a tolerance for narcotics, hence the relatively high doses.  Opana has been more effective than most everything I've tried, but because of insurance limits, cannot go up on dose, and Opana is very expensive. I don't notice that Opana makes me drowsy or less alert, so that's not a problem.  I am fatigued anyway from the Fibromyalgia, but am not any worse taking the medication.  Constipation is a problem, but I am taking other meds that cause constipation also, so not sure how much of a problem it would be on its own. I would recommend Opana if there is a need for continual chronic pain relief.  It has helped me and I can function as well as possible.

For some reason I'm having trouble seeing out of my left eye,it goes away after a couple of hours. Over-all I think it's going to work! I stated with 20mg and had to be raised to 40mg on the 4 day so it seems to be better.

I had a sever injuries to spine in 2000, this ruptured several disc and lead to several surgies.To repair the damage dics. The disc injuries also cause sever pain and as involve spinal cord in volvment. I have two numb legs with frequent pain course down them. the dics below the injurie have stated to deteriortate. I currently take 20 mil 2x along with Lortab 10/500 lortab to combat the sever break thur pain. Opana Er has allowed me to comtinue with my choson profession arms. I have some good days, but they are few are far between. I can perform some of the duties expected of a 1SG in regions of constant confilt. Opana er has allowed me to finish out military severice in which the plethora of drugs given to me before only worked for limit times. After being injuried in OIf and the in OEF, i have found that i can lead from the front form where a 1SG should be at.

I took 1 10mg pill this morning and I felt very foggy headed or brain dead all day and extreamly tired. It was a horrible feeling. This med reduced my pain by about 60% but I think I would rather take 10MG of Vicodin and feel only some pain relief and still feel somewhat alive. Maybe this doesn't mix well with the Elavil...does anyone know?Zombie

I find the drug to be effective with absolutely no side effects; for me. I do not feel anything except I can move around w/ ease and stated working out again which I just love. I feel like I'm human again.The best part AHHH to feel normal again. That's wonderful. I find the opana ER to be a blessing. I have read that some of you out there donot like if they are used to oxicontin...I say stick with the opana no it DOES I repeat DOES NOT give any rush of euphoric feeling. De-program your thinking.Atleast try for a week solid. This medicine does its job without me even feeling like you're on anything. I trust my brilliant Dr. Luis Cervantes   
Chronic Pain	DreamAngel629, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	9/21/2009 6:32:22 PM	Since I have been on OpanaER, which is almost 6 months,  I have seen a significant decrease in my pain levels.  Within 2 - 3 days my pain level went from a 9 to a 6-7. For me that is a big deal.  I was on Oxycotin for over 3 years, which to me, at the amount I was taking was doing nothing.  Someone made a remake to me that when her sister stopped taking Oxycotin she actually felt better.  At the time I didnt believe her, but now I do.  Being on 140mg twice a day, plus all the other meds, I was ready to put a gun to my head.  When my doctor switched me to OpanaER as a trial, I couldnt believe the relief I felt.  Today, I am able to function better and life feels better.  I will be in pain, probably for the rest of my life, but anyone out there who is sceptical about Opana.  Just try it!  If u are like me or other who agree with me, what do u have to lose, but the PAIN.  Good luck and I will keep everyone in my prayers.  BTW, Boss, Thank you.

I was leary at first as it a schedule II narcotic and my pharmacist warned against it.  However, the benefits have far outweighed the risk for me.  I only take it twice per day instead of several times with the other narcotics.  I never got that jittery, drugged feeling that I associate with strong pain medications.  It only helps to relieve the pain and helps with my energy level.  The only drawback that I have experienced is that Opana takes a while to get into your system and does not help with break through pain.  I sometimes still have to take the other narcotics that I was trying to get away from but not in anywhere near as high a dose or as often.  It does wear off a few hours before it is supposed to but if you take it on the same set schedule you can work around that.  I would reccommend this medicine for anyone who is expected to require pain medication for an extended period of time.

I've had several nerve blocks(16) and take Opana 30mg 3xday plus Roxicodone 30mg 3xday for breakthru pain.  I,ve really been disappointed with the Opana.  Roxicodone helps a little bit with the breakthru pain.  Have explained this to my pain doctor (which I really like) but he hasn't listened one bit.  I guess I'll just have to live with the pain.
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	Looking for a new doc, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	8/29/2009 7:34:41 PM	I was on 180 mg of Roxicodone daily for chronic back pain (3 bulging disks).  When my doctor stopped practicing here I had to find a new doctor, which was not easy.  With the blasted DEA bothering doctors they all seem to be terrified of people in pain.  I finally found a new doctor, but he wanted to drop my dosage from 180 to 120 mg daily.  I had no choice, actually.  I've had increased pain ever since, but I'm afraid to tell him because he's not a nice guy.  Just over 1 week ago, his new PA prescribed me 2 10 mg Opana daily.  The pain was overwhelming.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't work.  I called the PA, but 3 days later I still have no response.  So I e-mail the office mgr., who gets me in to see the Dr. within 2 days.  So I had this insane idea he was going to HELP me.  Instead he yells at me because he's angry that these pills don't work.  He's trying to force me into surgery.  He wants me to bring these crappy pills in so he can COUNT them and exchange them for a script for my usual 120 mg Roxicodone.  When I complained that they were weak he said they were some of the strongest pills available.  Then why is he so angry?  I looked these up online only to find that they swapped my 120 mg daily Roxicodone for the Opana equivalent of 40 mg.  Obviously I'm selling my prescriptions or addicted to them...Whatever!  Time for a new doctor.  I will need lots of luck finding one.  Any doctor would have to be better than that one.  I was mortified when he notified his whole office staff right in front of me that the prescription was not to be released to me until I brought in the old Opanas to be counted.

It's true if you've had head swellng it will make it worse. I take it everyday and vicodin es on the side for break through pain. Together they work most of the time. Winter I hurt alot more than summer. This drug is better for me mentally and physically than percocet, suboxone, and morphine. I have severe back pain for many yrs and I have to live with it in my lumbar disc.

Chronic Pain	JSFMIKE, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	55-64	8/6/2009 5:00:56 PM	In 1993 had tumor wrapped around spinal cord in my neck. Neuropathic pain started in 95 and got continually worse. Started on Neurontin. By 98 syrinx developed in the cord. Started on vicodin. As syrinx got larger it interfered with myelomalaccia (hole in cord) and pain got very bad. Started on Duragesic. Reached 100 mgc in a few years. In 2007 pain doctor started program to wean off of it and replaced it with Opana. It was a six month process, mostly spent in bed due to the pain. Currently at 80 mg twice a day. The pain level is tolerable and I returned to work. Taking Celebrex, Baclofen, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Tramadol to help control osteoarthritis throughout the spine, cramps and spasms in the legs and arms, neuropathic pain in the torso, and pain in torso and limbs. The Cymbalta helps with my mood. It's quite a mix of drugs but work is possible. The Opana allowed me to reduce amounts of other meds. The Duragesic was so high that I tried to sleep through too many days and had to take Provigil to counter. Opana doesn't do that.

Chronic Pain	mizjet, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	55-64	8/1/2009 11:41:40 AM	Opana has worked wonders for me as far as reducing my back and neck pain after 6 spinal surgeries. There are a few side effects that are bothersome to me though.  As others have stated, it wears off about 2 hours sooner that it should and often my pain level is low enough to skip a dose.  But I can't do that because of the withdrawal symptoms (skin crawling, nervousness, etc.).  But there is one other that I haven't seen anywhere.  After it kicks in, my eyesight gets blurry.  Not enough to where I can't see, but it is hard to read anything.  Has anyone else noticed this happening to them?  I do have the beginning of cataracts, but it is very slight and the blurrines goes away when the Opana wears off.  This is beginning to concern me and I would like to know what you all think of this.  Thanks for your help.  I hate to give up on it, because it sure has helped with my pain.

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	Cressa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	7/27/2009 1:49:33 PM	I just wrote on the review for the fentanyl patch. I started Opana ER (10 mg-2x day) with Percocet for breakthrough pain.  I have had 4 shoulder surgeries (botched) and the last ended up as total shoulder replacement.  I have tried a myriad of opiates and by far this is the WORST. For those of you just starting to take this, DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL.  It will make you sick. Even a glass of wine will give you side effects.  I do not believe the pain has been helped either.  I just switched from Kadian(good results-bad constipation) because I had been on/off it for years.  It definitely does NOT work as well as others. Also be extremely careful, as this med seems to alter my balance. If ANYONE knows of another long term opiod that they have had great results from I would GREATLY appreciate any help. (Oxycontin-doesnt work for me-cannot stay awake. AT ALL! Felt very drugged on Oxy.  THANKS TO ANYONE WITH ANY INFO!
Severe Pain with Opioid Tolerance	Aislinn09, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/26/2009 5:23:44 AM	I started taking OxyContin on 01-27-2003. I started on 10 mg/12 hours, then in 10/2006, my dosage was raised to 20 mg OxyContin every 12 hours.A friend of mine gave me Opana 20 mg once when I'd run out of my regular OxyContin, and I noticed that Opana worked better than the OxyContin.So, when I started seeing a neurosurgeon who's a pain control specialist, he switched me to Opana full time. It works (for me) much better than OxyContin as it takes care of the pain better, and there was no adjustment period where I was high for 5 days, getting used to it.I like it for these reasons -- it works quite well, lasts 10-12 hours for me, anfd I only need breakthrough pain meds during my period, as the cramps exacerbate the osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis, degenerative disk disease (my entire lumbar area, from L2 on down to S1) and manages to put me in Hell for a week.Thanks for reading.

The opana helps IMMENSELY with my pain but i have now found it to be EXTREMELY addictive for me. But it is the only pain medication that has ever helped me with my pain. Just be careful and watch for the signs of dependence on this drug! 
Chronic Pain	up2ujs, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	7/22/2009 8:19:27 AM	I just recently been taking it for about 3 months. Dr took me off methodone that I was on for about 4 yrs. It  became ineffective. The problem is when Dr took me off of 160 mg of methadone he replaced it with only 10 mg of Opana twice a day. I felt like I was going through withdraws I was actually it was the worst 2 weeks of my life. He bumped it up to taking it every 8 hrs. But that is not doing it either. If I take 2 every 6 hrs it is very helpful. The pain specialist came to the this town then moved huis business over to anesthesia so I am back to my family Dr treating me for this. I have been declared disabled for 4 yrs because of this and the pain is simply unexplainable to someone that doesnt have it. I was trying to get research on it to determine dosage amounts to both get rid of this pain but also not get the dosage to high so that there is room to move it up if I need it as time goes on. I am very thankful for the card that this company gave to pts becaue it is expinsive. Thank You.

Along with fibromyalgia, migraines, &amp; now seizures(most recent left me unconscious for 4 days), my quality of life has been getting progressively worse. I was on 4 100 mg. of Morphine &amp; pain Dr. would not go any higher, so I'm now on 3 40 mg. Opana ER as main pain med. I still have to take Fentanyl pops, muscle relaxers, &amp; more w/o complete relief, but any help is welcome. I'm lucky enough to have a Dr. who listens &amp; if we discuss a med. &amp; there's a possiblity it'll help, he will include it to a long list of meds. I already use. Opana ER does seem to work well with other meds. with no side effects for me. Hope all those in pain out there that there's relief for you ASAP. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES.

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	7/6/2009 1:00:36 AM	I use this as for periods of breakthrough pain when my Fentanyl transdermal patch 100 mcg/48 hrs is not enough to take the edge off my severe, chronic mid-low back and bilateral lower extremity pain caused by T8 - S1 DDD&amp;DJD, foraminal and central canal stenosis, extruded discs @ levels L3-4, L4-5, and L5-S1.  The pain center halted all use of methadone after studies found Q-wave abnormalities in long-term users and moved me to Opana. It is the best tablet pain reducer I've used since the original injury in 1988. In addition, it works in less than 30 minutes. When the pain needle starts pressing on 8/10, this will quickly and quietly bring things back to a more manageable 5 or 6/10 range.

New pain mgmt doc switched me from 400mg demerol to 5mg opana 2x day-absolutely no pain relief!  He is raising to 10mg,  I can't believe this is supposed t/b 100x stronger than other pain relievers.  At least the demerol made a dent in my pain.  Also, the 1hr before meals or 2hr after tends t/b an inconvience.

I told the Dr how it has been upsetting my stomach, even with food.  He then came back into my room with this Opana information and wanted me to try it.  He wrote it for 5 mg but the pharmacy only had 10's so he rewrote it and I was just amazed!!  One pill kept me the most pain free I have been in years.  Don't know if I mentioned I have a bad back with degenerative disk disease.  Why didn't he think of this sooner?  I highly recommend anyone to try it who is at their wits end with this pain that nothing seems to help.  Thanks, feeling better in Ohio

Once I finally took the injury seriously(got to the point that I couldn't get out of bed without my husbands help)I did everything..6 weeks of physically therapy, epidural, trigger point injections. In the meantime of course I was put on medications. After a year of being on short acting meds, I was eating them like candy. 5 mg lortab.The pharmacist was the one who told me to ask for something more effective. So they started me on 10 mg Lortab, and then Oxycotin. They worked great &amp; I could control my pain effectively. Then Oxycotin was no longer available as a generic, and I had to switch my long acting meds. I was prescribed 10 mg Opana twice a day. It worked great! I was apprehensive b/c it took the doctors so long to finally get my medications right to effectively control my pain. Opana worked so well, that most of the time I only have to take the first dose in the am, and then supplement with lortab throughout the day. I also take 20 mg flexeral and 1 mg xanax every night at bedtime. My quality of life is so much better. However, my insurance changed and they would only cover generic meds. Opana was $164.00/mo and was costly since I was laid off back in January. So now my insurance company says try Methadone. I think methadone is very effective too, but I don't like the stereotype that goes with methadone...which is your a heroin addict. People in the health industry and who deal with pain, know that methadone is an effective pain management medication. However, I still prefer Opana over Oxycotin, MS Cotin( which Did NOT work for me), and Methadone. FINALLY found a doctor who cared, and wants to help fix my back-MRI showed that I have 2 herniated discs, plus nerve damage, spondylosis, and degenerative discs. So I just had my 2nd epidural 5 days ago, and the jury is still out. I know my back pain has greatly improved, but the shooting pains down both legs are suppose to be a temporary side effect from it. 
Chronic Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	45-54	5/21/2009 10:41:18 AM	I have mixed connective tissue disease, DDD, and arthritis with severe pain neck, back and hips for years. I have taken Kadian before with such severe constip. had to change. Opana er does where off after 4 hrs, must be taken with empty stomach, causes severe itching with me,and so many sweats and chills I cant sleep. I am getting ready to start a med for rheumatoid arthritis called Arava. Hope this helps my pain. Its not a narcoic but works with the immune system.  I am tinking of not taking any pain meds that are extended release, they dont work.. make me dizzy, anxious, itch, and have nausea and vomiting.  wish I could find an answer.

I am currently on 60mg of AVINZA (morphine) however it doesn't last the 24 hours its supposed to. My doctor doesnt want me on short acting medications such as Vicodin because the abuse level where I live is so high Doctors are afraid to prescribe. It took me over a year to find a doctor to treat me for the Chronic Pain because no one where I live wants to. My pain is not back related. I have chronic pelvic pain due to 6 abdominal surgeries in 6 years. Does anyone know if this only works for Back Pain. Any suggestions on how to get my Doctor to take me seriously? I honestly believe she thinks i am faking.

Lets see if just taking the 40mg tabs work alone.

I take it three times a day instead of two because extended release pain medications usually don't work after eight hours for me. Before I started taking Opana, I was taking MS Contin.  The MS Contin seemed to give me anxiety.  The Opana doesn't give me anxiety at all.  Also, it works a lot better for me than the MS Contin did.

Now thru pain management I am started on Opana 10 mgs 1 every 12 hours.Thank You God and Pain Management. I have always managed my pain well and to be honest I like to have a little pain to remind me to watch what I take. Have a new CT coming up so I suspect I will be bumped up a little as far as mgs go but otherwise I Am VERY HAPPY with Opana ER. Oh yeah I am only 53 and started all except Diabetes w/the heart attack when I was 42.

Just takes the edge of a LITTLE. New chronic pain Dr. took me off that and switched me to Opana ER 10mg. Although I've only started this evening the pain has not been helped AT ALL and I'm tempted to take one of the percocets anyway.  Just scared of what it might do. Is this a med that works better the more that's in your body or is what I got tonight ALL I'm going to get from this?  I need relief.  I have Fibromyalgia, Crohn's disease, and Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Have had 5 abdominal surgeries in the past 5 yrs and I just need some relief from this pain! Constant all day pain...but even gets worse after about the second bite of food.  Makes you not want to eat knowing what's coming!

I have had no relief from the Opana whatsoever. it's also difficult to time with meals. especialy due to my severe stomach troubles. i have been using one patch every two days with the added Opana and i feel worse than i have in a long time.i have endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, sciatica and slipped disc from L5 to S1. I also have two slightly slipped disc in my neck and mid back. i also have shingles. these are just the top five causes of my pain, i have many more. i had such hope for this medication as i am so tired of dealing with the patches.

My pain management doctor began me on Kadian and it did not help at all so she started me on Opana, a 40 and 10 2x per day and relief is so sweet!  She is also started me on zanaflex and I see a difference with those.  As for sleeping she is trying topamax, zanaflex, ambien cr, opana (50mg) and a 5 mg klonopin along with 100 mg zoloft.  Needless to say my tolerance is very high.  I just want help and think my doctor is really determined to find the solution.

Severe Pain	GG, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/19/2009 12:31:39 AM	I love my Opana ER 40mg.I tried a prescribed Oxycontin one time and was &quot;out of it for two days. I promised never to take that again. It is VERY hard to believe that Opana is really 2 times stronger. Now, I have a pinched sciatic nerve with unbearable pain. Not knowing anything about Opana, my Dr put me on 10 mg of Opana. It did not work and I had to take Hydrocodone as supplement. Now, I am on 40 mg of Opana ER every 12 hours. I love it, have no side effects and am just praying I will not have problems when it is time to stop. I wonder if this is something one can take for yrs and yrs if their pain never goes away.

I lived with chronic pain for about twenty years and finally was referred to pain management specialist. I now take 30 Mg of opana every 4 hours,  one opana ER every 8 hours, zana flex 1 in the morning  1 to 2 in after noon and two at bed time, also 10 Mg Valium every 4 hours. For the first time in twenty plus years I can say I finally have a quality of life returned to me. I still have major flair-ups from time to time but on a scale of 1 to 10 I would give the open regiment a solid 7.

I use to take Oxycontin for Chronic pain, but had to go to a clinic to get off of it in order to tell what me true pain level was. The only thing that bothers me is that I have no energy and little tasks such as getting up and taking a shower and eating are very difficult.  I am not certain it this is from this medication, or another, however, it is not good.  This medication, when taken consistently does decrease my pain level.

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	HappyUsernIndy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/26/2008 5:58:54 AM	After five years of chronic pain caused by several sports related herniated disks, I tried therepy, drugs, 5 epidurals, and re-herniated my L5 almost immediately following laminatomy surgery Fall 2007. Tried vicodens, loratab, percocets, gabapentin, flexeril and finally, was up to 8-12 Norcos/day. (the percocets worked but felt a little too good and they interferred with mental function). After all of this, I still suffered chronic sciatic leg pain and severe leg cramps. Sick of the pain, the drug induced roller-coaster ride, and concern regarding liver damage, I left the pain management guys, returned to my GP doc and requested a new plan of attack. He prescribed Opana 10 ER 2/day and I feel great. Unbelievable results, no narcotic sensations, no pain, and no chance of more surgery. My only question to my doc was...what took you so long? Great personal results. Down side...very expensive so you better have good insurance or expendable income. Another suggestion, do not stop taking cold turkey. I ran out of tabs a few days prior to my follow-up doc visit after the first month on opana and the withdrawl symptoms were terrible. Insomnia, yawning, very tired, depressed, and flue like. Plan accordingly.

Allergic to codeine. I take Opana ER 20mg 3x day, percocet 10/325mg 3x day as needed, and 1/2-2 zanaflex at bedtime.  Medication is wonderful. I can function on a daily basis. Still have bad days, but tolerable. Only side effect is constipation. Take a stool softener daily and Miralax when real bad. I have no other side effects. I don't get the medicine head feeling or tiredness or jittery (from opana er). This is a miracle drug for me. I have had nerve blocks, steroid injections, burnt nerves, physical therapy numerous times. All have provided little or no relief. this med is the best thing for me. i have my life back!
Chronic Pain	Chris D, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	11/30/2008 3:27:59 PM	For me Opana ER is the best medication I have had in 20 years. I've been on medications for 20 years after an accident.  Vicondin or Norco 10/325 did not work.  But Opana ER and Norco 10/325 gave me my life back. Opana ER should be put into university hospitals where it is mostly needed.  I've had to educate nurse's and Doctor's as well as patient's on this product. I need this product to get my life back, I'm in pain management and the MS OXYCONTIN 30MG x3 ADAY does not work alone. But the Opana ER with a short term medication such as Norco 10/325 gave me my life back. I don't give opions but only facts. If given this regimen I could go back to work and get off of Social Security, go fishing and play with my children again. Please educate the Doctors on this awesome medication.  My name is Christoper Duran  1403 Jackson keller Rd. apt # 110E San Antonio, TX 78213 (210)530-4697. I need OPANA TO lIVE again, not to just lay in bed with this ms oxycontin, which does not even put me to sleep. Opana ER lets me be as active as I can be.  Thank you for Opana ER, I hope I can get it with my Medicare. My doctor gave me a prescription for it but at $497.00 thats my whole social security Check.  But I'll do What ever I can to get it again. Thanks Opana ER for changing my life and hopefully others.  Christopher DuranP.S. Opana ER gave me no side effect's. CD

Also, the doseage I can tolerate does not work well enough for the extreme level of my chronic pain.  Any higher dose effects my ability to function properly,ie; fatigue and thought processes.

Is this the highest dose or does anyone take about the same?  It works great, but one wears off before the 12 hours is up.

At first I was on Avinza but the side effects were too much. I now take Opana 2x a day and Percocet #10 for breakout pain for my back and almost daily for my knee as the surgery is only a month ago. The Opana works better than the Avinza, except it leaves me with dry mouth.

Opana did not work at all at a lower dose but seems to be helping my fibro and some pain but not the deep bone pain. I am happy with no side effects like the morphine etc. I feel human but also have norco for breakthrough pain. I hope this will begin to work better with dosage adjustments, I haven't been my active self in years due to pain and side effects from meds. I would suggest to give this opana a try if you really want to give pain releif a try, and be somewhat back to your old self. I can spend more time with my children now instead of laying in bed in pain or sleeping from the meds. God bless and everyone take care. Chronic Pain is one of the hardest things I've had to deal with in my life &amp; most people don't understand. I hope everyone has more good days then bad days!

Chronic Pain	jaf, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	65-74	10/18/2008 8:00:18 PM	I am supposed to be taking (2) 5 mg. opana ER tablets a day, every 12 hrs.  I can take one in the morning, and I really feel better, but when I take the one in the evening, I am wide awake.  If I take it with Ambien CR, I still don't aleep and have leg pain, and a wierd headache the nest day.  I am 5'3&quot; tall, weigh 125 and have scoliosis, have had one hip and one total knee replacement.  I've been going to a pain management Dr. for 5 years, and have tried different meds with the most effective being morpine sulfate, but it had many side effects.  I hope I can take opana, because I think it does help my pain, but I can't tolerate not sleeping and it also causes me to have this pressure feeling in my head. I'm just taking one a day now, until I go back to the Dr. and my pain is bad.  Does anyone else have those problems?

WITH THE MANY COMBAT AND OTHER MILIRAY INJURIES I HAVE TO SAY THE OPANA MADE THE USE OF THE OXYCONTIN LESS NEEDED. ONLY PEOPLE I THINK WITH SERIOUS AND CHRONIC PAIIIN ISSUES SHOULD EVE CONSIDER THIS MEDICINE. IT IS NO JOKE AND TO BE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY. HOWEVER KEEP IN MIND FROM MY EXPERIENCE IT'S NOT A MIRACLE DRUG BY ANY MEANS I STILL HAVE MANY PAINS AND NOTHING ON EARTH SO FAR HAS HELPED. PLEASE BE CAREFUL WITH IT AND HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER AT LEAST BETTER THAN YOU DID.

Needless to say it has quit working and I had to go off of it for a few weeks each year. I have had over 30 epidurals for  lower back pain. I am not a surgical candidate. Opana 10mg 2x a day has been a Godsend for me. I am able to get out of bed and function at a somewhat normal manner. I have my loritab for breakthru pain. The worse part for me has been taking it an hour before or 2 hrs after meals. I did have some headaches in the beginning but they are diminishing. Dont give up on this one too fast. It has worked!

The strength will need to be increased, but thus far I have not felt the sleepyness and fatigue that I have felt with the use of other drugs such as the patch or oxycotten.  I do experience brief periods of tiredness, but once I am over that period I find that I have energy and a considerable normal function mode.  I just hope it will not get much worse as I go to a heavier dose.

Always follow doctor's orders regarding the taking of opana, as you do. Kudos for following doctor's instructions on the proper procedures for the digestion of opana. RIGHT ON! More and more people are catching on to opana and it's special mode of action. Basically, if you take it with food, you WILL be in bed due to the fact that it causes opana to explode in your system and possibly let go with a lethal dosage. I'm very proud of you and others like us that know this. Keep healthy and God Bless! boss302kirk

I treat many health problems [chronic pain related] with this med and am somewhat of an expert in the pain tolerance area due to my diseases, most of which I will carry to my death. Opana has been my life saver and given me a new quality of life that other CII pain meds did not handle. If you are looking for PAIN RELIEF and not a &quot;high&quot;, this may be for you. When I first rated this med I found that many patients were not receptive to Opana since it's job is PAIN RELIEF, not a high that is associated with other drugs such as Oxycontin, Percodan, Morphine etc. It's easy to tell the distinction between the pain relief people and the &quot;wanna get high&quot; people. With that being said, reading about other patients' stories that use Opana as a baseline med, it pleases me to know that there are many of us that require the same properties of our pain meds. Kudos to all who use Opana as directed and are getting positive results. I've been on Opana since it was approved for oral use in pill form and am very satisfied with it's results, for me as well as others. So hang in there and send me a message if you need to share any experiences related to Opana. I am always here at WebMD to help if I can. God Bless and &quot;keep on truckin'&quot; with Opana! boss302kirk.

Oxycontin did nothing! Opana Er 20mg twice a day is taking the pain away enough that I can finally do everyday things I could not before starting this drug. The only thing is that it is VERY expensive. My insurance only covers a % of the cost. But finally having some relief from the pain is worth the price.

Nothing else, and according to my doctor I have been on absolutely everything else, has worked this well with such little side effects. The dosing schedule was hard to work out at first, but after a year and a half, I've got it figured out. Also, the dosage has been really stable, with only one minor increase in 18 months. It's rediculously expensive, and my insurance company is giving me all sorts of problems, but it is worth it for the pain relief it gives me. It doesn't do away with it completely - nothing ever will - but it does a really great job.

I can tell you it does help but does not last for 12 hours like the dr says. at best it will last 4 or 5 hours. I have run out of the med and can tell you i feel really bad. not just the loss of meds but back pain can get unbarable. I also lost my temper and almost my mind. I am scared the day i have to quit the meds.I do not like being on opana but need it for the pain.I have tried other pain meds and opana does work. I do not want to try oxycotin. I am afraid i would like it and get hooked really bad.

I have had no relief with my 10mg ER dose at all, only some relief from the faster-acting Roxycodone.  But even that drug is not strong enough now and lasts only about an hour or so now.  I seem to have high tolerance issues and will have to continue to work with my pain management physician to get things figured out.  Therefore, unfortunately, I have found Opana ER 10mg ineffective.

Severe Pain	ProudNana, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	55-64	4/17/2008 11:37:29 PM	I was thrilled to find the drug reviews on Opana ER.  I have been on OpanaER 20mg for over 6 months, and I thought that it was just me that found this medication unsuccessful in treating my pain.  I have so much breakthrough pain that I'm still having to take oxycodone every 4 to 6 hours. I had unsuccessful back surgery 2 years ago, leaving me with nerve damage.  I now have another ruptured disc, more nerve damage from scar tissue, which I have to use a cane to walk.  I refuse to have more surgery, and was hoping that I could control my pain through medication.  Fortunately my primary care giver is working with me on pain control, but so far even with the medication I'm on, I'm usually at a 7 to 8 range 24 hours a day.  I was wondering if anyone has tried a higher miligram of Opana and experienced relief?

It was not way better for me.  I actually had more relief from the oxycodone 40mg and I think I know why. I had also been on the generic morphine patches and had to take 20mg Lortabs every 4-6 hrs for break through pain.  Opana is oxymorphone, so I'm wondering if it's like a generic or synthetic morphine, morphine just doesn't do a good job on this type of pain for me. I had/have herniated discs w/ nerve root compression, failed back surgery w/nerve damage. I still would switch back anyway because even w/ins. it's waaaaaay too expensive.  Does anyone know if Opana (oxymorphone) is a form of morphine?

I have severe pain that runs down my legs to my feet , the pain is a 7 to a 10 . I was on the 100 duragesic patch  then long acting morphine ( avinza ) I have tried all of the other stuff and little pain relief .  I was then given Opana to try , it is extreemly expensive and was of no help at all / when the last of the patches wore off , I woke up at 3 am in the worst pain I have ever felt .  Thanks to rescue meds I was able to get some releif ( MSIR 30 mg ) Nerve pain is the worst .  I am a retired police officer , I spent my life fighting drugs and Now I see that they are really needed .  I beleive that the doctors that are willing to help by giving the proper medications are the Heros  , they risk it all to help . The govt. is way too agressive in chasing the &quot; easy catches &quot; ( It is easy to arrest a doctor , he even has to send in a report on all the meds he writes ) it is an easy bust , How sad .  PAIN DOCTORS ARE NEEDED.  IF YOU GIVE UP PLEASE DON'T OVER DUE THE MEDS , TALK TO YOUR DOC AND TELL HIM OR HER .If you find a drug that really helps , or does not work please post , let everybody know .

Very Similiar to Oxycontin in administration (oral, 1 every 8 hours), and results better than average. However, once again, tight insurance companies (concerned apparently only about cost of Meds....$500+ for 30 day supply, would not cover lme as was dispensed by M.D, (90 total needed) they would only cover 60 . . . . . . . . .2 every 24 hours. What do I do? I find that taking more does provide excellent pain relief for lower back pain, but I will run out, and, go thru that far too often hell of ging thru the D.T.'s of having to wait the course of 30 days until refill time. How do I get insurance company to loosen their purse strings, spring for the entire cost of 90 per month (vs 60)? As it is, I still have to pay over $60 per month(per script) but, 2 weeks of pai free living is worth it to me. Would getting an attorney help me get the insurance company to pay?  Why do these better drugs have to cost so damm much to the consumer? pc in San Antonio.

Finally, we're getting great feedback for our hero, opana. I went through the &quot;why me&quot; period several years ago, and I can assure you, it boils down to DENIAL,DEPRESSION,AND DEATH.The three deadly D's. So keep a good spirit, take your meds correctly, and TALK TO YOUR DR. Most patients do not converse openly and honestly with their Dr. This is a key factor in correctly assessing your pain. So bravo to all who gave opana the credit it deserves. I'm so-o-o tired of reading about the person who is upset because their Dr. took them off oxycontin, morphine sulfate, actiq, etc. They are just looking for a quick &quot;high&quot; and are not in the mode of &quot;pain control&quot;. Congrats to allof you positive and intelligent people out there. I am always willing to talk about pain control,conditions,medications, and general well-being for my fellow pain-ridden patients.I can be reached at mboand@cox.net.

I have constant severe (read: HORRIBLE AGONIZING) pain due to herniated disks in Cervical region from C2 through T1 and Lumbar region from L3 through S1, as well as deformation of spinal cord in C-spine area and OA. It seems that even my bones hurt. It's excruciating agony. Many times, it hurts so bad it's hard to breathe and I just lay there and cry.Duration: 22+ years.Treatments: Cervical Region:Chiropractor: 3x/week. This helps most of the time with c-spine, migraines, &amp; nausea.Lumbar region: Facet Injections and Epidural Steroid Injections (ESI). (10+ injections/3x/each procedure ... total 6 procedures = 60+ injections)(These did absolutely NOTHING for me and I refuse to do it anymore!) TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator) Unit. Time used: 4+ years.Yes, it definitely helps. Sometimes it's the only thing that allows me to get out of bed. (Of course there are those days when absolutely nothing helps.)I have been on this particular medication for about four (4) months @ 10mg/BID. I take it in conjunction with Norco 10/325. Even the combination has been of very little use to me... no relief. It definitely does nothing for my migraines. At my next visit to pain management doc (next week), I am asking for a med change.
Severe Pain	laurief, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	55-64	1/27/2008 11:36:03 PM	Opana ER hasn't helped me as much as past opiates, even after increased from 20 to 30 mg. The 10 mg. Opana IR for breakthru pain helps moderately but can only take once/day. Fibromyalgia, aging and degen. discs may be one reason.  All I know is I'm still in pain most of time and am depressed and in bad mood and have lost interest in anything.  Previous opiates at least gave me more energy and a feeling of well-being (not a high).  Dr.'s changed so many drugs I'm afraid to try anything new, but something has to be done.  He did finally put me back on antidepres. (Pamelor) for fibro, which helped w/deep sleep, Opana-incuced, realistic nightmares and late afternoon sleepiness, but maybe I haven't been on the Pamelor long enough for it to help my mood. I'd rather go back to something like morphine and fentanyl suckers, also even the suckers finally lost their effectiveness, which is why he changed my opiates.  I just don't know about this drug (Opana), and I've had chronic pain and FM for @ 25 yrs. now.  Hasn't been fun weaning down on Xanax and Opana to 20 mg. at same time this month.

Severe Pain	sthrnbe94, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	45-54	1/18/2008 7:05:54 PM	I have severe Fibromyalgia and have been getting steriod injections in by spinal nerves for about 8 months. This has helped tremendously. The pain has never gone but the shots got me out of bed and moving. I just started Opana ER and I have had an excellent response from it. I do have side effects that I don't understand, such as; severe sweating whenever I move around, mood change (wanting to fight or argue), shaky, and a hard time sleeping even with sleeping pills. I had a stroke in 2002 which left me with insomnia, severe pain, bed ridden, unable to walk, talk, eat, swallow and PAD (Peripherial Arterial Disese). So far Opana ER has been the best pain reliever for me, except for the side effects. I am still waiting to see if they will subside.

I am in horrible pain as you can imagine. Awaiting surgery now. I am taking 40mg Opana with no relief every 12 hours. Only thing it does is give that ringing to the ears after about the first hour then it goes away after another hour. Been doing this over a week now. Going back to the doctor next week to see what he can do further. Good luck to everyone.

I have been on everything from Vicodin to Oxycontin and Methadone and this so far has workd the best. I will be having my dose increased from 20mg twice a day to 40mg twice a day in 2 weeks and then most likely again after another month as I have been on these types of medications for 6 years.

I also take celebrex 200mg once a day. Before the opana I was taking Avanza 60 mg twice a day, but was having to many mygrains. For breakthru pain I will take up to three oxycodone a day. And it keeps me ambulating.
