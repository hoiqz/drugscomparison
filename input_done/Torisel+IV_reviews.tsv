The first scan was promising after taking both sutent and nexavar with little positive results. Since she has been on torisel there have been Fatigue after each dose and a blood transfusing because of the effect of torisel reducing blood counts. Thankfully no mouth soars so far

The one obvious tumor in his neck has decreased by 1/2 the original size.  Main side effects: bitter taste, no appetite, moderate itching and rash (Sinequan given), elevated blood sugar, cholesteral, triglycerides, anemia. Today he was given an injection for the anemia. Does anyone know what it may have been? It was not Procrit. History: kidney removed 2000; part of 2nd kidney removed 2002; Thyroidectomy/mRCC 2009; Sutent 50mg/20 days 2009, bad side effects.

He has had a kidney and adrenal gland removed. He was initially put on Nexavar and was on it for a little more than 2 years (lots of side effects).  He has now been on weekly infusions of Torisel for 13 months. During this period he has developed mets in his liver, spine, and ribs. He had some daily radation on the spinal mets in addition to the torisel with amazing results. The mets in his rib and liver however continue to increase in size.  His oncologist is optimistic though and wants to continue with the Torisel if possible. The major side effect he has experienced is swelling of his get/ankles. Keep believing this disease can be cured, there are new treatments developed annually.

Went on Sutent and could barely handle the side effects. A CT scan in January 09 showed RCC in the lymph nodes. A July CT scan showed the Sutent had stopped working and the spots were growing. Sutent was stopped.I started on Torisel on Sept 11th, 09. After 4 treatments, the rash/acne was so bad, (face, scalp, chest, and mouth/tongue)the fifth week was canceled to give me time to recover. Started 6th week at a slightly reduced dose and the acne came back but not in my mouth.The CT scan on October 16th showed a reduction in the lymph nodes.I have had 7 treatments so far, and I am on antibiotics to control the acne.

Have chromophobe kidney cancer, mets to bones.  Sutent side effects too difficult.  Dropped that dose and eventually stopped working. Switched to Torisel. Bad skin rashes are only significant side effect;  rest can be tolerated.  God bless all and good luck.

I haven't had any bad reactions but the taste change.  Everything tastes bad!  My cancer is still growing but slowly.  I have renal cell carcinoma in 5 spots.  I just finished radiation treatment for quality of life issues.  Now I can walk again.

He is due for his next catscan in 2-3 weeks and we'll see how those turn out...He has a a few problems with getting a very bad rash, but with a slight mg steriod, has only had to take a week off a month, and with the original bad rash came he had to take 3 weeks off, plus drop to 15 mg, for 2 weeks up to 20mg Monday back up to 25 mg's...I look at all the targeted drugs are hard and i'm not expecting to much shrinkage, but any shrinage is better than nothing or regrowth...So we are both very pleased with Torisel and a very understanding oncologist..It's helped up thru a very difficult time, making decision neither one of us thought we'd ever have to make....Thanks for reading...
Cancer Involving the Kidney Cells	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	2/22/2009 1:29:51 AM	I have been taking Torisel weekly for 9 months. Side effects: change in taste, mouth sores, weight loss. Have had two CT scans since taking Torisel. Tumors in lungs, adrenal, &amp; remaining kidney have stopped growing.I took Nexavar and Sutent but side effects were too much, even tho the drugs were effective in shrinking tumors.

Torisel was easy use and significantly reduced my tumors after 8 treatments.  Then it stopped working.  Over the next few months of treatment the tumors in lungs did not change while those in my abdomen &amp; liver increased in size.

Cancer Involving the Kidney Cells	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	55-64	2/6/2008 2:19:16 PM	Three years I had one kidney removed because of malignancy.  Period CT scans afterward were clear; however, recently a new tumor was discovered, metastasized renal cell carcinoma.  Started on Sutent but it had a dangerous effect on heart function.  Switched to Torisel and have been on it 3 months now.  Tumor has not grown and the active area has reduced slightly.  Side effects are not a problem considering the probable outcome if I wasn't taking it.

He has stage 4 renal cell carcinoma and has had one hell of a year. This is the third treatment, after Nexavar and Sutent. He has just had one treatment so far and is due his next one Friday, so I will post again when I know more about it.
