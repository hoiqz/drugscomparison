Skin Infection due to a Bacteria	satisfied, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	9/2/2012 12:47:25 PM	Every time I got a hair cut I would develop painful sores on my scalp. The dermatologist thought I had MRSA.  Using this for 3-4 months twice a day and putting bactroban antibiotic ointment in my nasal area once a day for the first 5 days of the month cured it and every time I now get a hair cut I use it for approx. 5 days and I've not had another episode in 2+ years.  I had it for approx. 2 years before I got this medication that worked.

Skin Infection due to a Bacteria	Meet, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	1/23/2012 10:31:39 AM	I have been suffering from folliculitits since I was 17 and now at age 25 I have almost no acne marks.  Since I started this product less than a month ago, I have not seen any new acne which has allowed my face to heal tremendously.
Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	12/24/2011 12:27:42 AM	I'm 17 and I got started on this about a month ago because I've had bad acne since I started puberty which was about age 12. and we've tried everything else and nothing seemed to work. I talked to my family doctor about my acne and he prescribed me this. It's been working wonders and I can see a huge difference. I'm seeing less acne on my face and it's making me feel more confident. Even my mom is happy with the results!

Seemed to work for a few months then stopped helping. She had continued use daily thinking her skin would be worse without it. She has had a very severe reaction this month with facial swelling, tounge swelling, throut swelling, headache, sinus swelling with drainage. She has been very sick! She is still  recovering, with stomach problems as well. Please use caution with long term use!!!!!!!!!

I have noticed no change in my skin. I still get just as many pimples if not more. My face is also dry and red since starting this prescription lotion. Not happy!

Acne	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	5/16/2011 10:00:53 PM	I've been using this ointment for about a year now &amp; at first, it was excellent.  I think I may be getting immune to it at times, but it still keeps my bigger zits at bay, pretty well.  I've a ton of tiny, white zits, as well as tiny black heads, deep in my pores &amp; it's not really helping much w/them at all anymore.  I use Benzole Peroxide OTC (for years) w/it &amp; it helps keep my skin moist from that.  I also use Clean/Clear toner for years too. I don't agree w/some of the comments on this being so drying, as I found it to be the opposite.  I don't use as much moisturizer since I've been using it &amp; as I said, it's helped my more severe drying &amp; flaking that the BP causes.  Also, when I use moisturizers, I break out more, even if non pore clogging!  I'm happy to keep using it, until my doc gives me something else, that may be more effective against the hundreds of tiny white, deep pored acne, that nothing seems to touch!  I don't see a dermatologist, b/c there are none who are taking new patients w/in an hour of me!  So, it's my GP who is treating me for it. I've gone my whole life treating my acne w/o a doctor involved, so finally, realizing you don't 'grow out of it', I've had to beg my GP to HELP! It got worse as I got older &amp; now w/the menopause, really changed again, getting worse, still! When I've run out of the Clin., it gets worse, so I know it's helping, in general.  I just think I need more, to deal w/the deep pore plugs.  I keep my face as clean as I can &amp; wear little to no makeup, so as not to add to the problem.  I do like some sun, so it does not show my acne much at all &amp; gives my face color w/o makeup.  Hope there is something else I can try, to clear me up a lot more!

I have since seen Derma Dr and my regular Doctor and NO ONE has an answer except it is not lice or bed bugs aor those other little critters I need help, because now the scalp is still peeling and itching but it peels badly and I am embarrassed and I have also lost hair in my parts  (hair line) along the front sides and top Help
Acne	BradysMom, 0-2 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	2	2	Male	0-2	4/15/2011 3:26:29 AM	My one year old son's face has been breaking out really bad. We have went to Drs., Dermatologist, and they have all said its severe baby acne. The last dermatologist we saw specialized in children. She called in the Clindamycin Lotion for me to use on his face, but the information guide says not to use on children under 12 years of age. I just got it today, I want to do whatever I can to get his little face to clear up so it won't scar, but don't want to use anything that could hurt him. Any one have any suggestions on it?

Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	11/16/2010 1:52:31 PM	Within four days my stubborn acne that had been lurking around for months vanished! Although my skin became super dry in the beginning which is hat cleared the acne, it turned into scabs and then flaked away and once the acne was cleared my skin began to feel stronger and got a little softer. easy to use but the smell is absolutely terrible! the smell is so strong it clears the inside of my nose and burns my eyes and is also hard to breathe until it drys. 
Acne	tropigal, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/29/2010 9:53:45 PM	This medication formes a film over the skin which if touched will peel off like after a sunburn. Trying to wear makeup over the medication is worthless. I am one of the rare individuals who had a reaction to the medication and as described in side effects was aweful and I still have isues due to it today. USE WITH CAUTION!

On the 7th day I developed a severe bright red rash covering all of my torso and extending on to my arms and legs.  Ten days later I still have a small amt of rash remaining. The skin on my torso and legs is peeling.  I had minor stomach problems relieved by Tums.  My doctor said to discontinue the medication and wait for the rash to go away.

I have had the virus since I was 17 years old. Ever since then, I have had terrible breakouts due to taking HIV medication. My doctor prescribed Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Gel, and I almost cried. My skin completely changed. It was as if I was given a new, clear, healthy looking face. My skin has never felt smoother and my acne has gone away! I would recommend this product to anyone. Whether you are HIV positive or not!
Acne Rosacea		5	5	5			3/1/2008 8:05:14 AM	I am almost 40 years old and have had chronic acne since my 20's. I have tried EVERYTHING, even expensive laser procedures. Nothing worked for more than a few weeks or months. I prefer topical medications but was considering oral until my PCP finally prescrcibed this. Not only did the acne go away, but my redness, and even little bumps on my forehead disappeared, all within the first 2-3 days of applying. I am careful to moisturize 2x/daily in order to prevent dryness and peeling. My skin has never looked better and all for just $10 under my healthcare plan - who knew?? Anyone with acne knows the heartache of hoping that the last product will be The One only to be disappointed yet again, except that this one doesn't! I hope everyone with acne will know about this.
Other	CarolNC, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/8/2007 4:17:33 PM	I developed red bumps on my scalp after losing my hair due to chemotherapy treatments.  I saw dramatic improvement immediately after using the topical pads, especially in the itiching, with the bumps nearly gone in just a few days. This was a godsend, after trying every over the counter cream and powder I could think of with little relief.  I wish every oncologist knew about this (I found out about it from a fellow patient).

I'm in college, so I'm sure the stress added to it.  I was upset about it, so I talked to my doctor. He prescribed the clin. phos. solution.  It took about 3 days for me to tell, but it really did work!  I still use it today.

The dermatologist noticed bacterial infection and prescribed clindamycin phosphate.  I apply a small amount morning and evening.  It seems to have rapidly cleared the infection without side effect.  Other remedies like alcohol and peroxide caused irritation and itching.
