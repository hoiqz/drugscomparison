Stop Smoking	Clarity, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	55-64	5/1/2012 7:03:06 PM	Took for a long time (three years) and kept on trying. Finally combined with Wellbuterin/ butoprophen and had great results. Chantix helped with the physical and the anti-depressant helped with the psychological. Today I have been smoke free for one year after 44 years of two packs a day. I was lucky; my only side-effect was vivid dreaming.

With Chantix my craving for a cigarette is gone. I do tend to aggitate easily but no aggression, my worse problem right now is not being able to sleep. Overall happy I am smoke free. Thanks

I started Chantix on Oct 8th and had my last cig on Oct 19th. I am 12 1/2 weeks smoke-free. I am also off the Chantix as of Dec 31st, after completing 12 weeks of the med. On the last week of the med, I cut back to only one tab in the morning and then cut it in half for the last 4 days. I basically weaned it back the way I started it. Sometimes I forget how huge it is to say I don't smoke. I am forever grateful to have been able use this medication. I do have cravings sometimes but it's not strong enough to make me undo 12 1/2 weeks. Thank the Lord above. Good Luck to anyone trying this and PLEASE stay with it, you can do it and it's worth it. YOU are worth it.  
Stop Smoking	Rabbit1956, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	1/5/2012 2:56:36 PM	Started Chantix 8 weeks ago &amp; quit smoking on the 1st day instead of continuing to smoke for 2 weeks. I have smoked for 40 years and was up to 3 packs a day, thats 9 cartons a month at $46.00 a carton, costing me $414.00 a month, almost $5,000.00 a year. I was a serious smoker and loved to smoke more than anything. The cost of cigarettes drove me to quit smoking.I have tried hypnosis,nicoderm patch &amp; cold turkey, after 2/12 weeks, I would give in to the cravings and start smoking again. Side effects have been minimal with Chantix. Gas,gas &amp; more gas, some constipation &amp; very vivid dream. I have found that by taking Chantix every 12 hours &amp; after eating something, works well for me. I have experienced no nausea or depression while taking Chantix. I can breath so much better, food tastes so good &amp; I smell better. I really cannot stand the smell of smoke now, it really stinks, only after a few days of quitting. If you really want to quit, talk with your Dr. about it. Stoping now will add years to your life and money to your pocket! If I can quit, anybody can. Good luck to you and God Bless.

Rough start at first with nausea but I eat before I take it now and problem solved. I do have silly dreams and I am a little tired/sluggish but otherwise I feel great. I smoked a pack a day for 30yrs. For me, this medication has been a blessing. I am now running and completed my 1st 5k recently. I HIGHLY recommend this med. But it can have serious side effects so please discuss all that with your doctor if you are considering it. Also, there is a well of info that comes with the med, read it carefully. Good luck and I hope it helps others as it has me.

Stop Smoking	cokaid, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	2	Male	25-34	7/5/2011 3:29:11 AM	Quitting smoking is a terrible experience, especially for those who are &quot;serious&quot; smokers. I was a pack-a-day smoker (semi-serious), and I enjoyed the experience. The burn, the oral fixation, the social factor, the pleasant head buzz--basically the overall calming effect it had on me after a hard day's work. And when I wasn't at work, I smoked while watching TV, reading, browsing the Internet, etc. Smoking added more pleasure to the activities I already enjoyed. But I knew smoking was killing me.Over a period of six years, I attempted to quit dozens of times: patches, pills, gum, and the cold turkey method (the worst of all). None of these methods worked for me, and the sense of failure was discouraging. But I wasn't the only one who was frustrated. My girlfriend of three years hated my addiction (let's not sugar coat it by calling it a bad habit), and I couldn't blame her. She hated the smell of it, whereas I had become indifferent to the lingering, pungent odor. Plus, I always had to carry extra gum or breath mints, or in other words, spend even more money on my already expensive addiction.On Valentine's Day of 2011, my girlfriend bought me a gift--more for herself than for me (her words). When I tore open the gift, I had to read the box to figure out what the heck she had bought for me. It was electronic cigarette kit. Thankful as I was, I was a bit annoyed at her for not accepting me for who I was--a nicotine-addicted individual who wanted to quit, but had failed too many times. Sure, I enjoyed smoking, but I knew the long-term effects were lethal. That being said, I continued to smoke. Naturally, my girlfriend pestered me about when I was going to try the electronic cigarette, and I kept telling her that I wasn't ready to quit--I was afraid of failing again, because I didn't want to disappoint her or myself.It was about two months after my girlfriend bought me the electronic cigarette that I tried it for the first time--mind you, I had to brush off

Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	45-54	6/6/2011 1:28:26 PM	I was beginning my third month of taking Chantix and had quit smoking, after 30 years of smoking, sometime late in the second month of taking the medication. It felt wonderful to not worry about cigarettes and people even said I looked better. I had experienced times of general grouchiness while on the medication, but just chalked it up to being in a bad mood. (Not very characteristic of me!) But once, while alone at home, I had a moment of sheer rage! It only lasted a couple of seconds. It came out of nowhere, and I thought, &quot;What the heck was that?&quot; It was gone in a flash, so I went my merry way. A few days later, the rage came back. My thirteen-year old son was making noise in his room and my thought was to go in there and choke him! Thankfully, I didn't and the rage left me as quickly as it came. I quit taking the Chantix immediately and have an appointment to see my doctor. Please be aware that any changes in behavior while on this medication should be reported to your doctor immediately!
Stop Smoking	lori mrw, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	5/7/2011 10:33:59 PM	i have experienced severe mood swings, thoughts of death, sweating vomiting i have stopped smoking for now but after 3 days short of my first month's supply the breathing problems this has triggered are extreme. i only experience asthma attacks when i am over exposed to things i am allergic too such as alfalfa hay, cedar trees pollenation some molds. today 5.7.11 and yesterday 5.6.11 i have experienced 2 severe attacks of asthma they are well controlled now that i am old enough to watch for triggers and use medications prescribed to prevent and keep them to a minimum. as strange as it sounds i have been smoking for about 2.5 years after i had not smoked for 8 years, before that i had smoked cigarettes off and on regularly since approximately the age of 13 or 14. there is a terror that comes with the realization that you cannot breathe anyone with asthma would verify this. after the testing done by my physician i hope to confirm that no other side effects show up and i pray the current side effects stop soon.

A part of me really wants to smoke, but I think Chantix is really helping me avoid caving and just doing it.  I keep reminding myself of all of the reasons that I am quitting (health, money, smelling pretty!)  I was a little nervous about taking it, because I have had a history of depression, but I feel fine. My only side effects are a little bit of nausea right after I take it, but it goes away shortly after and my dreams are really intense.  I haven't had nightmares, just some really funny, strange dreams.. it's kind of fun to laugh at them!  I am hoping that I will be able to remain smoke free with the help of Chantix!

I quit smoking after taking the chantix for 7 days.  After day 21 I cut it down to 1 pill a day to help me sleep better.  Totally quit after 25 days smoke free and have never looked backed!  It worked for me but I also WANTED to quit smoking.

Stop Smoking	SharylD, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	12/9/2010 5:51:42 PM	Took Chantix for 5 months.  Small cravings were manageable.  Dreams were vivid and rather silly.  The smell and taste of cig smoke was horrible.  Gained a lot of weight without changing eating habits so weaned myself off of Chantix and have been completely off of it for a week.  Now I am experiencing depressions, anxiety, and all around crankiness.  To top it off, I want a cigarette and with my horrible attitude, I just don't care if I smoke or not.  Hope it passes soon.
Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	11/20/2010 4:40:01 PM	I have not had a cigarette for 48 days, after smoking for 33 years.  I feel very proud of myself.  I did experience a few vivid dreams when first starting the medication.  My main issue has been the abdominal distress.  It's been miserable.  I'm weaning off it now.  I wish you luck. You can quit.

Chantix was best thing for me.
Stop Smoking	Psinaz, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/31/2010 10:54:05 PM	After smoking for 30+ years and having quit once for a year, I tried Chantix.  &quot;As advertised,&quot; within one week of starting this prescription, I simply didn't want to smoke anymore.  Only side effect I had was strange, crazy, vivid dreams - which I kind of looked forward to.  This drug may have saved my life.
Stop Smoking	Brenda, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/20/2010 6:32:18 AM	I am on week 5 of Chantix and can't believe how well it is working. I have been smoking for over 30 years and thought it was going to be impossible to quit. The only side effect I have experienced is gas (in the first 2 weeks, this has now gone away). My husband smokes right next to me in the house and I still have no urges to smoke. I was upset that insurance would not pay for it, but in the long run with cigarette prices I will be ahead. Good Luck Everyone!!
Stop Smoking	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	11/4/2010 7:55:59 PM	Only problems with the drug were minor in comparison to my nicotine addiction.  They included some constipation and upset stomach if I took it without food.  I did have some interesting dreams, but I actually enjoyed it as I rarely remember dreams.  Bottom line....today is my 1 year smoke free for me!  I was stuck in the trap of not being able to quit and 1 month of Chantix got me started.  Quiting smoking requires work and life changes (I now run 4 miles a day and have lost 40 lbs) but Chantix was a great kick off point for me!!

I had the 8 day target to stop smoking, but stopped in 5 days.  On the first 5 days, my taste stated to change to where a cigarette began to taste worse and worse.  I havent had a craving for 3 weeks, and now I can't stand the smell of smoking.  I do occasionally have vivid dreams, and was worried about the other side effects, however I feel great.  This drug was the best decision I ever made.  Good luck to everyone else quitting.

Unfortunately, I had an allergic reaction.  I broke out in a rash all over my body.  I had to quit taking it and hopefully I can stay quit.  I would still recommend that you at least try this.

Stop Smoking	Cajunlady, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	6/21/2010 9:32:28 AM	Started Chantix May 12; quit day May 25.  You have to eat something with substance to avoid nausea with taking the pill.  I have had a couple vivid dreams, moody--in the last week or so, yes!  The chance of getting one or more of the side effects in the short term is well worth the end result.  And I agree, for me it will probably be best to stay on it a little longer; I've smoked for a long time and this is long overdue.

I quit for several years but a stressful event sent me back to the filthy habit. Decided to quit again so this time used Chantix. Doesn't seem to be working near as quickly or effectively as Wellbutrin so far and it's 10 times the price. Hopefully it will finish the job and it won't be a complete waste of money. If it doesnt work I know Wellbutrin will so either way I'm going to be a non-smoker. Just a bit shorter on cash non-smoker lol

Today is April 28th and I am still smoke free.  The first couple of weeks on the Chantix are rather trying at first,(with the dreams you feel as if you haven't really slept, and I was feeling rather &quot;hyper&quot; for a good week and a half until my body got used to the medication)but the side-effects seem to lessen the longer you are on the pills.  The first three days of giving up the cigarettes are harder than the rest, but after smoking for 38 years I did it!!!  I just hope that when it is time to give up the Chantix that I can remain smoke-free.

I plan on continuing Chantix for another couple of months, just to be safe.  I did experience some moderate side effects. Vidid dreams, mood swings, memory loss, mild depression, and mild nausea are all daily/ near daily things I must deal with. Cravings have become minimal and manageable. Bottom line, without Chantix, I would still be smoking.

So I decided once I finished my pack I would not buy another, I haven't had a cigarette in 35 hours now, and am feeling pretty good. Sometimes I feel a little sick to my stomach after taking the pill but that passes, and the dreams are really interesting so I don't mind them. I think the pills are worth a try.

It took the edge off. I did get nauseated if I didn't eat a little something before taking it but the pro's out weighed the con's.It will be one year on March 4th since I have smoked and I owe alot of the credit to Chantix not all but alot!wse

The nausea &amp; headaches are the least of my worries.  The paranoia, aggression, moments of rage basically is destroying my life.  I am a totally different person on it. I can't even stand the person I become on it and have no clue why my boyfriend forgives me or still wants to be with me. The lack of sleep, lucky if I get 5 hrs a night, and the nightmares are tearing me down.  The nightmares are so vivid &amp; terriable that I have woken up crying so hard that it took my boyfriend almost a 1/2 hour to calm me down.  I know you're not suppose to just stop taking any meds, but I had to see if it really was the medicine doing this to me or not.  I didn't take it for 2 days and although there were a few moments of cravings, I slept through out the night, no nightmares, no attacking my bf verbally, no paranoia, etc.  I ended up taking 1 after 2 days because of the cravings.  Biggest mistake!  It only took hours and all the side effects were back in full swing.  I am done with this.  I will suffer and chew a million packs of gum a day to get thru this before I take another dose!

Stop Smoking	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/2/2009 3:07:15 PM	Bottom line is I have not had a smoke in 7 weeks.  It does what it is designed to do!!  For this user, the side affects were minimal compared to the pay off.  After talking to my doctor, I have been off Chantix for 4 days now and, while the occasional cravings are a bit stronger off the Chantix, putting some non-smoking time together has gven me the confidence to realize that just because I have a craving does not mean I NEED to smoke.  If I have not had a smoke in 7 weeks, I do not have to have one today.  If I dfo it is because I choose to, not because I have to.  I realize that some have had bad side affects so you should do this in close consiltation with your doctor, but for me Chantix was fantastic!

This is my second time taking chantix. The first time After two months I was down to one-two cigs a day and I felt great after 15 years of smoking, then I switched jobs and could not afford to buy chantix without insurance so.....I jumped back on the ban wagon and gradually went back up to what I was before the chantix. Now I'm back on it and it's only week 2 and I've cut down to about 1/4 pack a day.  I think last time I really fought the med but this time I feel the change and hopefully this will be the time I quit.

I am in my 8th week and although the urge still seems great at times, I seem to be at the point where I can control it.  I have had some strange, not scary dreams, along with difficulty sleeping and occasional stomach upset which seems to go away quickly.  One thing I am having problems with is constipation.  I have started taking a mild laxative a couple times a week.  Overall I am very happy with my results and would certainly recommend Chantix.

I had the prescription for almost a year before I actually got the nerve to try it. I was worried about the side effects I heard about. Luckily, I didn't have any problems. It worked great for me. It really helps control the urge. I've had nausea a few times but very mild. You have to eat first and drink lots of water. I'm on my my 4th week without cigarettes. In addition to the Chantix, I read a book: Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking. The combination of the two made it so easy. I don't even have the slightest urge to smoke.

Stop Smoking	LasVegasLinda, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	3	Female	55-64	10/14/2009 6:06:25 PM	I'm on Chantix for the second time.  I quit smoking for about six months, then had some severe medical issues with my daughter, which  put me in a tailspin, and I started up again.  I started a new regime about 10 days ago.  The first time, the only side effect I had was very vivid and weird dreams, real livelike.  This time I'm so sick to my stomach, all the time.  I'm ready to throw in the towel.  It's like morning sickness.  Maybe a bit worse because nothing seems to help take away the nausea.  I'm not going to take a pill tonight or tomorrow and see how I feel, and see how the cravings are.  I really do not want to smoke.  Big, big drawback is the cost.  Mine 30 day script was $144. My insurance won't cover preventative medicine. Go figure. Does not make any sense.  I hope I can continue.

The desire for me to quit was very strong, and Chantix just helped me even more. I am smoke free now for 3 1/2 months and going strong.  Only side effect was nausea, so I cut the pill in half and that worked fine (of course with Dr.'s approval.) I say give it a try, you have nothing to lose.  It is great to breath normal again.

I did 't want to quit &amp; really loved full flavored menthol.  There were no cravings and was too easy.  It has been 4 mths and even being around smoking doesn't cause craving.  I did have bizarre,vivid dreams but I could deal with that. I had tried patches, hypnotism with only brief and much desire but always went back and did not believe I would ever be successful.

I am very happy to have started Chantix. I have had little cravings but have not gave in. I do the daily activities and love the calls in the evening for check in and being able to say no I have not had a cigarette. I have recommeded this medication to my smoke buddies and parents. Side effects have been minimal. You do have to want to quit or a least that is how I feel. I feel confident. Congrats to all who have succeeded. And keep trying to those who back slide.

It is not a miracle drug, you still need to want to quit and you still need will power, but it makes the quitting process 100 times easier.  The only negative side effect I noticed was extreme nausea.  I was able to control the nausea by eating and then taking the Chantix about fifteen minutes later.  I never had the bad dreams or any other side effects.  I quit on the eighth day of taking Chantix as it tells you to and I have not smoked since.  I couldnt be happier.  It may bot be the easiest thing to deal with the nausea, but well worth it to be smoke free :)

I started smoking at 12 yrs of age and I am 59, having smoked over 2 pks a day for years.  I was down to a pack a day, after having a heart attack a few years ago, and have tried unsuccessfully to quit a few times.  I have a new attitude this time, but I really feel like the Chantix has been a big help.  It wasn't easy, but I was really determined to wait out the symptoms, because I knew I needed all the help I could get, and I had read about how Chantix works, that it attaches itself to the nicotine receptors in your brain, and it sounded like it would work.  I smoked for the the first 2 weeks, and boy I never enjoyed a single cigarette while I took it.  Blah!!!!!!    They were awful.  (This was a helpful sign.)  Now I can tell you that the little &quot;triggers&quot; I get, only last a second or 2, and they're gone.  I started to run out of the pills, so before I could get to the drug store to refill, I stopped taking them for a day, and I have to say that that was the first day I actually thought about searching the house for a cigarette somewhere.  I started taking them again, and I haven't had that feeling since.  I think they are working.  We'll see.

My &quot;vivid dreams&quot; started only days after beginning Chantix. Will they get worse? I planned on 8 hours of sleep last night and got only 4.  I know myself, and I can't go on like this. Does Wellbutrin help with the dreams or only depression?  If I don't get some sleep, I'll be depressed alright! Definitely stops the urge to smoke, and makes it just taste gross!  I don't want to stop taking Chantix, I just need to make the dreams stop and sleep like I used to... Any suggestions?

This drug made me lose my appetite and gave me insomnia.  After two weeks of not sleeping more than two hours a day and eating fewer than 500 calories a day, i knew I was on a downward spiral.  The good news is that I wasn't smoking.  If it works without the side effects I think it would be great.

Stop Smoking	2turn2,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female		6/18/2009 7:52:58 PM	If I can QUIT anyone can! I have been smoking cigarettes for 38 years. Not counting all the Marijuana, PCP, Crack cocaine and Green that I also smoked through-out my life. 30 yrs of Newport Kings soft pack. I started Chantix when it first came out and could not take it as my daughter was living with me at the time( way to much stress) The price of my brand kept going up close to $4.00 a pack! So I tried again. I took this pill for 79 days. I did not have a quit date. I just kept taking the pills. June 3rd 2009 I had 3 cigarettes left. It was 9pm and I knew I would get up around 2am for my early morning smoke. Well I smoked 2 of the 3 that I had left. Took my xanax and went to bed. I was up and awake right on time at 2:15 am sitting at my kitchen table a juice box in one hand and my last cigarette in my other. I fired it up and smoked it like a joint. I held it deep in my lungs and I kept saying to myself GOD please help me. You are more powerful then anything and these cigarettes are just a tiny speck to you. Please help me stop smoking! Let me wake up and not smoke anymore. I got up at 6am probably the hardest thing I had to do in my life. Coffee and NO cigarette. Well an hour went by then another and then a day and then another day. I have had support from my family and that helps. I quit taking the Chantix and I have been off it for 3 days now. I feel fine. Still, dying for a smoke. I eat a lot of peppermint candy and chew gum to knock the cravings. I look up take a deep breath and ask GOD to get me through the moment. It really works. It is a miracle drug. My side affects were Bloating, Gas, Up-set stomach (You have to eat and then take the pill) I had very vivid dreams nothing scary. It made me kind of dizzy at first, but you do get over the side affects. Please dont give up Talk to your Doctor and Please give GOD a try. Ask and you shall receive. I am not Holy Roller but I believe. I will help anyone out there just ask

Did fine the first couple of weeks, then the dreams started and they were violent so I would only sleep for a couple of hrs a night , only have the dreams now about 4 nights a week, I have had nausea, lost my sense of taste, I have turned mean, hateful, can't stand to me around anyone(even myself)severe headache every day. And this is not me, I have always enjoyed being around others, always having a smile on my face and really enjoying life. My life has gotten so bad that I'm surprised my husband and kids have not left and believe me I couldn't blame them, cause if I could leave myself I would. I finished the 12 weeks and still not smoking for 3 months even talked to my doctor about all the side effects and was told it could take a while for it all to go away, I still have very strong urges to smoke and not sure how much longer I can handle the severe headaches and other systems..I wish I had never started taking Chantix especially since it has severely altered my personality,moods, attitude towards life and my send of taste

Depression was intense during second weeek but then lifted.  Would have stopped taking it 13th day, but began to feel the fog dissipate.  I love not smoking but the intestinal distress is something I have never had before. I can live with it, but don't like it.  I amn not sure the medication is making me gain weight or simply the by-product of not smoking.  Doesn't matter, Not Smoking is great!!

I called Pfizer to find some info and was told that panic attacks were not associated with Chantix. I've just read some of the other comments and it's mentioned several times. Maybe Pfizer should read these comments. I was able to quit, but I really want to know if the panic attacks will continue.

When I stopped after only 2 months, I returned to smoking but quickly went back on the chantix...I feel I stopped to soon so it was my error in judgement   but I won't make the mistake again.

Chantix made the withdrawl minimal. I started it on April 3rd and am on my third pack I quick on April 13th and for the first six days it was a challenge. now nothing I hardly even think about it.

I may not have smoked a lot in quantity, but I was pretty addicted. After being on Chantrix for about 1 week, I was able to quit, pretty easily. I had tried patches, gum, and cold turkey. I am still taking it. I have some serious nausea, but it only lasts about 10 minutes. Then it's gone. For anyone who wants to quit, I seriouly recommend this medication.

After two weeks I had to stop taking Chantix because of the effect on my personality/moods.  I'm glad to see it's working for most.  I also experienced the loss of sleep, bloating/gas. 
Stop Smoking	Big red, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	3/31/2009 1:58:59 PM	I smoked a pack a day for 30 years. I only took it for 6 weeks and it worked fine.   Only side affect I had was a little nausea. Take with food and that helps. I have been smoke free 2 years.

I have absolutely no cravings, or nightmares, and can deal with the nausia.  What I can't deal with is how it is affecting my IBS.  I am almost ready to stop so that the gas and bloating will go away.  I've tried Gas-X and Beano, but found nothing to help in the discomfort.
Stop Smoking	Littlebit, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/25/2009 11:39:49 AM	I have tried every thing out there like most people. I started Chantix about a year ago and it helped but I didnt get to finish the program because of insurance issues. I am now back on it and I am doing great. Getting ready to start my 3rd week of it and I have been totaly smoke free for 3 days. I still have the cravings but they quickly disappear. I also have the vivid dreams, sick to my stomache if I dont eat before I take it this dry numb feeling to my tounge and also an intermidant metalic taste in my mouth. The side effects are finally starting to disappear.
Stop Smoking	shygnboo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/20/2009 1:02:31 PM	I have smoked for 35 yrs. and recently been diagnosed with emphysema. I have to quit smoking. I have been on Chantix for 4 weeks and it is working for me. I am tired alot and I do get a craving occasionally, but it goes away as fast as it comes. Don`t sleep well. The dreams are vivid but not scary, and they are not every night. I am so proud of the fact that I have quit smoking. You can do anything you put your mind to.
Stop Smoking	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	3/12/2009 5:54:48 PM	I have been taking for 3 months now. Cravings were gone immediatly after I started taking the medication.  Its the habits that seem harder to give up.  Just had to try one habit at a time, not all at once or it would not have worked for me.  I did experience vivid dreams for about the first 4 wks after taking the meds.  The nausea lasts about 2 hrs a day in the morning mostly and i dont notice it as much in the evening. There can be side effects of depression but I have not had any effects. As far as weight gain, and moodiness I dont think has to do with the meds, it is a normal side effect of quitting smoking.  I would recommed this to anyone that is trying to quit. 
Stop Smoking	binners41, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	3/12/2009 5:08:55 PM	I took Chantix for 3 weeks. After a week and a half, I had really blinding headaches. None of the other side effects, though. I quit using it, and a week later, I still had the headaches. I went back to the doctor, and he said it wasn't the drug causing them. He prescribed some worthless meds for the headaches, which do not work, and I am thinking about starting Chantix where I left off. The price of cigarettes is bankrupting me!!!

But this is the deal...I have to quit or I can't breathe.  Overall, it's worth it if you are well prepared, which I don't think that most people are.  I've taken it 3! times..this time it's a go.

What impressed me was that on the seventh day I had smoked less than one pack and I had not even tried to cut back, it just happened. on day two now of being completly smoke free. Have short little cravings now and then but they go away quickly. Have had no side effects what so ever. Too bad, I was kinda looking forward to the dreams people talked about.

You just have to hang in there and know how to use it.  I couldn't take the meds with food, I had to take it after I had eaten an entire meal, not just a snack.  Smoked for 11 years and have not smoked for four months.  You have to be motivated to quit for the meds to work.  The meds just take the edge off of everything.

I smoked for 30 years and tried to quit with every available med or system out there. Nothing worked for me until Chantix. I am smoke free for 7 months now and I do not want to smoke. I took the medicine for 3 months. During that time I would occasionally have the desire for a cigarette but it was a very short lived craving and I was easily able to supress the desire. I carefully followed my doctors advice and I am extremely pleased with the results!!!

Stop Smoking	B. Strange, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/9/2008 2:17:08 PM	By using Chantix I have reached my three month mark of not smoking. I stopped taking the pill three days after I quit smoking and did not have any cravings. My spouse is now trying it. The main side effects we experience/d are vivid dreams(no nightmares), vertigo, and mild nausea. I did notice that after I quit I was quicker to get angry. I think it was more along the lines that I didn't use smoking to cool down and separate myself from the person upseting me. I never noticed before how my smoking saved many people's feelings.

Stop Smoking	MattGT321, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	19-24	12/2/2008 12:50:42 AM	Hard to take in the mornings for me. Since i usually skip breakfast and just have coffee at work, i have to find food to take, otherwise makes me want to vomit for hours.Also, i havent had nightmares yet, and only been on for about 3 weeks. So far, has limited my smoking for like 3 hours after i take the pill, then im back on for a slower smoking day. But I am only 21, and i have a full mental state and work for an engineering company, and i have had some weird and interesteing dreams.BEWARE. Your dreams become reality, and at least for a little bit. They seem realistic, but when u wake up, you know it was just a dream. I woke up one morning, to agony. I work up to the sound of my kicking my wall as hard as i could. I remember i was a pro soccer player and was kicking a ball. Kicked and broke my big toe's nail. Broke off like 1/3 of the nail. Just be careful and hope i dont hit any dreams that make me hurt anyone or myself.

I am having surgery to resect my lung for a disease called MAI.  I started with the Wellbutrin 150mg 1 at 7am, 1 at 1pm and chantix 1mg twice a day 9am &amp;9pm.  I was able to quit in 3 days. The wellbutrin helped with the depression associated with quitting smoking and reported side affect of chantix.  Works great!  Love it! and now my Hubby is going to do it too! I recommend it for anyone serious about quitting smoking. I plan on stopping all meds and staying off cigarettes by 11/30/08.

Last year, I lasted 1 month then stopped taking them and started smoking again. Now, I've been smoke-free for 5 weeks and plan on taking Chantix for as long as I can. Just got 2 more months worth, which should last me 4 months since I break the pills in half and take half in the morning and half in the afternoon, which works fine for me. I have been irritable, which I didn't think was from the Chantix, but my doctor told me today that probably is it. She said if people have underlying &quot;mental issues&quot; Chantix can bring it out. For me, I have mood swings. I am having some trouble sleeping, which I can't say for sure is from the Chantix or not. I do enjoy the vivid dreams when I do get some sleep. I have experienced gas too, which isn't fun for a woman to be rootin' &amp; a tootin'! But, so far it's keeping me from smoking, and that makes it all worthwhile!

Taking the meds with a big meal helped. Was on it for 3 months the first time, when I went off I went right back to smoking. Now I'm trying again. No dreams, no suicidal thoughts. Will stay on longer this time. Noticed 2 things - nausea was worse when taken with milk, and taking this and Synthroid together caused very bad migraines.

But overall it has worked for me.  
Stop Smoking	exquisiteJ, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	8/6/2008 1:50:26 AM	I have been on Chantix for almost two weeks. The urge to smoke is almost completely eliminated. However, the side effects are terrible and I am debating on quitting the medication. The odd dreams are manageable. The nausea, vomiting, migraines are terrible. It has also seemed to trigger a pre-existing anxiety condition. I have had four panic attacks and they had to cut my dose to half a tab twice daily. I am having emotional disturbance and depression. I do not recommend this drug to people with pre-exisiting mental conditions due to the possibility of increasing the symptoms of mental disorders.

For me, when I get it in my system good, I notice tenderness in my right kidney area. May just be a coincidence???   But I'm going to quit for good, and I prefer the Chantix be there to help me.SO sad the Insurance companies don't see then need to cover this, but rather pay the long term care and cost of a smoker. This could be a way of &quot;preventative medicine&quot; which would help a lot of folks.

Stop Smoking	_charlie_, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/27/2008 1:59:02 AM	I started Chantix on Nov 8, 2007 and stopped smoking on Nov 15, 2007. When I stopped treatment after the 12 week course, I noticed my cravings came back a little. But the benefits of not smoking outweighed the comforts of smoking. I did notice that if I slipped up (which occured 3 times after quit date) and smoked a cig, I would get so nauseated. The doc told me that it was supposed to do that, the nicotine wasn't satisfying me and was going straight to my stomache and making me sick. Smoke...get sick... I'll stick with the no smoking. Also while taking this med, my sleep pattern was awful. I woke up almost every night and always felt exhausted. This ended when I stopped taking the medication. I sleep 20 times better now, and 10 times better than I did when I smoked - mainly due to the fact I don't wake up hacking.
Stop Smoking		4	5	4			6/12/2008 10:46:33 AM	From the time I started I quit for 6 months then got depressed and started again after 3 days of smoking I called the doctor to start on Chantix again I am now on my 3 rd day of taking it. I hope I don't relapse and start smoking again.
Stop Smoking	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	2	5	Female	55-64	6/9/2008 5:46:57 PM	I started using chantix Dec 1, 2007 and my last cigerette was Dec 8,2007.  At first I got very depressed.   my doctor took me off the medication and started me on a low dose antidepressant.  This all happened in November 2007.I also used patches. It worked. But I gained 16 lbs which upset my doctor.
Stop Smoking	dfwmifb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	5/26/2008 1:45:39 AM	I used this medication to help me stop smoking. I went through to boxes of this stuuf and I am still smoking. It is not cheap and insurance DOES NOT help pay for it. I stayed sick to my ston=mach every day while on this and eben lower the dosage by cutting the pills in half di not help. I became depressed; severe mood swings and even thoughts of ending my life. When this crossed my mind I knew it had to be the chantix. I stopped it and refuse to try again. 
Stop Smoking	Viv, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/23/2008 2:19:14 PM	I am 52 and have smoked since I am 14 years of age.  Did quit before for months at a time, but was always depressed about not allowing myself to smoke.  I was on it since the end of January doing well, had a death in the family, slip off of it, but went right back.  Down to one or two cigerettes a day which is not good, but only keeping me depended on nicotine.  As of April 7th, no even a puff of a cigerette.  I will not give in this time.  I will not allow myself to be tempted anymore.  I Feel very proud of myself.  There are three of us who all quit around the same time .  WE ARE SMOKE FREE........AND WANT TO STAY THAT WAY..............

I had the vivid dreams, some constipation but the side effect that they don't mention is the joint pain. I was on Chantix for 7 weeks and had to stop taking it because my feet and nakles hurt so bad. I couldn't figure out why I was having problems. I then talked to my sister-in-law and found out that she was taking Chantix and had to quit because of joint pain. I'm still not smoking so I'm very happy about that but I still do occasionally have the urge to smoke. I'm hoping that the join pain goes away. It hasn't yet and I quit taking Chantix as soon as my sister-in-law said that she and other friends had the same symptoms as mine. I quit about a month and a half ago.

I can't sleep and have some other side effects, but it IS WORTH IT.  The docter told me 1 cig. could kill me.  I have NO cravings and can not stand the smell of smoke now.  I have 2 grandchildren and one on the way and I plan on being around for them.  If I can do it anyone can.  My family will tell you that real fast. I just wish I would have done it sooner.

It will be 17 weeks on Sunday March 23rd. I'm also putting back $25 a week. I have not had any side effects to mention. I did notice nausea at first, I started taking the medication with a full glass of milk. My blood sugar has risen. I have just two more months to take the medication. I'm hoping my bloos sugar with go back down afterwards. I have recommended this drug to everyone, I have called it my miracle drug.

I warned my friends and family about the possible side effects, mood swings, etc but fortunately have not had any. I take one in the morning and one at lunch to prevent insomnia. I have had some vivid dreams but no nightmares (almost as good as reading a book). I would rather deal with the short term side effects than feeling like an outcast when smoking.

Stop Smoking	Hunter360, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	35-44	3/5/2008 8:37:56 AM	Started taking Chantix Dec 24 while I continued to smoke. My quit date was Jan 7 and I am happy to say I have not smoked a cigerrette since. The cravings were tough up until about the 8th week but now I hardly notice the cravings. I have also stopped taking the Chantix after 8 weeks due to the expense and I have not had any desire to start smoking again. I am proud of not smoking after 25 years. One other thing that I believe helped my sucess was the support from GetQuit.com, if you check in each day you will see how many days you have quit and the potential money you may have saved. I have saved almost $400.00 so far. That alone is worth it because that is going to be my new boat payment. Good Luck Everyone and don't give up!!!!

I have notice a few things; one being the first time I took the challenge to quit smoking I thought it was going to just be take the pill and quit smoking.  I have since realized that is had to be a commitment that I made with myself without that real commitment the first time I took the pill and continued to smoke.  This time I realized that I was slowly killing myself and with a new beautiful grand daughter (my first) I want to be able to fully enjoy the blessing. So, this time I am committed and I will beat this today is my 30th day without a cigarette and I didn't think I could make it this far.  I only experience the nausea sometimes, some weird dreams, and I have noticed some things taste different.  But, after being in my office and someone walking in who smoked; the smell was awful and I didn't realize that I too have smelled like that.  I will continue this medicine because I really want to beat this.

I have followed the program without fail and have been smoke fee for 6 1/2 weeks.  Have vivid dreams, slight trouble sleeping but well worth any inconvience.  Cravings have lessened with time, but still crave once in a while.  Biggest problem has been life style (eat a meal=smoke,drive the car-smoke), etc.  Plan to finish the meds (3 mo program) and will never smoke again.

I didn't have alot of side effects besides the sleepiness and I would get nauseous ever once in a while. The smell of smokes makes me sick now and eventhough I get small cravings I truely believe it is the habit of having something between your fingers and putting something to your mouth.

Had incredibly vivid dream, flatulence, and trouble sleeping.  Doc gave me lorazepam which helped w/sleeping.  Took 30 day script and refilled next 30 days -- talked to pharmacist -- said I was over the physical withdrawal and from here on out it was mental  - but Pfizer would be more than happy to get my $$$.  Given the side effects, I chose to quit after taking drug for 5 weeks.  It was (is still) hard - but I knew it was my time to quit(like Pfizer's ad campaign says).  I smoked 2 pks/day for ~7 yrs, 1 pk/day for 14 yrs.  It's only been about 5 months....but I don't want to be a smoker, so am hopeful I will not start again.

I have been on chantix for 3 weeks now and I have only had 4 in 2 weeks.  I am so incredibly pleased that the cravings have completely gone away and smoking a cigarette is last on my list if on it at all!  On the other hand, I have had horrible nightmares every single night for 3 weeks and that is really bothering me.  The constipation is awful, and when I wake up from the dreams, it takes me hours to fall back to sleep.  Depression also, but you know what??  I can't really say I mind going through those annoying side effects if it means that I am a smoke free person now and have so much more energy for my 3 little girls, and myself!  I wish I heard about Chantix a long time ago!

I tried just about everything to quit, and when I became ill late last year my doctor prescribed Chantix. It has been a miracle drug for me. My craving for nicotine was the thing which held me up, and with Chantix it xompletely has disappeared. I am three weeks with a cigarette, and cannot believe it!!!I do have a problem with nausea which is worse after my morning dose. But I breathe, smell and taste sooo much better- my nausea is (almost) worth it.My family and friends are impressed as they know how big a smoker I had become.

In my work I continually have to go to locations where over half the staff smokes. If I was not taking Chantix I would be right back up to 1 1/2 packs a day. Currently I just bum 1 to 4 a day. The side effects have been mild and usually subside. I have had mild constipation that goes away. The worst is the mild insomnia and dreams. I'll wake up for no reason about every hour through the night. I'm usually awake before the alarm goes off and that's usually because a dream woke me up.

I do notice if I take on an empty stomach it seems to make me feel a little out of sorts or edgy along with some nauseau.  If I eat first, it reduces or elimantes it.  Dreams are crazy but bareable.  I only take 1 tablet a day as that is all I seem to need to not smoke or even want to.  I want to stop now but am afraid.  Does anyone have any advise on when is a safe time to ween of of Chantix?

Yes it was expensive, but less than the cost of cigarettes.  Took all cravings away, even when around other smokers. Little nausea, constipation, wild dreams, but I can breathe better. Been smoke free for over 15days.  My brother is smoke free for over 4 months.  Worth the cost and the mild side effects.

I have tried to quit smoking using several different methods and have found this medication to be the most successful I have ever been. It appears to be getting easier each day. Would advise anyone who is wanting to quit to try this medication. My only problem is the dreaming that I have been having. I have never dreamed so much in my life since taking this medication. Some are weird and very vivid. Those to appear to be easing or else I am just so tired it dosent matter anymore. That is really my only side effect that has really bothered me at this point. Having people encourage you has been a tremedous help also.

MY ACUPUNCTURIST WHO IS ALSO A D.O WROTE ME A SCRIPT FOR THE DRUG CHANTIX.  THIS WAS THE FIRST DRUG I HAD TAKEN IN THREE YEARS.  I READ THE SIDE EFFECTS TO BE SURE IT WASN'T GOING TO BE ANYTHING I COULDN'T HANDLE AND STARTED THE DRUG ON 6/21/07.I HAD NAUSEA AND CONSTIPATION BUT I LOWERED THE DOSE TO MAKE IT MORE TOLERABLE.  BY THE BEGINNING OF JULY I NOTICED MY KNEES AND CALVES HURT PRETTY BAD.  THIS ONLY GOT WORSE AND I MADE AN APPT. WITH MY ORTHOPEDIC DR.  HE COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG THROUGH X-RAYS BUT HE DID DRAW FLUID FROM MY RT. KNEE AT THAT TIME.THE LEG PAIN CONTINUED AND STARTED TO RADIATE TO OTHER JOINTS IN MY BODY.  I SAW MY GP DR. ON 11/1/07 BECAUSE I HAD A URINARY TRACT INFECTION, SOMETHING I HAVE NOT HAD IN THE LAST 25 YEARS OR SO.  I MADE ANOTHER APPT. WITH MY ORTHOPEDIC DR. FOR 11/12 BECAUSE MY JOINT PAIN WAS ONLY GETTING WORSE.  WHEN NOT FINDING ANY REASON FOR THE PROBLEMS I WAS HAVING HE ORDERED A SLEW OF BLOOD TESTS.   I WENT TO MY GP 11/16 TO FIND OUT WHAT THE TESTS SHOWED.  HE TOLD ME THAT EVERYTHING POINTED TO SYSTEMIC LUPUS!  HE STARTED ME ON SOME PAIN MEDS TO GIVE ME SOME RELIEF ( I DON'T TAKE ANY MED'S THAT I DON'T HAVE TO AND ONLY A TYLENOL WHEN IT IS UNBEARABLE.

Stop Smoking	 Female  (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female		1/15/2008 3:36:40 PM	About a month after starting Chantix, I began to get extremely depressed and suicidal!!  I had no idea why.  I called my doctor and he said STOP the Chantix.  I did and now feel much happier and no depression!!  Since then, I have heard this same complaint from many people!!
Stop Smoking	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	4	Male	25-34	1/14/2008 2:13:21 PM	I am a 30 yr old man that has smoke since I was 14.  I didn't have any side effects until I started the 1mg twice a day.  I found that I suffered from impotence at times.  I spoke to my Dr and was told to cut the dose in half and that it was a side effect that would wear off with time.  After cutting the dose in half I am back to my old self and a non smoker now for 7 months.  I also only had to take the med for 2 months.  WONDER DRUG!!

Stop Smoking	Jack4077, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	1/9/2008 4:39:38 PM	I smoked 3 packs a day for 40 years and would still be smoking if it hadn't been for my heart attack. I always thought I was immortal and nothing was going to happen to me. Then bang it did. I was not over weight, I exercised and I ate right. But I had family history and smoked, that's what got me. I didn't want to wait the seven days to quit like suggested so I stopped on the first day and never started back. I took chantix for 14 days and didn't smoke at all. The weird dreams were kind of amusing but I was having trouble sleeping so I backed off on the chantix and totally was off of it and cigeretts after 20 days. I feel better, smell better and am saving myself a ton of money. Don't get me wrong, I would still live to light up a Kool but I know that if I do I will have another heart attack and the next one will take me out. That's my incentive to stay qiut. Trust me folks, if I can do it you can do it. It has been 4 months and I am hanging tuff. It aint gonna get me again. I am QUIT!
Stop Smoking	trtcollet, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/8/2008 9:21:10 AM	My wife and I both started at the same time and the first week we only smoked a small potion of what we used to.  We both quit on the second week on the medication with no problem.  The only side effects we both have are very vivid dreams and occasional nausea but both are worth it to stop smoking.  We feel that the negative side effects are only bothersome to those who don't really want to quit, if you really want to, this pill is a miracle.

I quit on the day I started the medication, and have had two puffs off friends cigs (while I was drinking alcohol...) Rod Serling dreams with a dash of Rob Zombie, nothing I can't handle, take the second dose around 5:00 to avoid sleeplessnes. I understand that I am part of the solution, so my wonder is how is life coming off chantix, and life after chantix...? Any advice out there? If you're considering taking the med...I say give it a try, you'll smell better, and walking up a hill won't seem like Mt. Everest. Good Luck!

My commit date to stop is 1-6. I really believe this will work. Side effects have been mild, nausea for the first hour once I started 2 pills a day. Vivid dreams (which I actually enjoyed)have seemed to stop. I have had some mood swings but if you are aware of it you can control it.
Stop Smoking	Connie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	45-54	1/1/2008 4:54:09 AM	This has been a very hard process. But from the first day of my quit date I have not had 1 puff. I am totally commeted to stay quit for the rest of my life. I am so thankful I chose to quit. I feel great, can breath, my cloths don't stink, my teeth are whiter. I am calm. You have to have a strong want inside you to quit. It is not a magic pill. I am glad I have worked so hard not to give in to that blessed nicotine. I will not go through that withdrawal again. I am in control of me, not the icky cigs. It has been a hard fight, but one worth fighting. I won, I am finally free.

I started taking it and followed the directions to the tee. I am super satisfied with Chantix, I wish they would have thought of this before. Normally, I smoke about one and half packs per day, so for a solution like this to be availible, I highly recommend it, worth every penny!!!!!

One issue....for the past two days i've been taking three a day, not two.  yea, i need to stop that, but it helps.  No sleeping issues, stomach slightly upset for the first hour of taking it.

I had severe nausea until I cut the morning dose in half and could not sleep more than 4 - 5 hours/night.  Also had strange dreams, but could live with that.  I also developed an uncontrollable unilateral facial tic which I hope will stop after I have finished weaning myself off the drug.

Severe dizziness, nausea, headaches, and worst of all?  I went temporarily blind in my right eye!  I didn't even know that was a potential side effect until I consulted my Doctor.  I am now trying Wellbutrin.  Hopefully, that will work better for me.  Many of my friends, and my Mother-in-law have had great success with Chantix - I guess it was not meant to be for me.

Have tried every other method to quit(unsuccessfully). This really does make a difference. I have been on it for almost 4 weeks. Since week 2, I have been down to 3 cigs a day, but can't seem to quit all the way.  I can go all day (which is a great accomplishment for me), but when I get home from work, I just can't seem to resist the strong urge to smoke. I have had no side effects (other than a little moody)so I think I'll get my refill and give it another month.

You have to go thru nicotine withdrawal and the med withdrawal when you quit.  I spoke with pfyxer myself to confirm this,  Now headaches and the need to so smoke is overwhelming.  I was on the drug for two months.

There is no cureall for quitting.  However, for me, Chantix has been a miracle drug.  I'm 31 years old and I've been smoking since I was 16.  I continued smoking through the first week.  At the end of the first week, I cleaned out my car and vowed not to smoke in it anymore. By the end of the 2nd week, I was smoking less because I just wasn't craving them as often.  I am nearing the end of my 4th week on Chantix and my only complaint is the severe nausea it gives me.  I take it with food, with lots of water and still I'm nauseated for 30 minutes after I take it. Unlike quitting with the patch or other methods, I have no anxiety about quitting, my cravings are gone and smoking is just not a part of my thought process anymore. I've quit a million times with all the methods out there and this is by far the best thing on the market.

However, it does have side effects that might make some people want to stop taking it.  I've been on it for two weeks, quit on my quit date with no trouble but have had stomach issues the whole time.  It think it's worth it.

Or perhaps it's helping me to control the urge.  After two weeks taking this medication, I can be in an environment where people are smoking and I simply do not feel the urge to smoke. This is so amazing and liberating!  I would recommend this drug without hesitation, as would my sister, who also quit using Chantix.

Only took it 3 wks. but did quit. many others having this &amp; need to report. Chantix should be banned til they find a cure for us in sooo much pain. For those who do not have these awful effects, it does truly work wonders for smoking. Put on market too soon. Go to wrongdiagnosis.com and read, it will scare you. If I have to live my life like this I would rather smoke and feel good.

Down-side is sleep disruption, weird dreams and some nervousness and depression. Cannot take the recommended twice daily. Do not be discouraged - take what your body will allow. No cigs for me for 33 days - tried not taking for two days just to see if I could and I'm back on it - cravings were back and strong.  I'd say hard core smokers need to stay on for 4 - 6 months.

I've smoked for over 20 years and this is the only treatment that has worked. The side affects are worth it. I've known others that it hasn't worked for. But more success rates than not. However, I was wondering if the rash I'm just getting now on my forearms is related to the medication. I've been on it for about 4 weeks now.

I followed the treatment to a tee.  I stopped taking the drug after about 6 months.  I have not smoked in 1yr and 2months.  I smoked for 30 years and have no desire to smoke.  I cannot stand the smell of it.  After trying everything, Chantix worked for me.

I have tried to quit smoking SO many times and get down to the 2-5 critical cigaretts of my day for 1-3 weeks but always unable to give up the last few.I do not miss my cigaretts, I do not feel like i want to rip out someones eyeballs to get a cigarett, the urge does pass quickly if I have one.Thank God for Chantex!I smoked 1 to 1 1/2 pack a day for 34 years.Did the gum, patches twice, filter tip's, hypnotism, 3-4 stop smoking prograns by the American heart and the lung associations........This was the answer for me!

Stop Smoking	Marcella, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/10/2007 9:50:11 AM	IT'S A MIRACLE DRUG! My husband and I quit together.  On our quit day, we each had one of our kids break up our remaining cigarettes (removing the temptation and accessabiltiy)  I was a smoker for 26 years at 1 to 2 packs a day.  my husband smoked 2-3 packs a day. We have now been smoke free for 6 weeks.  In the beginning, if i though about having a smoke, I would take a couple of deep breaths and the thought would pass.  I did not have any of the nervous jittery feelings that I had with other stop smoking treatments.  I don't even think about having one now.  If you do not eat before taking this, you will feel sick.  be sure to eat something.  dreams have been vivid and a little odd. I don't know if this is a part of the medication, or if this is from not having nicotine in my system but I actually feel clamer now than before, I have more patience with my kids!  I don't get as stressed out at work.  I am hoping that this remains after I am done with the medication.  I have not had any other side effects. My kids are so proud of both of us and that means the world to me. i am fortunate that I only have a $15 co pay for this med because it is fairly expensive, i would take it even if i had to pay full price, it works.  the cost would be no more than what I would have spent on cigarettes. I can breathe better and my chest doesn't hurt.  my clothes don't stink.  For me there is no down side!  Good luck to all of you!

I am very fortunate that I have had no side effects, other than being more thirsty.  I have been smoke free three days now and my biggest obstacle is the &quot;assocation&quot; smoking; getting in my car, sitting down to watch TV, those sort of things.  I have had urges, but very few and they don't last long, I am usually able to talk myself out of it, or chat with someone else until it is gone.  I would recommend that any smoker that is ready to quit give this drug a try.

The first was a weird...maybe because I overthought it...the second week was a lil better and now I am good.  No side effects or bad dreams and I haven't had a cigarette in a week or so ^_^
Stop Smoking	Sarah, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/30/2007 3:48:16 AM	After smoking 29 years and trying to quit on my own four times last year, I was finally able to just walk away. The cost for the medicine is about the same as the cost for the cigarettes. I took the medicine for only 6 weeks and have now been smoke-free for two and a half months. I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to quit. Amazing medicine. Thank goodness for this find.

Stop Smoking	Woman, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	10/29/2007 2:18:36 AM	It's a miracle.  After one month, I don't even think about having a cigarette.  In the beginning I thought about it but didn't crave it. Now I don't do either.  It's great except for having insomnia and you have to make sure you eat with it or it will upset your stomach. You also have to have your mind made up about not smoking. I don't smell like an ashtray anymore, I'm saving lots of money and I'm getting Healthy!! You can do it-it really works!
Stop Smoking	FaithHopeLove, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/28/2007 10:13:38 PM	After smoking 1 1/2 packs of cigarettes a day for 35 years I have been blessed to have quit before a month is up.  I had horrible dreams when taking 2 a day so I am only taking 1 a day now.  It will be a month in 2 days and I have had no cigarette.  As for me I thank God for this medication and his support in helping me quit.  I really think you have to be sure quitting is what you want to do before the drug will completely work for you.  Make your mind up and join me in being smokefree.
Stop Smoking		5	5	2			10/27/2007 7:36:59 AM	It completely eliminated my desire to smoke.  I quickly went from smoking a pack a day to not even thinking about smoking.  However, the nausea and heartburn became unbearable.

Dreams at the beginning were crazy as well.  Sleep patterns were not really affect, accept for the crazy dreams.  But stopped smoking within 2 weeks of taking prescription and have been smoke free for almost 6 months. Don't get too caught up in all the bad news this medicine has had with stories and what not.

I have had a lot of nausea and vomiting but it is well worth it as long as I get the good results that I've been having. I've smoked for 50 years and nothing else has come close to helping like this did.

HOPEFULLY someone in the insurance business will see that this medication is worth it's weight in gold, and get it on all of the drug forumalary's!!!

I can't believe how easy this makes quitting! Rarely do I have a bad craving. Most of the time I forget about cigarettes during the day/night. I'm really happy with this medication. The only problem I've had is stomach upset. I am a NON-SMOKER now!
