Prevention of Low Potassium in the Blood	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	65-74	6/20/2011 12:22:50 PM	I am trying to take K-DUR to counteract potassium loss due to taking Lasix.  It is difficult to swallow and falls apart in my mouth, throat, and esophagus.  It turns into scratching, scraping shards or particles.  These do not dissolve in water.  I tried.  They remain particles that must be swallowed and for me are not completely washed down with water.  My esophagus has become so irritated it is uncomfortable and at times becomes spastic when I swallow food. After a talk with my druggist, she is changing me to extended release capsules which I have taken in the past with no problems.  No more gravel swallowing sounds good to me.  Good luck with your K-Dur.

They need to put a coating on them like some asprin have. They get stuck in the throat. Right now I'm suffering with stomach pain because I didn't take them with food. I'll never do that again.

Very Scary! Then I bit it and then bit it again. Now, I chew up the 4 pills 3 times a day and then flood my mouth with water to the the pill sawdust down the ole hatch. Bitting into smaller chunks is the only way to get it down the throat. They really need to redesign this thing!Taste isn't so bad, a slight taste of salt. the granules get themselves under the plates (for those of you with partials or full dentures) and that hurts!Yeah, I take 18 thousand milligrams per day of K-Dur to combat what the 160mg of Lasix strips away so that my heart doesn't go into A-Fib.
