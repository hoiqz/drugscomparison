Daily folic acid. Gradually have reduced to 4, 2.5 mgs weekly and feel better but have skin outbreaks recurring. Medicine affects taste resulting in loss of appetite.Some hair loss. Worst side effect is 1-3 days after dosing suffer with 1 bout of severe intestinal dumping which happens without warning requiring need to stay home and sometimes emergency return home thereby seriously restricting activities. Less medicine, diet do not seem to stop the intestinal side effect.

My hair started to fall out when I first started taking it, but after a few months it stopped and grew back in curly (and I had very fine straight hair)so that was a plus.  I take it on a Saturday so I can deal with the fatigue before Monday.

I am on 7 pills a week.  I am also on Mobic for inflammation, predisone and folic acid.  I am down to 2.5 mg on predisone and hope to come off soon.  I have not had any effects from the medicine except it makes me sick and tired.  I tend to take it right before I go to bed so I dont have to deal with the nausea and tiredness as much.  I forgot I do take 2mg of folic acid because I was seeing an increase in hair loss.  Overall it has worked great

Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	45-54	6/29/2011 2:31:53 PM	I had ugly psoriasis patches on my face &amp; elbows plus arthritis.DR perscribed 2.5mg tabs - (2Fri/2Sat). Not much help so DR upped it to 6 tabs per wkend and for past 1+yrs seems to do the trick. My psoriasis cleared up nicely in conjunction with OXY (maximum) Face Wash and consistent use of Cetaphil lotion.I do have strange / bad dreams occasionally and do seem to be very tired. I do take folic acid, lisinopril, 81mg aspirin and citalopram as well. Not sure which or combo is causing tiredness but I can sleep lots unless I set alarm. I also seem to have strange &quot;tingling&quot; in my legs sometimes when trying to sleep.It's like I have to move them-walk around or something to make it stop. Usually goes away after 20mins or so. Thought it might be potassium - have gotten up and eaten a banana...not sure if it was the walk or the banana that got rid of the tingle.Overall, I am very happy with the effect on my psoriasis, pain is manageable. Prior to this RX I was eating Aleve like candy--6-8 per day, seriously. I am also overweight which obviously doesn't help. Am somewhat concerned about the possible effects to liver and bones. Also was perscribed 50K Vit D per week plus 1000 Vit D daily with the Methotrexate. Hopefully that will help keep the bones intact.

For the past few months however, I have noticed more episodes in which my arthritis has flared up requiring me to take steroids for a short period.  My rhematologist has considered changing my treatment plan, but I have had chronic sinus infections, and have hesitated in switching up until now.  I recently was found to have a mass which appears benign pressing against my esophagus.  They are still in the process of diagnosing this nodule, but I am wondering if it could not be rheumatoid in nature.  I mentioned this to my family physician and he seems to believe this is not the case.  As yet, I have not had the opportunity to mention this to my rheumatologist, as my next appointment is not until May.  I plan on giving him a call however.  If it does prove to be rheumatoid in nature, I plan on switching to another form of treatment.  
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	13-18	4/6/2009 4:10:47 AM	I'm taking this drug to keep my kidneys from failing as a result of my lupus. According to my doctor, half the time it works and half the time it doesn't appear to be the best option for me. The nausea is unbearable though, and the schedule is difficult to conform to with my chronic fatigue. However, I guess this is the best option I have right now (and for the next two years at least) so if it's between failing kidneys or a little nausea, I'll take the nausea any day.

This medication has worked wonders for me each time I go on it. My dermatologist would put me on 6x2.5mg once a week for 6 weeks, then reduce dosage to zero gradually. Each time I take these pills, my outbreak clears miraculously. But problem is, my psoriasis has a tendency to come back a few months after I go off the pills. I also go for regular blood test to ensure my liver is clear. This medication is a godsend to me when I'm depressed over a very bad outbreak that ointment couldn't help much. It's my short quick fix whenever I need to clear my skin of the ugly psoriasis outbreak, but I only go on this medication only in times of heavy outbreak as I'm afraid of possible side effects.

Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	2/1/2008 5:51:47 PM	I have had palm psoriasis for 6 years. Was refered to this drug about 2 months ago. Started out with 7.5mg per week. Every time I took this medication I would get ill. Vomiting, nausiea, migraines, fever, the list is endless. After taking this for 4 weeks my Dr. added another 5mg to the 7.5mg I had already been taking.  Side effects continued to get worse. My psoriasis didn't get much better. The illness and side effects made this medication not worth taking.
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	pjcasebeer@earthlink.net, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	1/24/2008 6:01:23 PM	I had a so called &quot;reaction&quot; to this medication and I believe anyone who is considering it for any disease should be very careful about side effects.  I started on a low dose and had some warning signs but because these side effects are so &quot;rare&quot; the doctor dismissed these signs as not related to the Methotrexate.  He doubled my dose to 7 mg and within 8 hours I was in the ER vomiting with diarrhea that was black and smelled extremely foul and like chemicals.  Everyone in the ER was sent to my room to help. I was in the hospital for five days. I had mouth sores, history of a gastric ulcer, history of sensitivity to medications.  I was being treated for lupus.  This medication may be very helpful for many people but sometimes I think the &quot;rare&quot; reactions are dismissed too regularly because they are so adamantly labeled &quot;RARE.&quot;  I am also afraid that many cases of these kind of reactions are under reported after all the official studies are done where somehow the rare side effects are overlooked.  My advice is to be very careful and take it slowly with this drug.     It's tempting to say only bad things about this drug considering the hell I went through because of it.  It might be that this drug might help a lot of people with serious disease with agonizing symptoms.  But when you read about it in detail, it is pretty scary what can happen to you.  You better have a very good doctor who can pick up on the nuances of your disease and what are truly VERY IMPORTANT side effects.  Good luck to you all.

The results completely outweigh the side effects and im very glad my doctor started me on this prescription. If you follow your doctors directions and get regular check ups, you dont have much to fear with this med except an upset stomach.
