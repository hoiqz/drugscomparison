He has been so violent that I have been afaird around him. The violence started after a few episodes and is now after almost every episode. we have tried using Depakote Er to counteract the violence but it is no longer working so we are switching him to something else.

He also has chronic asthma.and he has other medicines that cause side effects as well.

He has not had another seizure since starting it. But his emotional behavior has changed a lot.

I have two major concerns. First thing that I noticed was that I become very angry, I can be fine and if something upsets me like a car pulling in front of me, i can get into a rage. It scares me. Then also I have noticed my hair is thinner. My doctor has given me a new med called Lamectil that I have not started as of yet. Seems to be more side effects with that one also.

I'll admit it definitely has helped with the seizures, but im terrified to miss a dose. I have vivid dreams every single night which leads to no sleep, i always have a clump of hair in my hand when i take a shower, &amp; ive become extremely depressed. I cant wait for my next neuro appointment so i can have him start weaning me off this medicine.

Be sure to consider the side effects before using.

We were at our wits end. His seizures were so bad and he had just had a severe allergic reaction to lamictal. I am satisfied with it. I was afraid to try it due to behavior side effects that I had read about. Since he has autism and behavior issues anyway. It has been good. His behavior has remained stable and he is happy most of the time. He still has one or two seizures a month but they are less intense.

Simple Partial Seizures	disease control, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	12/11/2010 12:13:59 PM	I take 3000 mg keppra 2x daily as well as 200 mg lamictol 2x daily.  This combination controls my convulsive seizure activity but not my sps activity.  I still have deja vu, memory, and vision issues.  Unfortunately, the convulsive seizure activity is controlled so well that I mentally don't take my meds because I am &quot;cured&quot;.  I then will have a grand maul seizure after missing a couple days of meds.  This med combination has worked very well for me and once I convince myself I will never be &quot;cured&quot; of my epileptic activity I should be limited to mental attributes as opposed to physical attributes.
Simple Partial Seizures	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	10/26/2010 9:10:05 PM	I started taking keppra and had to switch to xr still having some breakthru once every few months going to be adding lamictal xr after reading the reviews a little scared to add that drug does not seem to help with control. will be slowly increasing the dose hoping that the side effects are small. I take 3000mg of xr and will be taking 200 mg of the lamictal xr. Does anyone else take this combo and give me feedback on this. They have never been able to find a reason for me having seizures to begin with. just something that started in 2008. I do notice the side effects with keppra emotional more then anything. any info would help me out. THANKS!

Just as soon as I took her off of the medicine her whole attitude changed and I got my happy child back. Definitely DO NOT recomend this, if using watch closley for emotional changes.
Simple Partial Seizures	adoug, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	9/8/2010 9:24:17 AM	I began taking this drug because of frequent sps which were exhibited through deja vu/false memories followed by severe jamais vu.  My seizures never generalized.  I am very satisfied with this medication as it has not only stopped my seizure activity but also has acted as an anti-anxiety medication as I no longer have to take Zoloft for generalized anxiety.  The only complaint I have is that now I have strange dreams that are quite vivid. They are not frightening, just strange.
Other	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	55-64	8/13/2010 12:15:20 PM	I take KeppraXR 1000mg once daily (at night)with Trileptal twice daily for COMPLEX Partial seizures (epilepsy).  I also have Vegus Nerve Stimulator (VNS)implanted.  Keppra has helped in reducing frequency of seizures, but not intensity.  I have been taking for three years.  Side effects include drowsiness (especially in afternoon) and  panic/anxiety, which I then MUST treat with Klonopin.  My neurologist has me continue with Keppra until and if newer med comes available.

I was put on a relatively high dose of Keppra and the side effects initially were horrifying.  I was borderline suicidal, severely depressed, aggressive and violent towards my husband - the complete opposite to the kind of person I really am.  In hindsight I should have been taken off the medication but the doctor simply said it was a side effect.  Now, two years later I realise that whilst for some people the side effects can be unbearable (usually just in the beggining)the drug actually works and I would not come off it now.  However, do not withdraw from this medication without medical supervision or advice.  I came off it because the side effects were unbearable but didn't tell anyone and ended up in status epilepticus, ventilated for 7 days in ICU.  Dangerous.  But the drug has generally less side effects than drugs such as topamax (I couldn't talk, walk, speak or write sometimes on this drug and couldn't make even simple decisions).

Don't have epilepsy but am Type 1 Diabetic and had consistently high blood sugars.  Previously on Dilantin (no problem). Switched to Lamectil, now Keppra.  This Keppra XR is causing severe and continuous alopecia!  I haven't had a seizure in 3 years but doctors reluctant to take me off med.  Losing my long, thick hair is NOT FUN!

I had 1 seizure in 2000 and one seizure in Dec. 2009.  I had 3 aura's in between the seizures. Dr. put me on 1000 mg Keppra XR and I had HUGE headaches 50 mins. later.  Felt like I had a CAP on my head that was WAY TOO SMALL for  me.  Reluctantly, Dr. reduced amount to 500 mg, for 1 week now.  Have headaches, less severe, every day. Even now.  I think STOPPING this medication is the best idea.  Seizures were minimal, headaches ARE daily.

Also, much safer for pregnancy and nursing mother.  I have been seizure free for almost 3 years and have lost 30lbs since going off of Depakote an switching to Keppra.  Overall, I am extremely pleased although I still get headaches, which may have been better controlled by the Depakote.

Started Keppra XR a few weeks ago. Doc wants to slowly decrease my Depakote and see how well I respond. Doc has told me that he has had many patients respond well to this drug (except of course for any side effects they may have experienced). Depakote ER is what causes all of my depression and tiredness. Keppra XR hit me hard for the first week . I am on 500mg in the morning and 1000mg at night. Tiredness returned to normal (becasue of the DEpakote ER) after the first week. Still getting used to it and not sure what will happen when the Neurologist starts lowering my Depakote slowly. Will post more news later.

She has the opposite side effects, it makes her excessively hyper and unruly. Her doctor even suggested a second medication to counteract her hyperactivity, but I don't believe in double medicating for no reason. She's 5 now, still has seizures regularly. I still don't know why they insist on her continuing this medication because it doesn't seem to be working on anything useful.

Simple Partial Seizures	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/16/2009 9:56:13 AM	Diagnosis of primary generalized epiliepsy.  I have had zero seizures since starting this medication.  I changed from Keppra to Keppra XR after my insurance co mandated a generic subsitution for Keppra, against what my doctor ordered.  Great effectiveness, but definitely experience tiredness and irritability.  However, I can manage these much more effectively than a seizure.

I've had it about just 2 years now. The Keppra was given as an addition-drug because my main Rx drug wasn't preventing a certain type of seizure. With the combination of the 2 Rx drugs I am taking - as long as I take them everyday - I get no seizures. I do experience some unnatural irratiability from Keppra. I tend to get some drowiness and a little dizziness (side effects of both drugs).
Convulsive Seizures	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	45-54	1/14/2009 2:00:48 AM	this medication is new to me and added to neurontin. therefore, i can not truly rate it. i appreciate users comments regarding side affects. i had two grand mals in may of 04, then this july 3rd, i seized while driving, crossed the center line, hit a car head on and nearly died as i collapsed a lung. they are still testing. i'm hoping the tiredness from the keppra doesnt bother me as i have sleep issues as well. its also nice to hear about possible anger and aggresiveness, thus something to watch for.

Keppra has stop the seizures but he experiences fatigue, inability to concentrate, irritability and extreme anger and aggression.  He has stopped taking it due to the anger and aggression. Hopefully there is another medication without this dangerous side-effect.

He experiences less seizures (Thank God). But, the side effects of tiredness, blurred vision and zoning into space is much experienced. Overall, we are thankful and it is less harmfull on the liver and kidneys as to other anti-seizure medications. I hope this will benifit someone out there in need of information and undecided on what meds. to take for seizures.
