Needing to Urinate Immediately	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	5/23/2012 4:14:33 PM	Detrol has allowed me to urinate within normal time ranges of 3 - 4 hours.  It has almost eliminated all leakage, accidents and embarrassing situations.  No real side effects to report.  My quality of life has definitely improved.
Overactive Bladder	madam butterfly, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	55-64	2/4/2012 10:16:33 PM	I have been taking detrol 2mg. for my oab for many years now but it hasn't helped much I have to wear a incontinence pad 24-7 and when I cough or sneeze or stand from a sitting or laying position I leak urine sometimes to the point my underware and pants are soaked.
Frequent Urination	In a Quandry, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	55-64	1/24/2011 9:54:56 AM	I continue to urinate.  I sometimes urinate 10-15 times (at least) per day.  Then, the urge will cease for a while.  I am 57 y-o woman.  I have not been able to entirely stop black tea and sweeteners but even when I do stop, it continues.  Have also been making some other dietary changes.  The Detrol may work a little...also find I crash when it wears off and feel weepy.

Frequent Urination	luckygrandma6, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	6/21/2010 8:53:54 AM	My Doctor put me on this drug as I have all the symptoms that go along with it. There are nights when I'm up every hour on the hour and always feel like I have to go. I'm on the third package of samples and so far I don't see this working but he also said he wouldn't guarantee it becasue sometimes women who have ahd children makes their bladder drop when they get older and so they have to have surgery to fix the problem.

I have been taking it in the evening and wonder if it would be better to take it first thing in the morning.

I was prescribed Detrol LA one year ago due to frequent urination, especially at night.  The medicine worked for the first three months, then not at all.  I am VERY disappointed!

Frequent Urination	Wwlsbrad, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	11/8/2009 4:12:09 PM	I just started so I'm still withholding judgement, but had to comment.  This drug DOES have a generic, and can be bought at Walmart for $6 for 3 months! I think unless you have really bad side effect it take at least 3 months to see if something is going to work.  But $6 for 3 months WOW!!!

Overactive Bladder	tootsjojo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	8/3/2009 6:53:02 PM	When I first started it, it gave me Vertigo, but controlled the urination.  Now, the Vertigo has stopped, and the affect of the Detrol has stopped the OAB is the same, if not worse than it was.
Frequent Urination	maria, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/15/2009 4:22:07 PM	Is expensive but it work for me after the first 3 weeks, I used to get up about 10 times at night and used to go every 30 minutes during the day. Now I can hold longer and finally have a full night of sleep. No side effects for me so far.

Overactive Bladder	MyShadow, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/5/2008 4:41:49 PM	Without Detrol, I wake up at least 6-7 times during the night. With Detrol, I may get up twice. The only drawback is that there is no generic and insurance either does not pay for it or the co-pay is high.
