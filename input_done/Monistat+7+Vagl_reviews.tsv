Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	13-18	9/21/2012 2:44:22 AM	I have never experienced anything worse than using this &quot;medicine&quot;. I have chronic yeast infections, and I have tried ALL of the monistat products...with 2 trips to the ER and numerous home removals, this is just not worth it. It should be banned! The burning and itching goes from annoying to UNBEARABLE! I have cried my eyes out from the pain! All in all...monistat is a menace to the name of cure.

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	10/25/2011 3:36:48 AM	This does kill the infection. I'm glad I started off with the 7 day Monistat. I was researching the 1 day and 3 day that is more concentrated and I heard that the burning is worse. Upon application there is an instant burning on the inside. If I move around it's a little worse. It is very uncomfortable. I might switch back to clotrimazole, it didn't burn for me. Why would they make a product that burns so much?

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	65-74	5/5/2011 5:28:02 PM	One minute after the first application, I experienced a severe burning sensation of my vagina and vulva.  I thought it was because I was sore already because of the infection.  The second application had the same result severe enough to bring tears to my eyes.  I couldn't get to sleep until 2:00 in the morning because of the discomfort and awoke at 6:00 a.m. to its presence.  I, also, had to wash off the exterior area to help stop the burning.

Only negative is how messy it gets when it comes out during the day because your standing.

Second day had some mild burning after application. By third day no burning and yeast infection symptoms all cleared up. Not sure if the inital burning could be from killing the infection..........
