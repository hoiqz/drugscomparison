Felt like I needed a neck brace to hold my head up. I had a very stiff neck prior to the inj, the inj loosened the cervical joints up.Very pleased with the reduction in migraines. I have gone from 4/wk down 1/wk in 1 mointh.
Migraine Prevention	Luv, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	4/16/2012 6:50:13 AM	I have suffered with migraines/headaches for years.  Now that I'm in menopause they've hit with a vengeance.  After numerous medications I elected to try the botox.  I was never informed that I'd be getting 20-25 shots.  The injections started right below my hairline, circled both ears, followed my hairline in the back and then 3 shots down each of my neck muscles.  The pain was minimal when you consider the migraine pain.  It has been approx 4 weeks and I am now going to new doctors because they think I have infectious or bacterial arthritis.  I never had an issue with joint pain in the past.  The pain came on 2 wks post injections and along with the severe left hip pain I've got pain in both jaw joints, my rgt shoulder, a low grade temp, nausea and severe fatigue.  Of couse this could be a coincidence but I don't think so.  Think twice before getting sooo much botox injected and read as many reviews as possible.  Nothing I had read had prepared me for what I am now going through.

Now my head feels very heavy due to paralysing of neck muscles which are in constant spasm.Have to rest my head ofton.  Had to get Lidocaine patches.  Also drooping eyelds, sinus infection, throat ulissues.  Agreed to injections but elimination neck and shoulders injections. Still have HA some even more violent.  I would rather have migraines than the constant spasms in the neck and shoulders.  I had to deal with both (HA and spasm). The effect wore off after about 6 weeks.  Due for next in a month.
Migraine Prevention	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/27/2011 4:11:29 PM	I had tried many medications for migraines with no relief.  Over the years I had gone from a couple migraines a month to one migraine every day.  Botox injections were painful (after 20+ injections).  There was numbness and soreness at the sites.  Was told that this may or may not work.  It is like any other thing out there...I feel like a guinea pig.  I just really hope that someday I can get back to my migraines only being a couple times a month!
Twisting Neck Spasms	Kathryn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	55-64	6/20/2011 7:00:56 AM	Began injections in 1998 for CD every 3 - 4 months. Side effects: flu-like symptoms which last for two weeks or more. Botox begins to wear off when pain and tremors return, then I eagerly look forward to my next scheduled injection. I use &quot;tricks&quot; to read, drive, and shop, but I often stay home in the few weeks that the drug has worn off. Effectiveness: Everyday activities can be performed with less anxiety due to the injections relieving pain and spams. Will continue to receive this drug that my body has happily accepted.  
Other	Kathy2, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	45-54	5/2/2011 3:12:18 AM	I have migraines and a constant facial pain from a trigeminal neuropathy. My doctor did the full treatment hoping to alleviate both the migraines and the facial pain. It's been a miserable experience. The Botox caused so much additional pain that I've TRIPLED the use of pain killers. The doctor has also added a long-acting pain killer patch medicine to the regular pain killers. I will say that I didn't have any migraines for almost 2 mos after the treatment. But it's been 4 mos since the initial treatment and I'm still popping pain killers right and left. I realize that we all react differently to medications, but I can't in good conscience recommend this therapy.

The only issues I have is that it takes up to 10 days to begin to work, relief is for 3-4 weeks vs 3-4 months, drooping eyelids, loss of neck muscle / upper shoulder strength.Those who suffer from frequent migraines will find 3-4 weeks of relief a great break! I still need to take Topamax and slowly reduce my dosage during the Botox relief to give my system a break but then I find that I need to increase as the migraines increase.  Wish I could find something that would work more effectively.  If your insurance covers this you should try it, it's worth feeling like you have bee stings in the head just to get the few weeks of relief!
Migraine Prevention	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/17/2011 12:54:40 AM	Instead of preventing migraines, this treatment actually caused one within 2 days of the injection and caused my eye to droop (which lasted for 2 months). I will never try this again.
