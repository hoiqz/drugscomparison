I also suffer from dysthymia and Major Depressive Disorder.  I was also taking Bupropion at the time.  I didn't notice any effect at all from the Adderall except towards the end I developed a compulsion to lick my lips and push my tongue against my teeth so much that it became a problem.  I also was hit with a wave of exhaustion every afternoon while taking it

There is almost none of the crankiness and anger experienced with methylphenidate when the effects have worn off in the evening, and the psychological effects of this med. are much gentler than those generated by Ritalin and its variants, which often make people like use feel straitjacketed and limited in thinking ability.   Most of us have comorbidities, especially those of us who were already adults when diagnosed. Adderall/Mixed Amphetamine Salts does its job and leaves the psyche alone. If Ritalin or Cymbalta or other methylphenidates work for you but you still get the evening grumps and hostility, switch to this drug.

It's been over a year now on the C-Pap and there has been no improvement in my RSE. I'm glad I have the prescription as it chases my RSE away. ASCO has improved my life with no side effects.

I used to fight off sleep at work (sleeping is a firing offense)... fortunately my desk is away from others and I never got caught nodding off.  I used to fall asleep at home after work and I missed quality time with my wife. On the weekends I would get up feeling refreshed but within an hour I would be sleeping in the livingroom chair and end up sleeping all afternoon.  This medication is truly helping me.

Had some joint pain before with name brand xr but nothing compared to this.  I felt as if i could not go out, hated being out in public &amp; arnd ppl. Horrible insomnia, dry mouth, stomach upset ( felt like I was on a laxative). Depressed out of no where.&#160; It does not feel like the same pill at all, I was told that I would not notice a difference from the adderal xr to the generic adderal. Not ture, it does nothing for my symptoms. If anything makes them worse, more forgetful, tired, I have not been able to get anything done on this med. Not hungry at all, its so hard to try to eat on this version. Confusion and lack of motivation, I also feel really hot on this like sweating. None of this i felt on the name brand xr (other than what I stated; mild joint pain, also head ache). Does keep me calm but not like before, makes me irrtable and lash out, I never experinced that on the xr name brand. Discontinued use after two weeks couldnt deal with how horrible it made me feel.* Took name brand xr 20 mg twice daily for almost two yrs and it worked wonders, but since I can not afford that anymore I had my dr. Switch me to this thinking it Iwould be about the same. I was wrong. Going back on my adderal xr name brand Asap, it may be super expensive but its worth it.

It has been well over a year that I am on this med., and I still find that I leave burning pots of water on the stove, get distracted so easily, chronically late and extremely annoyed by it all. I do know that I have to make a real concentrated effort on my part alone to keep my focus where it should be..Like I am suppose to be gardening instead of in this computer=addiction). OH, up side=I have lost weight without really trying=that's a god-send! I now only eat 2 meals a day and I feel fine.  HAIR FALLNG OUT: Stress makes hair fall out. I checked with my hairdresser and she said I am losing a normal amount of hair(we shed too). I have no problem sleeping at all, I do have to watch my sugar in-take. It is the sugar that is an upper for me and it takes FOREVER FOR ME TO GET TO BED, once in bed I fall asleep immediately and I sleep great....it is just the getting to bed!  No sweets starting early evening works for me!

Other	business nunya, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	35-44	4/5/2012 12:36:38 AM	Works great, my only issues with it are:1. Timing of my PM dosage is tricky, I try to take it no later than 3:00 but some days it wears off earlier than I'd like yet others I stay up pretty late.2. For me, headaches (from severe drops in barometric pressure) completely mask any benefit from it and a few times, after my headache will finally pass, THEN it kicks in, usually entirely too late and I stay up late, etc. 3.  I HATE the inconvenience of getting it.  The Rx has to be physically picked up every month and an ID has to be handed over for filling and now even picking up the meds.  There's also only a 3 day window every month between picking up the Rx, filling it and running out that always has to be considered, which is only complicated with weekends and/or holidays.  And forget having it filled across state lines if your pharmacy runs out and you have to travel, because state laws all require something other than what your going to have from your Dr.  I know it needs to be controlled, but it's really quite unnecessarily burdensome for legitimate users.

I resisted this diagnosis at first, but overtime realized how my previously undiagnosed illness had played a significant role on almost all aspects of my life up until that point.I am a naturally distractable person, often overstimulated by new (and familiar) environments.  This can interfere with my interactions with others in a conversation because I find myself jumping around from visual distraction to visual distraction (and voicing those distractions).  This is a less concerning symptom of my ADD though.  I see this more as an excitability that eventually fades the longer I am in a new environment.The most problematic symptom of my ADD though is my inability to start projects/tasks/assignments.  And because I am in graduate school, this is a symptom that I really need to stay on top of.  Deadlines are of utmost important, and have almost always been problematic for me to follow throughout all of my educational years.At the start of my medication regimen, I was prescribed Concerta ER, but found little benefit.  My doctor then switched me to Amphetamine Salts (little blue tablets) - dose 10mg, twice a day.  I have not used the med consistently, because there have been times when deadlines havent been issued.When I have used it, however, and in noticing more recently, I am feeling like the cons are outweighing the pros.  Yes, I am able to somewhat focus, but that doesn't mean I am focusing on needed deadline responsibilities.  I am also noticing increased irritation, especially caused by increased distractability.  Neck and back pain almost always ensue, as well.At this point, some drug change is needed.  Perhaps back to an ER-Tab, or (as recommended by my therapist), maybe Wellburtin.If anyone's experience has been similar to mine and you've found better medication treatment, could you please email your experience and new medication?

I have been taking this on and off for 3 months...I started with the XR capsules, but they were making me sick. Now I'm on 60 mg (6 blues) a day. They do help me focus and I have more energy, but by the time I take my last my last does or if I have to go alittle or my dose that day, I feel like my heart rate is high, I'm shaky, my vision is blurry, the sweats are really bad, and I feel withdrawl symptoms within a couple hours. I keep asking myself if this is worth it...but even if it's not...i know I can't stop taking it because it's gotten me off the couch and gave me my life back...my question is...is anyone else feeling this way? I've even had left body chest pains...scary!!

It made me downright irritated all the time for no reason and if I forgot to take it I had the worst withdrawl symptoms. When I got off the XR, I gained a ton of weight. I'm now on the 20mg Amphetamine Salts and I take it around 4pm and it's out of my system by the time I want to sleep (although sometimes it makes it difficult to sleep depending on how late I took it). It gives me enough focus to do my homework, without the unwanted side effects of the XR. The only issue I have with it is my heart races when I'm on it still. But as far as keeping me focused, which is its purpose, it works. Just watch out for those side-effects and DO NOT take XR unless completely necessary.

Then, get this; % 10 mg adderall XR as needed during the day leding to a form of narcolepsy. Dr states 'THEY' don't want him perscribing D-amph/Adderall as the reason for the XR.

When I started with it was 1 10mg a day of CMB Salt and the first 4 days were awesome, I flipped everything around and my family/friends really noticed how different in a good way I had become! I could concentrait, remember what others told me, I remembered things from my childhood, I was writting great about what I teach, helped my teaching/understanding, I could not find enough to do, I was talking 90miles and hour and I think I called everyone I knew with urgency to say sorry or thanks, when I got that moment or urge etc.. Everything was important! Now, we have been adjusting amounts and times because, I don't have any of the first weeks affects or minor if I do at best. Currently I am trying 20mg again from 40mg and 30mg, I take 7 pills a day 4 pills @ 8AM, 3 pills @ 2pm thats, 140mg a day. My affects during the 1st week are now, I studder for words, I loose focus, stay up sometimes 2 days, eyes get fuzzy sometimes, sinus headaches, I can't keep my eyes open for about 20min late in the day &quot;crashing&quot;, I guess and everyonce in awhile I feel like I am going to pass out when I take my last in the 4-3 dose. As of late I have been trying them in a 2-2-2 dose 8am - 12pm - 2pm... Seems to show something. My doc said you have to play around with the dosage to get it right and then it will be more like the first week I was on the drug. Im not sure? I think I drink to many cokes, dip snuff and might drink 1 bottle of water every 2 months. Anyone else in or had been in my stage? I have been taking the drug since August 2010.. I just want to find how I was in the 1st week I started or find out it's not for me and move on... Thanks :-)

I struggled throughout my life with focusing on the simpliest tasks.  My mind would race and I didn't know if I was coming or going at times. Before taking the medication I researched it by reading articles and even these user review comments.  Overall the medication has changed my life but there were times at the beginning that I almost stopped taking it due to its side effects. For the first month I was very moody and had what my son called a &quot;short fuse.&quot;  I stuck it out and this side effect went away.  Everything is fine now with no side effects other than I am never hungry.  I eat b/c I know my body needs the nutrition and enjoy the process of eating but I have no desire to run to the kitchen looking for something to eat.  I have lost around 30lb in a year which I needed anyway. Once my body was use to the drug and diet, it now maintain and I am at a healthy weight.  I do worry about any long term side effects and can not find any information on this subject.  Not sure if it was Nightline or 20/20 but they did a story on Adderal and the doctors interviewed did not know of any long term side effect. I believe you can find this on Youtube.

Then I got smart and started reading into how and why it works. After thinking long and hard and a 1000 questions later. I gave in. His performance at school has increased and now is an A B student. He is able to concentrate on things he could never do such as making model cars and ships. I do however worry. Is this a life long event for him ? Will he always have to take this drug ? I have seen what happens first hand from the neighbors child when he stopped taking adderall behind his parents back and had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance.  I don't want this for my child yet I want him to be happy with himself as he is now.

Sleep apnea, ADHD and others I realize that there are many out there who due to insurance reasons ETC can not get properly evaluated. I have worked every day of my life since the first day I joined the Corps. to my present day job. This drug has allowed me to put in a full 9 to 10 hours of work a day,  And above all be proud that in this day and age I can take care of my family of 5. Before starting this medication I was very close to being fired for lack of attentiveness. The only hard part was accepting the fact that I needed help for ADHD Sleep Apneia

Other	luvmycats, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	1/14/2011 9:38:18 AM	I have been on this med for about 4 months now.  My Doc gave me this med to help my Cymbalta.  I was feeling suicidal, very depressed and crying.  Since starting this drug, the suicial thoughts are gone and the crying spells.  The depression is better than before too.  I was hoping it would help with my tiredness, but it hasn't.  I haven't lost any weight either, which I was hoping it would.  I have noticed stomach pains and some days have nausea.  After reading some of the posts here, I guess it could be related to this Drug?  How do you really know?  It's kind of a hit or miss.  I've never taken the real Adderall because the Insurance says I have to take the Generic, so I can't say how Adderall works compared to this.  I do have anxiety attacks, but I had those before taking this Drug.  For me, it's very hard to tell if one drug or the other might be causing a side effect.  I see my Doctor every 2-3 months and just let him know how I'm feeling.  He listens to me and trys to help me the best he can.  I also noticed on this Drug that swallowing it is harder than other pills, it does seems to stick in the back of your throat, so have plenty of liquid ready.  It also has a funny taste going down, not an awful taste, just salty or something.

Vyvanse made me aggressive and unpredictable where as with the salts I am fine. I do find I get cramps in my feet regualarly now. I haven't read of anyone else with muscle cramps in the legs or feet though so it may be unrelated.

This works best for me personally; doctor said that if I notice significant interference with hunger and/or ability to fall asleep, then that means to back it down a notch. It's like hitting a sweet spot - too high of a dosage will exacerbate ADD like symptoms, and vice versa. Also taking Wellbutrin and about to complete a year long dose reduction schedule that will end its use pretty soon. Started Wellbutrin to quit smoking and treat mild depression (SADS); I didn't notice any urge to quit smoking actually until I started Addersall treatment - and now I'm a happy non-smoker after 15 years (cold turkey, no problem), which was an unexpected but pleasant side effect of the Adderall. By the way, Adderall XR had very little effect - not sure why but could be the timed release mechanism.

I make very few mistakes now while typing or counting prescriptions. I feel much happier and I don't have that 'want to go to sleep' feeling daily after lunch around 3pm. I also can complete task at home after work. Before I wouldn't want to do anything, and if I did, I would never finish my task. I also noticed my attention isn't on the conversations at work, it stays on the task at hand. Im 32years old, and I've been a pharmacy technician since 1999. My work has improved tremendously, also my accuracy, since I've started this medication.

Has really helped a lot. Had a severe head injury after accident, developed ADD and doc gave me this. I can concentrate and focus much better (have some memory problems still). I've lost weight since taking it, but that's ok with me! Only bad thing is I had to cut down on my daily coffee and/or caffeine drinks. If you take both, you can really feel weird, get shakes, etc. But I will stay on it, benefits outweigh the risks so far!

I tried other similar drugs like plain Dextroamphetamine and self-medicating with Caffeine, but went back to the Amphetamine Salts (little bright blue oval pills that taste sweet) because I liked the energy they gave me.  But NO MORE because I got ANOTHER RAGING YEAST INFECTION!!  How Maddening!  Here's my story, hope it helps: I took this drug off and on for about a year and a half.  I tried taking &quot;drug holidays&quot; on weekends, but that messed up my sleep patterns.  My husband says I'm aggressive on it, but I didn't see it until I got off.  I could get to sleep at night most of the time on 5 mg very early in the am, and another 5 mg no later than 1 pm, but when I jumped up to 10 mg 2 X a day I had trouble sleeping at night.  My mind would race and I'd feel uncontrolably wiggly. I tried the generic brand of Adderall XR (tan and white extended release capsules)- 10 mg early in the am.  I thought it was working fine, my husband (who's against my using drugs in general)didn't.  He thought my sleeplessness was worse on the XR capsules.  I lost some weight (from 150 lbs to about 138 at my lowest, I'm 5' 3&quot;) on the salts and XR which was nice.   I'm taking 5 mg Dextroamphetamine twice a day and it's working ok. I notice a big difference in my ability to concentrate and finish one thing before I start another.  It gives me the shakes sometimes, like the salts did at first, and similar appetite loss as the Salts did, but doesn't seem to give me those dreaded yeast infections.

For example, before I started taking adderall I couldn't even read the cover of a book now that i'm on it I am making straight A's in college and could read the same book twice in one night.  I think that it is a great medication.  I take the 30mg tabs twice a day.  Thanks!

I have not had to increase the dose in all of these years. I take it in the morning and at 1pm.  I have no sleep issues that way.  It causes sleep issues only if I take it after 3pm.

It does suppress the appetite early in the morning, but to go extended hours without food intake is hard on your body, as you are basically turning up the revs with blood pressure, and glucose consumption, while leaving the tank empty.  Be careful.
Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	2/9/2010 9:01:10 PM	I have had extreme fatigue for years now and nothing seems to help... After years of testing and misdiagnosed the only diagnosis left is chronic fatigue.. I never believed this disease before but after ruling evrything else out and being unable to function because of fatigue and aches for 7 years now I feel that this is the only option...I had gastric bypass thinking that maybe I would get more energy after losing 120lbs but no I was still not functioning and unable to work... I tried provigil but it didn't make a difference.. I would take one and fall asleep.. We decided to try Adderall and it has made a differnece.There are still some days that I take the medication and fall asleep. I still don't get enough done but it is a noticable improvement.. I will probably never be close to 100% but looking back on this past year I can see an improvemnt with getting things done and just being awake... my daughter had even missed school last year because i could not get up to take her... I had episodes to sleep paralysis on waking up...Now I take my meds before I even get out of bed.... I wish that someday I will have energy without the help of drugs ...

My studay habits have never been this intense since elementary school, my attentiveness has never been this good, well ever, and mt alertness has sky rocketed as well. My girlfriend can tell when I have taken my medicine or not simply due to my increased patience with her on the pill. I have had a couple problems with stomach aches, dizziness, and every day, a super dry mouth, but besides those things, this drug is truely remarkable. I only wish I would have believed my phichiatrist earlier that i had ADHD and taken this medicine when I started college.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	sweetpea, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	35-44	1/23/2010 8:44:06 AM	I have been on this drug for about 3 weeks and it's pretty good.I take 20mg a day and when I take it early in the morning I have no need to eat until late in the day when it wears off. I have lost about 6lbs, but I think I need the er kind.I noticed that I smoke alot more, has anyone been doing that too? I just don't want to get addicted to it. I have also noticed that I can get really upset somtimes at the smallest things, then I'm just in a bad mood the rest of the day, but it's a lot less now than before. But most of all I find myself happier and smiling alot which I never did before, so I guess I have to let it work longer in my system to see the benefits. Hope this helped someone out there.

I went from 30mg XR once a day to 30mg salts twice a day!! First of all this cannot be healthy to consume unnecessary amounts of a somewhat dangerous chemical.. i've noticed increased hairloss, increased shrinkage of the penis and testicles that is common with amphetamines but the effect with the salts is far worse.. i feel sick to my stomach and have vomited at least once from the Amph. salts and no i do not take more than the prescribed dose.. Headaches have come out of nowhere and havn't gone away since i've started taking the Salts.. The pills are hard to swallow and sometimes stick to the throat or mouth causing a gag reflex.. i've actually GAINED weight on this med because in the afternoon/evening(rarely) when the medication wears off you become unbelievably hungry no matter how much you've eaten during the day.. The basis for the FDA's approval of this medication is based upon the fact that the same amount of the drug enters the bloodstream as the original.. well injecting drugs gets the same amount into the bloodsteam but is the effect the same, anyone who's had a shot for pain knows that the action and the effect of pain pills is completely different than shots.. so what if your insurance company told you that you were no longer covered for pain shots in the ER because pain pills do the same thing.. well thats what they're doing here.. telling patients the generics are the same, B.S.

Even my motor skills are better when I'm on my welding job. I feel energized, efficient, motivated and sharp. I don't have any serious side effects that the other reviewers have mentioned. I must say though, I am a little worried about it being addictive...

It helps to sit still longer but I still have a Little trouble in the concentration area. I do not know if I need a strong dose or if it is just wrong for me. The only con that I have about this med is that it makes me feel weird in the morning, after I take my first dose of the day other than that It is okay.

It is just enough energy for me to get started on my daily tasks and actually complete some!  As a result I am less overwhelmed (and paralyzed!) and feel much more competent and confident as a result.  Because I take it first thing in the morning and have had a successful day, I sleep great at night.  I still wish I didn't need it but after 40 years of trying, unsuccessfully, to function well - I am now trying to be grateful for this diagnosis and treatment.  Good luck to all who read this - you're not alone; hang in there!

Adderall is just speed in pharmaceutical form. I learned this the hard way. If you have any question as towards your ability to stick to your prescribers directions DO NOT START taking it. I started taking it in High school and after about 1 yr i began heavily abusing it. This led to a serious addiction, including rehab. so be warned. watch teens especially for signs of sleeplessness and physical signs such as consistently huge pupils, and erratic behavior, basically any suspicious overactive or senselessly repetitive behavior. I would even go so far as to monitor teens with addictive personalities by potentially dispensing their meds for them daily. This is a GREAT med for some people, but just be careful to discuss all the angles with your doc before taking this medication. I am currently clean from adderall, and am working to handle my ADD differently - which is able to be done- I'm currently working on becoming a psychiatrist.. so my goal here is to give you all a fair warning from someone whose been there. PS. concerta is a much better add med and MUCH less addictive.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Caring Mom, 7-12 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	7-12	9/10/2009 8:30:18 AM	My son was giving this because he has ADHD. This med made my son so depressed all he did was cry and just upset all the time and he wasn't doing good in school he failed every test he got when he was taken this med. I called the doctor and she said that some people can get really depressed and he wasn't eatting at all so she stop it that day and it has only been a few days but I can see he is feeling better. I know something was wrong when he cried a lot because he doesn't cry about anything and he is already under weight but he wouldn't eat anything.  Please watch your kids if they have this because they can get depressed fast.

This drug needs taken off the market. I have been taking it for a little of a year and it worked at first but now all it does is make me overingrossed in whatever I'm doing too excess! And ANYTHING at all makes me go off on everyone; I yell, gripe, complain about everything and anything ALL the time now. If I hear any noise at all it just gets me so irate it's unreal. It's like a bell going off sending a signal to my brain that's suppose to make me go nuts. Not only all that, it's made me depressed, go into serious highs, then lows. I don't know who wrote about kids abusing the drug, but yes, a lot of kids are now a days, but that isn't always going to be the case if their having suicidal thought while taking this drug. The drug itself does it on it's own. I would advice anyone not to take it. I'm going to try the brand name since I've heard a lot better things about it.

I definitely felt that the Adderall was better and did not make me so irritable but the cost was prohibitive. The up side is that I am more focused and can work a project through very well to completion.  The bad is that sometimes I am so engrossed in what I am doing that I may miss something else that I was supposed to do.  I also find that it makes me shorter tempered and any noise, whistling or even singing by someone can go right up my spine.  I had also had a few high blood pressure readings but after getting back to my regular aerobic workouts my blood pressure is back to normal.  I did lose the last 8 lbs needed after having my child so that was definitely a plus.  It does boost your confidence and you are much more articulate.  However in speaking so well you may also experience some dry mouth!

No side effects. No problem with on schedule dose, when oversleep from sinus infection, or permanent damage from near fatal concussion when eighteen years old. At age 55 it is encouraging to stay awake longer than six to ten hours each twenty four. Currently following Doctors instructions to take four daily. My heart rate does not increase. I get more effect from black coffee, than a dose of one tablet. I have reduced coffee intake by ten to fifteen cups daily to attempt to stay awake.Due to our Doctor having a death in his family, my appointment was rescheduled for nineteen days after last dose taken! I ran out of meds on Sunday 10th May. Noticed slight loss of focus Monday, increased coffee to try to compensate, not much help.By Thursday 14th I was fighting overwhelming sleepiness without success.Got new appointment and Doctor worked me in later Thursday 14th. Slept in waiting room. Taxi to my home for energy meal and nap. Then to Pharmacy nodding out on bench waiting for Rx. Home resumed meds, slept two hours after first dose.

I say this from experience, at one time I abused the controlled release form of Ritalin, Concerta, by crushing it up and taking large doses at once.  I was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts, but was also have mild hallucinations and nervous tics.  For whatever its worth, if your child is experiencing something similar perhaps they are doing the same thing, perhaps not, but I felt compared to share my experience when reading the reviews.

I don't focus on the clock all day craving to be in bed. I can read a whole article without fighting to keep my eyes open. I can drive again for a long period of time,without pulling over after 20 minutes I can go on and on. Life is so clear now to me. My only regret is I didn't find out sooner how great this medication works.

I was prescribed 10mg twice a day. About six weeks after the first visit I went into my doctor and told him i wanted to go up a dose because I had tried taking a total of 30mg instead of the 20mg a day and that I felt it made a big difference( I did that only three times on my own). I was surprised when he treated me like a drug addict that was either selling it or abusing the medication.I'm a 39 yr old college educated, well dressed, professional woman who's only crime is having ADD. He informed that I would have to periodically take drug tests to make sure that the drug was in my system ( otherwise they think you are selling the drug to someone) and that I was not taking any other drugs if I wanted to continue the medication. I went ahead and took the drug test and they gave me the prescription for the second month. My question is ...is this worth the humiliation of being treated as if I have done something wrong because I want to think more clearly and be more organized and have some control over my life?

I tried to get the pharmacy to switch it out for something orange. However, I strongly encourage those with adderall prescriptions to give this new drug a chance. It has been outstanding for my confidence and ability to interact positively with others. My focus during reading is diminished a little, but hardly a noticeable amount. My focus when listening has increased dramatically. This pink version (30mg) of adderall has also been much more effective for treating my depression/anxiety. Not only do I find it more effective for me, but it is cheaper as well. I found this version of adderall to be a win-win situation.

They do not interfere with my sleep at night.  During the day, I am focusing better at meetings, but every task takes much longer,  I don't have the high energy, but more of a sleepy feeling after taking them.  Also, I keep forgetting to take my afternoon dosage, so I am not sure that affects the effectiveness of ADD.

He has been able to controle himself much better and understand what is going on around him. Me and his doctor have slowly reduced his amount to help him start to do it on his own he still needs to take the meds but not as much as. Did find out after time he needs to take it at in the early morning as it takes a good hour to take full affect and it only last about half or three quaters of the day. There is a time released one you may want to consider also.

I have had symptoms of ADD and recurrent sleep episodes throughout the day. Reading was difficult due to my mind wandering by the time I got to the end of the line, causing me to have to reread everything. Fortunately with a genius iq I was able to cram and get through everything. I was in my 60's before I started Adderall XR, and my only regret is I didn't do this years before. The amount of time and energy I wasted before that, not to mention driving everyone crazy around me by not finishing things or being able to stay on task was a side effect of the ADD. I developed very creative ways of doing things, and my wife says I always had to complicate things. I didn't like complicating things, it was the only way my mind worked. I function best with simplicity. I just didn't know how to do it simply. Anyway, Adderall XR has helped me get my life back. I am easier to be around as well. Or so I am told. One problem is getting the medication. Most insurance plans for Medicare drug coverage do not want to pay for it. Getting it at a pharmacy can be like ordering heroin, it is treated like a dangerous drug, which, in my opinion, it is not. It keeps me awake while driving, and that in itself is a blessing for everyone.

My day to day routines prior to the medication was a mess. I had a hard time being organized and seemed to never be able to follow thur or finish anything i started until my diagnosis. Within a day of my regiment my outlook became clearer, and my focus was unlike it had ever been. It seemed as though my I.Q. had even increased along with my memory. To top it all, it became very easy to talk to others and interact in society without any effort. On the downside my sleeping habits were affected and my appetite seemed to be rather non existent for the first couple of days, to the point i had to force my food down. But after 3-4 days it seem to balance out and my appetite returned, but i began eating less. Though i was extremely more active than prior. Since i have been able to really maintain an ideal weight and boost my physique. Overall i must say this is a very helpful and useful medication.

It was great at first. But when that dosage became ineffective he increased it to 20mg once per day. That dose worked perfect. It did cause me to lose weight and become short tempered. When I went in for an employment physical and mentioned that I was on this medication, they told me in order to pass my physical and be certified safe at work, I had to be evaluated by a psychiatrist. He refused to continue this medication and started me on Strattera. Strattera is ineffective with the maximum dose of 100mg per day. So I am going to find a psychaitrist that will prescribe me Amphetamine salt combo so I can get back to performing to my best ability.

I founded a new talent, art, which I went to college for one year.  I never was interested in art before.  It made me very impulsive, and obsessive.  I would find myself picking at my skin for almost the whole day.  Also, it made me late to work in the later years because I took too long doing make up, and kept thinking of things I wanted to bring with me on the way, keep changing my outfits till I found the perfect one, and losing complete track of time.  It has actually made me lose friends, and become very irritable in the mornings when I wake up.  It made my whole body unhealthy from having no appetite, and I was in a different world constantly.  I ended up not wanting to engage in social activities because I just wanted to be alone and do my own obsessive things.  I wish I never was prescribed this drug, because I can't afford the brand adderall (with less side effects) and I am stuck with the affordable generic, which is the crappiest thing I have ever put in my body.  It is currently ruining my life and relationshihp with my fiance.  He is also prescribed to the medication, but he doesn't get it anymore because he is lazy.  He just has half of mine when I get it, so it leaves me in serious withdraw every month for half the month!  It's a terrible situation, and even if He got his own script again ,I dont think I could live a productive life on it every day of the month!  I just look like I am on drugs and I get easily confused.  It is embarassing to be around people you know because they wonder what is wrong with you!  Plus since I took adderall and was out of it once, i tried coccaine .. because they said it was just like adderall.. and all i wanted was that feeling of being on adderall.  now coke is a problem in my life as well, not because I use it 2 times a month, but because I use it AT ALL!

It has really been a life saver.  It has increased my productivity at my office, helped me with my relationships in my personal life, increased libido, and made me a much better person overall.  What a great invention.  I have not be inconvienienced by any side affects from this mdicine either.  I was 100% healthy before starting the medication, so that may have staved off most of the reported side effects.  I have had no adverse health problems caused by this medication, nad I get afull physical every 6 months, plus a follow up visit every three months because of the medication.  It is true that you can lose weight on this drug because it does make you lose your appetite somewhat.  I have resolved that problem by only taking it after meals.  Other than that, it is the perfect resolution to my ADHD.  Home run.
Other	understood, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	3/4/2008 8:10:51 PM	I have been taking Amphetamine salts for around two months now and have been slowly increasing the dosage, (with my doctors consent) starting @ 5mg 2 times a day. Now I am up to 35mg 2 times a day. I will give this dosage a couple of weeks but I believe that 20 or 25mg gave me the same effect. I have lost 10 lbs because I don't sit on the couch all evening trying to figure out what I should do first (which ends up being nothing). I have finished most all of the projects that I started last year and did not complete due to numerous B.S. excuses/reasons. I am no longer depressed all the time. My blood pressure is down to a normal level for the first time in my life (I believe due to the absence of self inflicted stress). I (so far) don't procrastinate about talking through issues I have with others .For 40 years I have wondered &quot;why is everything so hard for me?&quot; Now I know. This medication has helped to show me why everyone else's lives seem much easier. It's because their lives are easier. Finding out that I have ADD and treating it has been a wonderful experience.

I'm currently taking 20mg twice daily. I'm able to focus on tasks at work - and I actually WANT to get things done. I no longer procrastinate or lose attention when completing tasks. When I first started taking this medication, I did have a few side effects - mainly not being able to fall asleep at night and loss of appetite. Over time, I overcame those - and the benefits of this medication definitely outweigh the side effects for me.

I'm taking 20mg twice daily. Taking the second dose early in the day (before noon) makes it easier to fall asleep at night. Only take after meals or while you're eating and it won't effect your weight as much.

Before I begin taking the amphetamine salt combo oral it would take me hours upon hours to complete an assignment do to lack of focus. Now I am able to finish my assignment in a timely fashion and I actually feel good about doing it, because I can direct more focus to my given task thus being able to get the maximum educational experience due to total focus and concentration.

This medication has been excellent for him. He's much more focused, and his mood is much more stabilized than it used to be.

It has really made college and work easier. I stay focused and on task. It took me almost a month to get over the jitters and jolts of energy, but I am very glad that I waited it out. I only take it through the week at school and work and occasionally on the weekends, normally during finals. I have not had any troubles falling asleep, but that could be because I also take 5 MG of Diazepam (Valium) 4x daily.

I do have some problems remimbering to take it in the morning though. But over all iam satisfied with the over all effectiveness.

In the middle of day, every now and then my heart feel like its slowing down, well it is slowing down cause it's noticable and i have a hard time falling asleep because the medicine keeps me up. so i dont know whats up with this medicine they need to suspend it from the U.s to because i need tips on how to get my blood pressure back down to normal because i believe its suppose to be at least 117 for my age and i am up to 146. please do something about it.
