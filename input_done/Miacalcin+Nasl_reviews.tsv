Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	65-74 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	65-74	3/2/2010 8:18:45 AM	Have been using only the spray for 4 years due to osteoperosis.  Bone mass has increased, but only slightly in spine and a little more in hip. During last year of use,  experienced runny nose very often and finally, a red circle formed on the top of nose (size of a quarter)and was very red.  Runny nose and redness has decreased since discontinuing the spray six weeks ago, but not completely.

This way I know to insert it in the other passage the next day. My only concern is I have noticed some hair loss and don't know if its related to this med?

Other	OneDaughter, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/9/2009 4:52:27 PM	My Mother had abdomanal radiation which caused her pelvis to have multiple fractures which caused excurtiating pain.  The orthopedic Doctor put her on this for bone pain and within two days the bone pain was gone.  He said he did not know why Miacalcin worked for the pain but it had worked for other patients and it worked for my Mom.  It increased her a quality of life which was such a great blessing!  I'm trying to tell everyone I know since it doesn't seem to be a very well known use for the drug.

Also had unexplained back pain (on one side) which has disappeared since I quite using Miacalcin.  However, my bone density did improve using it with Evista so I'm not happy not being able to use it.  There is also a generic Fortical.

Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	10/26/2007 1:13:08 AM	I have been taking Miacalcin for over two years.  While Miacalcin is very easy to use, it is slow acting.  My bone density test showed that I lost bone mass.  Now, I take it along with Boniva.  Hope the combo helps.
