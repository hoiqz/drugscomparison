Pain	jenylen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/27/2012 3:33:25 AM	I am allergic to codiene, vicodin, motrin so my dr. prescribed Darvocet 500 mg. and it worked for my pain.  I have fibromyalgia and I only used it when I couldn't tolerate my pain any more.  I had no side effects.  If I had known they were going to take this drug off the market I would have asked for a renewal.  I don't believe the reasons or the organization/or drs. that took this drug off the market.  I found it to be a safe drug if you take it accordingly and not abuse it.  One pill worked for me, very seldom did I have to take 2.  I really wish Darvocet would come back to the pharmacies. I don't have pain medication right now since I'm allergic to many pain medica-tions that are out right now.

I have strong meds but their are not for long time use.  I've use this drug for more than 20 years and have not ill effects from it!

The Soma is a muscle relaxer the other of course is for pain relief. I drive about 4000 miles per month for my job and I have no issues with taking this medication I use this combo aprox 5x per day when I can tell I am not going to have relief I do have some 5mg of oxy to call things down again, I find that when my pain gets out of hand it effects my sleep at night when I cant get comfortable enough to sleep. Ask your DR if this combo will work for you I have been thru pain managent and thought I was gonna die they put me on morphine tabs that made me so ill from there we tried the fentyl patch that was another one that I felt as if I was floating out of my body,yikES!!

Muscle spasms and back pain are pretty much constant(car accident in 1976). Hate to take anything stronger than tylenol but gave it a shot this weekend when i almost could not move. Worked like a charm with almost no side effects(just a little sleepy). Would highly recommend

This drug has no side affect and works, but you need to use it every four hours or pain returns and it takes awhile to cut the pain again.

Pain	doug, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	65-74	3/20/2010 3:46:57 PM	I've found Darvocet to have the least negative issues as compared to vicodin or percocet. I'm still able to function (drive a car and even fly an airplane- OK, with a safety pilot) and have never been aware of it making me &quot;goofy&quot;. I only take occasionally, so do not have issues with constipation or headaches as with the more powerful drugs). Back surgery dictated a need for pain relievers,probably forever- so Darvocet (occassionally) has never been an issue. Highly recommend it.  Just remember that it will probably be a step down in power from some of the others.

I recomend it for pain with people that have anxiety issues for pain.

Those of you who have this problem start taking a couple tablespoons of ground Flaxseed, with breakfast and drink a few glasses of water a day! It will help greatly.
Pain	katherine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	35-44	4/11/2009 7:58:14 PM	Switched to Darvocet from Vicodin due to extreme nausea. However, with no prior episodes, almost immediately had serious mental side effects and discontinued use. Returned to half doses of vicodin with acceptable results. Would not recommend use of this drug. FDA recommended pulling this in 01/09.

Pain	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	2/16/2009 3:00:05 AM	With temporary pins in a joint, I've been on this med for over a month now.  It dulls everything, and I sometimes feel high.  I would not even consider driving on this.  I have to drink a lot of water to be able to have a movement once every 3 days or so.  When I do have one, they are the size of dragons.  I no longer sleep well, just mostly drift in and out.  For the last week I've had a nasty ringing in my ears.  It's very annoying.  If I miss a dose, I have a nasty headache.  When this is over, I will request a different med next time.

Pain	nmiller, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	11/16/2008 2:02:52 AM	I have recently been prescribed this medication for pain related to a fractured ankle. This medication does not help relieve any of the pain but instead just makes me feel tired.  The last two times I have taken it I have felt like I am going to have a &quot;panic attack&quot; and it makes me feel like I can't breathe and almost like my heart is beating excessively fast!

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/25/2008 1:02:01 PM	I have migraines and Fibromyalgia. I use to take Vicoden and it was very helpful but I started to get very sick and dizzy before the medicine started to work! So my Dr. switched me to Darvocet and it helps (not as well as the vicoden) but I don't get any nausea or dizziness. The only bad thing I've found is I have terrible constipation after I take it. For days! So I only use them when I absolutly have to, but when I do take it, it works! 
Pain	SookieBaby, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	9/23/2008 1:11:28 AM	this medication you can say make you feel like your drunk. maybe its just me i don't know. after hearing on TV about people getting addicted i was afraid to take this med, but my doctor recommended it due to the fact that i just had a 6lb 4oz little boy and how i don't know he ripped me and i had to get 37 stitches the worst pain. the med. helped alot, but that i was only a half that i took after that never again it makes me feel lost and not aware what i am doing, plus have of the time i fell asleep anyways. plan and simple if you have ever been drunk before like really drunk then this medication is the same stuff!

After recently breaking her hip, she has been given twice the amount she had previously taken.  She is now getting one capsule 6 times per day.  She has just recently begun having panic attacks: feeling trapped, rapid breathing, aggitated, feelings of wanting to die.  These last approx. 45 min. to an hour.

While it certainly let me sleep better at night due to drowsiness, it could have done a little better job of relieving the actual pain, not just masking it with tiredness.
