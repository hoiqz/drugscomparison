High Blood Pressure	Mike, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	1	1	Male	55-64	11/4/2011 6:09:10 PM	Was prescribed this drug in 1984 for high blood pressure and experienced impotence and trouble sleeping after about 2 years. My doctor helped ween me off the Inderal LA. The high blood pressure went away but the impotence remained as did the insomnia. In 2009 I developed Peyronies disease. I noticed that all of these conditions are somewhat rare side effects of Inderal LA.

Essential Tremor	tsalam, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	65-74	4/30/2011 7:50:52 AM	I have been using Inderal tablets for more than 15-years for hand tremor and getting good effective results, best taken before breakfast. Noticed that regular use reduces effectiveness, but  declined increasing the 40mg per day dose.Read on this site that it shoudn't be taken for low blood sugar patients!? which is my case...? medical clarifying feedback appreciated.

Like any medication the dosage goes with your weight, so as you gain or lose weight the medication would need to be adjusted.  I have had no ill side effects. This medication gave me my life back instead of being in bed most of the week.  This medication doesn't work for all types of migraines. My daughter also has migraines. She was diagnosed with basular migraines when she was 10 years old. A migraines specialist in Washington put her on Varapimil (calan). She was the 2nd child that had even been put on the blood pressure medication for migraines. She had to have her meds increased as she gained weight but she hasn't had anymore problems with kidney failure, heart failure or black outs since. These are problems yoou can ahve with her type. These medications have been a god send. I don't understand why doctors don't try these medications before all the anti depressant meds that have such bad side effects. I hope this helps someone.
High Blood Pressure	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	65-74	3/16/2010 10:59:42 AM	I take this first thing in the morning.  I started many years ago when my BP went up and I was getting headaches.  I also had mild angina (or similar).  It has worked for me.  Most of my doctors over the years have tried to get me to take something else but I have no side effects and it works so I am not about to change. Because of change in insurance, I had to go to a generic.  Be careful, they are not all the same.  I believe there are 3 generics for this.  I tried one and it did not work at all.  The druggist said it could be the delivery system.  I now take a yellow pill called propranolol 80mg ERCAP AC.  It is one of the generics for Inderal LA.  I like to take only one pill a day.  I once was on a higher dose for a short time but it caused me problems.  When I lost a lot of weight, I was able to go off of the drug totally, but do it gradually.  The doctor took me off cold and I had bad reactions but they did go away.  In the last 5 years HCTZ 12.5 M has been added and recently that has been removed but I think I may start again since a noticed a small increase in BP.  Hope this helps.

Essential Tremor	wolfhound, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2		55-64	3/6/2010 5:47:59 PM	I was recently given Inderal LA 60 mg to take once a day. It was prescribed by tremors in my hands that my be caused by taking zoloft. I have been taking the meds for about a month now and I still have shaky hands. I am seeing my doctor in a few days to see what is going on. I would say this medication is not working for tremors. Has anyone had a similiar experience using this drug.
Migraine Prevention	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	10/19/2009 2:20:23 PM	I started taking this medication 2 weeks ago for migraine prevention and so far I have had only 1 headache. I takemy 60mg dose at night and it does put me to sleep and around noon I get hit with a wave of sleepiness.  Plus, I have been eating uncontrollably, however I went off of Cymbalta at the same time I started this medicine, so I am hopeful that my appetite will decrease without the need to staple my mouth shut!! Having no headaches is worth most side effects so I will definitely continue to take it.

Started on 80mg, am now at 120mg.  Also found that if I had an alcoholic drink within 8 hours of taking, my blood pressure dropped dramatically.  Would advise no alcohol use with this drug.

It changed my life!  I now have very few headaches, and rarely migraines.  I have no appreciable side effects at all, and am very happy.  Side note, though - they tried my daughter on the same for the same reason, and it didn't work at all for her.

Migraine Prevention	EForestier, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	2/16/2009 12:30:37 PM	I used this medicine years ago as soon as I was old enough to be on prevention medicine.  I was on 60 mg of the generic a day for years.  In 2002, after Hurricane Lili, the generic was unavailable in my area and I went on Inderal.  Not too long after, I began having worse headaches, so they increased to 120 mg a day.  I took myself off after a few weeks of constant headaches with no relief, and my migraines went away for a good while after that.  Now I read they are saying this medicine can help people with post tramatic stress, by helping them &quot;forget&quot;.  I have had memory loss for a while, after always being the one that always remembered everything.  Might be a coincidence, but I don't know...
Migraine Prevention	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	2/5/2009 12:11:23 PM	I was started at 60mg 2Xday. The first week I was on it I overslept by more than an hour everyday, was so tired I was falling asleep at work, gained 5 lbs., and couldn't focus or accomplish anything. Trying to work out was impossible, I couldn't even climb stairs without having to sit down &amp; I usually run the stairs 6 times a day!After 8 days Dr cut my dosage in half but I'm still worn out &amp; oversleeping, am experiencing mild burning in my face, hot flashes, and on top of it all my headaches are coming back, albeit in a milder form. I do not think this is a good drug for me.

It has been wonderful! I no longer feel ashamed of my tremor and do not get picked on for shaking. I can live a normal life now!I have had side effects of slight weight gain, problems sleeping,sometimes diarrhea,but it is still worth it to me for the positives I get from it.I was recently up my dosage substantially from 60mg-1 a day to 120mg-2 a day, b/c my Dr. says my ET has progressed quite a bit. I am still 100% satisfied with this medication.

When I was diagnosed as having essential tremor a few years ago, my doctor offered to write a prescription for the drug. I declined because my condition was more in the nature of an annoyance that I could live with. I did mention, however, that the only real hardship caused by my tremor was its interference with my ability to play golf. He prescribed a 60 mg dose of Inderal and instructed me to take it about an hour prior to tee-off time. It settled my hands so I can grip a putter without shaking. (I still miss my putts, but they come closer than they did before I started using Inderal.)

Inderal has been a life saving miracle for me.  I take Inderal LA 120mg, 1 a day, and I have very little trouble, unless I push it with too much caffeine or get too over-tired.  Then I have an episode where my heart wants to beat out of my body, but at that time, I take a second Inderal and relax.  So far that has worked for me.  Last year, my doctor said it's hard to beat Inderal, it's a great prescription.  I am very thankful as it has given me a quality life.

It has made such a difference in my life. Before I began taking it I was tired all the time with severe palpitations, dizzy spells and fainting to only name a few symptoms. My doctor had to raise the dose after 5 years to get the same effect but I would never want to go back to the way I felt without it.

Migraine Prevention	Pat, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	10/27/2007 7:40:37 AM	My doctor put me on Inderal LA 180 mg per day and Lanoxin, in 1977 for two reasons. I was having awful migraines that lasted up to  four days, and my pulse sometimes went up to 240 beats per minute and stayed there for 45 minutes. My family has a long history of heart disease and strokes. I've been on this dosage ever since. I still get an occasional migraine or irregular rapid heartbeat, but my pulse doesn't go as high. By the way, my  migraines DON&quot;T occur at the same time as the rapid pulses.
