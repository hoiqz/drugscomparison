We need it.I remember when having 2/3 of people's stomach was common practice.It is a rarity to hear of it now.Great medicines.Thank God.

Got so sleepy and my stomach felt sick, that I am afraid to take it this morning like I am suppose to but have to be able to drive.  Anyone else experience this?  It might be something else making me feel wierd.  Any ideas or comments would be appreciated.

Not one mentioned &quot;the burpies&quot;, gas, bloating and diarrhea (or at least very loose stuff). I am very annoyed by these side effects, but the relief of acid reflux is very welcome. Trying to cut down dosage and take probiotics, but still problems.
Symptoms Accompanying Esophageal Reflux of Stomach Acid	gypsylady, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/20/2011 6:40:24 PM	AcipHex is the ONLY medication that has provided relief of GERD, aspiration lung infections, and vocal chord damage.  I have been forced by insurance companies for years to try other medications (Prevacid, Nexium, Prilosec, etc.)with severe side effects, no relief and more damage to my vocal chords.  Now my insurance company refuses to cover AcipHex, and I am again suffereing with reflux, aspiration problems and asthma.  Why don't insurance companies care about the health of their patients?  It seems to me that prevention is more important than the possible damage being caused by drugs that don't work.

I got caught in a situation where my previous medication was not covered by my insurance.  I have had gastro problems for many years and had finally found a medication that worked well but because of the high cost I was switched to this one.  With all the problems I encountered with this one, I will gladly pay for the one which works.

One day out of 120 may result in a GERD episode, usually associated with diet.  When the episode occurs it is handled almost immediately when taking an extra dose at the time of the episode.  Only side effect I experience is that the interior wall of my esophagus have hundreds of outgrowths which have been determined to be benign and are almost entirely reversed with cessation of Aciphex.  I feel no discomfort from the outgrowths so I continue with the Aciphex treatment, as the pain of GERD is eliminated with the drug.

I have changed insurance companies many times over the years. The new insurance carrier always rejects it. When this happens, the next stop is to call the insurance and ask why. Sometimes they want you to try a different medication. If so, fill the scrip. Then your doctor will have to tell the insurance that you followed their protocol and need the aciphex.  Sometimes the insurance just wants a consult with your doctor.  I have also had an endoscopy done to prove I needed to be on it.  I have gotten it covered every time, so don't give-up!
Symptoms Accompanying Esophageal Reflux of Stomach Acid	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	55-64	4/5/2011 7:54:49 AM	I developed frequent,severe,frightening heart palpitations that got progressively worse after taking Aciphex for reflux. Before I made the connection between the two, I had gone to a cardiologist for a full battery of tests on my heart,all of which came back negative. My doctor and I then began to rule out variables that roughly coordinated with the time I began to experience the palpitations,and I discovered that when I stopped taking the Aciphex, the palpitations were 80% gone within three days. Within a week they were completely gone,and they have not returned. I now must experiment with alternative reflux medications, but I am relieved to know that the palpitations are not organic.

I only took one 20mg pill and experienced the worst side effects I'd ever had.  I was out of commission for 3 days with muscle aches, chills then fever of 102, splitting headache, weakness, and now a shortness of breath and coughing.  I'll never take Aciphex again!

The cost is high and my insurance increased the co-pay but there is a discount card available on line from the maker that keeps my cost to $20 per month--they pay up to $55 of co-pays after you pay $20!

It reduces the acid in my stomach and relieves the burning in my throat.  I have excessive acid in my stomach.  Since I am now on Medicare and have a supplement my insurance refuses to pay for my Aciphex.  I am now taking over the counter Prilosec and it does not do the trick.  I have tried many meds for this and aciphex taking 20mg twice a day has helped.

I carried Zantac constantly although it was no cure it would help.  I had it in my jacket, my desk draw at work, in all my vehicles, on my nightstand.  I took Prilosec and Nexium before this product and would still have problems.  I took Aciphex and noticed a difference within in a couple days.  Then after a couple weeks I noticed I had no heartburn any longer.  I found that I could skip day's at first anything more than every other day and it would return then it was two day's, once a week and finally as needed which is often once a month.  In my eyes this was a miracle drug; I had freedom again and I tell everyone about it but it is expensive.  With that being said:  I would still consider being a sales rep for this product and I used to not believe in any meds.  Everything used to cause me trouble I can't even take vicodin.

I have been taking other pp inhibitors for years. They helped but using Aciphex for about 9 mos. has completely stopped the symptoms.  Also before taking Aciphex a scope showed that I had ulcers on my esop. After using Aciphex for 6 months a 2nd scope showed they were healed. Exspensive but worth the cost.  I am so glad to hear they are making a generic of Acipex, so more people will be able to afford this wonderful drug.

The first time in 2007, Aciphex was the one that worked. I tried all the other ones, Nexium, Previcid, &amp; got hives from them. Aciphex works great!! I stopped taking it after one year and felt fine for about a year &amp; a half. I did take it on &amp; off when the Reflux felt like it would get out of hand. Then due to taking Ibuprofen for pain of shoulder surgery, the Acid Reflux returned worse than ever. No more Ibuprofen or aspirin for me! Omeprozole 40 mgs daily was prescribed &amp; did not work at all! I HAD to use Aciphex even though it is not covered by my Insurance. MY DOCTOR WROTE A &quot;LETTER OF MEDICAL NECESSITY&quot; TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY EXPLAINING THAT I COULD NOT TOLERATE THE OTHER, CHEAPER MEDICINES; AND MY INSURANCE COVERED IT AS A TIER 3 (highest co-pay)FOR ONE YEAR AT A TIME. Anyone who needs this prescription, because the others do not work as well, should try to get the doctor to write for the coverage. Maybe if enough of us do that, the insurance companies will finally cover this great medication. It's the only one that seems to work for a lot of people. It is not the same as the other Acid Reflux medications. It has very few side effects.

Felt great. My new insurance company will not pay for Aciphex (too expensive) and I'm on Omeprazole (16 days) its much cheaper than Aciphex. Omeprazole is a dreadful medication, the side effects are terrible: Constipation, bloating, overeating (hungry all the time), weight gain, headache, back ache, pain upper rib cage, gas, burping, problems sleeping, and on top of all that I still have heart burn. :(

I have tried every OTC out there and nothing works as well if at all like this Med. Besides my co-pay doubling this year, which is hard to take, this medicine seems to be the only one that relieves all my symptoms. Chest and stomach pains which feel like extreme cramps, heartburn, difficulty swallowing and being unable to eat because of it. I have been fortunate in having no side effects or at least I have not noticed any. I am extremely satisfied with Aciphex and if a generic becomes available that works as well, I will be thrilled to pay less money if I get these same results.

The only problem is there is no generic and is not in my plans formulay. A 30 day supply cost over $200.00 a month.

I have developed alot of mucous and persist clearing of my throat.  Has anyone had the same effects. I also cough constantly.  It has helped my heartburn, but I have to take something else.  This is driving me crazy.
Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	Athena, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	6/20/2010 7:55:39 PM	I was on Aciphex for about a week, but it only took two days for the side effects to start. Insomnia. Difficulty breathing. I'm an athlete, but I was getting winded going up steps. Dizziness and light-headedness. No energy. I felt like someone had beaten me. Very sore all over, muscle pain, joint pain. I switched back to Omeprazole, and a day and a half later, all my symptoms are gone. I'm sure it works for some people, but it didn't work for me. If you're having any of these symptoms, I'd stop the meds or talk to your doctor. I guess it can be really serious if yo stay on it.
Other	grasshopper, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	65-74	6/17/2010 9:56:42 AM	Diagnosed in '95 with GERD and hiatial hernia.  Lived on Tums for years.  After esophageal scope in '05, dr. prescribed Nexium - after 3 1/2 yrs, symtoms were almost the same and I had shrunk 1/2&quot;. Stopped the Nexium for 1 1/2 yrs - then had another scope in'08 with same dr who prescribed Nexium again which I did not use.  In winter of '09, I started havng excessive mucous (large globs of it) coming up in my throat and continued problems with swallowing food - some choaking and feeling like it was stuck in back of throat or upper esophagus.  Tried many products for mucous with no relief until late spring - it just stopped. It started again this Jan-went to ENT dr who identified problem as the GERD and prescriped the Aciphex.  After 3 weeks, the mucous and difficult swallowing was gone. I still have some acid problems, but my diet is not what it should be. I take it in the evening as nighttime is when I have the worse problem and can't lie on my right side. Have appt w/dr for another scope as there is damage to lower esophagus and I want to rule out Barretts.  If you will &quot;google&quot; Aciphex, you will get a page where you can get a 10 day free trial and they will send you a card where you can get the RX at a discount.  Also, I was told if you contact the drug co, they will refund you some if you have your paid receipts.  I have paid $20 per RX for the past 4 months.  It would be $55 w/my RX ins. card.  Hope this if helpful.
Excessive Production of Stomach Acid	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	65-74	6/14/2010 9:33:58 AM	Aciphex has provided excellent relief from my problem of acid secretion due to nervous tension. I use it sparingly, at most only a few times a week, corresponding to periods of greater stress. Yes, it is too expensive for me to buy. I get occasional samples from my physician. Recently, however, I found it under another name and much cheaper in a third world country where I spend time.  It is called (Parriet )and is manufactured by the same firm (Eisai Ltd.). 14 tablets of 10 mg cost only $30, or just over $2 per tablet. Recently I have experienced some liver pain which I thought could be associated with taking Aciphex, but reading through comments do not find any other references to this as a possible side effect.

Ulcer of the Duodenum	Connie Sue64, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/25/2010 11:39:42 PM	I LOVE Aciphex! For over 6mo. my Dr. kept telling me to get all the meds one would use for Gerd, acid reflux, etc. even had a colonoscopy...I finally told her I was finished being a guenie pig and wanted and endoscopy to see what was going on in my stomach from the TOP...I had a lovely ulcer of the Doudenum...no wonder I was in pain!!  She gave me sample of Aciphex and a prescription.  Within 30 min. of the first pill, it was heaven, no pain. I took the Aciphex for a month and my ulcer was healed.  Later on I found out my ulcer was caused by the Vyoxx (?) I was taking for my back inflammation...course, now that has been taken off the market.  But, Aciphex is a drug that specifically says it is for ulcers and that is what I needed..not the cheap generics, or the OTC pills..the ins. wouldn't pay for the next prescription, said I had to take Nexium, it was cheaper...by 2.32!! Amazing!!  Thankfully, my Dr. will give me her samples whenever I have a flair so I haven't had to pay for anymore Aciphex.  If you need it for your ulcers...ask your Dr. for any samples...the Drs. have samples of tons of drugs so you may as well try to get them for yourself.  I hope everyone has good luck if you try Aciphex, I loved it.  No side effects and it healed my ulcer...yea!

I tried several meds. Nexium, Previcid, then Protonix. None of them helped. I also experianced massive belching. Then my wife got a free 14 day trial of Aciphex.  I felt relief with in a hour from the belching. After a few days it has really helped the pain and pressure in my chest and other symptoms I was having. SO far Aciphex is a God send for me.

Medication Treatment for Healing Gastroesophageal Reflux	aciphex user, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		4/25/2010 5:22:03 PM	Taking Aciphex for 8 yrs. was diagnosed with Barretts Esophagus early on but have no symptoms since taking aciphex. Now because of new insurance and coverage gap I have tried other meds and am experiencing so much heartburn I am afraid it will cause the scar tissue in esophagus to become a problem. Is there any way to approach the makers of aciphex for help with the insurance companies? Aciphex is a definite 24 hr relief and has enabled me to eat well and sleep well without the constant acid reflux.

I have now been on Aciphex 20mg for over 8 years now and have not built a tolerance to it and it works BEAUTIFULLY for me. The only thing I noticed is constipation if I would happen to forget that I had already taken it and take it twice in one day. Since I have a memory problem, I now use a weekly pill box (what a life saver). Love this medication! No side effects when I started this medication and over 8 years later, still none.

He found one and it works great!  Ask your doctor about &quot;Omeprazole Cap&quot;  - I take 40 mg.  Your co-pay then would be at the generic price.

My insurance only covers Nexium (which does not work for me) and I have to pay $365.00 per mo. because I am now ordered to take it 2 times per day due to a GI Bleed I am trying to heal.And that's with discounts and coupons. So I must really love the stuff. Otherwise I would pay the $30.00 copay and get the Nexium.

My insurance company just let me know that the now-OTC meds like Prevacid will work just as well, but I don't know. What I do know is that I ran low before my last refill and I tried to switch to every other day on the Aciphex. It worked OK for the first couple of times, but when I went without the pill for a second day, severe heartburn roared back--and continued through the first day I was back on the Aciphex. This is day 2 and so far, so good. I took Nexium many years ago and it worked very well, but there came a time when the insurance company would no longer pay for it. I just dealt with the heartburn with Tums until a couple of years ago when I had an endoscopy and the doc put me on Aciphex.

Was on Prevacid which helped but still got heartburn once or twice per week even when she doubled the dosage.  I have also tried Protonix, Nexium, and Prilosec.  Aciphex is the ONLY one that completely got rid of heartburn and I have not encountered any side effects.

None of the other reported side effects, just the flushing.  It can be very annoying (and hot!) but seems not to be increasing in severity or duration so far as the other medications did but we'll see.  It does control the GERD symptons well.

I am on day 6 of Achiphex and I still feel miserable. So far, it has been very ineffective. I still have the choking feeling in my esophagous and cannot sleep well or much at all due to stomach discomfort. The only side effect I've experienced is itching. Achiphex makes my skin itch occasionally.

That's really saying something since I was living on Rolaids and Zantac. I had an EDG and the doctor took numerous samples for biopsies because of the shape my esophagus is in. I hope it continues to work like it has. It's a blessing to be able to sleep without proping up on three pillows.

This drug made me so sick, I was vomitting multiple times a day, but no other stomach flu like symptoms. As soon as it was out of my system, I felt 100x better and went back to my Protonix, which works like a charm.

In my case it certainly is. I can barely use my hands. Why it happens:AcipHex cuts down on stomach acid. Sometimes it cuts down too MUCH acid. In that case, you are unable to break down animal products enough to absorb vitamin B12 from it. Without vitamin B12, your nerve sheathing erodes. My advice would be to stop AcipHex and get a good vitamin B12 supplement (sublingual -- the type that dissolves underneath your tongue, and at least 1000 mcg). I would also advise to get the book -- Could It Be B12? By RN Sally Pacholock.This book has literally saved my life.

I tried OTC prilosec but that raised my blood pressure, so I totally went off meds for 3 weeks. I ended up in the ER and since then have gotten back on Aciphex, my new Dr gave me an Instant savings card which pays half of my copay. My suggestion is to ask your Dr's for these cards. I hope this medication goes down in price.

Recently I was unable to get this med from my pharmacy because my insurance didn't want to pay for it - I had to get my physician to call in and approve it - ( this happened a few time in the yrs of my treatment ) Since there isn't a generic - the insurance companies are giving their patients a difficult time on long term use. I went without the aciphex for 7 days - and became really ill. LOTS of heartburn and feeling sick esp after eating. I finally got it filled from my pharmacy and feel alot better - I wish I didn't have to take it - or - could find a generic - but have tried others - and this one works the best for me. The insurance companies need to WAKE UP!  Not all meds are created equal!!

I tried a generic medication but it was just that generic when it came to relieving my symptoms. My condition was so bad that I lost my voice and was having a hard time swallowing food has even changed the linning of my esophagus. Which is scarry since I have been told increases my chainces of getting throat cancer. Even with this medication I  still have top watch what I eat and drink not everything I like likes me. I also worry about long term effects of this medication since most research I have done on this say this medication in not intended for use past 1 year.

Have not had any side effects that I am aware of, I typically take 1 in the morning.  Since I dont eat breakfast 90%+ of the time I have to take in the morning, or my stomach pains on some days can be almost unbearable.  Overall works well, would recommend for acid problems doesnt cure you or take away all the pain.  But does make a big difference.

I have been taking it a few weeks now. I have really bad stomach pains when I eat, so my doctor put me on this to reduce stomach acid production... well, after a few days, I notice the pain was gone when I ate. Well, the label says take one at AM and PM. Well, for some reason, if I take this PM I can't sleep. It keeps me up, not due to an upset stomach, but maybe something in the drug? Also, it doesn't help that this medicine is out there to improve health. And most people who have stomach problems are on a healthy diet. Well almost all healthy diets are going to tell you not to eat after about 7 p.m. at night, since this is the most relaxing time, and very little physical activity is done. So it doesn't help that NOT eating with this pill does upset my stomach, so at night, I'd say take around 6 or 7 p.m. and not at bedtime, otherwise you might experience a few complications. Other than that, I have no complaints of this medication, works great for me, and I will still continue to take it!

When i took it at night, I was up all the time with my tumtum roaring.  I take mine first thing in the morning with a glass of water, then eat 30 minutes later.  Works like a charm.  very expensive, but worth it since I can sleep through the night with no interruptions.  Had to make major changes to my diet, but worth it.  No tomatoes (or tomato products), onions, garlic, citric products, melons or cucumbers.

I have taken ACIPHEX for over 9 years.  Since it is not on many health insurance preferred list, I have been forced to try many other drugs in this category.  Hands down, this is the ONLY one that provides me relief.  I have recommended it to others with similar results.  I cannot wait for this to be available OTC.

For almost a year I tried various medicines, better diet, eating dinner earlier etc. But still had daily indigestion.Aciphex gave me relief but I did not like having to take a perscription medicine daily. So I experimented with over the counter medicines, better diet etc. None of this worked.  Only Aciphex gave me steady relief.  When I stop taking it for a few days my indigestion returns.I still don't like the idea of being dependant on a drug, but it has been a godsend. I have no  side effects.I do eat lighter in the evening. I find red meat hard to digest. And I eat early.  It takes me 3 hours after I finish dinner for my stomach not to feel full.

When try to get refill found out that 30 pills cost 185$ (no ins.)125$ with my discount card so I had to settle with Prilosec OTC whick started working after the 5th day n' had side effects like lightheaded feel, stomach cramps in first week, I did not have any SE with ACIPHEX, also helped exercising more, checking diet (No caffeine, spicy n' citric food etc) i lost 15 pounda already, no more junk food but was told to go easy with sleep aid pills n' aspirin which i frequent use, Overall I recommend this med but anybody knows how to get it for less wallet pain??? thx    Martin

This man is a genuineidiot. As a result I have paid $188.82 outof pocket every month for the last six yearsas I have no insurance. But it is worth every penny because without it I literallydrown in stomache acid daily/nightly.

To the point where I was vomitting up cups of bial almost on a daily basis. I've tried at least 8 different medications and none of them worked. My doctors were considering surgery. Aciphex was the last medication they decided to try, and three days after taking it my GERD was completly under control. I am thrilled that I found this medication. I haven't had any side effects from it and I could be happier.

My insurance company wanted to switch me to nexium because of cost.  I flatly said no and they complied.  I was taking one per day with no problems.  Moved and a new GI doc gave me a Nexium sample for two weeks; after one week I was having gurd problems so I went back to Aciphex.  I was increased to two times a day by a new primary care physician.  I just had an endoscopy and results showed no acid reflux, no stomach ulcer, only gastritis.  So, I feel it has worked well for me. Acid reflux was bad before I started on the medication.  I have no reflux problems unless I take myself off the medication and then it returns.  I can skip a few days with no problems, but I would not suggest taking yourself off this for any length of time.

I had heartburn only a couple of times while on this medince but I think that's because I ate foods that I shouldn't of. But it did improve my heartburn because I would always have a constant burning feeling in my throat. Sadly I went to the doc yesterday to get a prescription for it and found out my insurance doesn't cover it. I am going to get a prescription for nexium on Monday. If anyone is thinking of trying this drug or is just on the the samples to see if it helps, I would suggest calling your health insurance provider to see if it is covered. I thought for sure aciphex would be covered with my insurance since I have military. But no I guess it is just too expensive.

If I am sick, I won't be saving any money, just spending it on different things.  I had already tried the formulary drugs and would not have needed Aciphex if they had worked initially.  Aciphex has changed my life and has helped me to lose weight, sleep better, and many many other advantages.  except too expensive.

Always depended on Pepcid but it quit working about 6 months ago.  My Dr. put me on Nexium, which offered little relief.  Then switched me to Aciphex and it has been a Godsend!  After 4 weeks, my stomach was normal again.  Little expensive but I have good insurance + they offer the $30 rebate.

Aciphex is the ONLY drug that has worked for me.  Very expensive. My insurance co. has just raised my deductible, but there isn't anything close to this product.  I love it and have suggested to friends to talk to thier doctor about getting them on Aciphex also.

Sometimes in the same day. Yet the symptoms still return. Aciphex cures it for me. I just wish is wasnt so expensive.
