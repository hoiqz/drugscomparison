I've been taking it a long time and it works. But it still scates me. I have high blood pressure and thanks to this drug I know it has caused me to have involentary jerking movements as I try to go to sleep. Be careful when you take this medicine as it can cause death.

But it also made me gain 8 pounds in 2 weeks. Mood wise, for me, it didn't do too much difference. If anything, it made me more in a state of depression. I would suggest it to someone who has a difficult time sleeping, but not at high dosage. Also, if your weight is important to you, don't take it.

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	ThatDogMom,  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2			7/28/2012 3:56:46 AM	I was on Seroquel a little over a year. It eased my symptoms and allowed me to fall asleep rapidly, which I badly needed. However, I gained about 30 pounds and had almost insatiable hunger. When my blood sugar levels started to rise, my internist advised me to stop taking it. Fortunately, my psychiatrist agreed. I've had a difficult time losing the weight and now have fatty liver disease from the rapid weight gain. The drug helped when I needed it, but I wouldn't stay on it for any longer than necessary. Do your homework on this medication, and be sure to have regular blood work done.

Other	angry baby, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	3	5	Male	3-6	6/10/2012 6:07:36 PM	My 5yr old son has numerous struggles including insomnia, mood disorder, possible autism and much more. He rarely slept more than a few hrs off and on through the night and had up to 10 violent tantrums harming himself and others. I am not a believer of too many meds but as a single mom of 2 boys, I was at my wits ends. The 1st week he started on 1/2 a 25mg and did sleep better w/ decreased tantrums but them went to 25mg. For 3weeks my baby was extra hyper but tantrum free. Recently the meds started wearing off around 2pm and I can now expect several tantrums until he recieves his next dose at 9pm but his doc will probably increase at out next visit. It took almost 5 years of screaming and hitting and more than most could imagine but we finally have some peace in our home. And for the 1st time in as long as I can remember- my baby gave me a hug and kiss and told me he loved me after a few days of being on this med. Tears of happiness don't come too often. Of course he has had some side affects that we are monitoring; extreme thirst and monitoring sugar, increased appitite ( which he is already being tested for that before the meds)

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	tresvick, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	5/28/2012 3:12:06 PM	This is a horrible medicine and I believe it should only be used as a last-ditch effort. At first it was a medication for severe psychotic disorders. Now it seems to be used as a catch-all for any type of depression or behavior problems. Even a small dosage can have lasting side effects, especially uncontrolled body movements and tics in different parts of your body that may or may not go away. My first experience with it caused my neck to move involuntarily in stiff movements. My next doctor ignored my reaction and gave me a low dosage of this drug. The first night after taking it, I couldn't walk straight; the second night my knee started to click when I walked; the third night my ankles started to click; the last night my neck started to crick or pop every time I moved it. That was the last night I took it and it took a year for my neck to stop clicking when I moved it. Even after that, my doctor ordered refills for me. I didn't take them and stopped seeing that doctor. I think you really need to be careful and if a medication is causing you unusual reactions, stop taking it and tell your doctor. If he won't listen, stop taking the medication and find another doctor who will listen to you and work with you to fing a medication that will help you instead of turning a psychotic medication for a non-psychotic condition.

I have complex PTSD and have been on it for 7 years. I had a TIA, high blood sugar, hideous soft tissue and muscle spasms, and now what feels like fibromyalgia. The latter started when I got down to 100 mg. from 650!!! It puts me to sleep but the side effects are AWFUL. Memory? Whats that???? Confusion, weight gain. This stuff is POISON in my book. We all recat differently to drugs becuz we all have diff. things going on in diff. organs etc. But I want off. They say its not addictive but to me it IS. I can't sleep below 100 mg. So really folks, the issues are many. I have noone to take care of me in this debilatated state. I eat extremely clean diet, raw foods, veg's and fruit. I highly recc. a product called &quot; CALM&quot; for the muscle pain. It is avail. only and health food stores and works like a charm. Its ionic magnesium. You drink the powder w/water. If you can't afford it , use epsom salts in a bath daily. Be well. I wish all of you the best of health SOON.

I took it for 3 weeks and it's been 3 months now that I've been off of the Seroquel 25mg and I still have mild tinnitus but is is much better.  I just want to warn people that if you do experience tinnitus to get off this med. right away. I don't know if the tinnitus will ever fully go away but I did test it and went back on the Seroquel for 3 days and the tinnitus got unbearable in just 3 days!  Now I'm on Abilify and it seems to be working almost as well as the Seroquel without any side-effects.

They are like blisters, but just a few.  Has anyone experieced this?  Is this a side effect of Seroquel.  So glad my doc is getting me off of this.  All my muscles ached unbelieveably.  Out like a light 3 hours after taking it.  And yes, felt like a zombie with no emotions whatsoever.  Been in bed for 5 days now.  Raised my blood sugar and haven't been able to control this at all.

I have tried Ambien, Lunesta, Rozerem, trazadone... all with horrible side effects.  Nightmares, etc... I also suffer from PTSD. the trick to the meds for sleeping is to take it and immediately go to bed.  don't sit up waiting for it to take effect, your body automatically goes into the fight sleep mode.

The medication was initially started at 100mg each day and titrated over a few weeks up to 500 mgs which is my current does. I have been suffering depression and anxiety for 30 years and have taken many different antidepressants. Nothing has even come close to helping my condition as much as Seroquel. I have been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 rapid cycling. Before Seroquel I would shift every month . Now I may have 3 or 4 short episodes of depression. As far as hypomania it really has not been much of a problem. Certain medications can cause me to shift to hypomania. For instance too much Nuvigal will do that. However I need Nuvigal and I just take 125 mgs or less mostly a little less. I also have been prescribed Clonazepam for general anxiety disorder accompanied with panic attacks . Also 20 mgs of fluoxetine.I am 60 years old with two sons 16 and 20 and my wife. Doing well . Nothing is perfect but I would say at this time that Seroquel is and has been the most important drug in my life as far as making a positive difference.

Now i tale 25 mgs before work. Have a much better day. 12.5 at lunch and then 12.5 after work and 25mgs at bedtime. Works very good for me with prozac. Have pretty well given up adivan. Tiny hard to cut in half.

Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	Philos64, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	45-54	4/3/2012 12:44:58 AM	What I've learned from 8+ years of taking Seroquel:1. Gaining weight was a problem in the past, however it is not now. Exercising, eating lousy (yes, lousy), and taking supplements to help with the vitamin deficiencies have helped me over the years. My definition of eating lousy is: Ice Cream with lots of peanuts on top. At least once a day. I use protein shakes and mix in good things to make up for the loss of the most vital nutriants. I don't eat junk food, or drink soda. I drink iced tea and water. I've found that no calorie sweetners increase my anxiety. To help with constipation, I take an Acidopholus based supplement. Btw, I am NOT endorsing my methods of eating!2. Seroquel makes me &quot;eat walk&quot;. Definition: 1/2-3/4 hour after taking my Seroquel, I get hungry, so I head for the kitchen and get something to eat. Unfortunately, eating kicks in my Seroquel, causing me to stumble about in the kitchen, and frequently falling. I have slept quite a few nights on the kitchen floor due to this. A friend of mine who witnessed this, told me I was like a kid who didn't want to go to bed at night.My answer to this has been to take a snack with me to bed. Because of this, I have many nightgowns with chocolate stains on them! A Seroquel friend of mine was the one who asked me if I had noticed that Seroquel kicks it in much more quickly after eating.3. Know your dose. If you're on the hypomanic side of bp, talk to your pdoc if adjusting the dosage is right for you. I have found that Seroquel does not help with my depression, so my pdoc adjusts my dosage accordingly. I am atypical, so my dosage needs are normally higher than most others.4. Don't give up the benefits of Seroquel because of the potential weight gain. Most of us know that finding a med that finally works can be really tough, and side effects come along with the package. There are so many different ways to stay active and get rid of any weight gain you might come across.If I can do make it, You can too!

I had massive weight gain, I now suffer from diabetes, and my kidneys don't function properlyp because of the diabetes this is a direct result of the seroquel. I also now have thyroid disease but can't prove that's from the seroquel. If you decide to take be aware of all side affects.

I had gone to a mental hospital because I had no idea what was going on, never been manic before, went in to see my Doctor and he prescribed this med, it is the only thing I have found so far that keeps the manic away and works great, my only problem is that it also makes you gain weight which sucks!

Bipolar Depression	Illmissbacchus, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	3/9/2012 5:50:54 PM	I was prescribed Seroquel and took it for only 4 days total.  I didn't even think the drug would be effective until it had built up in my system but perhaps it was because I was very malnourished and weak at the time I began to react within 24 hours.  It started a manic episode that literally had me smashing my head against the wall at work.  One co-worker found me lying unresponsive on the couch and thought I was dead, really I was just out-of-my-mind with panic, rage, and silent screams only I could hear.  I decided to take myself off it after that, as rogue librarians are frowned upon.  However, and I don't have any proof that this was a side effect of Seroquel and I'm sure people would argue with me but, for eight months afterwards and very seldom, to a far lesser extend, now I experienced pain in my shoulders and spine as if my skeleton were attempting to escape my body through the base of my neck.  I've eliminated all other culprits and those few days of Seroquel were when the pain began.  'Pain' does not even begin to describe what that felt like though. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone especially those recovering from illness.

My moods seem to be more even and I get amazing, blissful sleep. My only concern is how dependent I may be on this medication with regards to sleep. Since taking Seroquel, I never have anxiety about not falling asleep, and I am concerned that I may never be able to fall into a peaceful sleep without it. Also, my Husband lost his job recently, so we no longer have medical insurance..when i went to fill my prescription I was informed the cast would be about $800. Luckely I went on line to the makers of Seroqual and found a program that would help me with the cost. It's called AZ&amp;Me. I hope this may help some of you.

THIS MEDICATION CHANGED MY LIFE. I get 7-8 hrs of good quality sleep which was unheard of before. I haven't gained weight and don't have any side effects. Also, I've developed healthy lifestyle habits of exercising, healthy eating, and stopped bad habits of using too much caffiene to try to get motivated. I plan to use this medication for the rest of my life because I suffered for so long with insomnia. Seroquel changed my life for the better. I'm so glad my friend encouraged me to try it!

I could not think as well. It also brought on type 2 diabetes. After getting off of this drug, replace by other medication, I begin to feel better. However, people are biologically different. Thus the side effects defer with different patients. It may work well for many, but it did not work well for me. I have lost 56 pounds, and I no longer have to take diabetes medication.

(Honestly it was a blessing in disguise.) I had bouts of mania &amp; depression on &amp; off for over 18yrs untreated. At times I thought that there was nothing wrong with me &amp; everyone else was the problem. During my 20's I experienced feelings of being immortal, invincible &amp; on top of the world. I became a risk taker. All of these actions felt normal to me. I drank alcohol, used drugs, spent money without a care &amp; later have buyers remorse or overwhelming feelings of guilt. Several times a year I would feel depressed &amp; have thoughts of suicide but honestly never thought I would actually attempt it. Deep down I knew there was some type of chemical imbalance with the ups &amp; down. Later I realized my actions greatly affected those around me. When I would start to feel mania or &quot;normal&quot;,  I would forget about needing help &amp; think everything was ok. Never once did I consider that I may have a mental illness. When I turned 30, I started having lower back pain that is now chronic. 3 years ago I also found out that I have arthritis and fibromyalgia &amp; that these too are chronic. I tried a few antidepressants &amp; pain management, none that really worked. I withdrew from life, stayed in bed &amp; isolated myself, I became agitated, anxious &amp; my stress level was through the roof. My relationship of 11 years became rocky &amp; my partner left. Now, at 38yrs everything finally crashed together. So I tried to take my life.(I'm happy that didn't work out!) I was soon diagnosed with Bipolar I disorder during my hospital stay. My psychiatrist started me on a better pain regimen that works plus a low dose of Seroquel 50mg then up to only 100mg. My pain, mood &amp; depression are more manageable &amp; my relationship is back. I've combined that with therapy &amp; proper rest. I'm back in my life and doing what I need to stay balanced. I have much work to do &amp; may need to up my dose later. It's amazing how this med has evened me enough to enjoy life again.

Aural and visual hallucinations under control- avoidance and/or recognition of triggers a big help. Still have memory hallucinations, e.g., the sound of a fridge or the sound of tyres will trigger a cacophonic symphony inside my head. Concentration and focus improved considerably. Sleeping well, solid 8 hrs a night, quick to sleep and clear head on immediate wake. Even tempered and serene compared to psychotic states. Digestion improved remarkably- no more accidents in public or having to plan a route for every outing that is no more than 5mins from a loo. Don't drink and have given up smoking, craving for sugars initially but now am sugar free. Never used to drink coffee but now can't put the stuff down. Down side is a distended stomach (think of ET) but there has been no weight gain. Libido non existent, incapable of even a faded echo of an erection.In short, I feel fantastic.

I didn't have the weight gain but I did have the fogginess and hard to wake up problems.  What I did get was Type II Diabetes.  I had no glucose problems when I started but I stopped it after I was in the E.R. for bronchitis and the doctor came back and asked me if I knew I was a diabetic.  My blood sugar count was 300.  I was floored.  I just finished a 3 yr class action suit with AstraZeneca since I'm not the only one but all I got from them was to be bent over and screwed and $5k for a lifetime of the possibility of blindness, amputation or death.  If I sound bitter, you bet I am.  I'm on 2 meds for the diabetes plus about 13 more for chronic pain, insomnia, neuropathy and other things.  It takes me 4 different narcotics to sleep and then it's not the kind of sleep I need.  Some nights, even with all of the meds, there is no sleep at all.I'm sorry for all that have bipolar but happy for the ones that have gotten help from this poison.  For the others, I hope you will find something that works for you.

Seroquel worked great.  Was on it for about 5 years.  It seemed to be the final anwser to my depression.  Of course, the weight gain was awful. About,6 months ago my glucose level was very high.  Found out that Seroquel can cause diabetes.  There was a class action suit against them, and they lost.  You can still enter in that suit for a few months yet.  I slowly went off Seroquel, was more carful of my diet, and my A1C a month later was normal.  As much as this drug helped, I will never take it again.  My depression has gotten a lot worse since going off of it.  Have tried almost everything that I can take with Nardil.  Don't know what to do next.

Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	Bandrew85, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	19-24	1/19/2012 11:40:01 AM	Like many people who have been prescribed this medication I've been diagnosed with a mental health condition.  It is effective in that meets the expectations for treatment however it has a nasty &quot;hangover&quot; effect.  I've been on it a year or so and I still wake up groggy.  It has other side effects like leaving me tired all day, slurred speech and slower processing.  As an educator, it sometimes impacts my ability to be on my &quot;A&quot; game because I am tired.  It also makes me a little irritable--I'm not sure if the trade-off is worth it (e.g., the medication and its side effects in lieu of suffering from bipolar).  Unfortunately, most psychotropic drugs have a downer effect and this one is no different.  It seems my experience is on par with most other people's.  Two things I know for sure, do not drink alcohol while taking this medication and make sure you take it several hours before you go to sleep, despite what your doctor may tell you.  Also, this medication (at least in Illinois) can get you a DUI if you are under its influence and driving.  Be aware!

It is rough to start, feeling lethargic, lost &amp; confused for about 2-3 weeks. After that you settle in nicely.

Unlike other medications after taking this for a while I do not need to increase my dosage... In fact I can actually decrease my dosage. Unlike other reviews this medication does not make me gain weight, the only negative side effect is being sleepy when I first wake up (however, this is the same affect ambien or other sleep aids will have). If you are experiencing weight gain or concerned about weight gain I would suggest talking to your doctor to make sure your dosage is right. A little goes a long way with this drug. I take 25 mg every night, sometimes less if I am already feeling tired.

It also caused quite a bit of weird movements too. I was always tired on it, sleeping later and late for work. Even when depressed i still made it to work on time (depressed and useless tho). It caused problems at work because of the drowsiness. The side effects were more damaging than the condition. If i were on it longer i would've stopped taking meds completely.
Other	Luna, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	12/8/2011 1:12:05 AM	I have been taking this for sleep for about 12 years and in different dosages. Now I am on Seroqel CR and having *some* problems adjusting. Everyone is different but 50 mgs is very high to me and with the Seroquel CR I kind of feel like a zombie in the morning; a bit agitated at night. Prob 'cuz I have tried to cut this in half and take it: Bad idea! Cutting it made me feel sick. Also I have diareeha and trouble driving. **NOTE: I have only been on CR for three weeks: The reg dose I used to take (25mgs) was fine and helped me sleep without anxiety--yet had diareeha only on occasion...when I ate right before bed. If you do feel hungry just eat some crackers or something not anything big--that is the key to not gaining a lot of weight.:) And exercise/eat right..I know *reader eye roll*but it helps. I wish the CR of Seroquel came in 25mg! I would advise eating early if you can and take it WHEN YOU ARE IN BED/READY TO SLEEP.If you skip a dose and can't sleep that's why 'cuz you may have restlessness from not taking it. Take it the next night;try to keep the timing the same.Don't watch anything &quot;weird&quot; on TV or you can have nightmares- sometimes I just read.Good Luck everyone and sweet dreams!

IT IS A WONDER DRUG!!!! Yes I too gained weight in the first month. It was worth it to me to be &quot;sane&quot; again!!! I have always suffered from what I thought was severe mania and I would work with my doctor and he let me adjust my meds accordingly. I don't drink alcohol OR do drugs that is a huge factor in the seroquel working for me! I was on very  high dose's of seroquel It was my decision not my doctors because of the delusions prior to me taking seroquel were very scary to me! It was like I was trapped in another world and I wasn't having fun! I  was on an average 300 mil of seroquel every night but at some points 600mil.  I was at the same job for 8 years and didn't even know they (my co workers) were stressing me out to the point I had to take such high doses. Well I was fired from that job and 3 months later I'm down to 100 mill a night and I have NEVER been happier! I'm a hair dresser and my clients all can tell I'm a different person!!! I've started losing weight 10 pounds since my dosages have changed. (  I lowered my meds  VERY SLOWLY,  otherwise you could spiral into depression) It really helps if you know the signs of your symptons. Which I was in denial because I was always happy (or so I thought) I didn't agree with the depression symptoms the internet told me I was having. But I now know it was the truth. I would have lowered my meds ALOT SOONER, IF I realized I wasn't as manic as I thought. I'm not sure if anyone else read before about when depressed we stop taking showers, Well I was only taking showers once a week, for time sakes or I'd be late for work! No one ever knew! I didn't smell or try to cover it up with perfume! Of course I never went to the gym so I was never sweaty and all gross! Well I hoped this has helped someone, if you'd like to contact me I'm at creative.hair.genius@gmail.comI'm Kat BTW. Good luck and GOD BLESS

I had a SEVERE and scary reaction to the combination of Serequel and Ativan - I blacked out in a fugue and had a psychotic episode.  I remember nothing of it but both my mother and husband witnessed abnormal behavior such as flushing all my medication, putting turkey salad in a bowl and pouring milk on it like cereal, and thinking my socks were a chocolate bar.  This side effect isn't included in the 'interactions' portion but there is a caution regarding use of anxiety medication.  Seroquel is DANGEROUS.  I could have seriously injured myself, and its frightening to not remember a thing you did or said while others tell you that you were acting psychotic.  Ask for another medication such as risperidone that isn't as dangerous as Seroquel.

I also would sleep the day away and stay up all night, then pass out at 3am and sleep until after noon. I could tear down a house on this med. And I almost ruined my relationship. If you experience these issues, call your doctor as soon as possible! Seroquel is just not for me, it made me SO depressed. So be careful when taking these drugs. 
Other	ambrakay, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	10/22/2011 8:36:08 PM	Immediately after the removal of my brain tumor and my temporal lobe resection, I was suffering from major depressive disorder with having my amygdala removed, not to mention 30% of my brain.  A psychiatrist, not allowing me to so much as explain that I'd had brain surgery 6 weeks prior, within less than a minute declared I was bipolar and told me to stop my Lexapro (for generalized anxiety disorder) cold turkey and start taking Seroquel.  He started me on 50 mgs with the intent of getting me up to 300.  By the 3rd week, when I was up to 150 mgs, I wanted to die.  I couldn't stop crying and I slept for at least 13 hours a night.  I was soooo miserable.  Then my seizures came back with a vengeance.  I called my neuro and he told me anyone with epilepsy is not to take any ana-antipsychotics.  I stopped Seroquel immediately and weaned back onto my Lexapro and saw a psychiatrist who works specifically with epilepsya patients who put me on .5 mgs Risperdal for 3 mos as a booster to my Lexapro to get me through the hump of post surgical depression.  That did the trick :-)  By the way, I've since seen 2 other psychiatrists who have confirmed that I do not have depression, nor am I bipolar.

I thad been years since I'd be able to sleep, or really function in a day to day environment for much more than an hour or two. When my psyche team suggested this drug we talked it over, and I could hear only one downside, and that was the drive to feed within an hour or two after taking the dosage. We started out on a low dosage and worked up and I take it about 2030 and then about an hour later I eat an apple with a piece of cheese, and that pretty much kills the craving to eat everything in site.  I have been on a Seroquel 300XR for about 1 1/2 years now and I sleep like a baby and except for something to shut my mind down it works great. The panic attacks are controlled by other stuff, and I take another anti-depressant, plus topirimate for cluster headaches and it also seems to help with the BPD.  Only downside is the cost with crappy insurance my copay for 90 days is $180.00.  I wish the manufactuer would help us out.

I've been on it for a year along with Prozac and feel better than I've felt in my entire life!  Before Seroquel, I was on Abilify for a year.  Abilify is HORRIBLE and made me anxious, nervous, hungry, and restless.  I've been on about 7-8 different meds for my disorder since 1993 and Seroquel is by-far the best!

So I take it around 5 p.m. and getting up around 4 a.m. is no problem. And I have gained weight. Which I do not like, but the result of taking the drug is worth the 20 lbs. I guess.

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	9/19/2011 7:38:10 PM	I started taking this medication about 3 years ago and it was tough at first. It knocked me out and took a while to adjust to. I suppose it has helped with my mania (I seem to only have them when I drink-- not a good idea). Overall I am able to focus, process, and make responsible decisions now. The draw back is the weight gain- which just in the last six months has become noticeable and embarrassing. That alone makes me dislike my self image- but who wouldn't. The worst part for me is knowing that I can never come off of this drug because I ran out several months ago and experienced awful withdrawals. I was so sick and my insides hurt. I felt like I was dying. I never want to experience that again ever. It was terrible. As long as I take the drug daily and do not drink I am fine. I'll have to do something about this 20+ pounds on my tiny frame though. My clothes don't fit! Just do everything you can to not go through the withdrawals. And consider this a warning- you might get stuck taking this forever. Bonus- AZ&amp;Me has patient plans and financial assistance to those who qualify.

My everyday interaction with everyone is so much better!I was nervous about taking it at first because of the sedation and was worried that I'd sleep through one of my five kids waking up or something happening during the night but I wake up when my 6 mo wakes up and to my alarm! Not groggy after about 1 week. Huge decrease in irritability, anxiety, worry, paranoia. I interact with my kids more and have more fun with them. My husband even said that he was happy to have the girl he took on our first date back!

I had to keep Increasing the dosage every month because it didt help. So eventually I was taking 1 as needed (25mg) and 3 to sleep. My problem with this medication was severe weight gain. It was not told to me till about June that this was aside affect. I started taking it in January and from jan-june I gained 60lbs (which I had just lost that 60 that past year). It didn't even dawn on me till my dr mentioned it that the medication had increased my hunger. So I stopped taking it and have been trying to lose this weight and have not been able too. This weight gain has also severely increased my depression. So I would not recommend this medication at all!

One pill per day at bedtime because it also makes me sleep like a baby. I had a lot of problems sleeping and it sometimes took hours for me to fall asleep.  When I first began taking it - it made me sleep for a good 15 hours.  I never heard an alarm and ended up loosing my job because my boss did not believe me. Over a short amount of time the sleeping evened out and I slept the normal 7-8 hours a night. But VERY deeply!! Hope my house doesn't catch on fire because I doubt I would wake up. I still have bad moods but nothing like they were before Seroquel.

The SSRI had bad side effects, and I stopped taking. I have tried several different SSRI Anti-Depressants during this 10 year span. Approx. 3 years ago I ended up in a Mental Health Facility, and while in there I saw a psychiatrist. After an assessment the Doctor again diagnosed me as Bi-polar with an added diagnosis of Severe Anxiety w/Panic Attacks, and again tried another SSRI that was fairly new to me at the time called Celexa. I took it for about a month or so until the same side effects I have always had with SSRIs began. So I went to my new doctor and explained this to him. He then prescribed me Seroquel to try as an alternative to an SSRI, at first at a low dosage, than higher as I needed it. Not only did it NOT cause the same unwanted side effects as the SSRIs did, it eased my conditions very well and proved to be extremely effective. It has successfully countered my Bi-Polar Disorder for the last 3 or so years. It also aides with the Severe Anxiety &amp; Panic Attacks (along with Clonazepam). Lastly, I have also been diagnosed as an Insomniac and again Seroquel alone has also conquered that diagnosis as well. All in all, while this medicine is expensive due to the lack of generics (patent hasn't expired) it is well worth the money as I have had multiple disabling problems managed with the use of this one drug. The price of the medication can be adjusted with insurance, and/or a financial plan with the Drug Company themselves who offer RX Discounts, and free medication to those who are in need. The only bad side effects I have experienced with this medication is occasional nightmares, and dry mouth in the morning. I hope this helps anyone thinking of taking this medication. For my situation it was a PERFECT solution, and it may be the answer for you as well. Always talk to your doctor and weigh the pros and cons.

Worked very well but was getting groggy during the day and less focused, also memory problems.Then read it ups triglycerides and cholesterol.Also realized it was used off label and was anti-depressant.Realize there are many people caught in a catch 22 situation and Need these types of meds.,at least short term but Newsweek 2/10/2010, magazine showed studies that seem to prove the newer drugs simply do not work. Short term possibly,(one rebuttal) but to take one then add another which seems to be current practice because one seems to not work as well anymore just doesn't make sense to me related to all the other side effects that then need to be txd. also with more and more meds. and then those side effects from those meds in a vicious circle.I truly believe one of the problems created by preventive medicine is the same problems seen with defensive medicine. Meds are now being prescribles to large populations of people who really don't need them based on unproven results and anecdotal theories. Try reading a few of books now being published about over-treatment in this country. Now I take fish oil and scripts short term only as needed. Have read now that the fish oil doesn't work either but so far it doesn't look like it does harm either.

After 2 yrs of feeling like a depressed, fat, anesthised, drugged out, zombie, I weaned myself off this medicine. It's been over 3 years and have I never felt better. I lost 60 pounds in the first 6 months and started living life again. I was misdiagnosed in my early 20's as manic-depressive and was prescribed every type of psych drug a person can take. I found a new psych who listened and helped me gradually wean off all of the meds. I no longer take any psych meds at all. I finally feel like my self again! Seroquel caused me to gain a lot of weight, dried out my nose, gave me headaches, caused severe dry mouth and tooth decay, restless leg syndrome, muscle and tendon problems, confusion, grogginess, craved sweets, rebound insomnia, agitation, irritability, clumsiness, blurred vision, racing heart beat, and a overall decline in my health.

I use other medications for several different conditions, however, the lack of sleep over takes everything.  I'd rather have a good night's sleep than anything else.  My opinion.  Works right away. Sometimes if I have things to do in the morning, I cut the dosage down.
Bipolar Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	25-34	6/29/2011 4:56:49 AM	Seroquel was expensive and no fun at all.  After taking my dose, I would be in between sleep and wakefulness.  I would not be able to sleep, but would be very drowsy and yet restless.  It was a very uncomfortable feeling.  I would lie down and not be able to get comfortable.  The uncomfortable feeling occurred whether I took Seroquel in the morning or at night.  I kept taking it anyway.  I can't say how much it helped and how much was the natural course of my bipolar disorder.  But I would not take it again if I had the choice (and fortunately nobody's asking me to.)  Maybe it will work for you, but not for me.  I haven't taken it in years.  Now I'm on a generic version of Lamictal and a generic version of Risperdal.  Risperdal used to have a similar effect on me, but it doesn't anymore.  Maybe it was my drinking that caused the unpleasant side effects.  Who knows why these drugs work this way?  I sure don't.  But I'm much better without drinking.  I recommend it (quitting drinking).

I have obsessive compulsive personality disorder (which includes generalized anxiety disorder)as well as chronic depression. My OCPD is actually quite helpful when it comes to work and some social situations, so I don't take anything daily. I only take Seroquel a couple of times a month, so I have not experienced any weight gain. What I love so much about seroquel is that  when I'm starting to get worked up and breathing heavy and highly agitated, I can take half a pill and it makes me feel really really normal. Seriously. A normal I haven't felt in my life. I've taken it when I interviewed at my grad school for admission. I had 2 days of classes I had to sit in on and tons of important people to meet and impress and blend in with. SO stressful. I popped one in the morning when I noticed my hand shaking, and BOOM! I got a little tired about 5 hours into it. I took it once when I thought I was upset before a family gathering, but it turns out I didn't get anywhere near a panic attack and ended up falling asleep at the dinner table. Seroquel really really helps with my panic attacks. I have used these anti-depressants without too much success: prozac, zoloft, celexa, and fluoxetine.
Other	kprobson, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	6/23/2011 11:40:35 AM	I was given this drug because I wasn't sleeping.  I still didn't sleep with the medicine, but it did give me nasty twitching, such that as I walked down the hall at work, my arm would shoot out like I was batting at something.  I couldn't think straight or formulate words.  With permission, I got off the meds as soon as I could. I was told that Benedryl helps to get this stuff out of your system (I did take it), but 4 years after stopping the medicine I still occasionally still twitch.  If I could go back, I would have asked the doc if there wasn't something more safe for my problem (20mg Ambien wasn't working).  If you can't sleep, take something else.  It's not worth it in my opinion.

I have had 2 heat strokes where I fainted, and a stroke. I would NOT NOT NOT reccomend this drug to anyone. It is not a controlled substance but getting off of it feels like it. It is SERIOUSLY bad for long term use. I have been on it for 6 years for sleep as I have PTSD and cannot respond to regular sleeping pills. Im on 250 mg. and was on 750 mg. when I had a TIA and was in the hospital for 5 days.I have uncontrollable, IRREVERSABLE movement in my fingers and hands. I am a professional musician , so you can understand my horror.At this point, as I write, I have intense, muscle cramping in my torso and have put a call into my Psych. Dr. and my neurologist. Im very frightened , as I live alone in a remote community. I cannot FATHOM going off all of this at once. My research has told me that this will MAke YOu psychotic.

I am noticing a lot of myself in these comments, both good and bad. The first thing I noticed was a problem has been the horrible weight gain I have suffered. I have gained between 7lbs and 15lbs each month, so I have gained roughly about 50lbs, most of the time I feel like a zombie, no energy, hard time finding motivation. But there is also good things like helping me sleep, my mood stablizing. I am just trying to figure out if the good out weighs the bad enough to stay on this medication?

It did help with my anxiety and depression and with sleeping problems. Its much safer than benzo's, and my body became used to the feeling (I know some antipsychotics make you so sick but this one didnt). One thing though, if you are taking a high dose, it can be scarey waking up the first few times and going about your day. The first night I took it I felt like I had been anesthetized and waking up, I had to really lay down for awhile (try not to fall back asleep), be careful when I got up and walked around, and when I did get up, I ended up having to lay down on the floor before passing out. But if you give this medication time, it can work for you (I know diff meds work for diff people), so just give it about 1-3 months if you can handle it. It does get better/ easier and side effects usually dissapear.

I play with my children, I play softball, soccer, swim and hunt But since I have been taking seroquel, I have gained 45 lbs. I was not upset with mt weight before the seroquel and i was not depressed. I just have sleep issues and the dr. thought seroquel would help me sleep and stay asleep. It only did that for the first few months, then he upped my dose and I still dont sleep. So now, I am fat, depressed (because of the weight), and don't know how to loose the weight, wish i would have never started it.

I have always been trim and find that my body, especially my back, literally hurt from the weight gain. Spent a week in bed the first week with no desire to wake up. I cannot stand what it has done to my body and intend to have my p-doc remove it come my appt. on the 25th of May. My sleep is so hard that when I awake, it's as though I've not slept at all. This is the worst medication I have taken for my bipolar and feel angry that she would have put me in this position.

I became resistant to the meds I was taking, so Dr. suggested Seroquel.  Within 30 days, I had gained back all the weight I lost, but thought it would be worth it if it worked..... so far not working and now I'm fat on top of it.  Also an extreme hassle to try to take it 3 hours before I go to sleep, instead of at bed time.  If I don't, I cant wake up earlier than 10AM!

I had used Seroquel before, and my doctor prescribed it again.  Unfortunately, in one short month I gained so much weight I was unable to fit into any of  my clothes or shoes.  I am in the process of switching to Geodon.  One thing that troubles me with the weight gain side effects of these antipsychotics and antidepressents is that it's a vicious circle:  you need more medication when you're heavier, and the meds make you gain more weight.

Bipolar Depression	SadinCanada, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	45-54	5/12/2011 4:29:20 PM	I did experience bloating and weight gain, I think, around the abdomen especially. It left me feeling very &quot;slow&quot;, uninspired (I am an artist and this has been difficult for me).  It immediately relieved the mania, but not the depression; that took quite a bit longer (about six months).  Other strictly anti-depressents were much faster acting relative to depression.  It (the Seroquel) also gave me nausea and a sense of apartness from others.  Maybe that was good, given how difficult a time I was having coping with others in that period,a nd that I had recently been extremely traumatized by an abusive relationship w/a former partner.  I don't think I would recommend this drug for everyone.  I think there are others that may do as well and that the pharmaceutical that manufactures/distributes it allows me to obtain the drug free-of-charge is part of why I THINK it may have been given me, rather than something else.

It gave me diabetes and almost sent me into a diabetic coma within 2 months on it. And I was only taking like 100 mg a day-the therapeutic dose for bipolar patients is 500 mg day. I do not know if a person in their 20s could take this but diabets is such a severe side effect that if it occurs with weight gain it is not woth any benefits unless you are absolutely so bipolar you are a risk to yourself and of harming others and even then this and all meds in its class are so toxic I have to wonder why the FDA would approve it--its not a terminal condition to be bipolar..and there are alternatives far safer. It also makes you so out of it its like being on methadone or heroine--its like a narcotic-i think addictive nad sedating the crap out of patients who are manic is not a solution with these side effects. Awful drug, should be banned.

Other	copslstopya, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	1	1	Male	25-34	4/24/2011 3:20:14 PM	Read the insert. This medication slowly kills you if you don't die because of its similar action to alcohol. It was just like being drunk except no euphoria. I was expelled from public venues while on this drug because the consensus was that I &quot;was drunk or on drugs&quot;. I was refused service at fast food and told the 'cops have been called&quot; because I was staggering and slurring speech. I cut and bruised myself countless times without knowing how.  I tripped and fell because I could not lift my toes when walking. All this as a man in his prime.   Being compelled to be on this drug because to refuse would have resulted in depot injections of an even more damaging and debilitating drug still has me exasperated more than a decade later. I was subjected to an injustice by being compelled to eat this poison and an insult for being billed for  the cost of the pills.  Every time I see an auto accident I wonder if this drug or some other psych med is involved.This chemical should be banned and the knowledge of it be allowed to expire from human consciousness.It effects healthy and not so healthy persons  and mammals in an identical fashion.  It has no core effect.  It is a confusing blend of side effects and produces extreme paradoxical reactions within only a few hours in some individuals.   It is carcinogenic and how a doctor sworn to &quot;do no harm&quot; could consider it for inclusion in their practice baffles me.

I was really disoriented.  Even though I took it as soon as I got home from work, I was a complete zombie until about noon. I also developed muscle rigidity and shaking; it took a couple of weeks for the doctor to figure out that it was a side effect of the drug.  To top it all off, it made my mood worse.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

I am also taking Lamictal 100 mg X3 a day, Seroquel XR X1 a day, Paxil 20 1X a day, Atarax 50mg 3X day, and Klonopin X3 a day. Seroquel and Seroquel XR helps me releax, stay calm thouughout the day without the sleepiness, dizziness, and sudden drop in Blood Pressure I had expeienced before. This drug, along with the other drugs mentioned above, has given me my life back, helped me rest, sleep and I'm NEVER without it. I know if I can take it with a Medical history, beginning Y2K, of 5 strokes, 1 heart attack, 19 heart caths, 5 stents, 1 Pulse Pacemeker, Carcimona Sin Cancer last June 2010, Parkinson's, and more, I feel very confident saying that, for me, it has been a life-changing drug. My mind is clear; I'm an Internationally- published Celebrity Photojournalist, who needs to be completely &quot;focused&quot; to continue working freelance at home part-time. I hope this will help anyone reading this comment. God bless and keep you and in the way of a suggestion, if you decide to try Seroquel, ask your doctor for a week's supply to try  it. If you are on Medicare, a month's supply of Seroquel is $6.30, a month's supply of Seroquel XR is $ 6.30. Walmart will fill your RXs and send  them to you VIA US MAIL.

Since starting I no longer have suicidal thoughts which used to be a daily thing for me. My anxiety has decreased and I finally am able to go out by myself. I used to be so nervous aboout being alone and what people were thinking when they saw me. Nothing else has been anywhere near as effective as Seroquel. My only complaint is that I take 300 mg XR at bedtime which my doctor instructed me to take at 7pm so I will be able to sleep and get drowsy around 10. I don't like having to predict when I will want to go to sleep. overall its a great drug.

My condition was mild and primarily depressed with some anxiety and OCD until trying Lexapro a few months which triggered an awful mixed episode. At first, as with almost everyone, I was started on a low dose of Seroquel, in my case to be elevated in three stages. The first two went pretty smoothly after a few days of brain fog and fatigue. I did not feel 100%, but was alot better than I had been, and started to enjoy life again. My depression was greatly alleviated and my anxiety became totally manageable.  However, I have had a very hard time dealing with the third stage of titration (still a comparably low dose considering how much some others are taking), which even after a few days I am finding too sedating and have new side effects such as a kind of pressure headache. I know it needs to be bumped up as the initial relief I have had with the lower dosages have waned a good bit. I am just really hoping I can adjust to it and get the same results consistently in the future. Also,even with insurance, this is proving to be a very costly medication. I am happy with it because it is the only med that has provided many any relief, but you may want to discuss alternatives considering its sedation and high price.

She became more agitated &amp; anxious.  After calling the dr. &amp; reporting this, the dr. advised taking her off the med.

I still have to take Ambien CR to sleep, and I don't have any &quot;hangover&quot; effect in the morning. It's balanced me out but left me a little more sad than up, so I still need more help. The biggest problem: 60 pounds weight gain with the accompanying bad changes in cholesterol, blood sugar, etc. Now working with a nutritionist b/c it's worth it for the mental health help.

I then developed nausea and couldn't eat or drink.  I lost 15 lbs. in two weeks.  I went to the ER three times and each time they changed my anxiety meds.  I ended up knowing I had to try something else.  I am a nurse and I called our mental health facility.  They told me to come in and after an extensive interview, I was admitted for four days.  They stopped my meds and put me back on Effexor, but Klonopin for anxiety and added Seroquel 100mg.  The first night after I took it and went to bed, I felt a burning in my shoulders.  This is often related to my anxiety episodes so I figured the new meds weren't going to work.  Next thing I knew I felt this wonderful peace come over me and I slept like a baby.  After three days the nurses said,&quot;You're feeling better, aren't you&quot;?  And I sure was.  I took Seroquel for about a year and added talk therapy.  I did gain 20 lbs. but I had a quiet mind, didn't stress, and my life got back on track.  I eventually was able to go off of the Seroquel.

My heart began to pound, so much so, went to ER and was diagnosed with a rare heart condition. called Left post. ventr. block. Stoped taking it, and  the &quot;panic attack like symptoms stopped.

My recent concern with this medication is how high your cholesterol can go, such as mine under 200 going to 297. After 3 mths of none of the medication, sleep does not come easy so I have taken 25mgs several times versus the 200mgs a night I took in the past. Yes, I do have vivid dreams and have bitten my tongue or cheek while sleeping. Yet, we all need our body rested. A difficult dilemma to say the least.

Combat Engineer. As a result of my employemnt, I have been diagnosed with severe depression, panic and anxiety disorder and worse more so, PTSD. I have tried heaps of physco-tropics over the years, cymbalta, lexapro, zyprexa, immovane, zanex, serapax, effexor and avanza....to name a few...it has been some years! All moderate to high doses. About 3 months ago I started on 25mg of Seroquel and am now on 100mg. I can't believe how good this drug is. NO SUICIDAL thoughts, perfect sleep, no wierd dreams (although some are so REAL), so relaxed during the day and best of all, they ARE NOT benzo's.......I would highly recommend Seroquel, not to anybody, but by trial and error as it worked for me. We are ALL different so please don't give up. Keep smiling mate...xxx Leigh McQuade (Sydney Australia).
Other	S. Ryan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	2/4/2011 3:24:12 PM	This medication was given to my mother-in-law for anxiety.  When the commercial says &quot;uncontrollable muscle movement&quot; you better believe it.  She became totally incoherent and had muscle movement similar to severe cerebral palsy. After pleading with the doctor to discontinue it's use, she had major improvement but still had strange facial movements.  She was eventually admitted to a nursing home (for several reasons aside from the medication) but was never the same after her exposure to the medication.  If it works for you, go for it.  I'll never allow it to be given to anyone in my family again.  After what I've seen, it is too much of a risk.

I said that I use it to control my hypomania and that's incorrect. I'm hypermanic the majority of the time. In other words, I'm usually &quot;bouncing off the ceiling&quot; and very, very rarely get depressed. In fact, I'm only on a very small amt. of Remeron at bedtime for anti-depression but must take frequent, daily Xanax for non-situational anxiety due to my hypermania.

But Seroquel WORKS for me and I can already tell a difference in the short time that I've been on it this time around. I take 100 mgs. at bedtime so I don't feel buzzed all day long and am able to fully function, driving and everything. I feel at peace with myself now and I've learned from my past weight gain from it to 'nip it in the bud', not giving in to the eating urges. Instead having a diet root beer or bottle of water to fill me.I've been on SO, SO many different drugs with my hypo-mania that I've discovered that EVERY SINGLE ONE has side effects but if the benefits out way the side effects, we are blessed.

After trying Abilify, and Risperidone with no positive outcomes, my doctor recommended Seroquel. The first night I took it, I couldn't even speak a complete sentence. I felt like a zombie for a week straight and then my body got more regulated to the medication. Now, I do sleep through the night, but I have NO sex drive, no bubbly in my personality, my mouth is dry, and I'm always ready for a nap. I have gained 20 lbs since I started on this medication and my boyfriend has had it with these negative changes I've gone through. I feel faint when I stand up and have had diarreah on and off for the 4 month period I've been on this drug. I plan to get off of it ASAP!
Bipolar Depression	Hoper, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	19-24	1/13/2011 2:06:25 AM	Ok First off medication alone won't &quot;cure&quot; you. You have to actually try for more than a week. I take Seroquel XR and haven't seen any reviews for that yet. It is only my second night taking it and I can feel myself stabilizing for the first time in years! Yet the over sleeping sucks but being bipolar mixed, I'm used to it! So you just have to accept it and work on yourself! And also weight gain is a big thing with depression too! So really if you get your butt up and be active I am sure you can conquer that, Plus everyone is different. My experience so far is dry mouth and oversleeping. I would love to hear from those around 18-30 in my range that are on XR. I am working my way day by day to 300 mg. So far on 100. God Bless

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	MSQUEEN1997, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	12/16/2010 8:16:04 AM	For the past four months, I have been taking Seroquel (600 mg.) and Effexor (300 mg.) for severe depression and anxiety. I have been on Effexor for five years, which began with 75 mg. was increased to 150 mg, and then to 225 mg. before beginning the Seroquel. Once I started this one, the Effexor was bumped up to 300 mg. Since beginning this high dose combination, I have gained 26 lbs., began chewing the skin on my fingers (nervousness), have vivid nightmares, constant sweating, dizzy spells, loss of memory, itchiness, sleepiness, losing my chain-of-thought in the middle of a sentence, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations. On one occasion, I passed out in the bathroom, and woke up in a fog  wondering how and why I was in the floor. While the severity of the depression, anxiety (and muscular pain from Fibromyalgia) has lessened, I continue to have little interest in getting out of bed, leaving home, interacting with others, and driving. In the past, I have tried other medications for depression (e.g., Prozac, Celexa, and Cymbalta), and did not have as many issues. I took Prozac for about six years and only experienced talking excessively. With the Celexa and Cymbalta, I experienced insomnia and continued having episodes of depression and anxiety, but not as severe as I had when I did not take any medication. With the symptoms I am having with this current combination, I am not sure which medications will work for me, but I plan to consult my doctor about a few of the medications some of you mentioned (i.e., Abilify, Remeron, and Lamictil). Also, I have a prosthetic heart valve and the last thing I need is an increase in the symptoms I am having with the Seroquel!!

He didn't start to get better until he took Depakote.  Now the Depakote is going up and the Seroquel is going down.  If you have BP - I suggest a moodstabilizer first.

At first I saw double and slept like the dead. I would bump into walls after taking it, so I took it right before I went to bed and had no difficulty. I had somewhat of a hangover in the mornings, but that went away after 10 - 15 minutes of being up and about. But I felt better in a few days, better still in a couple of weeks. After a week or two, I adjusted to it and felt no side effects except a little morning hangover. Small price to pay for sanity. This can be a great med for many people. I'm bipolar II, rapid cycling with 3 suicide attempts. It was like magic for me. Ride out the initial side effects.

I was perscribed many different drugs, but this is the ONLY one that works for me.  No more suicide attempts and my moods are much more stable.  It does have some side effects but if you can learn how to work with them, they aren't an issue.  I've never ever been able to sleep at night, but an hour after taking Seroquel, I'm out.  I love it.  It did cause me to gain 30lbs, but once I fought through the cravings, I was fine.  Lost all the extra weight and my diet is back to normal.  Since I take it at night and it knocks me out, I know I need to get at least six hours of sleep or I get the &quot;hangover&quot; effect in the morning.  The only thing I don't like about it is that I get ripped from my sleep at least once a night.  Nightmares, but the racing heart is a little scary.  It goes away within a minute or so of me waking.  Then I'm back to sleep without any problems.  I don't mind the nightmares.  It's better then spending weeks at a time in Psychiatric care.  So yeah, I love it.

My depression lifted as I didn't obsessively think BUT that was because I felt like I had smoked a bag of pot. I had every side effect listed including the serious ones. It took me forever to choose things in the store and my vision was blurred. I couldn't drive and would forgetwhat I was talking about or if I had something on the stove. I went back to Lamictal as it worked for everything else I needed it for. I just think too much.

He was a complete zombie, slept all the time. His personality changed. He was not himself at all, he did things that he never would have done. He doesn't remember most of the things that he did while on this medication. Worst medication ever. The only good effects were weight gain, he is very thin naturally &amp; has trouble gaining weight, and that his cravings to drink had subsided.

Eye glass prescription had to be changed to bifocals ( previously had 20-20 vision.  Caused confusion. And weight gain.  I do not recommend this drug to any one.  Seroquel is known to be sedative like with and represses inhibitions.  It causes a mental fog where unable to make sound decisions.  Seroquel can induce hallucinations and paranoia.

I am still suffering from insomnia, I was tired, but the anxiety was far more overwhelming than the tiredness. It did allow me to become drowsy, but I was still depressed, worsened now by the feeling of never being able to sleep. My anxiety, depression and insomnia were not helped with this at all. I have found myself more willing to lay around than to move. The thought of eating doesn't appeal to me, causing weight loss. I have short term memory problems. Muscle cramps, eye twitching and increased dry mouth, fatigue and general lack of interest are the side effects that are kicking my back side now. It may work for some, but not for me. UGH!

My Dr wants to increase it til I get to 200mg daily. Problem that I am having is that at 100mg daily, I am sleeping til noon and have become very lathargic and have lost so much of my motivation. Before taking Seroquel, I worked from morning til I went to bed never stopping. I was always in a state of being very manic. I take it with 200mg of Zoloft daily. If I am this lathargic at 100mg of Seroquel, what am I going to be like at 200mg? I'm very worried about it. I don't see my Dr for another month but in the meantime, I took it upon myself to drop the dosage down to 75m daily. I came to WebMD hoping to find a list of side effects from Seroquel but so far haven't seen any.

I must admit I don't take it every night as I was told because of the feeling out of it effect it has on me the next day and days after that.  Actually though I must admit I do feel just a little calm but wonder if my feeling out of it days afterwards is worth it. Now I'm wondering if I should just not take it at all because I just read on this web site (that I trust) that persons with heart failure shouldn't take it.  If I don't take it then I'm not &quot;complying.&quot;

At first I would fall asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow, but after a while I built up a tolerance. While on the drug I gained 90lbs. I would continuously eat while in a state that was inbetween consciousness and being asleep.  I would also wake up in the morning feeling incredibly drowsy.  At one point it was so bad that my doc had to prescribe a narcolepsy drug to keep me awake.  It might have helped my depression, but it was. pretty hard to tell with everything else going on

I have suffered  severe OCD for decades. I did not expect the seroquel to help the OCD. OMG!!!  For the first time in decades my OCD is under control. I asked my psychiatrist if this could be true and he said yes. First I tried 400mg and it helped my bipolar a little but I still had nagging depression. My doctor increased it to 600 mg a day. At this dose I was 99% free of my OCD. I am a nurse and need to concentrate on work and not be distracted by my OCD. I know seroquel has possible side effects like, diabetes, high cholesterol, cataracts, but you know I really don't care. I want to live for today and be happy.

Im not very happy that she prescribed this to me.  Every side effect they listed, I had it.  Hot flashes, cold sweats, constipation, anxiety, joint pain (I couldn't move) tighten muscles, flu symptoms, and more.  I noticed on and off tingling at the bridge of my nose.  Guess it doesn't shock me with this type of drug.  I only had taken it for 6 days.  Dealing with the withdrawls were aweful.  Glad I have an appt with her on tues.  In the mean time I've been dealing with neck,back, shoulder problems from whiplash.  I swear this drug made me rebound, Im back to feeling miserable again.  This should be something they give to prisoners on a daily basis, not me.  I just had a little stress in my life, that was about all.  Looking back at it after taking 50mg of it for 6 days.  I'd rather just deal with it, and have myself normal again.  I feel almost tramatised from Seroquel.

Years ago my son was prescribed this due to bi-polar, ADHD symptoms.  He was eventually on 325 mg a day.  He was a walking zombie and had no quality of life.  So he ended up coming off of it.  He hasn't been the same since.  On another note my doctor prescribed it for me and reluctantly I tried it.  I had extreme insominia...  This has helped me tremendously on 25 mg.  I can't imagne what my son was dealing with on 325 mg.

My doctor gradually increased my dose to 800mg as it didn't seem to be helping.  Shortly after beginning this medication, I started having severe panic attacks after taking my dose at bedtime.  They were so disturbing that I decreased my dose and then stopped taking it altogether.  At night my heart rate would increase, and I would feel like I was being dragged into a deep, dark coma against my will.  Sometimes I experienced mild hallucinations, which were frightening.  I will say that in general Seroquel did &quot;take the edge off&quot; of my emotional episodes, but the improvement was negligible and not worth the side effects.

It was effective as far as helping me sleep and mood swings.  However, I put on over 20 pounds in less than a month.  I went to the doc and they had me get on the scale and I thought that it had to be wrong, but then I went to my other doc and the scale said the same thing.  I was not happy at all!  I have a weight problem to begin with, I don't need any extra help.  The person that prescribed this med to me was NOT my doc.  My doc was out on an emergency with another patient and I had to see this other doc.  My doc was VERY upset that I was put on the meds and took me off them at my last appointment.  I would NOT suggest this med to people with a weight problem or have the potential for a weight problem.

After eight days, I suffered uncontrollable shaking, and I couldn't walk. I took an ambulance to the hospital, where I was given tests, including ultrasounds, a heart cath, and an MRI. It was all ok. I also have occasional A Fib, and my heart was also in A Fib. After three days, the shaking was gone, the A Fib was gone, and I returned home. The doctors at the Hospital took me off the Buspar. That was three weeks ago. I have had several A Fib incidents, and have been in and out of rhythm. I have occasional weakness and dizziness. But I have always had a sleep problem, but it has allowed me to sleep. I don't know if I should report the weakness to my doctor. The A Fib happens everytime I get the slightest bit upset or bothered. Before this period, I suffered A Fib only three times in four years. It has now happened four times in the past week. I am 74 years old.

He has had several strokes, heart valve replacement, and was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2005. He can't work anymore because of his eyesight from the MS. He also cannot drive anymore so the only time he gets out of the house is when I take him somewhere. He was acting like a 2 year old and throwing tantrums so his doctor recommended Seroquel to keep his moods level and to help with his depression. Who wouldn't be depressed if disabled and had to rely on others so much? This med has really evened out his moods and works great for him. He sleeps better at night than he has in a long time. No side effects.
Manic-Depression	7-12 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	7-12	8/16/2010 8:59:09 AM	My 7yr granddaughter,whom we have been raising since the age of 5 mths,has been on this medication for Bi-Poler Mania almost 3 years now with great results,although a slight weight gain,just watching her carbs &amp; sugar intake keeps that under control.She is SO much calmer.where at first she would &quot;rage&quot; to the point of picking up a 2 wheel bike @ age 4 &amp; throwing it about 10 ft,she would bite herself &amp; others even bringing blood at times.The rages would become SO bad that even applying &quot;passive&quot; restraint(as told by psychologist)was almost impossible even though we outweigh her by 100#.Now she is a straight A student in the 2nd grade &amp; her teachers are amazed at the results &amp; the difference in her ability to concentrate much much better.she sleeps through the night without any sluggishness or grogginess the next morning.Her self control is allot better for her to do,she's able to &quot;think&quot; before she reacts where before she wasn't able to,She is in NO way a &quot;zombie&quot; at any time throughout the day.She takes 50mg at noon &amp; 100 mg at bedtime (8pm)along with Concerta ER 36 mg(in the am for ADHD).I am in NO means saying that every adult or every child will have these same results,but for our granddaughter &amp; for us,Seroquel,along with therapy has been a life saver.It is my hope that more people that have Bi-Polar Mania will be able to find relief &amp; control over their lives with whatever their Dr's medicine regimen may be.God Bless
Bipolar Depression	suzie2673, 65-74 (Patient) 	2	4	4		65-74	8/15/2010 11:30:39 PM	I have been on it about 6 mnths. My heart has never given me trouble and I always had low blood pressure, but was diagnosed two weeks ago with high blood pressure &amp; high cholestral.  I have also noticed a fast heart beat when going to bed.I hate to go off of it as I used to be dependent on Abien for 5 years which was becoming dangerous.  The seroquel along with taking care of bypolar has a side effect of sleep, which as normal and pleasant as an insomniac never has. Is there any way with treatment of heart problems successfully will alow me to continue with this med?  The only other bypolar med I take is 150 mg of effexor.  Please give advice - I go to the doctor this Friday for my monthly med.check. How can I get an answer from web

From the first day that Seroquel was in my system I noticed a dramatic difference in my lifelong inability to sleep deeply and continuously.   It is the only drug I have been prescribed that effectively prevents the chronic sleep deprivation that has triggered mood swings.

I am a non- insulin dependent type 2 diabetic.  It raised my blood sugar to 450!  Also it caused severe anxiety and actually made my skin on my back feel creepy crawly, also VERY sleepy ALL the time.  I was only on it for about 2 weeks and my doctor took me off of it.  It must work for some people or it wouldn't be here but just be careful if you are a diabetic or prone to anxiety.  It makes no sense to me that a drug can cause anxiety and drowsiness at the same time as they are opposite reactions but I had both!

I gained nearly 60 pounds while on it in less than a year. I swiftly went off of it and went onto Risperdal and never looked back. Although I did gain more weight on Risperdal but not from eating in my sleep, just because that medicine makes you gain weight, too.

I was experiencing very bad agoraphobia after a near death experience. So I went to a shrink who turned out to be a massive quack and he diagnosed me with bipolar disorder (which I don't have). I gained about 30lbs in less than 2 months but was able to sleep (I have insomnia). I think I was taking 100mg and unfortunately after stopping the medicine went back on it because of my insomnia and the fact that nothing works for it. I now have weaned myself down to about 25mg a night. But I have experienced : weight gain, excessive thirst and urination, high cholestrol, blurred vision, dizziness even while sitting, close to blacking out while driving, neuropathy in hands and feet, massive brain fog, memory loss etc. Unfortunately I do not sleep AT ALL without taking this medicine. I have tried every medicine out there and nothing works for my insomnia. Went months without taking it and was extremely sick and in and out of hospital from lack of sleep. I want off this medicine before it kills me but the lack of sleep will kill me too. Please do not start taking this medicine do whatever it takes to never take this drug it will ruin your life. I once was intelligent but now I have so much brain fog that I can barely spell or remember simple words. Not too mention dizziness, neuropathy, weight gain, blurred vision etc.Works great for insomnia but not worth it. Do not take it!!!

Works pretty good for sleep if you aren't considering the side effects. After a year of taking it, I started gaining weight. I gained about 30 pounds. It also makes me irritable when the medicine starts to kick in. Like I HAVE to go to sleep right when it kicks in or I get really mad and start crying. You feel very drugged when the medicine starts working.But it does help you fall asleep fast, sleep through the night, and wake up without feeling groggy.Getting off this pill as soon as I can.

Bipolar Depression	Riga, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	7/3/2010 7:08:02 AM	Seroquel worked wonders once when I was experiencing a consistent feeling of unreality for days. The very next day I began to feel at home in the world, not anxious or depressed.  However, as soon as the drug started to take effect (I took it at night), I would be so dizzy I couldn't walk without holding on to furniture.  I would fall asleep anywhere--on the floor of the closet while looking for something in a box, on the floor on my exercise mat, standing up in the kitchen drinking a cup of coffee.  I'd wake up when the coffee spilled or I started to fall (if I was standing up), but I had a horrible experience waking up on the floor of the closet covered in clothing that had fallen on top of me, not being able to remember where I might be--it was pitch black, I was covered in something--was I in hell?  I didn't think I was dead but I was terrified until I crawled out of the closet and realized I was in my bedroom.  My husband would find me sleeping on the floor all over the house.  So, I went down on the dose. Still had side effects (less though)and it didn't work as a sleeping pill for me. Right now I'm trying not to take it until I need it again.  It is a VERY effective drug but side effects are surreal.
Other	Southern Lady, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	6/30/2010 2:26:44 PM	I started taking Seroquel four year ago to treat severe insomnia.  I started taking 350 mg.  After two months of hardly any sleep and feeling &quot;homocidal&quot;, this drug finally got me the sleep I needed.  However, as with others who have written, I would get the &quot;munchies&quot; within 1/2 hour of taking it and gained weight.  I also feel like a zombie in the mornings unless I get about 10 hours of sleep.  Over time, I whittled down the amount of dosage little by little.  I am now taking somewhere between 35-38 or so mg. (I cut the pills with a pill cutter).  This is the least I can use without disrupting my sleep. I still have trouble getting up early (less than 8 hours) in the morning.  The way I resolve the &quot;feeding frenzy&quot;  I take the Seroquel within 10 minutes of going to bed before the &quot;munchies&quot; kick in.  I eventually want to get off the drug all together because you know the damage presdcription drugs can do to the kidneys. &quot;less is more&quot; in this case, which is why I reduced the amount of dosage.  For those using Seroquel just for insomnia, experiment with dosage reduction and go to bed directly after taking it to avoid overeating/raiding the fridge and gorging (yes....I did it and gained 25 pounds.....trying to work it off).

Fortunately and unfortunately Seroquel has been the one drug of all of them that has actually made me feel depression free!  The problem and I do mean problem is that I have put about 60lbs!!  I am 5'3 and that is a lot of weight for me to lug along.  All my joints are killing me from the weight gain.My easting habits have gotten very peculiar.  I eat really only one sit down actual meal per day and then I spend the rest of the day eating frozen blueberries, fat free frozen yogurt, and popcorn until I am sick!!!I fear I will have to give up the mental sanity that I have finally found because the weight is unhealthy and causing me such a self esteem problem that I can't really leave my house for fear of seeing someone I know!!Anyone out the have any comments or advice?

This was an &quot;after hours party&quot; where my son and others had been drinking heavily.  Unfortunately when my son said he needed help nobody helped him and he died, 6 months ago today.

After not being able to sleep for days at a time it is a god send as 1 hour after taking 200mg I can fall asleep almost every time.

I take it in combination with Lithium and Lamictal.. I love the seroquel. The only side effect I noticed is the weight gain. Have found that any anti-psychotic med causes weight gain. I get good sleep every night, have no problems waking up and have been very pleased with the results. About 2 times a yr I cycle and my dosage has to be adjusted, my depression is nothing more than a blue day occasionally and my mixed manic swings are almost non-existant...Seroquel is extremly expensive...am waiting on the generic!

I took my first dosage in the morning before work. At work, I became very dizzy and hoped that it would subside. I completely fell out-fainted but did not lose consciousness after feeling dizzy. Then I started suffering from rapid heartbeat and my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest. The Medic was so scared for me-as soon as he listened to my heart he said you are going to the hospital I do not like the sound of your heart. If that wasn't scary enough I became convinced I was going to die panicked in the ambulance begging this medic to not let me die as I had never felt my heart do the things it was doing. I was put on a EKG and given charcoal solution to drink I guess to soak up rest of drug in my system. That was only on 1 pill-100mg-I basically overdosed on the medicine that I was prescribed. It was the most awful experience of my life. I would never recommend this medicine to anyone.

But if you start having neg effects they are most likely only going to get worse. This cured my anxiety/panic attacks @ a low dose of 150 mg. My psychiatrist raised it to 400 mg and w/in a week I lost control of every party of my body and the side effects outweighed my anxiety/panic attacks. Massive twitching and muscle spasms from my face down to my ankles, I couldn't make my eyes stop moving and I was starting to see things jump and things that were not there, foggy mind, slurring and stuttering speach, hot and cold flashes, cold sweat, I did not feel more hungry but I never felt full so I ate all the time, tingling from face to legs, my mind was not sharp (I had trouble even remembering simple words and barely was able to finish a complete sentence), forgetfulness, constipation (had to see gastrointerologist b/c I wouldn't have bowel movements for a week @ time..very painful), anxiety b/c of my fear of the side effects...I never understod how a med could make someone feel like they're dying but I was experiencing all these symptoms @ one time and it became unbearable. Withdrawal symptoms are just as unbearable as the side effects. Simply put, Seroquel made me feel like every part of my body and brain was going through retardation.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started on Seroquel.  Within a week I felt like a different person, constantly in a fog.  And good god, the sleeping...I slept CONSTANTLY.  When I took the first dose, I got up once to use the bathroom, and other than that slept for 30 something hours.  I gave it time for the side effects to wear down and continuously slept for at least 14-16 hours a day until I stopped taking the medication.  Also, I gained over 40 pounds in 4 months while I took it.  I felt hungry constantly.  It helped with my depression and bipolar at first, but after a month or so, what good effects it had wore down.  Before taking this I could've been considered a nymphomaniac (an effect of bipolar, I know), but this medication made me lose ALL interest in sex.  And this has become a long-term problem.Also, DO NOT GO OFF THIS MEDICATION WITHOUT TAPERING OFF WITH HELP FROM YOUR DOCTOR.  I could no longer afford it, so instead of paying attention and tapering off of it, I just stopped.  I was sick for days.  Felt horrible mentally and threw up constantly.  This medication may help some but it was absolutely horrible for me.  If you have issues with it, talk to your doctor instead of thinking the effects will go away.

It was prescribed for me to take at night to sleep.  On top of 4 other meds for bi-polar depression.  Although it did allow me to sleep, when i finally got to sleep, my husband hated it because it made me a zombie (400mg).  The weight gain is OUT OF CONTROL!!!!!  I have adjusted all medication over the coarse of the years but gaining weight like I have only increased my depression and I isolated myself because of the way I look.  Just be careful, if you start gaining alot of weight.. try new things..holistic things..anything at all but this drug!

I m on 200 mg at night with 3 mg of Xanax. My Dr.s tried everything and I suffered for 3 yrs until they put me on Seroquel. It started to work for me in 2 days. But, I was only on 50mg and now Im up to 200mg. It truely saved my life. I was to the point that I was going to kill myself. I would go days without sleeping and wouldn't answer the phone, go to work. I just increased my Xanax last night and Im going to reduce my Seroquel down to 100 mg tonight. I need to reduce the amount of meds I take at night because it takes me over 2 hours in the morning just to get out of the fog Im in. I don't know if its addictive like the Xanax. I hope its not. I can't sleep without the Xanax, and I know Im addicted to them. But my life is SO much better now that I don't care if Im addicted

Good combo of drugs.  However, Seroquel's side effects are considerable.  They are manageable, but you have to put in some effort--get blood tests to check your thyroid and cholesterol and fats, eat really healthy and work out or you will gain weight, schedule your days so you can always get 9-10 hours of sleep even if you have to go to bed by 8pm.  The heart palpitations don't hit me if I stay in bed once I take it--the palpitations only show up if I try to fight through the drowsiness to move around, so I just plan to be in bed for 10 hours.  It's a question of what you're willing to put up with to be stable emotionally.  Bipolar made my life hell, as long as I could remember, and for the first time, I've been stable for more than a few weeks at a time.  2 good years and counting.

A decade ago, I was involved in a very traumatic experience that sent me into a downward spiral. I was diagnosed with acute clinical depression with PTSD and Anxiety. After trying every single anti-depressant out there with no improvement and some worsening the conditions, I finally got on Pristiq. It helped a lot but I still suffered from mood swings occasionally and insomnia every night. My dr prescribed Seroquel. I am much more calm. I was on 300mg but have gone down to 200mg. I take it at night. At first, it knocked me out almost immediately and I slept through the night. After being on it for over a year, it's not as effective at helping me fall asleep but once I am asleep, I stay asleep. However, there is a HUGE side effect that I've suffered greatly from and that is weight gain. I've gained 45lbs since being on it. When I would take it, I would develop the munchies identical to those you get when you're under the influence of alcohol or marijuana. The desire for food is too hard for me to fight. However, I am a food addict so I am sure this plays a lot into my problem with not being able to control myself when I get the &quot;hungries&quot; this drug causes. Other than that, I've had no other side effects besides daytime sleepiness but it usually wears off once I get going. As well as this drug has worked for me, I now have diabetes and am morbidly obese so I plan on switching the drugs around. I recommend this drug to anyone who is NOT a food addict and needs a boost to their antidepressant and help sleeping at night. Try to stay at the lowest effective dose you can to minimize side effects. Wish me luck! I am going to switch to abilify and try ambien or lunesta again, even though they haven't been that helpful in the past.

After two-three months of being on the medication I started to realize that I was having a hard time fitting into my clothes.  I hadnt changed my eating habits, but when I when to my psychiatrist I asked to have my weight taken and I had gained 32 lbs in less than 3 months!  I was on Seroquel and then tried Seroquel XR to try to relieve the weight gain but unfortunately I had to switch medications because the weight gain was a steady gain.  I would monitor your weight closely while on this medication.

Its making me lose weight in my breasts and its making my hair fall out, BADLY. I was having uncontrollable movements in my lips and mouth. I was waking up just as tired as I was before I went to sleep that night and sometimes I would sleep for 4 hours, to 14 hours and would still be tired. I would stand up and black out.

I started on 800mg and am down to 600mg.  only downside is that if I miss a dose, I am very physically ill the next day (vomit, sweats, etc).  Works well as long as you really need it.  Nuvigil has helped me not be a zombie after taking it.

From the beginning it was a horror. Extreme panic attacks mostly. I told me doc about the side-effects. I told her I stopped taking it on my own, she then replied &quot;I think you need a higher dosage.&quot; So I tried the higher dose and it made the side-effects much worse. I stopped taking this stuff, see a different doctor who put me on Effexor 150mg a day. What a difference, now I'm feeling great with no side-effects. Word to the wise: Don't trust all medications or all doctors.

Seroquel gave me my life back.  I can again hold down a challenging job, be an effective parent, and sleep like a baby.It made me extremely tired at first, but that faded after the first two weeks.  The dreams I experience on this med are amazing.  Very vivid and detailed.Like others here have mentioned, it makes me crave sweets like there is no tomorrow.  I gained 8 pounds the first month, then realized what was happening and stopped giving into the cravings.Overall, Seroquel is my own personal miracle drug.  I've seen several people mention that Seroquel has abuse potential.  The only recreational value I can imagine would be to use it as a sleep aid.

I have been unable to sleep through the night for 2 years.  Yes! I got the greatest soundest sleep ever but....I gained 30 lbs in 3 weeks.  I would find myself up in the early morning hours eating...anything...especially sweets and pastries.  I eliminated all of this binge food and ended up binging on oatmeal with tons of brown sugar.  I felt tired all through the day.  Never very alert.  I hated to give up the sound sleep, but my already overweight body could not handle more weight to bare.  I am no longer on seroquel and the weight gain and early morning binging has stopped.

He stole and hoarded food due to increased appetiate. He was mad all the time. On the pos he was focused, did all his work in school, and was getting great reviews from his teachers. However, all the positives were not worth all the negatives!!!! In 2wks, the meds had lost effeciveness. The doc uped the dose. That's when things went medically horriable. Agian, this is also when he was doing so well in school as a zombie, but medicaly he was suffering. He started stealing and hoarding food from increased appetite. He gained 20lbs and went up 2 pants sizes in 3wks. His peditrian told me it was having an affect on his heart and overall health. That it's not safe or recommended for someone little and young to gain that much weight that fast. When i told his med doc, he was discussed w me. I told him i wanted my son off sequel immediately!!!! In less than 3 days my son stopped stealing and hoarding food. He wasn't mad all the time. He's been off the med now for about 3 wks. He's still hasn't lost all the weight he put on due to sequel, but he is loosing it slowly. Which his ped says is a much healthier way to do it. His heart is not nearly as stressed and he's no longer a zombie.

First starting it was a lil rough just because you do feel really tired for a couple weeks, but nothing to bad. Especially in comparison to how I was feeling. I was getting panic attacks on a daily basis, and then crashing hard into depression. I started at 50 mg 1 x a day, now I take 400mg 2 x a day and have been very even. Of course there are ups and downs.. as life does throw us curve balls here and there. But I have felt able to cope with them. I also take Zoloft for depression, that combo has worked out really good for me. I am thinking about adding lithium to my regime just because I am now starting to have higher ups and lower lows.. maybe that will help balance things back out. All though I have had a lot of recent stresses added to my life, a little something extra would probably help me out for a short term thing. If you haven't tried it, it's worth giving a shot!

I've only been taking the drug for a week now (about 5 tablets a day) and I've already noticed severe side-effect reactions, one of the scariest being uncontrollable muscle spasms, twitches, and general restlessness (CAUTION: These abnormal muscle movements can become permanent if Seroquel is not stopped quickly!). I've also noticed/experienced a constant need to move my legs (restless leg syndrome), shakiness in my movements and voice, dry-mouth, increased temperature/fever immediately after taking, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), mental/mood changes (e.g., increased anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts).PLEASE, SERIOUSLY SPEND SOME TIME CONSIDERING THESE SIDE EFFECTS I HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE. From what I have read, some of these side effects can even be PERMANENT. I hope a week wasn't enough time to have irreversibly damaged my system.

If you mistakingly take a dose when you don't intend to find a place to sleep you're going to need it. I take 300mg@ bedtime w/2mg of lorazepam to shut everything off and I can sleep the night through without the side effects of most of the other sleepers

I was told it would help my depression.  I am also on lamictal and lithium.  I feel like the serequel helped to lift my depression which was very good but I have also gained 10 pounds in one month despite working out and dieting.  I will be asking my doctor to go off of this medication tomorrow so that I can hopefully get back to my healthy weight.

At first it made me sleep for days on end, on half a tablet (100 mg). Now I take 600 mg a night. I cannot sleep without it. If I run out, it usually takes 3 or 4 days of non sleep before I can get a couple hours in.  It takes about an hour for me to completely wake up in the morning, but I wouldnt trade this medication for anything.  I  have tried so many different sleep meds and this is the only one that has been effective for me.  The only draw back to it, is its cost.

I was a mess, hadnt slept in months, manic right to the edge. Then we found Seroquel.  From the 1st 25 mg dose, I felt different. I worked slowly up to 150, didnt like the effects at that dose and went down to 100 mgs. Doc and I agree that sometimes the dose needs to be adjusted to help me cope with stress (which brings on the MANIC MONSTER) but lower dose is usually good for all.  And it allows me to practice other coping techniques. So I watch what I eat, control the carb cravings with health snacks and get my 8 hours.  I would rather deal with the side effects than live like a lunatic on the fringe.  
Bipolar Depression	Aunt Freda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	3/25/2010 1:15:32 AM	Seroquel lowered my blood pressure so much I had to stay in the hospital 8 days.  My blood pressure hovered around 60 over 40.  I kept losing my vision, falling down, heard buzzing or ringing sounds, slurred my speach.It was terrifying.  I had taken seroquel for a couple of years before having the acute adverse reaction.  I also became so sleepy I would sleep for two or three days at a time.  When I finally stopped taking it I lost 35lbs.  I believe that the medication has very long term effects on my brain.  I haven't taken it in three months now and I still feel foggier and more stupid than I used to be.My memory seems to be permanently changed.  I cannot remember as well as I used to before taking this drug.Physicians are prescribing it to large numbers of patients now.  I think there will be a large population of people who are less intelligent than they were prior to taking the drug.Also, there is no cure for hypotension.  So, if you get it like I did, you are just plain screwed.  Spend time considering these side effects.  I think they may be permanent.

I did have a hard time being alert on it. My dose gradually increased over time and added lamictal to it. I was taking 200mg  in the morning 200 in the afternoon and 400 at bed time. This medication worked very well however the side effects were not worth it all it made me gain weight but the problem came when I had my blood drawn and we were able to see what was going on inside  this medication raised my cholesterol messed up my sugar and my thyroid. The only good news I have after being off it for a year everything is almost back to normal. If you are taking this medication you should have blood work done on a regular basis

The only reason for one star is that if you are diabetic DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.  Don't get me wrong it works well but it did take some time to get used to it (out of body feeling, severe muscle twitches and cramps, feeling like I was not standing on the floor but rather floating).  Then after taking it for about a year developed HIGH cholesterol (651) and OFF THE SCALE  triglycerides (over 4600 - yes 4600 - not a mistake) in blood tests at Mayo Clinic. A soon as  I stopped taking it and all went back to normal with temporary help from chol/trig meds.  By the way docs at Mayo are not allowed to give it to diabetic patients.  But it does work for mania/manic periods.

The 3rd day I couldn't stop crying and this is just off of one pill...I personally had a bad experience to the point where the day after I took the pill...I at age 25 wetted in the bed...be carefull, although medications work differently w/ everyone...now going to try abilify 2mg, if that doesn't work...pls tell me what will...I already lean on Jesus for help, but my chemical imbalance, I'm desperate to feel better for my son and my husband!

The last 10 years have been on seroquel.  The sleep is outstanding, often 10 to 12 hours daily.  However the weight gain offsets the practicality of using it.  Short term use would be very beneficial.  My weight is now 305 lbs for a 6 foot person,  making me ineligible for practical health care insurance.

It helps me sleep...which was a very big problem...however, I have gained 25lbs. I thought the munchies were due to quitting smoking. But, now that I have read many reviews here I am convinced it is the medication. I would love to be off of it but cannot go without good nights sleep...I will loose it! I have been agitated lately and figured it was again because I quit smoking..but I am rethinking that..maybe it is the medication???

Would go 80-120 days between cycles. Just read Seroquel can increase Prolactin levels, causing problems with missed/irregular periods AND difficulty getting pregnant. Would have been great to know BEFORE taking this as a 24 year old who wants to have kids. Also had other side effects which made it not worth it. Extreme fatigue in the mornings, cognitive blunting (i.e. felt like I was in early Alzheimers) never realized I don't have a horrible memory until after I stopped the medicine 3 years into it. Now my memory is completely normal! Overall it worked super well, but the side effects were not worth it.

It was being administered for on going anxiety. I started the medication with a dosage of 25mg, twice a day.  Reportedly a low dosage.  Slight nausea feeling; second day was slightly better.  But the third day in the morning I was in a serious stage of agitation, manic, frightened,  and called the doctor (a psychopharmacologist). With some discussion, he took me off the drug and increased my Klonopin intake to .5 mg 3 times a day.  This is the second day since ceasing the Seroquel and I am much better. Another doctor (my PCP) said that this medicine can work just the opposite it is supposed to.  Manic, extreme agitation, Hopelessness/deep depression.  I will keep the bottle of Seroquel and write &quot;NO&quot; on the label.  It didn't work for me.

Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	2/27/2010 3:07:31 PM	After months on end of little or no sleep and being hospitalized twice,  I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder in January of 2010 although they had been hinting at it for a few months.  My psychiatrist finally gave me lamictal in the  morning and Seroquel  100-300 mg as needed.  I have had Severe insomnia for many yrs.  racing thoughts bad behavior and increased drinking to self medicate.  Since the seroquel  I fall asleep with ease and stay asleep and most if not all of the anxiety anger and racing thoughts are gone..  I am grateful for this medicine and even my psychiatrist teared up as she realized I was getting my life back.  while I have dealt with some weight gain I am now able to get up and move to do something about it.

It is quite sedating, the effect of the sedation feeling do diminish with time. Weight gain was an issue I did not have many side effects during the time that I was taking this medication. This medication is a powerful drug and reading the FDA Caution is cause for me not taking this drug again.

That in itself has been a god send.  Being able to sleep after years of insomnia is amazing.  I am concerned about the weight gain.  Has been approx. 30 lbs over the four years.  I have a wonderful man in my life who thinks I am still beautiful, very important!!!  I worry about the blood sugar but so far so good.  I go to sleep about an hour after taking but have found a schedule that works for me.  Won't babysit my 2 yr old grandson overnight because I can't guarantee I would wake up if he did.  Getting up in the morning has become a little more difficult so will need to adust for that.  Just have to find what works for you!  I know this drug isn't for everyone, that's for sure.

One of the biggest problems was getting up and getting to work on time. I have been written up so many times. Then there is the weight gain. Over the two years I was taking it I gain over 60 lbs. I started tapering off in December and am glad to report I have lost 16 lbs. I no longer have cravings for carbs. I do feel a little more anxiety but I'm taking xanax to try to help with that. It's not the same but at least I'm no longer blowing up like a blimp. I'm happy to be off it.

This has been a fabulous medication for me, coupled with cognitive behavioral therapy.  I'm not on very much of it and I can sleep through the night, no more panic attacks, I feel &quot;normal&quot; and I no longer eat in my sleep when I'm stressed.  My whole body feels less tense.  I've been on it now for 6-8 months.  I have experienced the weight gain but I now watch what I eat and exercise more.  For me, I would rather deal with some extra weight and have a far better quality of life.

It gets worse and worse the longer I stay on it.  Although this drug does have some benefits, I think the cons outweigh the pros of it.  I seriously question why this drug is on the market, and not just because of the side effects I mentioned.

HINT-IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY TAKE THE SEROQUEL OTHER THAN BEDTIME, LAY DOWN AND SLEEP FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS.i used the ASTRO-ZENECA plan for low cost seroquel.  it gave me the seroquel for 4 months in 2009. when i called to reapply the first of the year, they denied me the drug until i spent $540 out of pocket on medication.  this is INSANE!!!!!!! i wrote to them explaining the problems of sudden withdrawal from the medication and the effects of sudden withdrawal.  ASTRO-ZENECA did not even give me the courtesy of a reply. they do not live up to their advertising of medication for those who can not pay for their medication.  thumbs down for ASTRO-ZENECA.

I would hate going to see him, for fear that he would be dead.  I have never seen him look so bad.  It was HORRIBLE!  He never left the house, sat in the dark until it was time to work, went home and did the same thing again.  I told him to get off of it.  Wean himself off for 7 days.  He wasn't happy with me, to say the least, but he knew he was a mess.  A year later, 1,500 miles away, we got a call.  His dad was DEAD.....  Coincidently, he was taking the same medication.  His parents found him, like I imagined finding my son.  But, they were not monitoring him, like I was doing for my son.  My ex's heart stopped...  He wasn't sick, no heart problems, but he was taking too much medicine, and it stopped his heart.  He was so messed up from it that he couldn't remember how many pills he had taken, and took more.  55 years old, with no health problems, and DEAD!  This medication should be BANNED imediately.  My son use to complain about how I made him &quot;STOP&quot; taking his meds.....  I haven't heard a thing since his dad died.  I know he appreciates what I did, even though he wasn't happy about it in the beginning.  If you have any other alternatives, use them.  This med is dangerous &amp; deadly.  Try medical marajuana!  I may be weird, but I believe that it is natural, and safer than anything out there.  My son refused to try it, and then last year, he did at 33 y/o.  Said it was the first time in his life he felt &quot;normal&quot;......  And I am totally against illegal drugs, more than most people.  But, I believe that natural is the way to go.  Get rid of Seroquel before it kills you!

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	1/7/2010 12:32:40 AM	I have Bipolar II and from my personal experience I do NOT recommend this medication.  I was on 400mg/day for just over 2 years, and was also taking 300mg/day of Lamictal.  At first the Seroquel was beneficial, but after a while the side effects began to greatly outweigh the positives.  It was great for putting me to sleep, and though I didn't have too much trouble waking up, I did have problems feeling awake for most of the day.  It also gave me double vision for a couple of hours mid-morning, which obviously made all activities difficult/dangerous.  I also experienced auditory hallucinations, though not intense or alarming.  I truly only noticed them once they were absent after stopping the medication.  The withdrawl was horrible.  I was constantly sick to my stomach, could barely eat, and vomited for over a month.  However, it was worth it!  I still experience mild hypomanic episodes, but not as serious previous to the Seroquel.  I still remain on the Lamictal and it has been a savior.

Now trying to get off of it. Also, lots of potential permanent health effects: tardive dyskenesia, diabetes, etc. not worth it. 
Bipolar Depression	Maggie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	1/6/2010 5:17:16 PM	This treatment was used for my racing thoughts and sleep aid.  It worked well, however I felt tired after sleeping 10-12 hours.  I took it for 6 of the 10 years I've been sick.  8 weeks ago I went off Seroquel and started using Abilify and Ambien.  I feel much better and feel rested after only 8 hours of sleep.  I have lost 14 pounds in the last 8 weeks.

I used to take regular seroquel along with my other meds an hour before bedtime but with seroquel XR this didn't work.  The doctor then said to take several hours before bedtime- still didn't do anything.  I asked to be put back on regular seroquel and back to normal.

Doctor switched me over from Ambien and prescibed the smallest dosage available. Within 1 hour of first dose I was a zombie. If my house had caught on fire or someone had broke in, I would not have been able to react what so ever! I had horribly real dreams that made me feel as if I was not sleeping at all. When my alarm clock went off, which I have never had to use before, I could not get up to turn it off for almost an hour. I have contacted my doctor's office and explained that I will never take this drug again. 16 hours later I still felt the affects of this drug. I have to function and this medication rendered me useless.

My anxiety was under control and a good side effect was easy to sleep. After about 3 years the sleep effect went away and had to and xanax to the mix to get even the minimum sleep. Seroquel is VERY expensive and the weaning in impossible. The withdrawal is horrible. I want to eliminate both seroquel and xanax but don't  know how to go about it. I ideally I need to get back to a normal sleep amount and also getting rid of seroquel. Any Ideas?
Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	1/3/2010 4:20:28 PM	3 months ago, I was very happy with my life and then all of a sudden, I couldn't sleep at night. I started having major anxiety and feeling depressed - fear got a hold of me. Sleeping aids didn't work. I started an outpatient pysch treatment program and to my surprise was diagnosed with bipolar II. I started taking Seroquel. Now I take 600 mg a night (have been increasing the dosage for almost 2 months). Helps me sleep at night, but that is the only benefit I have experienced. I feel very lethargic when I am awake, and since taking the drug, my mood has not returned to normal. Constipation and dizziness are other negative side effects I experience on this drug. I plan to start reducing my dosage immediately, so I can eventually stop taking it altogether.

Other	bubbles2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/1/2010 9:35:39 AM	I have been diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, as well as kyphoscoliosis. I have been prescribed the strongest narcotics such as fentanyl, morphine, oxycontin, etc. That just takes the edge off to where I am ablt to move. Sleeping is impossible. I was going up to almost 5 days without being able to sleep. It got to the point I felt like I was being tortured, and couldn't function with 2 children. So thank God for my psychiatrist! Where my regular doctors did nothing, he never stop trying to find something to help me. Hence, Seroquel. The 1st dose, I slept so hard! Like a baby. I woke up more refreshed I couldn't believe it. As far as people who have a drug history being prescribed this medication, I dont think they should be. I do believe it has some sedative qualities and can be sold and abused. But I have seen my psychiatrist for 5 years and knows my circumstances and doesn't just give it out like candy. He discusses the medications purpose and explains why he suggests that I try  that medication. So if someone is being given the medication and selling it, they are the ones who end up ruining it for those who really need it. Especially when it doesn't get you &quot;high&quot;.

Thankfully I got control of the situation that was causing my insomnia in the first place.(degenerative disc in my neck that was affecting my nerve roots) so I can be off this awful medication!

It has caused severe weight gain, swelling in my ankles and painful urinary retention.  I was prescribed this drug for anxiety and insomnia.  It does NOTHING for anxiety.  It does help with insmonia.

I have treatment resistant depression, and this drug has given me hope! I do feel more rested and normal. I'm only on 200 mgs. I can see why people would gain weight. I feel so much better I actually feel like eating. But with healthy food choices and using a treadmill (for the first time in 10 years) I have successfully lost weight I had gained over the years, and kept it off. Keep in mind that everyone has different brain chemicals and they change! So be patient and flexible with your meds.

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	11/19/2009 9:33:45 PM	I have been on Zoloft for over a year.  This past summer, my doctor added seroquel in addition to the zoloft. We began at 50mg. At first, it seemed to be helping. It did make me very drowsy about an hour after taking it. If I tried to fight it and stay awake, it felt like I was drunk.  Then my moods seemed to get worse.  The doctor gradually increased the dose to 300mg.  In the past 3 months, I have gained almost 30lbs.  Prior to the medication, I was hardly hungry.  Now it seems like I can't get full.  Also began cutting myself when extremely stressed.  Not sure if this was from the seroquel since I don't have a history of cutting.  I found it very difficult to wake in the morning.  I have a 19 month old child and I never hear him cry in the mornings.  It's a good thing my husband is home to hear him. Having a young family, this drug was very difficult to use.  Having to take it pretty much as soon as I got home, to make sure that I would get enough sleep to hear the alarm in the morning.  I needed to have at least 12 hours of sleep.  It's just not possible to spend time with my husband and take care of my child on this medication.  At this point, my doctor is gradually decreasing the dose and we are going to try ambilify (I think that is how to spell it).  Hopefully, it will work better for me.

Took the medication before bedtime-also told it would help me sleep at night-and had intense, realistic dreams of dying. Experienced weight gain, hard to wake in morning.  With all the drugs available this one should not be - maybe that is why there is Seroquel is being sued in class action, unless they settled already.

I am very calm and colective now.  Nothing really bothers me any longer without feeling tired or sleepy. I feel normal again without the anxiety or paranoria feeling I use to have. I take 400 miligrams before bed - sleep through the night-have rem sleep now - so it helps my fibromyalgia too. Wonderful medication.

I have taken many medications for bipolar disorder and sleep depervation, but this was the worst!! My Dr. said he could put anyone asleep and at first I was excited to be able to sleep.  I was raised every month, up to 600 mg a night.  The side effects were a night mare for my whole family, as well as myself.  I was on this medication for a little over 2 years and have been off now for about 5 years and some of the effects are still haunting me, I fear I will never be the same again.  My eyes, my memory, my sleep disorder, my physical and emotional self, are still effected by this nightmare of a drug, and I haven't seen or heard from my  husband since just before I desided to go off it. I use to look pretty good, tall and thin but now I am very heavy and threatend by type 2 diabetes.  My advise to anyone who is having trouble w/ serequil, GET OFF  i CAN ONLY HOPE AND PRAY TO GET MYSELF BACK!!!!!

I am fully functional thanks to this medicine: attending work, spending time with friends and family, maintaining a healthy romantic relationship, and volunteering in my community. That said: this drug is NOT for everyone, and you should try drugs like Zoloft, Lexapro, Effexor etc before you try this drug because the side-effects can be horrible. My side effects are dry-mouth, severe drowsiness and akathesia, a painful panic=like attack that can cause me to walk around my apartment in circles for an hour or two after I take the drug. Luckily, my doctor and I found Mirapex, an anti-Parkinson's drug, to stop these panic episodes from occurring. I take a significant dose of Mirapex before bed, when I take Seroquel, and also usually smoke a small amount of marijuana, and this has allowed me to enjoy the benefits of Seroquel without the horrible panic. If you have akathesia as a side-effect, and the drug is helping you, please try Mirapex before you give up! Finally, please note that every story in this thread is one person's personal experience - including mine! - and none of these stories are an accurate portrayal of what you will experience yourself if you try this drug. I mean this as both a warning and an encouragement; only you and your doctor can decide if this drug is right for you, and I hope our stories make you more informed in this decision. God bless.

It does cause nighttime munchies and dry mouth but otherwise I feel great.  I don't feel groggy but I think that is because of the degree of mania I was dealing with.  I have read other reviews and people need to know there are alternatives available. If you are experiencing terrible side effects you need to try a different drug or combination of drugs. Most of us have to endure being a guinea pig until the right balance of meds is found.  Hang in there &amp; you will get your life back.

After taking the 25 mg. tabs for a short time, I found myself sleeping most all of the day and when I was awake I would nod off into sleep. She told me to continue to take the drug but I went against her advice.I hated the way I felt on the drug.  I felt tired, more depressed and crazy, all i wanted to do is sleep all the time. Not recommend at all &amp; after doing research it is VERY addictive. So be careful if you do choose to take this.

Exhausted constantly, 50 lbs gained, but I guess there's something to be said for fat and happy.  HAS ANYONE NOTICED LACTATION AS A SIDE EFFECT?

Helped me to sleep at first, but after about the 6 month mark it did not help with sleep as much. Did not seem to help the paranoia and anxiety. Really, it just helped me sleep at first and stopped the racing thoughts. Caused akathisia within 1 hour of taking it at first. Close to the 1 year mark, the akathisia became persistent and lasted all day. Caused me to have an extremely unnerving feeling that I can't even begin to describe. This was usually within 1 hour of taking it, but was persistent throughout the day with a higher dose. My muscles were twitching really bad all the time.

I was on this drug for a little less than a year, and in that time, I literally could not function. Then, one day, I ended up checking myself in to a pshyciatric ward,  because of the side effects of this medicine. All at once, I could not swallow, followed by severe confusion, muscle rigidness, and psychosis. I WAS TERRIFIED to say the least. I spent two days there and was taken off the drug. After a few weeks, I started to come around and feel halfway normal again. I feel sorry for anyone who is taking this obviously harmful medication, and the fact that this product is still on the market and people are taking it, bothers me. Hope this helps someone out there.
Other	 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	3	4	3			10/26/2009 1:39:08 PM	I have been on this medication for a couple of years (300mg every night for anxiety) it was working great for awhile.  But now, for many reasons I have decided that I do not like being on the medications and decided to slowly back myself off.  So over the course of 3.5 weeks I took myself from 300mg a night to nothing.  The only problem was as soon as I started backing myself off I started getting nauseated and dizzy, and now that I am completely off I am nauseated and dizzy on off through out the day every day.  I have been off completely off 1.5 weeks now.  Has anyone else experienced this? I have always been extremely sensitive to medications side affects but I was just curious if others have experienced this as well.  Thanks.

I gained 30 lbs in no time and it was more like water weight because it was more like my whole body was swollen from my face all the way down to my feet....I had no energy at all it was hard to even get up and down out of a chair. I had chest pains constantly,dry mouth and the shakes... I could go on and on because I felt like it was literally killing me !!!! I took myself off of it because I called my Dr and she advised me to stay on it even after I told her about all the side affects I was having and there was noway I was going to do that I know my BODY and I knew I was not feeling right. After going off of it my insomnia is back but I am able to live life again and the weight dropped off without me even having to diet.... I really hope this helps anyone that is thinking about taking this medication. I would never had takin it if I would have known what it was going to do to me... I now just take something to help me sleep from my primary care Dr and that is it because I don't trust in any kind of drug that is supposed to help you but instead it henderd my life more than anyone could ever imagine !!!!!!!

It was only MODERATELY EFFECTIVE in helping me sleep and it had terrible side effects. After taking it for a week i noticed i had less of an appetite than usual and had already started to lose weight. I hallucinated and saw shadows moving across the walls, i heared voices and noises coming from both inside and outside our home. Soon i believed that someone wanted to harm myself and/or my family in some way and we were all in danger. At the end of the third week of taking Seroquel i had stopped eating altogether and i had lost almost 30 pounds. I couldn't work because i had so much anxiety and depression due mainly from extreme sleep deprivation. I was hospitalized and treated.

Other	Trying2sleep, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	25-34	10/20/2009 4:41:59 PM	Psychiatrist prescribed for sleep problems that include difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep for about 3 yrs now and getting worse (sometimes go 3 nights w/o sleep). After practicing the usual sleep hygiene recommended by regular Dr which includes breathing relaxation, no caffiene etc. I started with 25mg of Seroquel. I'm now up to 50 mg because i still wake up during the night frequently. My main problem with this drug is the fact that I need to take it no later than 9pm to get to sleep by 10:30 or so to be able to get up on time for work the next day. On Seroquel, I need at least 9 hrs of solid sleep otherwise I feel hung over the next morning. This means no late movies or other activities with friends/boyfriend unless I take it later in the evening and cut the dose which means I probably won't sleep very well. Am also concerned that I may need to increase dose the longer I'm on it. Haven't really had any side effects other than grogginess in the morning and I don't feel safe driving after taking it. Talked to my Dr about getting off eventually &amp; she said its unlikely as I have some mild generalized anxiety and possibly low seratonin levels (as many women over 30 do). Apparently Seroquel is not addicting like Ambien/Lunesta but I would eventually like to sleep on my own and hope its possible down the road. If you start Seroquel don't be surprised if at first it knocks you out for up to 15 hours (try it first on the weekend till you adjust).

My doc put me on this med in addition to citalopram that I take and I do have a know heart condition and so far Seroquel has calmed me to the point where I don't need to take my adivan's but I do still need to take my Lunesta to help me get to sleep, I still have a problem with that.  Weight gain, so far has not been bad but I was overweight to begin with.  I give this drug a 9 out of 10.  It took me about two weeks to get use to it but after that I like being me for the first time in a long time.

Bipolar Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	10/18/2009 1:46:11 AM	I had a horrible reaction to this drug! I was on it for about 3 weeks. When I got up to the 300mg pill, things started going down hill for me. I still don't remember a lot that happened when I was on the med, and I started cutting again when I was on it, sometimes with no memory of cutting myself. I had bruses from bumping into things all the time, and it was basically like being drunk and high constantly. It was not fun. The first night I took the 300mg pill I wet the bed cause I was so knocked out I couldn't wake up to go to the bathroom. I went to the doctors because I had slight whiplash from going to an amusement park (while on the med) and not being able to control my head on the roller coasters. When I was in the room my speach was slirred and when I was walking to the waiting room I had to be guided out, and I've been going to this place for years and could probably draw map of it from memory. The PA, nurse, a woman from the front desk who has known me since I was a baby, and my case worker all stopped me before going in the waiting room and told me that I needed to be off this med, because of the effect it was having on me. A different doctor perscribed it for me, and the PA called him and told him I was to taper off Seroquel right away. Getting off the med probably saved my life.

I wake up sometimes alot of times at night and sometimes I sleep &quot;all night&quot; only to wake up around 3 or 4am and not able to go back to sleep unless I take more medicine or something else that makes me sleep.

Bipolar Depression	workinggirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/9/2009 4:21:21 PM	I have been on some form of antidepressent since 1987. Despite medication, my illness grew from mild depression to a total inability to function in the '00s. Nothing worked until I was put on Seroquel. Like magic, the negative loop that ran and ran in my mind stopped. Yes, I've gained weight (it does seem to trigger late nite eating) and the restless legs sometimes drive me crazy, but I can function again. I even got a job and have been able to keep it! If this had not worked, my doctor was recommending electric shock therapy, so believe me, I am thrilled.  Having taken so many meds over the years, I am convinced that each individuals brain chemistry or whatever you want to call it is as unique as his or her DNA.  What works for me may not work for you.  Side effects that I can tolerate; you may not be able to stand.  But until my doctor tried Seroquel, I was hopeless.  The only thing that kept me from committing suicide was my dogs and not wanting to leave a mess for my family to clean up, either literally or figuratively. Oh, it is also expensive as hell, but I'd pay for it even if I didn't have insurance.  Hopefully, it will become a generic some day soon. Finally, it does make you sleep and sleep and sleep.  I've just had to adjust my life so I can allow 9-10 hours a day for sleep. It is worth it to me.

Before I begain taking it I slept maybe 2 hours a night. I started with a larger dose of 400 mg per night, but gradually reduced the dosage to 200mg per night. It has been a life saver. The only negative side effect I can tell is that I cannot lose weight very well. There could be other factors involved - but I have been told this medication could cause a problem with weight gain. I may try something else at some point in the future, but as of now sleep is more important to me.

I have changed drugs some but have been on lithium and seroquel for the majority of the time, which my diagnosis started in February 2008. The seroquel does help me sleep which is great but I can not get up the next day. I sleep 12+ hours per day and there is no way for me to have a productive life style if this continues. My original episode was considered to be manic. I get the feeling that, the doctors feel they are doing their job right if I stay sedated. This really sucks and has turned my life upside down. I am unable to finish my school work and struggle with easy tasks.

At first(on 50mg) it really helped alot with sleep. I slept throughout the night every night. But had problems waking up and feeling very groggy. After about a month my mind and body were used to it, and now at the max. dose 300mg, I still sleep well, but its almost like an all day, all night hypnotic(meaning I dont feel the need for my anxiety meds throughout the day UNLESS something really stressful arises. Its not very addictive at all, but If you go two or three days without it.. you do feel like your gonna lose it and need it.. not out of withdrawl, but because it works so dang good your mind begins to trip. It takes care of anxiety;stress;insomnia;lossof appetite;and depression. 5 in 1 drug!

I just stopped takeing it and asked for my ambien pill again. The doc gave the ambien back to me and I slept better, not great but better. If it helps you I am happy, but I did not like it for sleep.

I immediately felt loopy, drugged, and foggy.  I am generally not a very angry person, and with this drug I got irritable and down right mean.  Within 20 days, I was hospitalized with an altered mental status and was told it was a severe reaction to this drug.   To this day, I don't have a memory of much of the hospitalization.  To boot, this was my first hospitalization in my life.  I later found out that since I take an anti-hypertensive and Metformin, Seroquil is not recommended due to severe side effects.  My doctor was fully aware of all my medications and prescribed Seroquil despite this knowledge.  I have since been off Seroquil and found another doctor.  Please educate yourself before taking any drug like this.

I am not bi-polar or suffer from any other conditions that Seroquel is prescribed for. After reviewing all of the side effects as well as all of the comments from others who have used this medication, I am definitely NOT taking it and I am completely angered that my doctor would even consider putting me at risk for all of these horrible side effects! In fact, I am in the catagory of &quot;people who SHOULD NOT take this&quot; due to other health conditions I have. I would rather be awake for days on end than suffer from these serious side effects!! Patients BEWARE, your doctor's diagnosis isn't always correct nor their choice of medications to treat certain conditions. I am greatful to all of you who have posted your comment and that I have researched this drug BEFORE taking it. The danger and risks far outweigh the benefits of this drug in my opinion, but for those few of you that it may help, good, so long as you can deal with the side effects, and unfortunately, it's after you are already addicted to it and can't get away from it.

Is it Bipolar depression or major depression?  Big differences in the two.  He suggested this medication because I have failed many trials of anti-depressants.  I have been on this medication for 4 months at 300mg.  The first 2 weeks of taking this medication were a blur.  I remember being in a daze, disoriented, dizzy, and very very tired.  Ok, I gave it a few months.  The verdict, I am not impressed with its powers as a depression fighting drug.  On the other hand, I do suffer from sleep apnea and insomnia and it actually helps me fall asleep.  I take it 2 hour before bedtime, and by bedtime I am about to fall over, boy does it make you sedated, but I am no longer tossing and turning for hours before finally falling asleep.  It takes me about 15 to 20 minutes and I am out!  A good sedative for sleeping but not so much a good mood-stabilizer/anti-depressant.

I am actually schizophrenic but I haven't shared that with my mental health professional yet.  She gives me seroquel for bipolar.  MAJOR PROBLEM with weight gain, blood sugar skyrocketed, I have thyroid problem which I never had before and I now have high cholesterol.  I was taking 300 xr daily and 200 to 400 mg for sleeping.  I quit the xr completely (don't want diabetes-- sugar was 124, diabetes is 126) sugar dropped 30 points when I gave up the xr.  I currently rely on only 200 mg for sleeping.  This has me seriously worried about relapse (back in nuthouse for 16 days and maybe losing my job and subsequently, health insurance)

Anelderly doctor in Houston Tx. told me aboutthis medication.  He said that besides helping depression, it can also help some for pain.  Since I have been taking it only at night time, it has helped me to rest better, helps with my depression and nervousness.  At first I thought he was a little crazy if he thought this was going to help me since it is more of a mental disorder medication, but after giving it more time, I did notice that it was indeed helping me quite abit with my different problems including my chronic pain.  So, now I continue to take it and I realize that this elderly doctor did know what he was talking about after all.

It used to take me hours even days to overcome a mood swing, nad I now I jump right out of a bad mood w/in 20 minutes. I take about 1 to 1 1/2 hours before bedtime so I'm not as groggy in the morning. It is hard to wake up, but after I drink coffee and get going I'm fine. This medicine gives me a crazy appetitie, uncontrollable. I'm going to try Sensa to help curb the hunger and will keep you posted on whether or not it helps. I do recommend this medicine for mood swings!

This is one of the best meds. This med should be put into the drinking supply and fed to babies from birth. The long term side effects appear not as bad as the older meds. I hope.....Don't give up. also if the drugs were placed in food you wouldn't even know?give me a break or a steak near a lake while I'm still awake.

Next morning would feel light headed, feeling of being in a daze. I was tried at different milligrams, but had the same result. Taken at 25mg when I would waken I could compose myself withing an hour or so but when taken at higher mg's I would sleep 12-15 hours and have trouble waking up and left feeling &quot;groggy&quot;!I had saved a few and it worked well if I was having trouble sleeping and did not have to be alert upon awaking.

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	8/11/2009 3:50:05 PM	I've tried a lot of antidepressants over the past few years. All the drugs I've tried either didn't work or worked for a bit before they stopped working. Last week, I went to my doctor to follow-up on the Pristiq I've been taking. I told her that some days it seems to help, but other days it seems like I haven't been taking anything.  I also told her that a month or so ago, I was feeling good so I stopped taking it for about 2 weeks and felt great before I crashed. She said it could be that the drug worked its way out of my system, or it could be that I may be bipolar.  I told her that my therapist has had me tracking my moods, and she thinks I may be hypomanic.  My doctor said most people call the doctor when they are feeling down and think they're depressed, so a lot of the time, bipolar disorder gets overlooked.  She had me fill out a questionnaire, and the results showed borderline bipolar disorder. She suggested trying Seroquel. She gave me a starter pack which starts at 50mg on the first day, increases to 100mg on the second day, and goes up to 200mg on the third day.  My doctor said to take the Seroquel at night because it WILL make me drowsy.  I took my first dose (50mg) on Saturday night and woke up on Sunday in a major daze. My husband kept asking me if I was ok. By late afternoon/early evening, I wasn't in a daze anymore. I took my second dose that night (100mg) and woke up on Monday morning again in a daze. I took the morning off work because I was afraid to drive. It almost felt like I had been drinking. That night I took the third dose (200mg). I woke up today feeling very dazed, although I'm coming out of it now around 3:30. I stayed home from work today and called my doctor to see if this was a normal side effect and to ask whether it'll go away. They called me back and said the doctor is calling in a rx for Abilify instead. I hope that helps. The Seroquel has helped with my racing thoughts, but I don't think the daze I've been in is worth it.

It works really well but it does have many side effects. I gained 50 pounds and I now have Type 2 diabetes. I have to be on Seroquel regardless of the side effects. I cannot sleep without it and I am a basket case if I do not sleep. Seroquel is extremely expensive if you do not have insurance. It costs around $750 for 60 pills a month without insurance. And please if you take Seroquel at night, don't get out of the bed because it will make your heart race, which can be scary. I take them only at night and when you get used to Seroquel it gets easier to function. Now, if you start to eat more than usual try stopping by taking a appetite suppressant or try to beat the cravings by eating vegetables. Otherwise, I can't function without Seroquel.

Great concentration and creativity. At higher doses it turns into a nightmare,hyperness,trouble sleeping,wierd thoughts.I have tried many different drugs none worked as well but this drug by far is the most dose sensitive of anything i have taken. Less is more and i wish they made it in 5mg tabs. Im tired of cutting 25mg tabs. I also take 100mgs of lithium and 0.5 mgs of clonazapam daily.I am at my best with my small but regular dose of seroquil.Want to learn how to know if your taking too much or not enough of your meds? Drink alot of water every day. if you feel better after the water, slightly reduce your dose. If you feel worse after alot of water, increase dose.this works with all meds.Dont keep taking anything that doesnt help you,switch to another drug or docter. NEVER EVER QUIT ANYTHING COLD TURKEY.Switch or gradually reduce.

Prescribed the 100mg-2xbedtime for sleep and mood stabilizer. Fell asleep fast, but would sleep at least 12hrs. I would feel sluggish after I awoke in the a.m. Gained weight and kept gaining. Went off of it for a while, but had to get back on it because of terrible mood swings, violence. Started back on it at a lower dose of 50mg. Recently switched from Seroquel to Risperdal because of the weight issues and this weirdness with demonic attacks....no kidding. I don't drink or do drugs. Didn't realize it was the Seroquel til I stopped taking it. Might've been interaction w/other medications, cause no doc or review has ever brought up evil spirits or anything. I don't want to ever go back on it.

It didn't work for the bipolar and I had every unlikely side effect. It took almost 4 days to get out of my system and caused asthma-like attacks. My heart was beating around 120bpm and I felt like I was being smothered. I would not recommend this drug to anyone. Too many side effects. I spent 2 weeks wondering if I was going to have a heart attack.

Bipolar Depression	BP Male, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/15/2009 12:14:26 PM	I have been taking this drug for two years now.  I know it works differently on everyone but I am bi-polar and my mood has been stable for the first time in my life.I take 300mg before bed and I sleep very soundly.  I have to be disciplined about getting up or I could sleep all day.  Once I'm up for a while I'm fine and do not feel tired like other people who are using this drug.Warning:  Do not stop taking this medication abruptly.  I did this because I couldn't afford it (no insurance) and I got very very sick.  I have been sick everyday for two weeks and I've started to take it again but I'm still sick.Working is a nightmare but I have no choice.  If I don't work I don't get paid.It's a great drug for some of us but be careful if you stop.

Over the past 6 years, I have gained almost 100lbs.  I went off the drug temporarily, and was able to lose 40lbs.  My bipolar disorder resurfaced, and I had to go back on Seroquel because nothing else worked.  Unfortunately, I gained the weight back.  I am very unhappy with my appearance, but am pretty much stuck on the medication.  I had to weigh out whether my mental health or my weight was more important.
Manic-Depression	Cindy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	7/10/2009 11:26:25 PM	I take 300 mg. of seroquel every night at bedtime. 10 yrs ago I took 2400 mg. every night and went from 120 lbs. to  230 lbs. in a year. 18 months ago I started weaning down the mg.'s and am now back to 120 lbs. and maintaining a wellness with 300mg, however, knowing my bipolar so well, sometimes I will take up to 450 mg. knowing that my manic phase is starting to kick in. If I don't take warning to my mania, I will be awake for 3 nights and four days before I completely crash and burn for 3 straight days, waking only to use the bathroom. Seroquel has, what I consider, literally saved my life. Bipolar is a life sentence, unfortunately, but I can maintain a wellness because of it.
Other	lady, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	7/10/2009 9:18:02 PM	I have been taking this drug on and off for several years (usually around 75mg/night), primarily for severe anxiety (sometimes a little psychotic). I also have a history of major depression and 2 manic episodes. I do not know if these meds have an effect on my depression because that lifted 4 yrs ago and hasn't returned, and my moods are stable. I suspect that it helps because this is the longest period that I have ever been depression-free. Because of the sedating effects, I definitely feel less anxiety, and so far it has been the only medication that has helped me (I have tried many over the last 14 years). Some anxiety remains, and I still get panic attacks, so I will have to start something else as well. The drug has not been as scary as many of these reviews, but I am on a relatively low dose. Also, don't be turned off by people who complain about the initial side effects. This med takes a long time to stabilize. For the few weeks I was so tired I could barely function, but it was less every day. Now I just need a morning coffee and I'm good. If I miss a dose it is really obvious because my anxiety sky-rockets again. The only side effect of concern is extreme irritability and emotional volatility in the morning that declines as the afternoon approaches. I'll snap at my lovely husband for no reason at all, so have learned to walk away and avoid him when that happens (only about once every few weeks). It's like really bad PMS in the mornings. It's still definitely worth it.

I gained 50 pounds, hate how I look.  It is very sedating and helps me sleep and relax.  I am experimenting with taking half of 25 mg pill to see if I can get some benefits without all the weight gain.  Also taking Ambien and Lorazapam with it which also help with sleep and anxiety.

Bipolar Depression	Rachelle S., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/1/2009 7:57:25 PM	I take a very small dose of Seroquel XR - just 50 mgs - a few hours before bedtime to help with sleep.  I was told this formula (the Seroquel XR) reaches peak levels approx. 4 hours after taking it and have found this to be fairly accurate.  A very important reason that my doctor has me on this drug in addition to Trazodone for slee is it also helps minimize my anxiety and mixed episodes, which is a very good thing!  I was on a higher dose (200 mgs) but found it caused me too much fatigue during the day.  I have had some weight gain with this drug, but that was primarily when I took more, not on this smaller dose.  (The weight gain could also be related to the combination of drugs I take: Depakote XR, Trazodone, Pristiq, Abilify, Klonopin, and Seroquel; so I can't just pin-point it as the Seroquel.)  I did notice that when I first started taking Seroquel it had much more of &quot;an impact&quot; at sedating me then it does now.  The smallest dose could tire me out within about half and hour.  This effect has worn out though now.  Overall, I would say Seroquel is a very effective drug for me.  I know several others that take it (for varying reasons and with varying effects on their energy level) so I will say it's very important with this drug - like all prescriptions - to really find out how it will affect your sleep and energy and why it's being prescribed at the particular dose it is being prescribed.

I could not stay awake at work.  I was a zombie all of the time.  Went to Abilify, Geodon and only this but 300 mg.  All of these made it impossible to function.   I am now on lithium and ciatopram and do very well on it.  They are generic and cost $4.00 each a month.  Can't do $50.00 a month just for the seroquel.   Wish my boyfriend wouldn't have to take it for sleep.  Just afraid what this poision is doing to him.

I take Seroquel in conjunction with Zoloft and having been on both now, I cannot imagine going back to the life I had before. When used correctly, these prescriptions are a true life savior. I am being treated for Multiple Personality Disassociative Disorder.  I had to fight to get access to Seroquel. With my medical history I would not have stood a chance with any other prescription.  All the other drugs available to me would have put me in the hospital because of their interactions with everything else in my life.  Seroquel and Zoloft have made my life liveable again. I was taking only Zoloft but my symptons were getting worse and it was not fun.  I do not drink, I do not smoke and I have not had any adverse reactions to my meds together.  It is a wonderful feeling to wake up and know that I am not subject to the noise and fast moving thoughts of my brain.

I was experiencing insomnia.2. I was having very disturbing dreams when I did sleep.3. On top of taking another anti-depressant, my mood swings were taking over my life.Seroquel worked wonderfully for me for the first 5 months of usage. I was more stable, sleeping well, and not dreaming whatsoever.Unfortunately, a tramatic event in my life proved that I needed a strong sleep-aid med. My doctor has kept me on Seroquel as it's control of my mood swings have worked well.

Although I did fall asleep instantly, I experienced night sweats, vivid dreams, and was unable to function the next day. I also gained five pounds in three days, even though I had actually eaten less. As the week commenced, I found myself hungry all the time. I am certain t was directly countering what the Prozac was supposed to do: ease depression and control bulimia. I'm off it completely and glad to be...

I had terrible side effects. First i gained 40pds. Then i was a zombie the next day and i am a 32 yr old woman with three children. It also raised my triglycerides alot. Normal is under 150 and mine was 609. High triglycerides can cause damage to your pancreatitis and can kill you. I am having a hard time remembering things and i have problems getting my sentences straight. But the worest of it all is i was diagnost with Tardive Dyskinsia which is terrible i now have movements with my mouth and tongue that i can't control. If you look up the side effects on this drug they say its suposely rare to get Tardive Dyskinsia well i guess i was that one in a millon. This drug is terrible i don't reccomend seroquel to anyone. Now on top of taking my normal biplor meds i have to take Niacin for my Triglycerides and 200 iu of vitamin e complex to help control Tardive dyskinsia. My dr told me that Tardive Dyskinsia is sometimes irriversable. Which means i will probaly have to live with it. I would not reccomend seroquel to my worest enemy. Now my dr has slowly taken me off the Serquel and put me on Geodon. Wonderful drug it gives me lots of get up and go and a different out look on life. It opens up your eyes. The only side effect with Geodon is at first its kinda like Seroquel when you get up in the morning its hard to get up an go but my dr gave me Adderall 10mg to take in the morning and i now have know problems. So to all you people out there with Bipolar with panic attacks and aniety DONT TAKE SEROQUEL IT HAS RUINED MY LIFE!!!!

Sleepiness all the time -though not near as bad Zyprexa.Constant, constant, constant hunger.  Over about four years of taking atypical anti-psychotics.  I went from 190 lbs to 270 lbs.My doctor took me off of it and put me on Lamictil.  Almost, immediately, I started shedding the pounds.  I take other drugs that suppress appetite, but I will say without a doubt that the Seroquel just simply made me way too hungry, and too fat.Look if Lamictil did not exist, it is either taking the Seroquel or having to deal with major depression and dizzying highs.  I would opt to take Seroquel.

It worked very well for sleep and stabilizing moods.  The down side is that I could not function on less than 10-12 hours of sleep, my hA1c (diabetes) has steadily climbed, and my weight has increased 30-40lbs.  The doctor switched me to trazodone a few days ago.  I was supposed to slowly drop the dosage down to get off it.  I disagreed with the doctor because I love the medication and decided to cold turkey it.  I stayed very sick for a few days and its messing with my physically.  This isnt ideal but I HAVE to get off it because of my diabetes managment.  Overall, this is an awsome drug I could even ignore the weight gain if it werent for the diabetes.
Bipolar Disorder in Remission	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	35-44	5/31/2009 7:16:33 PM	Although the side effects that are constantly undesirable the treatment of bipolar mania have been controled. The worst and only problem with the drug is the uncontrollable earge to eat excessively shortly after taking it. As well as the pattern of sleep that is so deep and requires about 10hrs a day, I feel it isn't safe to sleep so deep when on one occurence the building fire alarm went off. The building was evacuated and I didnt know until two days later.  I do not recommend using it with children in the home and the weight gain isn't controllable. Another disadvantage is that problem of not being able to stop taking it. If you go out of town and forget it to bring it you will not sleep and become very sick the following day.

Within 4 days he was back to his normal temperament.  He is taking 25 mg with supper.  He was off it for one week while in the hospital, and was combative and agitated again after 2 days not taking it.  After starting it again we had very good results.  It puts him to sleep in about 2 hours and he sleeps through the night again.  The next day he is fine until suppertime, when it is time for his next dose.

I would say 85-90% of the time it works for me, I could never ever take it during the day. I don't wake up any more groggy than what a person usually feels like when they first get up.

Thanks to my borderline symtom, the mixture of Seroquel and Prozac was not necessary because, I was on a little of Prozac before.

One day my boss told me he was concerned because I have forgotten things that I have done normally for years. I went to a neurologist and he said that my left side of my body was unstable. After talking with my doctor, he recommended that I switch to Lamictal. Lamictal has been a life saver for me.. that is when I started to truly heal and be able to make decisions. I would say that if you are having symptoms that are worry some and scare you, please talk to you counselors and therapist. You have to find the right combination when you have this disorder.thanksnicole

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	Ryan in MN, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	5/6/2009 1:13:33 AM	This medication has been a good addition to my anti-depression battle... helps with anxiety as well as insomnia.  Though i have recently heard that it possibly increases  risk of adult diabetes... hopefully I find it is minimal and I can continue to make progress in finding happiness in life.Certainly the meds do not MAKE us happy, they were very difficult for me to &quot;swallow&quot; when I was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety.  I refused to think I needed to take pill to be happy.  Of course I have learned, they don't create the contentment, but they help us to balance our chemistry to combat the symptoms.  We are all different, and many times the first medications prescribed don't achieve the proper results or even worsen what you are dealing with in the first place.  Dealing with depression on some level for over 15 years myself, I've been through all kinds of presciptions... and just in the past couple years found a combo that is finally effective for me. So if you find the meds you are taking now aren't quite right or simply dont work... keep trying.  It will be very frustrating.Seroquel, along with Lamictal and Lexapro, has helped me to better deal with my depression, anxiety as well as other issues... more effectively than the many other med combination I have tried.  I hope this can help at least one person out there!

WOW... did I sleep... but I was walking, talking and biggest problem of all- EATING in my sleep with absolutely no recollection of the events except what I had been told. I've been off of this drug for about 5 weeks now and am not sleeping hardly at all! When on it though, I had weight gain, whacked out blood sugars, heart palpitations, and lethargy without about 12 hours of sleep... but it did really help with my anxiety and insomnia... I just wish I could sleep that hard without taking anything!

I have gained more and more weight, putting on about 38 pounds since I started. Also, it makes me sleep wayyyy too much.  I take it before I go to bed and if I don't get 12-13 hours of sleep, I'm still exhausted.  I've missed many college classes and some days of work bc of oversleeping. If I don't take it for even one night, I get no sleep (even less than before I was taking it, which even then wasn't much) and the next day I feel really sick all day (empty feeling in the stomach but if I eat anything I feel nauseous).  Is there a chance of addictive qualities with this drug? It worked reallllly well for me for a couple months, but has slowly worn off and isn't worth the side effects.  I feel sick a lot and am always tired.  Also I've lost nearly all sex drive.  I'm going to my dr to get an alternative.

Those meds combined with a pain program i took part in, I got back to school, back with my friends, and back to my normal self. One bonus for me is that it helps me sleep, which was an issue because of the severe headaches. After 10 months on this medication, they are finally weaning me off. I have been very happy with the results of this medication and I am glad that my Dr. prescribed it for me. I would not be back to my normal self if it was not for this med and the pain program.

By taking it at night it helps me fall and stay asleep, and I don't have trouble waking up as long as I get eight hours of sleep. This med has caused me to gain 15lbs. but I'd rather have a few extra pounds than live the way I used to when I was flipping out and being angry all the time. I used to get crying spells before I took Seroquel, and those are gone too. I also talk to people more freely and a lot of my social phobia has gone away. I feel like this medication saved my life by making me comfortable in my own skin and helping get rid of all the unnecessary rage. 
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	4/19/2009 4:05:15 AM	I began taking seroquel about 2 years ago and stopped because it just didn't work like it used to and my doctor upped my miligram to 300. I was still waking up 2 to 3 times a night and eating not even knowing it. So i just quit cold turkey. I have done nothing but lay on the couch or the bed ever since.  What's happening?
Other	allisone, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	4/19/2009 12:32:38 AM	I was prescribed Seroquel 100mg six years ago to help me sleep. I had tried everything prior--ambien, benzos, I've even tried Lunesta recently. But only Seroquel combined with Klonapin are successful at getting me to sleep. The problem, though, is that starting two years ago, out of nowhere, I noticed that about 20 min after I take the Seroquel, I have food cravings that are so intense they're almost painful. I HAVE to eat--a lot. I have gained 25 pounds in two years. I run and exercise at least 4 times per week and eat NO sugar or fruit. I cannot lose the weight, and my cravings persist. I'm becoming depressed and ashamed of my body. I would give anything to get off Seroquel so I can have my old body back. I'm MISERABLE! I need to find something to substitute for Seroquel!

The only thing this drug does for me is put me to sleep. I haven't noticed any kind of change in my mood or behavior. Another bad thing about this drug is, it makes you extremely lethargic the next day. I take 150 mg at night with a small meal. It hasn't helped.It seems as though my moods are getting worse. I wouldn't recommend this drug.

I like being able to take before I go to bed, the Seroquel XR I had to take an hour after dinner does not work for me. The only side effect for me so far is that I sleep alot harder, but not as long as I did before I started the medication.

Bipolar Depression	bwise, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	1	1	Male	35-44	4/4/2009 6:23:13 PM	seroquel is a very mysterious drug. having been on it for years it seemed to calm many over acting thoughts. of course there is the weight gain but that did not effect my view on this med. i weened off sucessfully, but then put back on for reasons unknown. thats when i realized the outstanding unacceptable side effects. 200mg pill sent me into a nightmare of out of control physical behavior. spasms, jaunting muscles, seizure type episodes, than hospitalization. i decided to look into this med, and discovered the negative side effects highly outstand the possitive in many case studies. this med is at the end of its patent, and is being pushed to patients in high measures. costly, it needs to sell before generics are able to replace it. seroquel barely passed fda regs and i know why. diabeties,extreme weight gain, dillusinal behavior. the sedation aspect as many complain about pales in comparison to how mind altering this drug can be in many,many patients. im underwhelmed, to say the least, this med is rxed to sooooo many. start with very low doseage, and do research. a good alternative is thorzine. it may be oldschool, but its been around so long for a reason. i worry seroquel is pushed too hard on every diagnoses ones dr invents. meds are hugely profitable to many players in this field. by the way, as many know, the makers of seroquel are and have been sued with numerous cases pending. god bless if it works but if you suffer its evil do not be talked into a abusive relationship with this med. long term effects may insue. p.s. sorry for the poor spelling. that i wont blame on seroquel.

I wasnt so happy with it in the beginning but once i got to about 600 milligram i started to notice very good results with experincing less voices. I now take 1200 milligrams and am very pleased. The bad side effects were finding it hard to wake up in the morning and the the amount of weight I gained. I gained about 80 pounds. But after realizing it was making me feel hungry when i wasnt i was able to stop the weight gain and actually lost 60 pounds of the weight i gained. I am on my way to losing the last 20 pounds but even if i cant, the benefits definitely out weigh the side effects.

It does help me sleep but I do need to becareful with it if I need to get up early in the morning. Most of the time, if I sleep good, I do have a good alert day, but if I don't have enough sleep, I'm a zombie for the rest of the day, trying desperatly to get sleep so where some how.

It did NOTHING to help me sleep - in fact, I started taking it in the AM with my other meds to help me remember.  I started having the weirdest muscles movements as I was falling asleep though.  My leg muscles would twitch, my hands would fly out from under my pillow, and I would donkey-kick my husband, apologizing even as I was kicking him.  This has stopped since my Dr. took me off the meds, but I'm scared they'll come back permanently, and I'm terrified of the weight gain issue.

Manic-Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	3/24/2009 2:26:52 AM	I occasionally take Seroquel for Bipolar II disorder. I vary with dosages. I won't take Seroquel on a daily basis as I fear weight gain. I have an eating disorder and I find this drug difficult to take because of the increased appetite and weight gain as side effects. It has been a lifesaver for sleep during hypomanias! When I am hypomanic this has been the only thing to get me to sleep after days without any or very little sleep. I have not found it helpful for the depression aspect. I did take it daily before and I had thoughts to self-injure. That was after I initially started taking Seroquel. Overall, I'd strongly recommend this drug for Bipolar disorder.

I have been hospitalized to date 11 times for mania and extreme depression. The last time in 2002 I was prescribed this drug but my Dr. had me taking 1000mg a day! I in one year  slept anywhere between 12-18 hours a day. I didn't leave my house or room for that matter and went from 200lbs to 427lbs. This drug not only made me worse it gave me type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol,ischemia along with heart palpitations and morbid obesity! This drug ruined my health and my spirit to live! I would definitely urge anyone that is using this medication to think whether they are taking it to escape everyday life and reality by sleeping it away or are you taking it to get back to your healthy self? I believe this drug is very dangerous and has effected my body in all the negative ways. If anyone would like to reach me concerning this email please feel free to email me at Redhead76@live.com

I run on the manic side and it helped me with racing thoughts and gave me the opportunity to sleep.  BUT like a light switch, I woke up one day and it has no positive effect anymore.

After gaining about 40 lbs. (my normal weight is about 210) I stopped taking it. Its overall effectiveness was negative because of the significant side effects and little help on the upside.!!Read this article from the Washington Post, 3.18.09:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/ content/article/2009/03/17/AR2009031703786.html

Bipolar Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	19-24	3/17/2009 3:29:00 PM	I'm now 21 years old. When I was 15 I attempted suicide for the first time, I was sent to a mental facility where they diagnosed me for Bipolar and put me on Seroquel and Lithium. I gained a lot of weight off from the Seroquel, and it messed with my head a lot. After I took it I felt extremely lethargic and sleepy. I didn't sleep well, I'd often scream in my sleep and wake myself and everyone around me. The drug made me more confused than anything else, I didn't feel as sad as I did before, but I also couldn't feel happy (unless I was over tired from taking it), it was like I was numb. Nine months later I had a second suicide attempt, I was sent to a different mental health hospital and they replaced my medications with Lexapro, Wellbutrin and Topamax (mostly to help my weight situation). I just got off all my medications last spring, so it's been almost a year now that I've been medication and therapy free. Althought Seroquel can actually treat people, I don't really recommend it for most.
Bipolar Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	3/17/2009 11:24:58 AM	I am 21, Bipolar and have been taking Seroquel for 3 weeks now. This medication is two-sided. I have control over my thoughts and impulsiveness but am constantly tired. Within 20 minutes of taking it at night I can't even speak or walk. If I don't get 10 hours of sleep I can barely function the next day. If I do get the 10 hours then I feel ok. The thought and mood control is great but the zombie/hung over feeling isn't. I'm thinking about stopping because it is beginning to affect my focus at work.

It has kept me out of the emergency room for about six months now. I take 400 mg at h.s. make sure you are laying down after you take it due to loss of coordination, i am not kidding, it really knocks you on youre butt it also keeps my brain from working overtime when im trying to go to sleep. It gives me a full night sleep without the grogginess in the morning. I sleep uninterrupted. I also take the 50mg during the day prn for irritation and anxiety, it really helps me get through the day. The only problem I have with the drug is I have no insurance so it costs me an arm and leg, about 400 dollars to have it filled, and there is no generic available. So it is an expensive way to help me be a productive member of society.

I love that it helps me sleep, and my mood has been pretty good.  I've recently developed some really weird side effects though - some nights when I go to bed my heart pounds so fast and hard I'm afraid I'm going to have a heart attack, and I've started having irrational fears and panic after taking it at night.  I'm a perfectly normal professional during the day, but after taking Seroquel at night I'm convinced evil spirits or ghosts are going to get me, and have to sleep with a nightlight on with all the doors in the bedroom closed and locked!  Not a lot of fun!! I'm waiting to get in with the doc and have started tapering off.

At first I was very tired all the time but after about a month that went away. The dr. gave me this to help with my insomnia and bipolar. I'm only on 25 mg at night, but that seems to be enough to help my brain shut down at the end of the day. I love this stuff. It is wonderful to feel like I've finally got the right combo of drugs to function like a normal human being. Since I've gotten stabilized I got a job and don't feel like quitting it at the end of every day. I play with my kids now... this has been nothing short of a miracle for me.

She went to bed within 2 hrs. after taking it and slept 12 hrs. and awoke with anxiety and fear and couldn't go back to school. By the 3rd day she was coming out of the fog and back to her old self, but she still has some anxiety. This has been prescibed this on a temporary basis for 1-2 weeks only. We may need to get back on the Lexapro.

Well all this one did was make me sleep. Which I don't need help with. I have other meds that are fine but this one makes me angry easily, frustrated, gained almost 20 lbs in 6 months, nearly gotten myself into several altercations due to this medication having such an negative effect on my behavior. Which is was to make me more stable...all it did was make me want to harm others. It had gotten so bad that I actually drove myself to my the hospital &amp; literally cried for help as I knew if I continued on this path that one day it would cause my end. With little help from this medication, severe weight gain in little time, mood altering &amp; sleep inducing, for me this medication was THE worst thing my doctors could have put me on.I have family who has been helped wonderfully &amp; no lead normal &amp; happy lives due to this &quot;wonder drug&quot;, but for me it was a terribly scary experience that I would never want to experience again.

Although it did help with the bi polar, it has some nasty side effects.  I gained over 50 lbs and developed type 2 diabetic.  I was taken off of the medication when I went to a new dr and have since lost the weight and the type 2 problems are gone.

This drug has stabilzed me for the most part, but I have had episodes and  another hospitalization while on the drug. It is not a wonder pill for me, but it definitely has helped my particular situation. I take 1000 mg a day, 150 am, 150 noon and 700 pm.  I have gained a lot of weight, 50 lbs, over 2 years.  I am trying to lose weight through diet and exercise with minimal loss (1 pound in 1 month of hard exercise and following weight watcher's diligently)  I find the exhaustion I initially experienced went away, but is now back again.  And, I am hungry all the time.  With seroquel you need to go to bed early or you will be a tired wreck the next day.

This is an extremely POWERFUL medication and unless you have a SEVERE mood disorder, it's over the top! I took only 1/2 the initial dose as prescribed (as recommended by my pharmacist) and I was groggy for 2 days straight -- felt like I was drunk. I have heard the mfr is being sued for not disclosing it causes diabetes and weight gain. Scary drug unless you have a severe problem in my opinion.
Bipolar Disorder in Remission	patient, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	25-34	3/1/2009 7:49:48 PM	This medication seems to have been effective at preventing another bipolar episode for me.  However, I have experienced weight gain.  I had gained about 9lbs. previously while taking other meds.  Since switching to only Seroquel at 300mg a day, I have gained 5lbs more.  I think that this weight gain is due mainly to the medication.  I have had difficulty losing any of the weight and keeping it off.  I have never had a problem with being anything but slim before in my life. I have also had problems with grogginess, tiredness, difficulty waking up from sleep, and some difficulty in concentration.  My dose has just been decreased somewhat and I look forward to seeing if that eases my side effects.  It seems to be effective at helping me think positively.  As far as its effectiveness at treating regular depression apart from bipolar disorder, I think it is only somewhat effective at that, as I still have some symptoms of depression. The manufacturer of Seroquel, &quot;AstraZeneca, is trying to get approved for use by people suffering from depression.&quot;  I have been on it for about a year, and will think it is very effective if I have had no bipolar episodes 3 to 4 years from now.  The Wall Street Journal online has some good articles about Seroquel and its efficacy and safety.
Schizophrenia	Zooid, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	3/1/2009 6:47:23 PM	I have been on 1500 mg of Seroquel going on three years. I could not ask for a better treatment. I had an initial weight gain of about 15 pounds, which hasn't gone away. I take the full dose at bedtime. Within 45 minutes I am out and need at least 10 hours of sleep, or else I am so groggy that functioning for the day becomes difficult. About the second year in, my symptoms and minimal side effects began to recede exponentially. I haven't had problems with my blood sugar or have shown signs of diabetes. Constipation was a problem for a long time. One side effect that will not go away is that if I do not take the medication at night I cannot fall asleep and can literally be up for two days without feeling overly tired. So having a few doses in your car, at your friends houses, on you, and places of the like is important. If you miss doses there are noticeable spikes in symptoms that can last several days. Also keep drinking to a minimum. There has been a few times when I drank too much and had to stay in bed for about 15 hours before I had enough energy to crawl out of bed. There is also a very personal side effect with reduction of libido, sexual stimulation and production of semen. I had very weak orgasms paired with no ejaculation. I now have as regular bowel movements and orgasms as I ever had, with the exception that in the mornings, when the drug is still strong in my body, I cannot ejaculate. I am so grateful for this drug, it truly is a miracle. New users, know that it takes time for you to heal. Schizophrenia is a scary illness that tweaks the associations in your brain, it takes a while relearn reality by forging new synapses, Seroquel helped me rely more on facts than delusions and helps me think that my delusions are just that. If you have been on smaller doses for a while and your symptoms have receded little, ask for an increase, it will help. Rely on science and logic to identify your delusions and time and Seroquel will help them dissipate. God speed.

I usually take only 2x a day.. I also take 250 mg of zoloft. It helps me feel calm but I find if I sit for to long I will fall asleep. The tiredness during the day has finally stopped it took about 6 weeks .. I started having leg jerks at night just when I'm starting to fall asleep but then they stop. I do have dry mouth .. No weight gain yet keeping fingers crossed...... I do notice that I'm liking dessert more but I have been keeping that under control.Overall this medication is helping me to feel at ease &amp; not hyper so it's working...
Other	Sleepless, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	2	3	Female	45-54	2/22/2009 7:38:39 AM	I was Rx's this for sleep.  I had tried Ambien, Restoril &amp; Rozerem which either worked 6 hrs. after taking at bed time or I was just naturally exhausted.  I was staying awake 30-48 hrs. at a time w/ anxirty.  Even if it did fall asleep, any sound could awaken me after 2 hrs. without ability to go to sleep.  Dr. said I desparately needed sleep so she Rx'd this &amp; told me to take 300mg. the 1st time &amp; it would knock a horse out &amp; keep me asleep about 24 hrs. &amp; told my husband not to worry if there was no movement or he couldn't awaken b/c I really needed to sleep.  It worked just as she'd said.  Then I was to take 100mg. ea. night at bedtime.  It will make me sleepy in an hour but I can stay awake if to much anxiety.  But 200mg. will definetly make me sleep.  Problem is that w/ 100-200mg., I usually sleep 10-14 hrs.  If I can wake upp after 8 hrs., I very groggy &amp; can't drive for business.  So I don't take it nightly as I should.  I still have sleep deprivation, but try to take it at least 2-3 times per week on days when I know that I'll be working from home.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	2/18/2009 8:44:01 PM	My doctor prescribed 50mg a night to help me sleep. I am on 20mg of Lexapro daily to treat anxiety. Overall I'm in love with Lexapro, but it seemed to wear off by about 10pm and I would still wake up hourly all night with anxiety. The Seroquel completely knocks me out about 30 minutes after taking it. I've noticed a sort of tired drugged feeling til about noon the next day when I take it. I'm also told that I talk in my sleep a lot when I take the Seroquel. I've cut back to every other night in order to have more alertness during the days, but I definitely sleep better at night when I take Seroquel. 
Bipolar Depression	NYC10021, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	2/18/2009 7:36:52 PM	I started taking Seroquel over a year ago.  My Dr at the time put me on 200mg a day, and even though I wasn't feeling better, he kept it at that.  In the long run, he ended up up being a terrible Dr, so of course I switched.  My current Dr is awesome, and has me on Seroquel, Klonopin, and Lamictal.  I ended up spending a week in a psychiatric unit with severe anxiety and panic, about 6 months ago, before I was on my current treatment regimen.  After all of that, and during my stay in the hospital, my final dosage is at 600mg per day (50mg morning, 50mg afternoon, 500mg bedtime).  It has worked very well for me, both with my anxiety and my moods.  I haven't had a bipolar cycle in a long time, so in my opinion, Seroquel is an all-around wonder drug! :)

From the moment she took it she could no longer stand up, was dizzy and could even speak properly. She feel and hit the back of her head that required 7 staples. The ER Dr took her off seraquel and within a few days she was back to her normal self (still has dementia of course) but didn't need the wheel chair and can have a conversation again.  Drs need to be careful prescribing seraquel to elderly dementia patients! Was an awful experience.

I take it with 1m of chlonazepam (klonopin) I am a very athletic guy. Ever since taking this med I have gained a lot of weight &amp; seemed to really want to eat AT NIGHT. Plus, it always seems so hard to get up in the am. I've tried to take 25m of late and I have terrible nighmares. I need the sleeo but I really believe Seroquel makes me feel worse overall b/c of weight gain though docs won't validate weight is from the Seroquel. Also give me small dose of Cymbalta for periodic depression and pain and then provigil in morning b/c I'm tired. What a nightmare - No pun intended, Anyone have any good ideas?
Bipolar Depression	tracie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/3/2009 9:47:46 PM	seroquel should be taken off the market and patients and caregivers should be aware and honest about its side effect. For me:nightmares, nightsweats, fighting myself and my husband while I slept.And believe me thats all I did while on seroquel.I also gained weight which caused more depression and more sleeping.These symptoms occured even I took a small pieceof a 50mg tab.

It's fantastic! I take it about a half an hour before I want to go to bed so it usually only takes a few minutes to fall asleep after I turn in for the night. I am happier and more comfortable with talking to people. Also, I worry so much less than I did before I was on the medication. It's truly a blessing.

Since I started the meds, I have had a period every month like clockwork... every 25-28 days.  Nothing else has changed in my life except these meds. Just a question.

Other	betternow, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	1/27/2009 9:42:23 PM	Seroquel was prescribed for me when I was having panic attacks following a major depressive time in my life.  I took it for a few days, and what I experienced was a drug-induced sleepiness all the time.  It did not help my depression, and I could not have remained functional while taking it.  All I wanted to do was sleep and felt like a zombie.  I believe this is what they must give to nursing home residents to make them less hostile and wakeful.

We have been on abilify, respridol, depecote, lithium, and who knows what else. We have awsome spych nurse but the children's hospital has acted like he is responsibe for his disorder and can controll his actions. Why are some mental health professionals so ignorant?  He has been on this med (300 mg) for a year now and his moods have been fairly stable, for him that is, with the zoloft, clonodine, and topomax coctail he is on. When he started on this med he was like a zombie for months, missed school because I couldn't wake him, and when he was there he fell asleep (still does occasionally)to the point that I was threatened with court action. He has had major weight gain, which continues at 3-5 lbs a month. He is closely monitored, but even with that he is now experiencing health problems that are a direct result of this med. His triglicerides are off the chart, blood-pressure is too low, sugar high, and occasional chest pains. Since we have been through most of the available meds for his dissorders, and he is relative stabile,it has been decided that taking him off of the meds will cause him to crash. I am in the process of working with the doctors, med and pcp, to decide what to do before... I'm not sure what could happen to him, but I was told his situation is dangerous. I know it isn't fair that there are not better meds out there, or ones that the side affects wouldn't kill you, so what is a mother to do? Either way it seems to me that my son is the looser; breakdown- suicide attempts or diabetes, heart disease, or stroke. What would you do?????

All symptoms were gone, but the weight gain was immediate. I'm 5&quot;1' and gained 40 lbs.  Now I'm off and on Lexapro 30 mg. 2xday, Cymbalta 60mg. 1xday, and Klonopin 1mg.4xday.  It's been a year and weight is gone, but I feel like I need just &quot;something else&quot;.  Just not sleeping.  Ambien, Lovasea, Amitriptylene all are not working.  Just have to find the right combo. :)

It brings me down to earth when I take it PRN for mania. It helps me sleep when I am &quot;excited&quot; with mania. The only thing I have against it is the WEIGHT GAIN. When I was on it regularly, daily, my weight went up 20 lbs. Now that I take it only PRN for feelings of mania, my weight is stable. It took me 1 year to lose the weight! I have to take it with my Effexor XR, as the Effexor makes me feel manic. It's only been 2 weeks. Effexor XR has helped me lose 4 lbs. I wonder what the Seroquel will do now? If I continue to feel manic on the Effexor XR and my weight increases because of having to take the Seroquel so often, I will stop both.

I was very &quot;freaked out&quot; for the fact I am NOT bi-polar, I cannot shut my mind off at night and go days without sleeping. I went off this medication for about 3 weeks and had to go back on.

Severe nightmares, I have actually woke up in the morning with red spots all over my chest and neck. It literally looked like someone had been grabbing me but I got to thinking and I was dreaming of being choked by my ex grandfather who in time we found out that he was a child molester. I absolutely hate Seroquel, I now have to double sleeping medicines because the Seroquel was so strong. People beware of Seroquel, its the devil in your dreams.

Then I started getting restless leg syndrome so it was lowered to 100 mg.  It worked well but the RLS came back.  I'm now on 50 mg. and it seems to be working and the RLS hasn't returned yet.  I'm worried about the uncontrollable movements and the condition it can cause but if I can stay on it at a lower dose I want to.  It does make me extremely sleepy but I can function on a lower dose.

Almost instantly it increases your appetite. YOU WILL GAIN WEIGHT with this. Whenever I feel I get too skinny from depression I actually take this to gain weight on purpose and so does my friend who also has bipolar. Also it started to make my heart beat very rapidly and uncontollably so I have stopped using it for sleep. But it does work, usually takes 15-20 min and I get sleepy.

At least while your awake. And then there's the whole can cause Diabetes thing.

My ending dose is 300 twice per day.  This medication has not helped me at all with any of my issues, in fact, it has made me feel like a zombie throughout the entire day.  I also find that it makes me extremely sleepy so I am not sure why she has prescribed this medication twice a day.  Ive spoken to her numerous times about this issue because it is affecting me staying awake at my job which is not a great thing.  Ive also been experiencing extreme abdominal pain to the point where I could hardly stand up straight.  At first I thought it was gas which causes bloating and pressure but then I found out it was because of this medication.I honestly dont recommend this to anyone due to the ineffectiveness of the product and because it will make you feel like a zombie for at least 99% of your day.  Before I took this medication I actually felt better so I am now at the point of lowering my own dose by cutting my pills in half each day and eventually I will stop taking this medication and seek out a naturopathic or holistic route.I feel that doctors today will prescribe medications to patients without being totally honest about what other products are out there, so we must do our own research.  I have come to the conclusion that doing your own research and finding a doctor who wholeheartedly cares about your well being and is interested and/or willing to try alternatives before giving meds that will make your life less productive can make the difference in solving the problem or having a medical condition that can affect you for the rest of your life.

I had several dentists and oral surgeons all inform me that Seroquel was the cause...extreme dry mouth despite drinking nothing but water and milk and brushing, etc.  The decay was so rapid and widesread that after ALL attempts and a small fortune spent, at the age of 38, I had to have ALL of my teeth removed at one time in the hospital!!  I now have a set of $3,000.00 FULL DENTURES!!  I was prescribed this med. for sleep (diagnosed Bi-polar in 1996) along with Restoril, Valium, and Ambien CR!  I have gained a ton of weight, and wake up in the middle of the night (3-4 hours of sleep)!  It's about the strongest thing they can give me for sleep so I still take it nightly.  I really hate this drug!!!  If you take this medication, I STRONGLY recommend you see the dentist every 3 months!!  By the way...Serowuel is NOT approved for the treatment of sleep disorders!!  It is being used improperly!!  If you read the uses, it states that it will make you think clearer and take an active role in everyday life!!  HA!

I have been on several medications to help my condition but I think seroquel has helped me the most. It helps me sleep (which is sooo important). It also helps my mood tremendously in that I don't think about how I'm feeling- I just feel rested and... better. So, if you just started taking this or are thinking about it for depression, anxiety, etc. I say give it a chance. :)

I started at 25mg. That did nothing.  I am now up to 400mg. I do like how it helps stablize my moods. I have depression, and bipolar.  I take the seroquel as a stablizer and Wellbutrin XL for my depression. I have been gaining alot of weight since this last bump up from 300 to 400mg. I gained about 15lbs in the last 3 months. I used to have a horrible time sleeping. This knocks me out like a baby. The downfall is if I take it really late at night and have to get up really early for work or something, I get really sick. Light headed, dizzy, sweating, feeling like I'm going to throw up and even pass out. I moved about 2 hrs from my psychiatrist and she wouldn't give me enough medicine to make it to my next appointment, and wouldn't call it in either, so the withdraw from it is terrible. I get bad migrains, sick to my stomach, dizzy, and just plain mean. I do want to talk to my Dr about maybe coming off of it. I hear alot of people have been gettin diabetes from it, and that runs in my family. I don't want to do anything that would help it along.

With the lithium, seroquel and lamictal, I'm stable and sleeping through the night with no brain-racing and waking up refreshed and not groggy.  Best combo ever.  Also, I think I've maybe gained five-eight pounds?  Nothing like some of these horror stories.  (that was Depakote for me.. horrible weight gain)

For me that was the one medication that just did it! I have finally turned my life around and am living a life I love.  You just need to find the right medication along with someone to confide in and of course some health coping skills!

I took only a little bit of 25mg and it already helped me w/those things. It is not hard to wean off, not much of side effects. My shrink and I both love this meds. Yes, it does give you a bit of hangover next morning but it will go away if you can sleep a bit more (2-3 hours more in the a.m.) I am fine with that. Compared to Zyprexa, this is not as &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;mean&quot;. Lowest Zyprexa dosage can make me sleep days and nights.

It allowed me to sleep. I stopped taking it over the past 3 months. It became too expensive. Asked my doctor to try something else and I was told it is not habit forming. If I missed one dose I could not sleep at all. It took me 3 months to wean off of it. Now, I cannot sleep at all. I will have to start taking it again. I cannot fall asleep or stay asleep more than 3 hours per night. I'm frustrated.

My doctor did not even relate my sever symptoms with Seroquel. I lost my memory, kidney functions and couldn't do anything for myself. The doctor thought I had dementia but my daughter looked the drug up online and found all my symptoms were listed in Seroquel warnings.  I was 46 yrs old when I started taking Seroquil. I was 50 when I stopped taking it.

I am 36 years old and have been bi-polar since I was a teenager and started taking meds when I was in my 20's I also have schizo trates.  Over the years I have taken every med that is out there on the market and some would work for a little while and then stop working. I have had horrible side effects everything from weight gain, body trimmers so bad I could not stop slobbering and hold a cup of coffee, liver damage, high cholesteral, I can't tell you all the side effects that I have had.I started seeing a new doc and she suggested that we try seroquel and I was at my wits end because I did not want to end up back in the mental hospital I just wanted something that was going to work.  I started taking it and everyone said they could see a difference in me that was for the good I was like my old happy self again.  I have been able to stop taking the anti depesants and the sleeping pills and the anti anxity pills. This drug has made a world of differance for my life I am able to get up and do things, be with my family and friends and I am happy.  Not all days are good mind you I still have some times where the anger comes out so I think I might need to increase the dose but all in all this drug has been a life saver for me.

And my sleep cycle is backwards - awake all night and sleep all day. These meds have been wonderful but my continuing depression had escalated sleep disorders and the remaining depression from which I could not dig myself out despite the addition of a full spectrum light box I felt I needed something else if it were available.  Seroquel 50-150mg has done the trick for me for my lingering bi-polar &amp; clinical depression.  All 3 meds + my light box have worked wonders for my 'dark night of the soul' and for my insomnia types.  Now I'm hoping to get my sleep hygiene back on track &amp; wake up w/ a better outlook for the day. Or at least an outlook that is realistic. I'm also a Type II diabetic, controlled by diet &amp; exercise &amp; I have found that Seroquel does, in fact, raise my blood sugar.  My FBS ranges are now 109-118, but my 2hr post prandial sugars are in my range of 120-135. Hope this is helpful.

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	11/11/2008 4:53:39 PM	I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was maybe 12 years old and tried every possible cocktail of mood stabilizers and anti depressants to try and control it.   Seroquel was the last thing thrown into the mix, and I have still not recovered fully.  I was so tired I could not keep my eyes open.  I couldn't read or hold conversations with people or go to school or drive.  I developed head ticks that I still have.  It was then that I decided to stop taking medications all together.  I have had a job and haven't been in a mental hospital ever since.

I also have depression that I am prescibed Zoloft and Wellbutrin. The Seroquel gives me heart palpitations so I experience drowsiness with a tachycardia that I find diconcerting so I take .5mg of Klonipen for that anxiousness. I cannot take high dose benzos or Ambien becouse I am a recovering presciption pill addict. I can take the low dose Klonipen without an addict wanting side efffects, as I often take the Seroquel without the Klonipen.

I do agree with the other posts that you really need to be able to sleep 9 or so hours otherwise it is very hard to get out of bed in the am.  My doctor wanted me to switch from Seroquel and try Geodon instead but the Seroquel works so well I don't want to switch.  I also take 300 Wellbutrin for depression.  I have not had any weight gain but am on a low dose of Seroquel.  I have been using Seroquel for about 10 months and have not had to increase the dose for the same effectiveness so that is good.

I'm on 600mg a night, and the only side effects I've experienced is some nausea if I stay awake more than 2 hours after taking it.  If you use this medication, make sure you take it in the evening right before you go to sleep.

The md should really tell patients before prescribing.  I take 300mg a day with 150mg of Wellbutrin.  I was ravenous for anything sweet until I started the wellbutrin. I have gained forty pounds that won't come off for anything.  I work out, eat right and still gain weight.  Very frustrating.....my moods are stable, but I get angry very easy towards the end of the day.  The best thing is no more anxiety.  I really need some advice to lose the weight.  I tried to ween myself off the seroquel slowly, but the nausea is overwhelming   help!

I feel like I am more involved in my life instead of just watching from the sidelines. But I am NOT happy about the weight gain! I have put on 40 pounds since I stared on seroquel and can't seem to lose more than a couple of pounds, and even that doesn't stay off long. My blood pressure has gone up, too. And my internist is monitoring my blood sugar, too.
Other	TiNK, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	11/3/2008 4:33:06 PM	My OpinionSeroquel good for:Excellent Sedative, Controls Emotional Instability--which is exactly what it should do.Bad:irritability, shaking, withdrawal, weight gain, grogginess, forgetfullness, slight angerI've been on and off and back on Seroquel since March '08. For someone like me who was suffering from paranoia, panic attacks, anxiety, and drasitic mood changes from being extremely happy to unbearably sad, the amount of sleep I was getting was about .8 hours per night.  My first dose of 50mg knocked me out within 20min.  I have never felt better. My doctor had me gradually step up to 200mg within a week and I honestly felt better aside from the grogginess. I had no mood swings, I wasn't feeling anxious, and best of all, my general fears subsided and I was able to gradually sleep without the light on. As a 26 year old woman, I was really happy about that last one. Those were the good things.  As for the not so great things, I realized that the reason I wasn't having those terrible feelings was because the Seroquel had me so tired, that I didn't have the chance to be worried, sad, or frightend. I would wake up and just be dragging. I also noticed that I was extremely thirsty, which I confused for hunger, thus the weight gain of 10lbs. But I was lucky enough to catch on to the weight gain factor and control that with plenty of water. BTW, it dries out your skin so if you have oily skin Seroquel is a plus! The worst side effect I've experienced is anger. Since being on this medication I become angry much easier than I used to.  In fact, I never used to get very angry, just sad.  Now I feel angry and irritated at small things.  I mentioned it to my doctor and told him I wanted to get off.  When I stopped taking it I experienced terrible withdrawal.  And this was only after a month of taking it.  nausea with vomiting, depression, etc. It was terrible.  I am now back on it to control my anxiety because I haven't been properly diagnosed.

After about an hour I fall to sleep and don't remember anything about falling asleep. It's wonderful and it's stopped the cycling from mania to depression.

I went from cycling quickly between mania and depression with the occasional stop at rage.  I had to go on disability at work too.  The Seroquel didn't start working immediately.  I was groggy and listless, unable to focus or function for about two weeks.  And then it kicked in.  I haven't been this happy and normal since I was ten.  Everyone who knows me is amazed at the difference.  The only downside was some weight gain, but I am &quot;fat and happy.&quot;  I would recommend this drug to anyone suffering from bipolar disorder.

Other	feelgood, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/25/2008 12:39:05 PM	Been prescribed almost every anxiety med available. Unfortunately after so long the dose has to keep increasing until you reach the highest dose. Then you repeat the process with another med to take its place. My last med was Paxil for my anxiety. So mutually my doctor and I wanted to try Seroquel. Within one week I feel wonderful other than the slight dizziness and grogginess in the morning. I am currently on 200 mg. By reading these posts that are the same situation as myself I am going to decrease my dose in half and take when I get home from work, not before I go to bed to try to alleviate these 2 side effects that I am experiencing. But for ME this med is wonderful. I am completely stress free and enjoy life in a totally new light in just one week of taking this med . So something tells me Im taking too high a dose for my body to handle. I will keep experimenting until I find the right dosage. I would also like to add that everyone is different . Not every med works the same for everyone. You shouldnt &quot;slam&quot; a drug if it doesn't work for you personally. It could be a life saver to someone else and their family.

My docs not that worried but its bad when your child is crying for you and you cant get up.  I dont know why happens.  I have low blood pressure and maybe thats why.  One or 2 of the times I had a glass or two of wine so dont drink before you take it.

My Dr. had me start with 50mg at bedtime and that first morning I could barely get out of bed. After another dose of 50mg the next day it wasn't as bad and on the 3rd night I increased it to 100mg. I was still having trouble with being sleepy for a few hours after getting up but the rest of the day was a big improvement in my mood. My wife even commeted on how I seemed to be doing better. My Dr. said I should try to work up to 200mg-300mg at bedtime so I incresed it to 150mg and the side effects didn't get any worse so I plan to go up to 200mg after a couple of more days at 150mg. I did notice that I seem to get the munchies throuogh out the day, but now that I'm more aware of the weight gain problem I've been able to resist the urge to eat and so I hope to avoid that problem. The overall benefit to this drug seems to be alot more calmness in my personality and and alot less anger and homocidial thouhgts. I think it is working well for me. I would recommend starting at the low doasge and slowly increasing until you get the results you need. It does tend to make you feel hung over the next day so I started taking earlier in the evening, like a couple of hours before bedtime and that seems to have resolved that problem as well.

I find it very easy to judge it's effectiveness and can raise or lower my dose to fit my needs with just a breif consultation with my phychiatrist.  I take it in conjunction with Cymbalta for my depression and anxiety.  It provides a steady platform to stabilize my mood so that anti-depressants can be added to improve my quality of life.  I don't know how it works, but it does.

Manic-Depression	Anonymous, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	13-18	10/19/2008 3:12:28 PM	       I have Bipolar 1 and I am 16 years old.  I was diagnosed February my freshmen year of high school and they put me on Lamictal in June.  It treated some of my symptoms in the first month: extreme interest in sex, delusional thinking, depression, and others I can't even remember because they stopped.  But I added Seroquel last May (October now).  Stress and bad sleeping patterns set me off, and I am pretty good about recognizing when I am about to go through an episode or what state I am in.       I take a dose of 150 Lamictal (2x a day), 200 Seroquel (2x day).  I was a little out of shape when I started Seroquel, so its side effects were strong, especially dizziness (I would sit down for a long time and when I got up, I lost my balance, couldnt see because my vision would go white.  And I usually fell down or smacked into a wall, not fun...).  I dont like the dizziness and this started the day after I began taking it.  Being in good physical shape can really help.   Seroquel also causes me to have episodes that I call panic attacks that started when I increased it.     A trypical panic attack:  I have trouble thinking and functioning mentally.  Im a vegetable.  And when I am trying to do a certain thing, like math, it frustrates me and then I loose it.  I start to cry, my breathing gets messed up, and I cant put 2 and 2 together to save my life.  Someone will try to ask me a question and instead of answering, I start crying and breathing fast, my heart-rate skyrockets, I repeat phrases like I dont know because I cant think and Im completely terrified.  This is set off by stress and a change in sleeping patterns.        Im not sure if Seroquel is a good thing even though my doctor thinks it is.  But even though my doctor disagrees, I can honestly pinpoint some bad things to this medication.  If it works for you, great, if it doesnt, we might have something in common.
Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	4	3	2	Female	35-44	10/18/2008 8:17:55 PM	This drug helps me to sleep. I don't have as many panic attacks on it, but the severe weight gain is unbearable. I've gained 80 pounds. I even had the lap band surgery and can't get the weight off. I think this makes me even more depressed. I was a 35 year old woman wearing a size 8-10, and now I wear a size 20. I am pretty sure I don't call that satisfied.

It is one of those medications you have to be careful when you're sick with bronchitis or other illnesses because you might end up hospitalized for interactions.  I had a very scary interaction with this medication and Nyquil on the higher doses.  this medication works don't get me wrong, but there are some rather high risks -- I had to go into the hospital a few times with blood sugar issues.

You most definitely have to be lying down when it starts working or else you will stumble, slur words, and possibly injure yourself while walking around. It also makes me wake feeling drowsy for the first couple of hours.

I'm thinking it's the puberty - he began having bad bouts of OCD and emense fears at night - nightmares were waking him up everynight to the point he was afraid to go to sleep. We will be going to Dr to re-evaluate his condition. He started at 25 mg and gradually moved up to 100 mg.  It did indeed work for quite awhile. 
Bipolar Depression	Darlene, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/15/2008 11:23:00 AM	I take 100 mg at night and this drug has changed my life. I am happier, I sleep great. I would recommend this drug to anyone. I am watching my diet because so many people have complained about the weight gain. Maybe if I stay ahead of the game I can maintain my current weight. I love it!

My Psychiatrist refused to taper me off Seroquel.  I tapered myself, and began to lose at least a pound a day.  However, I am now Diabetic.  There is NO HISTORY of Diabetes on either side of my family.  I have lost the weight after stopping the Seroquel, and following a diabetic diet with tons of exercise.  Thanks to Seroquel, I will have this disease the rest of my life.

I take 25mg at night and I am happy to say that this drug has really made a difference in my mood and quality of life. However, I wish that some one (aka my Dr.) had informed me about the weight gain. I'm glad that I read these comments.

The next night I then tried the 25 Mg and that seemed to work better.  Work your way up to the dose the MD wants to put you on if you get these side effects......but let them know that is what you are doing.  No Binge Eating yet.....

The side effects were difficult to deal with at work in the beginning. If you can get past that phase it can be a wonderful drug. I no longer suffer from depression, I am not impulsive, and I am able to focus a lot better. As far as weight gain, you have to exhibit self control other wise you will gain 20-100 lbs on this drug.

I cut 150mg tablets in half, and I feel like a zombie the next morning. The medicine is very effective. At times, I couldn't sleep without it but it ended up causing problems with my job. I couldn't get out of bed and would be late for work. I just stopped taking this medication for this reason. If you cannot get 10-12 hours of sleep every night, this medication is not for you.

I take 600 mg at bedtime. It helps me sleep very well and all night. It also helps me with my mood. My depression was also lessened. Im not so mopey. But this medication can make you really &quot;out of it&quot;. It's very hard to function after taking it. My heart races. And it makes me VERY hungry when it kicks in. It also makes it hard to communicate as well. If someone asks me something after taking it im very incoherent. I also don't remember things that I did while it's in my system. Like if someone calls you on your phone you answer it because of habit. But I can't really remember the phone call. My memory isn't the best either. I believe this med is the cause of it. In my opinion the side effects to me are not as important as how I feel and moods are a lot better. The side effects that i mentioned I have had for a long time. I have been on this medication now for 3 years.

It has worked fantastically for me.  I know a lot of you know how these manic times and depressive times can feel.  I felt like I was literally losing my mind.  I have been taking this drug for 6 weeks now and I am so happy that my doctor prescribed this.  I take it just before I go to bed at night, and it helps to make me somewhat sleepy and help me fall asleep easier.  My problems with sleeping have been helped as well as the bipolar.  I have not had any weird side effects.  THIS DRUG WORKS for me at least.  At least give it a shot.  You might be surprised.

The side effects can affect your activity. Two hours after taking the drug I get really dopey or drugged. I can also have some dizziness or tremors in my hands. But, this does disappear after a few hours. I take most of this medication at bedtime. This drug has an amazing effect on your &quot;thinking.&quot; It substantially improves your mood and encourages positive thinking. It really reduces or eliminates negative feelings or thinking.

I read the previous reviews and noticed that almost everyone said they slept the best they ever had.  I think I may sleep worse than I did before.  I take it at bedtime and it does make me sleepy.  However, I keep waking up in the middle of the night, at least 3 or 4 times.  It also seems to have made my rage worse.  Instead of having the rage building inside of me, I've been screaming and yelling and crying over my frustration.  I'm just confused about this medicine.  Maybe I need to give it more time or maybe I should just stop the medicine.

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	45-54	10/3/2008 1:00:15 AM	My Dr prescribed 100mg to help me sleep about a year ago when an increase in my dose of effexor was keeping me up at night.  It really helped me at first.  I slept great, started remembering dreams, woke up fine, my long term memory improved dramatically. Eventually I cut the dose in half as I was getting too sleepy.  That worked fine for a few months but then I was unable to wake up in the AM, having really vivd, disturbing dreams and practically passing out asleep mid afternoon.  I stopped taking it altogether a few days ago and I'm not sleeping real well, but I wake up feeling much better in the morning and I have much more energy and enthusiasm throughout the day.

It was horrible for me. After I got my dose (cant remember dose) I was ordered to go to my room promptly and get it bed. When I got home I continued on it and gained about 25 lbs. Yuck! One night after I fell asleep from it I got a phone call and I could hear myself slurring my words. It was frightening because I felt I wasnt 100% awake. I do not recommend this to anyone.

Other	Diane, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	9/30/2008 12:27:07 PM	I have been taking this medication for a year and 4 months 200 mg. made me dizzy, spacy at first for 2 months. But I think it was interacting with the other meds iive been taking. I could have a medical condition or an allergic reaction because I am hungry after I take it for bed at night. I eat like a pig becuase it dropped my blood sugar and in the morning my arms were numb. My face numb around my mouth, My skin felt hot but it was cold. I was also taking wellbutrin at that time which must have made these reactions worse.  I am now on a low dose now 50 mg and feel less depressed, less numb, less weak and tired. I'M hoping to get off this med and on to something else maybe natural wise.  This medicine maybe given me hypoglycemia abnormally low blood sugar as I have learned I have been feeling more like crap than when I first started taking this shit medicine!! I also heard it may cause diabetes! something similar to Hypoglycemia. Symptoms are worse when I was taking antidepressant pills.  Hungry then tremors, then anxiety, sweats, fatigue/weakness.  I hope someone can relate to this because I want to know what is going on with my body. When I skip my meds I feel better!!!!! I told my doctor of my reactions.  He didn't believe that could happen? Sure.  He just wants to help the pharmacy make more money when we are getting sicker!!!! this makes me angry.  I would like some answers and facts about these meds because I get the negative side effects and heard of other people talking negatively about these meds, too.  Help get me a cure.  I can't work without feeling like crap weak in my muscles, number around my mouth and arms.  this is not healthy and I gotto stay on these meds until I see my doctor next time.  This is like torture and bullshit.

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	4	Male	25-34	9/26/2008 4:27:08 PM	This medication has been quite effective in treating my depression and anxiety. One of the side-effects was unbearable when I first started it. Excessive tiredness, dizziness, and forgetfulness resulted from larger doses (300-400mg). I gave up on the medicaiton at first, but then I recently started to split the pills into 100 mg pieces and am taking them throughout the day. I can now handle the lower level of tiredness and I can actually stay awake and more alert, although I am also occasionally left to drinking caffenated drinks to help with my energey level.  Extreme tiredness(zombie-effect) appears to be a common side-effect. To combat this I suggest trying smaller doses and taking them throughout the day instead of once a day. In the two months since being on this I have seemed to have just recently built up a bit of a tolerance, thus the zombie-effect has lessened.  I have also gained 3-4 pounds  since starting this medication.  I seem to be hungry more often.  Watch out for this as well and try to start or continue exercising. I do get some other side-effects, however they are minor in comparison to the ones listed above.

He was givin this drug years ago and we thought it was wonderful. Unfortunatly he was also an alcholic and they knew this when they told him to take 200mg a day. The said it would help him get his thoughts straight and enable him to stay sober. My brother died Feb. of 2007 from accidental perscription overdose. He had been drinking and taking this med. and it finally built up so much in his system that his heart stopped. He was 45 yrs. old with 2 kids. This medication may be a blessing for some but PLEASE take every precaution to monitor yourself on this. And don't drink!!!

Bipolar Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	9/25/2008 4:28:49 PM	I've been on this medication for a little over 2 weeks now. It's done a good job of leveling my mood and keeping me from blowing up with anger like I used to. I haven't been as depressed and paranoid since using this medication. The only down side I've experianced so far is that it makes me feel very drugged and loopy. I have a hard time working my body and want to fall asleep so I take it at bed time. I would not suggest driving while taking this medication until you are used to it's side effects. I've heard about weight gain associated with this medicine, but have not experianced it thus far. I'm on 100 mgs at night and am working my way up to 200 a night and 50 to 100 mgs as needed throughtout the day, although I don't usually need the extra 50 to 100 mgs.

It caused alot of problems for me such as increased depression, loss of contiousness at any given time, while cooking just falling to the ground, while trying to go up stairs, falling down them, dificulty breathing dizziness, I literally was not myself.  It still effects me today even though I have not taken the seroquel for the last 4 years.  I was on a very high dose of 600 mg at bed time for sleep disorder. I would never use it again, it scared me very much. I get the quivers just hearing the name of it.

Now, however, when i take the drug in the evening (200mg) i feel very short of breath and experience a severe drop in blood pressure. I have read the warnings about the drug, severe low blood pressure and the heightened risk of seizure, and am afraid i am in danger, but i am afraid to stop treatment on my own. I dont have the money to see a doctor regularly, i usually go only when i run out of meds, and i am very concerned for my health. i no longer know whether the benefits outweigh the risks. if there is anyone else who has had this experience, please reply.

I weened myself off of seroquel due to concerns...Now, I regret it...Seroquel really helped me with my anxiety...it made me less nervous in different situations and made me more comfortable with myself...and I kept my weight up....it also helped with my insomnia...Without it, I am a mess...the paranoia returned...I can't sleep again...(I am back on the adderall again) I was taking Straterra but, due to personal reasons like the seroquel I stopped taking it...I lost weight again because of the adderall...I was taking Lunesta to help me sleep but, I broke out in hives and my behavior and mood swings were worse than ever...I suffered loss of memory which never happens...Adderall is not meant for petite adults that are underweight...(I am perfectly healthy and eat like a horse...always have...I never had a eating disorder and I still don't) mental illness is a horrible thing...I suffered from panic attacks and anxiety since I was in grade school due to endless amount of harassment from classmates and teachers...I no longer have depression either...:)

He is also on Topamax (200 mg per day)  He has no say in the matter.  He cannot speak for himself.  He has been diagnosed as both autistic and Schizophrenic.  They will not do an MRI on him, even tho I keep requesting it.  He has gained 30 lbs, most of it around his middle.  We have diabetes in the family.  I am most concerned with the weight gain but the Dr. feels they don't want to rock the boat if he is doing relatively well.

Nearly fatal on two separate week long occasions. On both occasions over 24 months seroquel alone was used under two different psychiatrists. Side effects were suicidal efforts and complete loss of control resulting on $100,000 automobile crash. Both of these were symptoms never even closely experienced under any other medication.

Bipolar Depression	ellebee67, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	9/7/2008 3:49:16 PM	Been on a ton of dif meds for Bi-polar disorder (rapid cycling), this one seem to work the best so far.  I don't have the weight gain and it's the best night sleep ever! I have accidentally skipped a dose or two and couldn't sleep for a couple of days (50+hrs). I fall asleep fast and stay put for 9+ hrs. I did have a hard time at first w/waking but now I am learning to take it earlier (which is difficult, I work 2nd shift), and get up earlier.  I tend to stay awake the rest of the day as well.  No tiredness through out the day.  But if I take it and I am not in bed, I do tend to feel a bit &quot;drunk&quot;. I did my homework a bit before taking.  I knew a lot of people said something about weight gain. So knowing that before hand, I curbed my normal eating habits and changed them into healthier choices.  I have increased my activity level as well.  All in all I have lost 12 lbs.  My moods have leveled.  I am a bit more organized. And I am trying to be a bit more hands on with my kids (ages 16 &amp; 11).  I also picked up a hobby which normally I would never do.  I will write back if I have  down side, or an episode. I hope you found this helpful and I hope it helps you see a different side to this medication.  Good Luck.

I have been taking 200mg of lamictal in the morning and 50mg of seroquel at night.  Sure it may have different effects on people, but for me, it is amazing.  I actually feel stable. I haven't felt this normal  in. . . I don't know.  Forever.  If you are just starting.  Give it a chance.  Let it get in your system and do its thing.  Nothing is going to be a miracle overnight.  I had been on Effexor for three years.  I am still on it.  We are going to start my taper at end of September.  I am a little worried, but I know  that what I sm taking now is working. If this med doesn't work for you.  Don't give up.  You and your DR. will find the right one for you.  Everybody is different.  GOOD LUCK EVERYONE!!

His symptoms have been brought under control, and he feels like himself again.  We consider it a miracle drug!

Sometime during the night I went into my livingroom and somehow wrecked my whole apt.! I woke up on the rug and realized what I had done. I told my doctor what happened and at that time he took me off the seroquel. Now I am back on seroquel 100mg. three times a day. So far, I seem to be adjusting to the seroquel.

All this guy would do was dope me up on different meds, but he was most successful when he prescribed me the seroquel.  I only weigh 102 lbs but instead of starting on low dosage I prescribed on a 100mg pill.  I was suppose to take it every morning with other medication.  I could not remember the day, I would pass out, in class, driving.  I try taking only 50mg but my day still had felt surreal. Eventually I decided to use it as a sleeping pill, it worked, but i never got up.  Or when I did get up I felt as though I was suffering from a hangover.  Unless you are looking to be a zombie or sleeping beauty,  I would recommend this pill.  But if you are trying to start enjoying life and becoming part of it STAY AWAY!

It didn't work. It made me spacey and sort of sleepy, but was ineffective.  After reading the side effects and reviews, I cut the 300 mg tablet into parts and gradually took it the first night. I did the same for a total of 3 nights. On the day after the 3rd night I had an outbrake of acne...new for me. So, I quit taking it and am hoping the acne will clear up soon. It has not been a good experience. I hope this drug works for you if you are considering it. I won't take it again.

In a 1-2 wk. period (while in hospital) they brought her up to the full dose. (A psychiatrist at a good teaching hospital later told us the dose should have been built up to over a 3-5 month time span). When she went back to high school, she had what they call Word Loss where she would raise her hand to give her interpretation of a poem and she would have trouble expressing what she meant to say and it was very embarrassing for her. She almost got in an argument with the teacher and she is not the type to do that.
Manic Phase of Manic-Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	8/16/2008 2:04:05 PM	A couple weeks ago, I had a manic episode with psychotic features. I was on Geodon and Lithium when it occured. At the hospital I was tapered off of the Geodon and started on the seroquel. It wasn't until I had reached the 600mg at night dosage that I was able to finally sleep eight hours. However, I do wake up often during the night. I have been on the 600 mg dose for over a week and my psychotic symptoms are finally starting to fade. Because of Seroquel, I wake up drowsy, foggy, and have a dry mouth. Also, the severe perpetual hunger caused by the seroquel has just about driven me crazy. I am determined not to gain weight on Seroquel so I am toughing out the hunger and watching what I eat for the three meals a day I do eat. So in summary, the seroquel took a little while to accomplish its task and its side effects are bothersome. I am hoping that the side effects will disapear once I become accustomed to this drug. I don't know how long that is going to take because with Geodon it took three to four months before the side effects disapeared. I don't know if I can be severely hungry for that long.

After taking it at 6pm I am up to 10:30 - 11:00pm.  Started it when i was mixed, now I am high with no help insight. My doc and I are trying everything. I mixed Geoden last week but had weird side effects, such as feet feeling weird, alwaye needed to be streched all the time. Plus i had weird deams. I also take Lamitcal (200 mg) every morning. 
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	8/2/2008 1:23:55 AM	My Dr. gave me Seroquel for insomnia. Sometimes 50 mg works better for me than the 100-200 mg he has me on. I cut them and take what I feel I need to get a full nights sleep. I have had no side effects, but couldn't imagine trying to take them during the day.
Other	Rosecap,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female		8/2/2008 12:04:03 AM	I have taken 25mg of seroquel at bedtime to help me sleep as prescribed by my Dr.  Now I have tested positive for diabetes type 2.  I didn't know there was a class action law suit for this situation.  No one told me that this medication could cause diabetes,even in such a low dosage.  I am angry.  I would like to know how long it stays in the system after you quit taking it.  Can anyone answer that????

Other	Stacy , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	7/28/2008 10:13:29 PM	My doctor prescribed this to me after no results with other sleeping medications such as Lunesta &amp; Ambien. I am not bipolar so I was very hesitant to take this when reading the drugs &quot;use&quot;- I'd consulted with other people who have taken/are taking it and it did not hear too many good things. I wish I stuck with my gut instinct, I took Seroquel for less than 2 weeks and my depression worsened, suffered from depersonalization (which had never occurred before), I felt nervous/shaky without physically shaking, and zombie-like and very negative. I noticed that I had trouble handling small problems, I took them as the end of the world. I also noticed that my blood circulation was impaired, my hands would go numb, more so right when I'd woke up. I can tell it has still not left my system, I just don't feel like myself. I know this is a good medication, it is just not the right drug for me and I feel it was prescribed in bad judgment to me especially with hypertension. I also gained nearly 7 lbs in the two weeks.

Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/27/2008 5:57:37 PM	This is the first drug in 15 years that has controlled my bipolar disorder. Both during my usual bipolar depression and during my manic states. i feel reconnected to my family and life. i sleep better, not anxious, worried. i don't have the dillusions, voices, or paranoid behavior. what i learned from many doctors one drug does not work for everyone, but most important is the right DOSE. my doctor and i had to adjust it for a couple of months. now at 300mg it's perfect for me. the first 6 weeks was the worst until my body adjusted. now i feel great. it's saved my life.

Bipolar Depression	 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		7/26/2008 4:52:39 PM	Thank god for this drug. I finally have received the help I need. It took my new doctor a while to find the right dosing for me. The lower the dose, the more I would sleep. The higher the dose the better normal sleep I have had. My depression and self esteem and life control is much better. It took many psychiatrists to finally figure it out. None of them completely understood all the past meds I was on and the weight gain I experienced on all of them. The uncontrolled movements with all the other drugs. With this drug he told me first few weeks I would feel sedated, but that it would pass. Told me to ONLY take it at night couple of hours before bed, watch my diet, eat better as most drugs have you gain weight. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/26/2008 10:24:13 AM	This medication has been wonderful for sleep! The company should get this FDA approved for insomnia. I had drug induced Akathisia from SSRIs and the Seroquel was the one drug that helped me get a solid 8-9 hrs sleep. Sometimes I take it if I'm having a lot of anxiety as well.

Other	Misschichi,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		7/25/2008 12:31:00 AM	I found seroquel very ineffective in helping me to sleep. I would take the pill and be awake for hours and hours, feeling groggy and hungover, but I still could not fall asleep until the late hours of the morning. It also made me ravenously hungry, I gained 2 pounds in less than a week. Alos, I was very grumpy and irritable the next day. I wouldnt mind the side effects so much if I could get a good night's sleep, but I don't want to gain weight while having the unpleaseant experience of feeling like the living dead all night, only, getting a couple of hours in the morning if I am lucky.

I tried to commit suicide and that landed me in the nut ward. Well they put me on Zoloft 25mg daily for depression. Needless to say I got really Moody,Manicy and angered very easily. I have been on Seroquel now for 7 weeks. Im gaining weight but when ur 28 and weigh 93lbs thats a good thing for me. I do get up throughout the night and find myself eating not just normal food I want chocolate. I eat excessive amounts of it so im a lil scared of the diabetic side affect so im trying to watch that but all in all I really like this medicine because I feel good about myself. No more mood swings and being mean and whatnot. The suicide thoughts are GONE. I feel great. Still tired for bout 2 hours in the morning after taking it but for my happiness back ill deal with that. I guess to avoid turning diabetic i need to slow down on the chocolate but I DO find this medicine seems to be working well for me. I take 200mg in the morning and 200mg at night about an hour before bedtime.

Gained weight the 1st yr and have since lost it. I will try taking it earlier at night.  and perhaps alternating bet 125 &amp;150/Don't know what else to try.  Abilify does not seem much better. Have at times difficulty swollowing,&amp;restless leg, memory but it is being tired that bothers me.

That night was the FIRST night I slept more than 2 hours total in 14 months! I actually slept for 10 hours, and I rested, not just closed my eyes. I had been going, non stop, for 4 and 5 days in a row with a max of 4 hours of sleep TOTAL! It has been a life saver for me! I did find out the hard way, though, don't take seroquel and codeine at the same time... I took a teaspoon of cough syrup with codeine when I was sick and my pulse was BOUNDING and at 155bpm for over 3 hours. I fell asleep convinced I was not going to wake up. MY husband sat up and checked my pulse constantly for HOURS... It finally came down to 110 after 6 hours. NEVER AGAIN!!! I was given 100mg to take but I MUST have 12 hours to devote to sleeping if I take that much.  I get by with 8 hours with taking 50mg. It seriously saved my life, and my marriage... I'm not quite as moody and &quot;snappy&quot; because I'm not exhausted.

I take 100mg at night and I fall right to sleep. I started on a smaller dose and we built up to the right dose for me. The only down side is I have to have at least 9hrs to dedicate to sleep, otherwise I am really tired the next day. If you feel like a zombit then u need to cut back on the dosage or take it earlier in the evening. My Doc says 1-2 hrs b4 bed and this works for me.

I was once up to 650 mg a day. I was a complete mess. Seems to me this drug is given to every recovering addict I have met. The weight gain is gross and I am already so insecure that this med makes me hate myself, really aggressively hate myself.  I have cut down to 25-100 mg at night and am on lorazepam 3x aday as well. I dont know Im not feeling so great.

Other	pill geek, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	7/1/2008 12:29:53 AM	Been off and on this med since 1999. First, 200mg a night, then down to 25mg a night and then up to 50mg a night, I stopped it and tried to switch to Topamax---BIG mistake. Topamax made me very ill. For the last two weeks I was having severe abdominal pain, which no diagnostic test could diagnose - abdominal and vaginal ultrasound. I couldn't eat. I stopped the Topamax per physician's orders, and just started back on 50mg of Seroquel at night. Today was the first day in a very long time my stomach did not hurt as bad - meaning this medication works for my ANXIETY, my IBS. I was wondering why I was becoming so restless and irritable during the days, I think I finally figured out that Seroquel helps my anxiety and I take 50mg for sleep. I tend to be an addict, so will not take Lunesta, Ambien or the like. I also take Suboxone and Librium, and I have been able to cut down on the Librium since starting back on Seroquel, it really helps my PTSD symptoms in the morning - I was wondering why I was getting panic attacks when I woke up - - because the Seroquel had been out of my 'system' for over 2 months. The only thing I worry about is that my heart tends to beat irregular, and now my physician believes I am pre - diabetic. I could lose a good 30 Lbs., but I also eat tons of veggies and ride my bike as much as possible. I do not sit and watch soap operas and eat Ding Dongs. I haven't gained much weight from Seroquel, my eating sugar is to blame for my weight gain. Interesting how I had to play doctor to find out why I was feeling so horrible - I thought I had something seriously wrong with my abdominal pain. Still not sure what effect this medication has on our hearts.....hotstuff70 at peoplepc.com

I started it about 2 days after it was approved and during my third trip to the psych ward. I did have the low blood pressure/fainting if I didn't lie down asap side effect for about 3 yrs. I still take the same 150 mg dose every night. If I go without it (due to pharmacy or holiday hour confusion) I get really cranky and paranoid and confrontational. I used to have really vivid dreams and found that Effexor made the dreams so vivid that everything was in extremely bright color and I could touch, taste, smell. Really too psychedelic and I felt so tired when I woke up. I'm on Lexapro now.I would suggest Dialectical Behavior therapy as well as medication. I can function much more normally now and blend in socially so to speak without behaving like an a** and feeling like everyone is against me.

At times, the weight gain got to me, but I have never been happier and functunal. I dont know how it did, but it also stops my palms from sweating. Even if I miss a dose for one day, they will sweat again. I am much less intense, I get sleep, and I live a positive life. The only problems are weight gain and sleepiness, but with a good diet and exercise, the weight can be managed. Im narcoleptic, so I already take something to keep me awake. I thank God for this medication!

I take 50mg an hour before bedtime and I sleep through the night. I never knew what a good night sleep can do for a person. I have not had any side effects. To me this is a wonder drug and would reccomend this to others. 
Bipolar Depression	K.B., 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	6/14/2008 3:10:57 PM	This is a horrible &quot;dirty drug&quot; that now has a class action lawsuit going on against it.  It has terrible long lasting side effects.  For me, I tried it for a couple of days and felt so horrible, like I was having the worst hangover in my life.  It did not help me at all for treating the increased agitation and &quot;ticks&quot; I was suffering from. I am already very overweight and don't need the added weight gain, either.  Be careful and away from this stuff.

It has brought me out of the dark despair of the depression from being in a mixed state. At first it made me very sleepy,iv'e been on it now @ 2months.I can now see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.I still have no motivation,and am unable to work,but it does make life bearable for me. It is a Godsend for me. The weight gain is not a welcome side effect.

I have been taking it for 10 years, so the major dip in blood pressure and immediate need to lie down 15 min. after taking my evening dose of 150mg has stopped. It has kept me calm and non-violent and the inability to see things objectively is gone. Nothing is a wonder drug. If you have Borderline Personality Disorder I would suggest Dialectical Behavior Therapy as well a drug therapy. I feel so much more able to blend in with society rather than feeling paranoid and angry and blaming it all on others.

This drug has been a life-saver for me.  I have severe depression and PTSD and I've been taking around 600-700mg at night.  It helps me sleep, it helps with the intruding flash-backs and suicidal thoughts I really used to and seldomly do have still.  I'm taking other medicines, but this is the only one that has consistently worked. I have gained weight, although I'm unsure of if it's because of it, (my dr. says it's not), but I'm alive and I owe a lot of that to this drug.

Started at 75 and currently at 800 mg spread out daily. Mania and depression are both aided satisfactorily. Side effects that were part of Zyprexa are drastically lessened: increased appetite, hypersomnia, and cognitive hindrance are wonderfully diminished in comparison. Nasal congestion has been a significantly annoying problem, particularly with sleep. Tiredness is also noticeable, but not worse than with Zyprexa. Strangely, effects can be erratic: a dosage that often quickly puts to sleep can have a much more muted effect the night afterwards and has required me to take 50-100% more to fall asleep, without the presence of caffeine, chocolate or other stimulants. This odd inconsistency has been constant since day one of taking it.

So if any one out there fits this catagory here's your info. I also suffer from depression and sleep problems according to experts. When i useed 200 mg of Seroquel in recovery phase  made me sleep the whole 8 hours, but it failed to make me drowsy. i had a little groginess but not unbearible. While in relapse phase it made my heart beat incredibly fast and caused me to have an anxiety  problem. My recomendation if recieving treatment is the hot topic in your life, stay off drugs.. but in case ya can't; here's wat ya wanna know.

At first there were too many side effects, probably from the trauma to the brain. Of late I have found it very effective at 600 to 800 mg, few dside effects.

I have few mood swings and when I do, they are milder and shorter in duration.  Side effects are inability to concentrate sometimes, and memory problems.

Bipolar Depression		4	3	3			4/22/2008 6:13:46 PM	I took Seroquel for a year. I found it very hopeful with my episodes, anxiety, and depression. However, I gained 40 pounds while on it. It helped me sleep very well, but I was very groggy in the morning. The doctor reduced the amount I was taking, and the grogginess went away. But the weight gain was terrible
Bipolar Depression	scorpio481,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female		4/22/2008 1:51:10 AM	I have been taking Seroquel off and on for about a year.  I have tried to take it daily, and while it does help me sleep, I am still groggy the next morning.  In fact,  I am on the lowest dosage, 25mg.  I recently went back to the dr and he has also prescribed Lexapro for anxiety and Xanax to take while I am at work.  While I do feel that Seroquel has helped me this last year, it is difficult for me to take it daily because of the sleep and grogginess.

Have been on a minimum dosage (50 to 100 mg) per day for some five years.  The reduction in &quot;bad dreams&quot; has been marked and with 30 mg of Lexapro per day the previous anti-social behavior that I exhibited at times (i. e. very short fuse) is essentially under control.  The usual chores allocated to me have become much easier to perform.

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	4/19/2008 5:13:10 PM	I was given this medication to initialize stabilization for Bipolar Depression.  It worked for the first week, then lost it's effectiveness.  Dosage was upped and I gained 45 pounds in three weeks.  It then took two months to get me off of the stuff.  It's horrible.  The withdrawals even at a low dose are equal to opiate withdrawal.  There are much better and safer medications out there that aren't as expensive as this drug.  With my insurance paying 80% it was still $150 per month.  Astounding.  There is also a class action lawsuit being filed against the company because it causes diabetes from the weight gain.

I had to pay $150 for the seroquel and only $6 for my Trazadone.  I took the Seroquel anyway and 2 months into it I can not afford to buy it as my insurance is no longer valid.  Even if it was I have not the financial stability to afford it.  So now I go without for a week now and feel less than emotionally stable.  It worked great when I had it though.

Been on it 2 weeks.  Headaches, raving anger, and dead asleep the first few days.  Started at 25,50,100,150.  Paranoia mostly gone but sleep from 7pm to 11am.  Need to work. Dreams oh yes.  Most of all heart pouding and crushng feeling in my chest, asking to get off it scares me.  I have heart disease and stroke in my family.  Zprexa worked great in past too much weight gain though.  Abilify never got high enough on dose cuz it was sedating.  Same with seroquel but tried it this time, took 2 weeks out of work. Still tired and want to try abilify again.  Does that make you gain?  I was only ever on 15mg.  Doc says heart stuff not from medicine but this board says otherwise.

Your child is not in danger (like a child with juvenile diabetes who you dont help administer insulin, that IS prosecutable, youre scenario is not) If your doctor is not listening you need, absolutly need to switch doctors asap. you have to be extremely careful with what you put in your body. My husband whos 26 is still paying the price for medications he took when he was a child. They were new and innovative and didn't know the long term effects, well... now he's suffering from them.  If you feel something is wrong, do something about it. Get someone to listen. You only have one body. and you have to speak up for your childs.   
Other	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	2	1	1	Female	13-18	4/8/2008 10:41:34 AM	My 17 y.o. daughter was on this med for nearly a year.  Dr's had maintained the benefits out weigh the side effects.  Not so in her case.  She has what we are told may be irreversible tremors.  She had severe loss of appetite and nauseau, which in turn she responded by refusing this med on many occasions.  She was admitted to a different facility and they immediately stopped Seroquel and began Risperdal-M, a disintegrating tablet and also Cogentin to combat the tremors. It is important to keep in mind that bad side effects play an important role in treating disorders, especially in teens when these side effects are visual to others and they are prone to reject meds if they associate negative experiences with treatment. Listen to your loved ones concerns regarding their treatment and know that ill side effects can outweigh the benefits.  There are other options.

Bipolar Depression	Nay, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/2/2008 3:27:40 PM	I was diagnosed with Bipolar II in August 2008. I had severe aggravation, anxiety, couldn't relax, insomnia, irrated easily, most of the time isolated and couldn't work to boot. I went to a psychiatric nurse practioner and she started putting me on Lamictal and klonapin for sleep. After two times trying Seroquel, the second time was the better. I think the Lamictal had to balance my mood first and my body got used to that way of functioning, more calm. My sleep is much better, can sleep through the night at 50mg at bedtime. I feel so relaxed during the day and more confident I can get through my days. Not inhaling alot to relax. No weight gain yet, but I am excercising regularly and eating right. Please don't give up on medications as Seroquel might be helpful especially with sleep. You,ll know right away with the sleep. I know we are all different and we all need different dosages or meds. but it's nice to know that Seroquel works fast for sleep and in my case three days to see the calmness. I have read so many reviews, and thank you to all who have helped me find Seroquel with yuor inspiring stories.

A week later had gone by after starting this medication I was on the phone with my dad and I felt like I was a magnet and my entire body felt like it was going to puddle onto the floor. I got off the phone with him, called the ER and told them what was going on. They told me to tell the person who put me on the med to take me off and to find something else. My heart felt like it was going to explode. I collapsed on the bed and passed out. I woke up sometime later and found myself not being able to move, talk, nothing! I could hear my heart. It was so slow it was pausing at times. I was scared as hell. I couldn't move, but I had tears freely falling from my face. Woke up hours later, went to a counseling appt (not the nurse that gave me the med). She saw how I was and was amazed at what that med did to me. My speech was slow, it gave me amnesia (i honestly had convo's on my cell and never knew i had them!!!!) It was a horrible experience and will NEVER go back to that drug again!!!!! 
Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/17/2008 9:12:47 PM	I was on 300 mg for bipolar/anxiety/sleep but I was still very anxious.  My doctor told me to do 450mg.  I did that for a couple weeks but then my doctor thought the Seroquel was adding to the anxiousness so he took me off it completely.  That was a huge mistake.  I did not sleep until he put me back on it.  I was also more anxious again.  When he put me back on it mainly for sleep he told me to take 300mg and if that didn't help to take another 300mg.  This drug has helped me in many ways.  It is very sedating so I only take it at night.  I sleep very soundly, too.  My husband will come home from work at midnight and we will have a conversation.  I won't remember a word of it the next day.  This is a side effect that I am more than willing to live with, though.

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	25-34	3/15/2008 1:24:44 AM	My doc prescribed this to me to treat anxiety, and to act as a mood stabilizer as well as a general calming drug.  Day one of taking it...tried a 25 mg tab and about 30 minutes later was so drowsy I could hardly stay awake.  A couple of hours have gone by and it seems to have tapered off to a nice calm effect.  I will probably get more used to it as time goes on.  If anyone wants to take this as a sleeping aid, pop 50 mg and night, night...:)

How can they do that? Find something that works without a lot of side effects and make it unavailable? Seems irrational, but typical of the big pharmaceutical/governmental control system we have in the USA. 
Manic-Depression	wenpoo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	35-44	3/12/2008 12:13:03 AM	I was started on this medication Seroquel after a manic-depressive episode. I was in the middle of cycling phases. The M.D. put me on 100mg and after 3 days bumped to 200mg. I had a severe nerviousness, low b/p, general body weakness. Always question your doctor about what they are using this medication for(diagnosis) and request that you start low &amp; graually go up as needed. As a patient you have a right to ask questions. If the doctor gets offened, then you need a new doctor. I left a program because I felt the doctors were not listening, but always telling. Now I will find a new program. I do recommend education via mental health facilities. You will learn more at a facility than at most doctors offices, unless you find the best doctor ever, but don't count on it!

It significately decreased impulsivity, anxiety, and mood swings.  I also get a good nights sleep with it.  It does increase appetite, though.  To me, the benefits way outweigh that side-effect.

I sleep 8-10 hrs and am still groggy for hours in the AM. I am confused and have memory issues since on this. My Dr is dismissis of the labwork that is supposed to be done every 3 months or so, so I insist on it, while I try to find another Dr.Thanks to the person who mentioned the sleep eating! I began doing that suddenly and did not know it was the Seroquel.I would not recommend this drug and want to get off of it, although I don't know how I'll sleep.* The lady who posted that she only takes part of her 300mg tab - all of the strengths I've used are NOT scored, so you should not take part of these. The medicine is NOT evenly distributed if a tablet is not scored, or have a line down the middle.You could still be taking 300mg, or 200, or anywhere in between.

Yes, I have had some weight gain (10 lb) but the mood stabilization is well worth it.  I decided to take this drug as an alternative to Depakote, which after five years had lost its effectiveness for me.  I am more level headed and noticed my personal relationships with others improving.  I am also less inclined to use alcohol as a cover-up/coping mechanism for my depression.  This drug makes me VERY tired instantly.

I used to be a trim size four but as a result of the medication and the increase in appetite, I am now a size ten. Though it does help me sleep, it sometimes make me feel dizzy and nauseaus. If I happen to get up in the middle of the night, I bump into things. Recently while getting up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, I hit my head,but I was so groggy I didn't realize I had hurt myself. My vision has blurred, I sometimes get pain in my body when I'm sleeping and I wake up in the morning feeling sluggish and drugged. On some days I have such a hard time shaking the fogginess off that I am completely withdrawn.Additonally it has made me severely constipated. Also with the weight gain, I'm extremely concerned about becoming diabetic. My mother was bi-polar too and she became diabetic from her medication-a year after acquiring diabetes she passed away. It's extremely frusterating to have to choose between your mental health and your physical well being. I'm sure that seraquel works fine for some, but it is not a medication I would recommend.

Seroquel has been the med that has given me the most competent help so far, as being able to live my life in  what one would consider the highest quality terms of every day living. As compared to any other med I've used. Yes, there are some effects one must watch, as Seroquel does have the tendecy to cause an excitement of the Pancreous. One can adjust to this possible deficency, by the avoidance in consumtion of the amounts of sweets and or sugar one uses.This is benefit to the overall health for the person who is currently using Seroquel, as excess sugars are a huge problem in our diets today as a whole. Any elimination of such excess sugars is a win/win senario with one who is currently using Seroquel.If one continues to use excessive amounts of sugars in their diets, this can have the effective disabling of ones pancreatic functions by leading to Diabetic conditions, which are as I noted earlier easily avoided by strictly limiting your sugar intake.

Schizophrenia	bjr28, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	19-24	2/10/2008 6:27:27 PM	Although my psychiatrist loves this drug, I found it totally ineffective. Moreover, it gave me constant headaches, slow (but persistent) weight gain, and, perhaps most importantly, it made me sleep all day, which rendered my totally dysfunctional.  I have found Abilify (surprising, I know) and Zyprexa to be much better at treating the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and, most importantly, allowing me to operate at a high level of functionality.  Given that all the anti-psychotics work differently, it's worth a try, but I have found Abilify and Zyprexa to be superior drugs.  In Seroquel's defense, however, I have heard that (for most people) the sleepiness wears off after a few weeks; it just didn't for me.  I would talk to your doctor and do some research about the other anti-psychotics (Abilify, Geodon, Risperdal, and Zyprexa) before taking Seroquel.  Lastly, be careful at first b/c you will not be able to drive or operate machinery &amp;c. &amp;c.

I started with 100 mg and have slowly increased over the year n 1/2 to 600 mg.  It takes care of my insomnia about 95% of the time, have not had any manic episodes in a year.  This is the most stable I have been in a LONG time.  My only fear now is I may have to stop taking it because we want children.  It's a good drug for some, just start small and adjust as needed by talking to your doctor.

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	25-34	2/6/2008 9:46:25 PM	100 mg for the first time made me sleep for 2.5 days causing me to get fired from my job. I also experienced extreme &quot;hangover&quot; from this,,, extreme lethargy and not energy or motivation. I now take 25 milligrams... it is great for insomnia, for other issue with mental diseases, I see how it could shut off the brain and kill that race of thoughts in the mind while you are trying to fall asleep.don't think I like this though. Good luck to those that it works for or for those trying it for the first time.

Manic-Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	2/3/2008 8:47:41 PM	i have been taking this for 1 &amp;1/2 years.I also take effexor.I divide my life in 2, pre and after this med. My life has changed so dramatically, in a good way!I can process info,am not in a state of panic and self loathing, and confusion.Now that my thinking has cleared up, i must face the crazy things i did in the past,and the troubles i have had all my life, it is very difficult and sad.My illness ran my life before, not me.I am grateful that i can now stand back and really think about things ,big or small, the medicine allows me to have the luxury that&quot;normal&quot; people have all the time.I am 55 and for the first time in my life i get to hear the words in songs I've heard for 50 years, so simple yet a profoundly different experience,as i was never able to comprehend even such basic stuff before.The &quot;psychotic&quot; stuff has slowed down too. It's great to be able to sleep every night.I tried easing up on the effexor, but immediately had the constant body pains that i had all my life, so the combo is what works.I no longer have  my physical,emotional and mental life filled with confusion and pain.Weight gain has been the biggest problem, i have gone from 150 to 180!!!,a dry mouth, and receding gums concern me.Also a series of skin infections on my feet continuously.I sometimes have bad heartburn, but perhaps this is also due to weight gain.I am rarely sick, have fewer colds or headaches than before.I cannot take the summer heat, and find that sweating comes with any physical exertion at all.I am concerned about raised sugar levels, I seem to crave sweets.I also am thirsty a lot.And finally, the price is outrageous-$760 for one of the seoquel prescriptions. My health ins. does not pay for scripts, but was the only ins.I could find that covered mental health.My health ins. is my biggest monthly expense, more than house etc.It is clearly discriminatory for those of us needing meds and mental health coverage.Despite the side effects, I cannot imagine living without it.
Bipolar Depression	LibertyRayne, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	2/3/2008 2:35:34 AM	I agree this med makes me very sleepy... at least for the first week or so. I'm newly diagnosed as bi-polar and this is the first treatment we tried because of I've also PTSD nightmares/flashbacks. I have to say I actually sleep now, of course, but after the first week of taking the med I'm not drowsy during the day and I feel stable. I've had one panic attack in two weeks, two &quot;manic&quot; episodes in a month lasting less than a day each, and my depressive days have been cut dramatically! If you're looking for a miricle drug, there isn't one. This isn't for everyone. It can't work for everyone-- nothing can. It sucks, get over it. But I'd recommend trying it to any one with bipolar or PTSD with the caution to take a week off and adjust fully to the new med. I'm now taking 200 mg at night and 25 mg three times in the day time and I work a full 40 hours a week.

However, I have to sleep 10-12 hours a day- but that is worth the terror of a psychotic manic episode where I couldn't sleep at all. The weight gain is awful. But for me to be able to think straight and not have racing thoughts and disorganization is worth all the side effects (oh, yeah-edema in legs, dry mouth and slight shaking).

Personally, I would recommend Seroquel as an alternative to Zyprexa for anybody. The side effects are a bit similar, but not nearly as acute or inhibiting. If you're considering Zyprexa for a psychiatric disorder, Seroquel is probably a much wiser choice. It's a more advanced drug, and it doesn't impair your cognitive abilities or motivation like the older ones do. It will increase your appetite, but I've found that side effect to decrease over time. The biggest problem, though, is that it will be very hard for you to wake up the first few mornings as your system gets used to it.

He's a 9 year old male.  First it made him start to eat alot but that was good because his other medication makes him not eat.  Then I started to notice that his emotional outbursts were getting worse within the first 20 minutes of him taking the medicine.  Then he started to get headaches from them and they progressed and got worse.  It was getting to the point where I had to pick him up from the school nurse 1-2 times per week because he had such a bad headache.  I recently took him off all medication and decided i would rather deal with his behavior than to keep on the medicine I didn't really think was helping all that much

I was unable to drive, go to work, and function to do anything that I would normally do. Not everyone is the same, but that is my experience. It was rather scary. I did ween off the medication and it was the best thing I have ever done. Just a side note- Apparently there are some suspicions about seroquel being linked to Diabetes, I would talk to your doctor since everyone is different.

I feel rested at night, but not overly sedated when I wake up. I did gain some weight, but really needed to since my manic phases lasted one to two months, and I wouldn't eat much during them. I would recommend trying this medication. Also if you read that someone is overly sedated and they are taking 2 or 3 other medications, it's probably safe to say it could be the combination. Of course you also have to consider what extra cirricular drugs these manic patients are also trying.

Bipolar Depression		2	5	1			1/16/2008 8:34:05 AM	Takes all emotion away. You feel like a walking zombie. But most of the medications for bipolar do that so it is hard to tell if it is the medication or just you. Also makes you gain a great amount of weight and none of the doctors will admit it is the Seroquel doing it. You will sleep walk and just pass out in random places. Talk and scream in your sleep.In general -- HORRIBLE DRUG! Should be taken off the market!!!!

Her many years of not being treated for a multitude of psychotic behaviors while living alone (paranoia, racing thoughts, aggressive behavior, insomnia, delusions of granduer,etc.) has vastly improved with Seroquel and she became a rationale and caring human being and was able to sleep well for the first time in her life. She did gain weight, but was under-weight to start with, and has developed swallowing problems and has had to change her diet.Her doctor just stopped her dosage 2 weeks ago (cold turkey) after no negative symptoms presented, and she has just ended up in the ER and psychiatric unit at the hospital after becoming verbally and physically abusive to her caregivers and was removed from the facility kicking and screaming. The doctor has stated that he thought that since she was on such as low dose, she didn't need the medication anymore. We are investigating the whole situation, but are stunned that her doctor would remove her from the drug when she had been doing so well on it.

The only advice I have for some people is to take the prescribed dosage as directed never more!  The medication is very strong and you might even need someone to watch over you as it is extremely tranquilizing.  Keep some type of snack close by because it can make you get the munchies too.

I take 200mg along with 1500mg of lithium, 30mg of abilify, 200mg of trazodone and 150mg of lamictal. I guess the way it works for me is that it knocks me out for about 18 hours a day. I can't function while on it, since I feel so groggy and continuously tired. Half of the time, I can't even open my eyes. It does help with the sleep, otherwise I'd be up for days at a time. But as far as the mania, it hasn't helped me much yet. Maybe because I'm always sleeping and the time that I am awake, I'm irritated, moody and very anxious. Maybe it will get better in time though.

I have been treated for Severe Clinical Depression for 20 years I started on Seroquel 2.5 years ago after I found my usual antidepressant losing it's effectiveness. I have never had the &quot;manic&quot; or &quot;up&quot; side of Bipolar disorder but have found this RX effective in treating my symptoms. Finding the right dose is always trial and error but I find that those who don't have a positive result haven't given the medicine an appropriate amount of time to work. Yes, when I started taking Seroquel I was a walking zombie for a week but with each subsequent dose I felt the side affects less and less until they were gone.

I am pleased with the results but without insurance, it has cost me over $300 per month to keep my bipolar disorder in check for ONE of my 3 meds.

Bipolar Depression		4	4	4			1/2/2008 1:34:06 PM	The first night on this medication I had some crazy nightmares, but it didn't last. I have been using this medication for about 2 weeks now. I finally feel normal. No mania, no depression. I am &quot;foggy&quot; in the morning, but I work through it. The fogginess wears off quiler if I drink a lot of water in the morning.  
Other		4	2	4			1/2/2008 12:13:53 PM	I was given this medication to help me in my recovery (methamphetamine recovery). When I went to treatment I was paranoid and delusional from the drugs. I am afraid that if I hadn't been given seroquel, I may have never came back to reality. The big problem though is that seroquel is extremely sedating. I fell asleep standing up on this stuff. Use extreme caution!

This medicine has work for me in controlling the anxity, I can sleep at night, I can be productive and not worry about everything imanginable, and it has helped with my OCD symptoms.  I do not take a high dose, it is enough to relax me.  My husband was taking a high dose at night to sleep and he would go into a state of being unable to function and then would eat several large meals in the middle of the night and wake up drenched in sweat, I don't reccomend a high dose.

I've been told that it is NOT addictive, but I have to disagree with that. I once stayed up for 15 days and nights straight. When I am out of meds, I feel jittery, anxious, moody, Can't eat Just not good at all. Sometimes wish I would have never taken this to begin with. Now I can't get off of it.

I began hallucinating.  I couldn't distinguish dreams from reality.  I still to this day swear men built a house down the street from ours.  I can describe exactly what they were wearing while building it, everything.  I called my doctor numerous times and was told NOT to stop taking it after only 2 weeks.  I finally stopped because i nearly killed my boyfriend.  I broke through our bathroom door and beat him with a flat iron.  I also slashed my wrist.  After a visit to the ER begging social services not to commit me I was given Ativan for a week.  Thank God I didn't kill anyone or myself.  I still have terrible facial spasms.

It also changes or rather improves your mood to one of more positive than negative. And, you can function and think while using it. The only issue I have is that when I take it at night, I'm drugged, but I sleep well. It has also caused some blurred vision and tremors, but this is minimal considering its effectiveness.

It took me quite awhile to get back to being my old self again. I don't suggest taking this or any drug that you don't absolutely feel you need.

I suggest you research this side effect, as I have also had it with Compazine.  If you have this side effect with Seroquel you may also have it with certain other tranquilizers. It's a rare but very serious side effect...research all your meds if you have this side effect!  PS I was on this medicine for two weeks with these severe side effects before my doctor would take me off this Seroquel.  It took my husband to tell him I was in severe pain before he believed me.  Why are Bipolar people dismissed so easily?

My moods swings are less severe now and I'm not as angry anymore. I'm more patient too. I do on occasion still have my &quot;bad days&quot; though. I take 100mg before bed and actually sleep whereas before I'd frequently go days without rest. Higher dosages gave me severe RLS and had me feeling cold one minute and hot the next. It also made my eyes extremely sensitive to light. On the 100mg dosage my 2 complaints are weight gain of around 30 pounds and a strange congestion of my upper sinuses that leaves me breathing through my mouth at night.If I forget to take a dose I will not sleep at all. I'm scared of the possibility of this medication causing diabetes as my father is a brittle diabetic. I eat very low fat meals, little sweets and drink only diet soda which has kept my blood sugar levels normal so far.

My doc told me that i needed to make sure i didnt have anything to do the rest of the day when i first took this...within a half hour i literally had to crawl to the couch and passed out for 4 hours.  i was supposed to take 100mgs a day, i couldnt function, so went back to just the lithium.

Bipolar Disorder in Remission	AliveAtLast!!, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	11/19/2007 8:28:35 PM	Following my Psychiatrists advice, I started with a beginning dose of 25mg per day and ramped up to 600mg per day within 2 weeks.  I have currently been on 600mg for about 13 months.  I went from being a hopeless 30+ year alcoholic (apparently self medicating bi-polar II), with frequent in-patient treatments, to a recovering alcoholic sober for over a year now.  I have no doubt that Seroquel saved my life.  I went from the brink of suicide to the most &quot;together&quot; I've felt in my 53 years.  The only thing different with my alcoholic treatment strategy this time was the Seroquel.  I've noticed a couple of posts saying Seroquel has some &quot;street value&quot; for drug abuse.  Hmmm....I would think that is the case only if you wanted to SLEEP on the street.  This stuff puts you in snooze mode, so take it before bed.  I have noticed absolutely no surreal or feeling high characteristics.  It does give you hunger fits, so you need to religiously follow Doctor's instructions and get regular blood work to test glucose levels, cholesterol and triglycerides.  You also need to work a responsible weight maintenance program.  Not too hard to do when your head is screwed on straight like Seroquel has done for me.  My anxiety level went from an extremely high level to what I perceive as low.  The world is now a pretty good place to live.  I should note that I am also on 325mg Effexor XR (SSRI) per day (past 5 years) and have no idea if the combination has somehow given me outstanding results. All I can say is Seroquel RULES for me.  Your mileage may vary.

I would be up all night and sleep in the day. I guess you could say I was nocturnal. I had pretty much dealt with that for years, though. I was diagnosed Bipolar without the extreme manic episodes. This medicine is not bad, I had no problems except sleepiness, and extreme hunger. This is technically an anti-phychotic drug, but popular and used quite frequently. I would suggest starting out on a very small dose, say 25 mg. &amp; work up from there. I was taking 300 mg a day, but then stopped the medicine for a while, and now use occasionally at night. 25 mg knocks me out now. You do get used to it in higher doses if you up your mgs slowly and take it everyday. But, beware of the side effect of hunger because if it's not nailed down YOU WILL EAT IT! (oh, but not so bad in small doses)

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	11/14/2007 5:40:21 AM	Took my first dosage (25 mg) at 9 p.m.  Awoke at 7 a.m. the next day, feeling very groggy, slightly nauseous &amp; sensitive to light.  I lost consciousness about 7 minutes after waking up, likely due to a drop in blood pressure.  The fall resulted in serious injuries (cuts and bruises) and a concussion, and a trip to the ER.  I would advise starting treatment on a day you can devote to assessing how you react.  I personally was advised by ER Doc to discontinue.

Taking along with Cymbalta 60mg for the depressive phase currently on 300mg of Seroquel now. Overall, I wouldn't trade the drug for anything in the world. It is the ONLY thing that helps me sleep at night and after many years of me working with the drugs I finally have my disorder under control. The only downside is that I was diagnosed with diabetes this year and the only cause we can come up with is prolonged use of Seroquel. I have it well under control now and it may go away if I am able to come off the drug but I'm willing to live with it for now, I am that pleased with this drug! I have been to the dark side of bi-polar and I am not returning! Hope this helps!

Taken off in 2004, since my primary doctor found I had Type 2 Diabetes, which Rispersal may have caused. There was no other know cases of diabetes in my immediate family.  In Jan. 2005, I started feeling hostile toward people and feelings of anger and destruction were brewing. I didn't like this, so my doctor put me on Seroquel's lowest dose.  Within a month I was so much better. Calmer, less hostile, sleeping better. This year I noticed I was not having same results. Now take 200 mg before bed. Sleeping better, calmer and much more rationale.

When I started taking it, I thought it was a miracle drug: it got me to sleep quickly (which covers anxiety and insomnia) and I was to groggy to feel anything, including sadness.  It sort of worked at first, but steadily lost its effectiveness at zoning me out, and its appeal. Over the course of six weeks, I gained 60 pounds;I was eventually diagnosed with pre-diabetes. This medication did NOT help me, I thought I was doing better because I was in a daze most of the time, and too groggy to realize what it was doing to both my physical and mental health. I go to a small theraputic school, and of all the kids there who have taken it, I have never heard of any good it has done for teens. I'm now on other medications, and struggling to lose the weight Seroquel left me with. This medication tampered with my memory, my health, my personality, and my mood.

She prescribed increasing doses of seroquel, ending at 200 mg per day.  After a few weeks I developed targives diskenesia with drastic lip and tonque thrusting as well as leg thrusting.  My wife reported this to the doctor who was sure that this would abate after I used seroquel for a period of time.  Luckily my wife looked up diskenesia on the web and found that it could become permanent.  After a few more weeks of symptoms she insisted that the doctor return me to haldol.  In a matter of days the Targive symptoms started to disappear.  I am no longer going to change my effective treatments for new drugs pushed by ill informed doctors.
Other	up all night, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	10/17/2007 4:53:33 PM	I have severe tnnitus ,a high pitched sound  24/7. Along with Labyrinthitis for the past 22 months. I cannot sleep because of the loud sounds .I have been on almost every drug to help me sleep. My Dr. started me on Seroquel 100mg. along with 15 mg. Flurazepam I just had 2 nights of sleep,then 2 nights of on and off sleep.I had 1 full week of no sleep at all in May,when we tried Rozerum. I was so sleep deprived I could not even stand up on my own. Being only 102 lbs. and 48 yrs. old I want something to work for me. It has been really hard on my husband and our 2 children. My Dr. says we might have to up the dose to 200mg. to sleep. I can only hope a larger dose will do it for me. It is so hard to function when you are sleep deprived. I have done vestibular rehab therapy with a physical therapist for the past 20 months.My vertigo and dizzy, nausea, and walking and normal daily life has changed drastically.Symptoms are worse with less sleep, I hate living this way, but it could be worse, so I need to try just about anything.Hypnosis didn't work either.
Other	infp76, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	10/17/2007 11:33:08 AM	I use this for chronic insomnia at 100mg and have been on it about 3 years. I started at 50mg but needed a dose increase after about 1.5 years. I've noticed that 100mg still puts me to sleep but doesn't give me that &quot;whoa&quot; feeling when it kicks in like it used to, and also takes longer to kick in. But it still works for me when nothing else has. I tried ambien at 10mg but it took 50mg (over the course of a few hours) to barely put me to sleep for 4 hours. I also tried trazedone which had the opposite effect, and some samples of Lunesta which were too weak. Given all this I'm not even going to bother with Rozerem. NOTHING puts me to sleep and keeps me asleep like Seroquel. It has been a lifesaver. I've gained a little weight but that's because when the drowsy kicks in, hunger kicks in as well (side effect). But I'm just lazy and give in to the hunger without considering other options to curb the hunger, or consuming less fattening foods before sleep.Note to people reading this for insomnia! Most general practitioners have little/no experience with this drug, and won't feel at all comfortable prescribing it for insomnia (let alone what it's intended for). You will most likely need to see a psychiatrist for a Rx. To a psychiatrist, this drug at a low dose (~100mg which is plenty to sleep for most people) is no big deal to them. I never heard of this when it was prescribed to me so I did some searching on google. I read some horror stories with the drug (mostly weight gain) and didn't even want to take it but when it knocked me out the first night, I haven't skipped a night since. Most of the horror stories you'll find are the exception and not the rule. Talk to your psychiatrist and they will most likely confirm this.

THis is the Only Drug I feel like myself on. I hate to have to take meds, but I DO NOT feel like a zombie on it. The first time I start taking it, I was Super hungry for sweets, that goes away after 2 weeks. Plus it doesnt affect my sex drive like the others do.  :)

It made me hallucinate and hear things. It made me shake and scared the hell out of me. I also tried to smother my husband because I thought that he had kidnapped me!!
Bipolar Depression	Jazz, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	10/12/2007 11:19:09 PM	I'm having mixed feelings about seroquel and remeron since I was taking both at the same time. I gained so much weight, my cholesterol hit the roof and I also started loosing my hair.  It did help my to keep me stable and helped me sleep (although taking 200mg of seroquel and 60 mg of remeron is probably enough to put a horse's light out).  Sorry but the side effects have been a bit much and too stressfull for me to handle.

The medication claims that it will decrease halunciation, provide the user with a sense of control. Well all the things this medicine said it claims to decrease, well for my mom they increased and I was terrified.

The combination probably saved my life. My concerns with Seroquel are the potential side effects and I think that it mixes badly with alcohol. I've had several experiences of complete loss of memory from having just a few drinks and I think that I've narrowed it down to Seroquel. If I have to choose between life or martinis, I'll choose life!

My 8 year old son takes 500mg.  He is diagnosed with Mood Disorder NOS and ADHD.  He is also on Focalin XR which makes him not eat all day so I give him Seroquel in the evening and he eats for 2 hours staight.  He does not have a weight problem, actually he is a bit below average.  The dose I give him makes him lethagic (it is meant to) so he can sleep.  The med is also supposed to help curve his impulsivity and aggresiveness, which it does seem to do well.

I noticed a HUGE change after 3 days of using it. I like not  being angry all the time and it helps me cope with a very stressful sales job. I dont like the weight gain part of the medication, but a little more excercise doesnt hurt anyone and actually helps with the stress.

I have been taking for 2 months now.  It is a miracle drug for me!  I take 50 to 200 mg., but usually take 100 and 150 if I had restlessness the night before, which is now rare.  Thank God for sleep, a return to dreaming, and Seroquel.

It worked for both depression and manic.  One of the side effects of this drug is that is can severely raise cholesterol and triglyceride levels to dangerous levels.  I wish I could have remained on Seroquel, it was the best I've felt for many years.  Only now I have to take additional meds to reverse the effects so I don't die of a heart attack! But I do miss the &quot;normal&quot; feeling I had when taking it.
