Underactive Thyroid	Debbie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	2	Female	45-54	8/13/2012 8:46:48 AM	My tests showed low thyroid but had few common symptoms. I also have IBS D and take Prozac for that and that really helps. I have been on medication for 12 days and am very fatigued, irritable, sometimes depressed, and have constant body ache. Hard to say if this drug is helping though my doctor said it would take some time. Since my cholesterol shot up 150 points over the last two years I am hoping this drug lowers it. I have also noticed my voice is raspy all of the time. Have to say, I am extremely frustrated as I am generally in good health. could be my age too!

Cancer of Thyroid	Lorie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	6/22/2011 7:58:33 PM	Since the removal of my thyroid 11/2009 I've been on this medication, the doses has been adjusted which helps with keeping the TSH levels within range.  Unfortunately, my weight has increased from 169 lbs to a 223, doesn't matter if I diet or not. I try to remain active, I've gone from working out a minimum of 30 mins per day to approximately 3 or 4 days a week and I really have to push myself to do that, problem is the next day after working out, I am so exhausted and ache so much that that I can barely move the next day. I have sleep problems, muscle aches (even without working out) and pains, little hair thinning, always cold, tired, brain foggy, forgetfulness.  I'm pretty sure that these complications are side effects of the medication..

Also didnt know would cause red face which I have sinse taking this, feel tired, chest pains that I didnt relate to the med. but see as a side effect, think its time to get off it, I got on it bcs was told it could help w/ fibromyalgia pain and chronic pain, but it hasnt in over a year. Comment on severe shoulder pain was interesting as I also began having to take injections for arm and shoulder pain, possibly from this too?? Im stopping this very soon, guess I need to wean down.

Underactive Thyroid	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	2/26/2010 9:36:34 AM	I have been taking this medication for treatment of an under active thyroid.  For the first several weeks, I felt my heart was racing and I was very irritable.  I stuck with it, as my doctor said that my body would possibly adjust to the medication.  It did.  I took it for close to 7 months but had occasional chest pain, which I didn't know if this had anything to do with or not.  I also developed a stomach ulcer, so I stopped taking this med for about 5 days during which time I felt somewhat more tired and cold.  I decided to start taking it again after my stomach felt better.  I took half a tablet.  I felt horrible.  My heart started racing again and I felt like I was running a marathon but at the same time, I felt tired.  Hard to describe.  I also noticed my EXTREME irritability with everything around me, including my family.  The bad thing is, I have no idea if this drug is even doing what it is supposed to be doing because my thyroid hasn't been rechecked.  I can't take a drug that makes me feel this poorly.  It's not worth it.  But what is the alternative?  I am on the lowest dose possible.  VERY FRUSTRATED!!!!!
