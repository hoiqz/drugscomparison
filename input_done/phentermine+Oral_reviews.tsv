Overweight	LooseBritches, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	8/19/2012 2:07:35 AM	I have been taking this medication since June 10th.  Beginning weight was 253 and now at 227 in about two and a half months.  Weight loss was 14 lbs for first month and 9 lbs for second month.  I am currently in the third month and have dropped around 4 lbs so far.  Doc said to expect 6 to 8 pounds from here on out and that I would continue the medication as long as it is working.  I weigh in once a month.  The only downside for me has been side effects.  During the first week only:  insomnia for five days and excess energy.  After one month I developed excessive dry mouth and numbness in the middle of my lips and on the tip of my tongue...a tingling sensation that feels like I've just put something minty on these areas.  I have occasional constipation, constant dry mouth, but no problems with sleeping, palpitations, or excessive energy.  I am eatting about 1300 calories a day, exercising about 3 or 4 times a week (the hardest part for me), and have no food cravings.  I often have to remind myself to eat, even after 11 weeks of meds.  I have added daily vitamins, including calcium, D3, and a complete vitamin, to my diet.  I get one daily serving of dairy, one carb, veggies, fruit, and protein  (meat, nuts, legumes, peanut butter: one serving of one type of protein at every meal). I have occasional treats such as frozen yogurt or chocolate.  I have about 85 lbs to go and am expecting it to take around 12 months. I have been overweight since my late 20's (40ish now), but never taken diet meds before. I have dieted a few times before, but always quit because food cravings drove me absolutely crazy and I would blow the diet, gain weight, and get discouraged, eventually gaining back the 30 to 50 pounds that I lost over time.  Every month that I don't gain weight is a victory to me.  Good luck to you all.  I hope this is helpful.

Overweight	Herc's Mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/1/2012 9:25:27 PM	I've been taking Phentermine for a little over a month. The first week was amazing - I lost a pound a day consistently.  It has sort of plateaued and I haven't seen the drastic daily weight drop but I've lost 18lbs so far.  I am doing this in conjunction with My Fitness Pal to police my calories and reading online about the diabetic diets as my doctor told me to follow a diabetic diet. I had started exercising 3-4 days a week and cutting back on portions (not necessarily making healthy choices though) 5 months ago and had completely stopped losing weight so my doctor suggested I try this. The dry mouth is more of a annoyance than anything else. I forces you to drink a healthy amount of water which I needed since I am typically not a water drinker.  Appetite suppressant 100% for me, I am never hungry - its a matter of breaking the habit of boredom eating.  The constipation is no bueno and I find that to be the most frustrating but I also wonder if its because I put too few calories in my body now and it goes into starvation mode.  I have about 25lbs to go.  I am hoping by remaining on these for another 2 months that will happen.  Overall I am really happy with the results and minimal side affects.  I have tons of energy though I am OCD about the scale now.
Overweight	TEE, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	7/31/2012 11:35:42 AM	I had a gastric bypass 4 years ago.  My starting weight was 277 and I got down to 204. I didn't lose as much as I would have liked but I still lost alot. After years of suffering with anemia and my menses being so overly heavy, I had a hysterectomy in January.  Although I felt much better, I gained 20lbs which I can not seem to get rid of.  I went my Dr and he said he could do a revision to my pouch which would require surgery.  I had so many problems after the gastic bypass that I do not want to undergo another surgery so I talked him into prescribing me Phentermine.  I started taking 37.5mg once per day on Sunday, 7/29 and I weighed 220. I weighed myself this morning and I weigh 210.  YAHOO!  I would like to get down to 180 so I am well on my way.  I do not have the cotton mouth but I do have the headaches which I am hoping will go away in time.  I love this pill although my doc is not a fan.  Screw u doc, just keep them coming until I can lose 30 more lbs because you will not be cutting on me again!
Overweight	Thinkthin464, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	2	2	Female	45-54	7/24/2012 7:05:05 PM	I am a 47 year old female and started taking this drug one week ago.  The benefits, it really helps with weight loss... I lost 6 lbs so far.  Downside for me... Side effects.  Dry mouth which was fine just drank more.  Insomnia, kept me awake if I took it after ten am.  I took a 37.5 mg the first day, didn't sleep a wink so I took only a half the rest of the week, did much better.  I dealt with a headache every day but not too severe but I didn't like it nonetheless.  The worst part happened last night... My lips, eyes and throat swelled and I started with asthma having difficulty breathing.  I did not like the way I was feeling at all!  Thank goodness for Benedryl and rescue inhaler!  I wish I could keep taking it but the pros don't outweigh the cons for me.  Good luck to everyone else.

I just finished my 3rd month and went from 213.4 pounds down to 189.6. I'm taking it one more month and that's it. The only side effects I have are dry mouth here and there and constipation. I'm working out 3-4 days a week and using portion control. I think I've shrunk my stomach in size. I've also lost inches, 6 total.

Overweight	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	7/11/2012 3:35:11 PM	I have been taking the pill for 3 weeks today.  My doctor had me take a half pill for the 1st 4 days to curb any side effects.  I have only had the dry mouth problem but it makes me drink tons of water a day which isn't a bad thing.  I started at 215lbs and I asm 195lbs today.  I have drastcially decreased my portion sizes but still it mashed potatoes etc.  I have also started excercises 3-4 times a week.
Overweight	Bwine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/10/2012 10:30:08 AM	I am almost 35 years old.  I have been taking this medication for a little over a month, and have lost approx. 17 pounds so far.  I am taking it in conjunction with a low carb diet plan.  It definitely helps with appetite suppression and with cravings.  I haven't had sugar since then, and don't really crave it.  I have some increased energy, but not the shaky or nervous feeling.  It may cause you to be super hyped up in the very beginning, as it did for me for about 3 days.  I do experience the dry mouth, but have become accustomed to it, and just carry water with me everywhere.  I have also experienced constipation with this medication.  Very pleased overall with the medication.

The first month i lost 18lbs along with healthy diet and plenty of exercise. It has helped w/my appetite and cravings a great deal. Side effects were minimal, very dry mouth , constipation and a tingling in the face area but i found them tolerable. I do have more energy when i exercise but i dont feel &quot; on the go go go &quot; like i did in the beginning. I do feel obsessed with the scale since getting the next prescription rides on me losing a certain amount by each weigh in.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/29/2012 2:44:04 PM	I started this medication in mid December. I am 5'8, I am a 32 yr old female. I weighed 236lbs. I was a person who over ate a great deal. My doctor put me on the 30mg, once a day for 3 months then changed to the 37.5 once a day. I am finishing my last month of pills now. I have lost a total of 38lbs. In the beginning I was exercising, eating super healthy, sometimes eating less than I should. Now I am very conscious of my portions, eating healthy at a &quot;normal&quot; level. I also have been doing some therapy type work on my reasons for over eating and working on those things. These last couple months I stopped taking it on weekends, because Im less busy and can plan my meals easier and to demonstrate my healthy eating behaviors without the pill. For me it worked as an appetite suppressant, I've never felt like it gave me more energy. I havent noticed any side effects but rapid heartbeat a handful of times. I am a person who has always been medically healthy has never had any health problems.

Overweight	Falling Weight, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/27/2012 3:31:17 PM	I started this medicine on June 1st and to date I have lost 18lbs. I have so much energy I exercise five days a week and the one week I didn't exercise but two days I lost 3lbs. The dry mouth issue is not that bad I just carry around my 24oz water bottle. I went two weeks without eating much of nothing since I really wasn't hungry at all. I'm doing this for three months or to lose 30lbs whichever comes first. I wish you all the best.

In my first month I lost 13lbs. I have only experienced a couple side effects. I have had dry mouth on a daily basis and slight insomnia if I take it after 8am. I have not experienced cramps like other people have said, but I am constantly drinking water. The more water you drink the better. I am hopeful and positive about continuing sucess. I am also changing my life style at the same time. I am eating better and working out regularly. If I keep it up I should lose more weight.

During this time I stayed on a 1000 calorie a day diet, 3 meals a day, no eating between meals. I also walked 30 mins on the treadmill every day.  Side effects were irritability and constipation with occasional insomnia. 
Overweight	toobugs, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/18/2012 2:30:11 AM	Update to a few posts down..I have been on this for a week and a half and have stopped weighing after losing a lb a day the first week. I can get obsessed about the scale and have had  my husband hide it &quot;well&quot;..lol. When it says Ive lost, I get HIGHLY motivated. When it says Ive gained/stayed the same, I get HIGHLY depressed. its insane I know. Side affects are the same, a bit of dry mouth, but as others said..helps to drink water, chew gum. The last 3 dys my lips have been severely chapped, almost like if I open too wide or something they will crack..yikes. But Im trying to control that. Ive been taking melatonin from the beginning because the reviews of not sleeping terrified me. I have 2 toddlers, I need my sleep. It really works, I sleep great! I cant take naps anymore though, too much energy ;)But my clothes are getting loose and a few people have noticed weight loss in only  week and a half, so thats promising. Last weight was 188.5 from 194.5. But it has been since Monday morning and today is Sunday, so Im sure i have lost more.Good luck everyone, It's worth a try!
Overweight	desperate weight loser, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/18/2012 1:00:12 AM	Last year I was on this pill along with b12 shots every week, I lost 6 lbs the first week..At the end of the month I lost a total of about 15 lbs, and that was with no excercise. I started back on these pills about June 1, 2012, I weighed in at 244 , I weighed myself today and I was at 235. Now I did get a lipotropic shot( fatburner). which Im suppose to take once a week, But instead I take B12 vitamins along with my pill. I work at night so I take it late afternoon. When I say that Im awake all night with no sign of tiredness, full of energy. The only side effect that I may have is dry mouth which will make you drink more water and some occasional constipation which Ive had as a kid. Now Im 5'6 and Im suppose to be 135-140 , but I want to be 145-150 , My weight gain came from my last kid and post partum depression from the baby. I dont have much time to excercise and my meals are usually in the late evening when I get up and I usually eat like one medium meal a day and some snacks after that. So im sure if I eat right and excerise I will lose more weight. But for now Im happy with the little weight lost.Im going to continue and try to involve excercise (start with some walking) . My goal was to lose at least 80-100 lbs , so far I have lost 9 lbs in 2 1/2 weeks. So well see, wish me luck...Its not easy and it is very discouraging when you dont see a difference.. But you have to set your mind up for this physically and mentally.. trust me its not easy

I have been taking the 30mg capsule for 6 days now and lost 6.5 lbs! I have about 50lbs more to go. Here are my side affects so far. Dry Mouth, but def not as severe as on some meds. It is not cotton mouth, just a bit less saliva which yes, drinking water does help. Other than that, a few heart palpitations, and a bit of constipation. But if you eat right and use plenty of fiber it helps. I have been trying to eat 3 meals a day, but I probably have been able to cut my food intake by half or more. Also, I was drinking a lot of alcohol before, a few drinks a day. And now I no longer even have that craving. It gives me so much control to be able to say &quot;no&quot; I dont need that. I have never expierienced that in my entire life :) It is totally amazing to have a pill change your brain and how it thinks, but thats what it does. Food, drink is no longer important, so when I force myself to eat, I can focus on fruits/vegetables/healthy grains/proteins. I am defenetly hoping I can take this until I reach my goal! I will update soon. Good luck everyone! You can do it!

The biggest help was cutting most of the sugar from my eating and beverage and eating smaller portions.  The only side effect that can be annoying is the extreme dry mouth.   I love the increase energy and am confident about my resuts.

This time I have been on prednisone for 2.5 years and picked up over 100 lbs.  Now that my disease is in remission, the doctor and I talked about weight loss.  Gastric Bypass is out as is the Sleeve as it requires being sedated.  With my lung condition that is not an option as being put to sleep is too risky.  So I opted for the pill.  I have lost 20 lbs in 2 weeks.  Yes, it does take your appetite away but that is the sole purpose.  Doctor said 1/2 the pill if I find I am not eating at all.  As for constipation mentioned by other increase your fruit and vegetable intake.  Craps and headaches mean your potassium is low.  My blood work is tested monthly for my lung disease.  I am just so glad to be getting the weight off.

First week was rough, energy up the butt...but I am actually able to go to the gym now and not get tired after 10 minutes. My only complaints are the occasional headaches. But, to fix them are extra vitamins and a few extra bananas. Biggest complaint, the constant teeth grinding habit I've developed. My back molars are SHOT. I think this medication should be prescribed with a teeth guard.

I have already lost 14lbs! In the past couple days though I have realized a nasty taste in the back of my mouth and shortness of breath it't not too bad just a little annoying. I go back on Friday for a check up to see how everything is going I guess I'll bring it up then.

Overweight	Anthony, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	5/11/2012 11:39:56 AM	Started take this medication on 02/09/2012. lost 60lbs 3 mos. later. However, you must help yourself by resisting temptation and working out on a regular basis. I have not expierenced any side effects at all. I try to mentally positive about myself. This is a marathon (no pun intended!) we are on and no pill will do all the work for you. Love yourself and keep the faith and the weight will come off. 
Overweight	AZgirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/10/2012 1:57:34 PM	I just started taking this today. I am taking half a pill of the 37.5 as suggested by my doctor. I took it right before I went in to work at 5:00am. It is now almost 11:00 am and I am not hungry at all. So far so good. I did eat a handful of celery sticks and carrot sticks. Although I am not hungry at all, I don't want to starve my body. I've been very thirsty and already I have drank more water than I drink in a day. I am 5'2 and 182lbs. My goal is to be at 130 lbs, which I was before I gained all of this weight. That's a 52lb weight loss goal. Prior to Phentermine, I have been doing crossfit 3 days a week for two months but it hasn't worked for me AT ALL.

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	35-44	5/5/2012 11:35:27 AM	I started taking this medication because I have tried diets and exercise and could not lose any weight so my doctor did some blood test and then decided to put me on this and I have lost a total of 42 pounds and feel great.  I take it in the morning around 10am and have lots of energy, I don't get tired as easily and I have stopped snoring and sleep better at night.  I would suggest this to anyone who needs help.  I also did not have any side affects. 
Overweight	dukeydonkey, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/2/2012 11:47:29 PM	I started taking this med per my doctor's orders. I was unable to get my weight under 200 pounds no matter what i did. After only 7 days, i have lost 6 pounds! It takes no effort on my part and i no longer have the urges to eat out everyday. I take the 37.5 mg pill in the morning once a day, and that's it. The only side effects i have had was insomnia the first 2 days, but that went away, a dry mouth sometimes, and i get a bit moody sometimes. By late afternoon, i get a little tired, but it comes and goes. I actually have more energy now, and am getting more things done. I wish my dr would have prescribed this medicine for me a long time ago. I am so happy now because this is something that finally works. i have tried expensive mail order diet supplements and girdles, etc. I am totally recommending this  medication to friends and family that could possibly benefit from it.

Overweight	Linz0, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	4/25/2012 2:52:58 AM	I started taking this medication 3 weeks ago, my first 2 weeks were great. I had a ton of energy and slept like a baby the whole night. I was taking a 15 mg pill twice daily along with a b12 vitamin, I lost 5 lbs. the beginning of my 3rd week I wasn't as lucky... I began getting lightheaded and waking up every night around 1 or 2 am with nausea and the feeling of my head spinning. I tried taking both my pills in the morning as my doctor recommended with plenty of water and it seemed to work for a day but here I am 3 am wide awake and feeling like I'm going to cry from lack of sleep. My energy has since dropped but I want to stay on this medication to help me lose more weight... I started at 332 and am now at 319.Anyone have any suggestions, or should I just quit while I'm ahead? I hate the way this drug is currently making me feel!

Overweight	Ivory, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	25-34	4/22/2012 11:30:11 AM	I was perscribed this medication by my doctor to assist me in losing weight faster being that I work out monday-friday at my local gym and have been for 1 1/2yrs now. When I was put on phinermine, it made me sweat under my armpits very bad, but lasted for only a wk. I weighed in at 183lbs, in a matter of 10 days + the gym I lost 5lbs, over the next few weeks I lost nothing. The medicines started making me severly tired, down, depressed, mood swings, head pressure like I was wearing a fitted hat that would not realease the feeling of pressure would stay all day. I would try to eat and I would feel extremly full for HOURS!!! along with the pressure feeling on my head. It was like a nightmare. To sum the feeling this medicine gave me was severe anxiety, depression, whole body drainage to say the least! I tried stopping for 2wks, and started it back up to give it another shot before I gave up on it. I have a doc apt 1st thing in the morning, I use have such a high happy energy all day, a busy body! when I started taking these.. I have little to no energy and I feel awful all day!

I have now lost 25# of it Yea!   I am wondering is this med used to treat other problems? Here's what is going on sence I started this med. I have always felt like the world was speeding by me, and I didn't understand many things in life because of this, when I started this med. about two weeks in, I noticed the world slow down and I have been able to understand more. I have learned more in the lase 3 months. I was daignose whith a learning disability when I was 8 years old now I'm wondering if it's something else and on a side note due to PCOS I do not have a menstral and I have had one for the last 2 months at the same time of the month and that has never happened in my 32 years does anyone have an in site? Thank you and please forgive the miss spelled words, I have just started to learn and understand the the placement of letters in words:)
Overweight	prettygirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/11/2012 4:25:27 PM	I started taking Phentermine 2/13/12. I lost 18lbs the first month.  I've changed my eating habbits; no soda, bread once or twice a week, and pasta once a week. Baked chicken breat, yogarts, berries, fresh veggies.. So far I have had little to no exersize. The first month I didnt really have any side effects.. I've just been starting to have slight irritability, some headaches, and feeling tired. 4/13/12 I will be starting my 3rd refill. So far in 2 months I've lost 28.5lbs. I can tell that the pills aren't as affective as they were the first month.. After my 3rd month I will probably stop taking them and do the rest on my own. 
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/7/2012 6:51:57 PM	I am 28yrs old, 5'6&quot;, and 235lbs. For 6 mos I've worked hard to change my eating habits and have been taking cardio kickboxing classes 3-5x a week plus power walking, getting really strong and tone but without weight loss bc my appetite was insane with the workouts. My doc thought I was an excellent candidate for success bc I'm so active, I just need to control my hunger. So now I'm on day 3 of Adipex and I've lost 4lbs already! I've only eaten 900-1100 calories each day, I have to remind myself to eat more to not get too low cals. It is so liberating to not have hunger consuming my thoughts. Dry mouth is an immediate minor side effect, and I also feel more &quot;alert&quot; but not jittery. At this rate I should be to my goal 175-180lbs in 2-3 months. Hopefully my stomach will shrink bc I'm eating small portions, so the hunger won't come back with a vengeance when I'm off this pill.

I have changed my eating habits but I don't have much time to exercize. The dry mouth is one of the worst symptoms so far. My goal is to lose 45 lbs. in all. The fact that I am under 200 lbs. makes me very happy because I havn't been under 200 since High School. I hope to continue my good eating habits after my Dr. takes me off the meds. If you keep a good mindset on your eating and not beat yourself up if you slip a little you will succeed.

Overweight	wannabthinagain, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/3/2012 7:31:59 AM	Ok, so I was on this medication 10 years ago and i lost 75lbs!!!. BUT BE CAREFUL!!! my dr even told me, now Amy you have to keep exercising and eating right after you stop taking it. im like yea yea...well i've gained all of it back and then some. (i had another baby too) but still. So, I know it works. I started taking it again and I get headaches?? does anyone else? and what do you take for it? 
Overweight	Sunshine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/1/2012 11:21:40 PM	I started on this drug 2/8/12 and weighed in at 264.5 lbs. The next day I noticed a dramatic drop in cravings and appetite, but an increase in energy with no jitters and a feeling of euphoria. I have experienced some side effects such as dry mouth, which causes you to drink water, that's a good thing. But not so good is constipation. There are other side effects listed with this medication but I have only experienced a couple. As of today 4/1/12, not quite two months later I am down 37.5 lbs. and continue to drop everday. One important fact to consider is that this is not a miracle drug, it does require a lifestyle change of eating right and excercise. This pill works to get the weight off if instructions by your doctor are followed. I never thought it would work, I am the biggest skeptic there is b/c I have tried everything to lose weight with no success. But make the most of this medication while your on it b/c your doctor will not keep you on it long term.

I feel energized and not hungry at all. Even the smell of food makes me feel sick. I know I still have to eat,but I just find it hard to do. Right now, I only eat 1 very small meal at night. I have only experienced 1 side effect and thats Dry Mouth, but the way I'm feeling, its no bother to me. I was told that you could lose 40 or pounds per month with the right diet and excerise so I hope I can do this. I excerise 6-7 days a week along with watching my food intake. I have a goal of loseing 80 in two months, WISH ME LUCK!

I was a little frustrated that it was that easy for me! But, I been taking it for 2mos because i was not going to give up and i glad i did not. I started at 199 and i am 185 and still losing.  It works out to be 2pds a week. I guess some peoples bodies work faster then others!

I wasn't thinking about food. I was in a good mood.

I have been off and on for awhile now, and I gain the weight back everytime I stop using them, but thats not the pills fault, that's my own! My anniversary is coming up in July so I was dead set on losing weight before we go on our trip, I restarted taking the pills on 03/19, 9 days ago and I went from 297 today I am 288.6 I have been following a 1200 calorie diet to the t also! Of course i'm getting the side effects, the head tingling and the rapid heartbeat which i can easily deal with, the only thing i hate about these is the drymouth is so severe to the point it's very uncomfortable. I'm getting canker sores and sore throat, and dry lips that are cracking..but the weightloss is awesome, and i just look at it like it's worth the little sacrifice to look and feel amazing later!

It's now 3/24/12 and I'm weighing in at 227 lbs! Thats 23 lbs in 33 days. I've cut out all soda, dairy, and I've cut back on red meats. I teach very young children so I am very active almost 40 hours a week, and I know that helps me alot. I was told to take my pill on an empty stomach first thing in the morning with water, the only thing I can drink,only 5 days a week. So I take mine Monday thru Friday with weekends off. The only problem I had was my appetite was suppressed so much that I was not eating at all. After a few days of only ingesting water I started to get sick. Dry heaves, shaking, and hot flashes. I called my doctor and he said to eat a healthy breakfast, like oatmeal, 30-45 minutes before I took my pill. Since I started doing that I've had no problems. I will admit I miss soda and steak, but I'm loving my results so much more!

No program and regular exercise worked until I took the medication. However, this is not for everyone and you still have to make good choices and exercise regularly. This is not a magic pill, but another tool in your belt.
Overweight	Ms. Positive, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/20/2012 11:49:19 AM	I started the pills and I love them, I have lost 10lbs in less than a month. The pills give me plenty of energy &amp; curve my appetite. The side effects of headaches bothered me, so I stopped. Then consulted my physician b/c he started me on the pills. I was told to drink with plenty of water &amp; that explains the drymouth part and now b/c I take them regulary I hve no headaches. I also joined a 10K step program at work , so I'm really experiencing the benefit from the diet supplement pills. I give them 5 stars across the board!

I WAS ABOUT 22 THEN. IT WORKED PERFECTLY! POUNDS FELL OFF, I HAD ONLY A LITTLY DRY MOUTH. I HAD BEEN ON &amp; OFF OF IT OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. EVERTIME I LOOSE ABOUT 30 POUNDS I STOP TAKING THEM. 9/2010 I STOPPED TAKING THEM. FROM ABOUT 2/2011-NOW I GAINED ALOT! I WAS 232 WHEN I GOT OFF, I AM NOW 300! I JUST WENT BACK TO THE DOCTOR TO GET BACK ON (2/2012) AND MY SIDE EFFECTS ARE HORRIBLE!! SO BAD THAT I STARTED TO THINK I HAVE BRAIN CANCER OR SOME SERIOUS ILLNESS. AFTER READING ABOUT 100 REVIEWS ON HERE &amp; GOOGLING THE SIDE EFFECTS I REALIZE THAT IT'S JUST THIS MEDICATION. I HAVE SEVERE HEADACHES (I NEVER GET HEADACHES), DRY MOUTH (HAD A BLISTER IN CORNER OF MOUTH, SORE THORAT, &amp; BAD BREATH... ALL COMES FROM DRY MOUTH). I ALSO HAVE THIS WEIRD TINGILING FEELING IN MY HEAD.. WHEN I WALK FAST MY HEART RATE GOES UP. I USUALLY START OFF WITH HALF A PILL BUT THIS TIME I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO GET THIS WEIGHT OFF THAT I STARTED TAKING WHOLE PILLS RIGHT AWAY, THIS MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE NEW SIDE EFFECTS.. I CAN'T TAKE IT THO, IM GOING TO JUST STOP TAKING THEM. I HAVE ALREADY CUT REDMEAT, PORK, DAIRY &amp; SODA OUT MY DIET. I ALSO JOINED A 24 HOUR GYM. HOPEFULLY THIS WILL HELP ME ONCE I DO STOP TAKING THE PILLS. BY THE WAY, FROM 2/3/12 to NOW (2/27/12) I HAVE WENT FROM 300 POUNDS TO 285 SO IT DOES WORK, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY MY SIDE EFFECTS ARE SO HARSH. I HOPE THIS HELPED SOMEBODY BECAUSE I HAD TO READ ABOUT 50 REVIEWS BEFORE I ACTUCALLY READ A COUPLE I COYLD RELATE TO, PEOPLE WHO HAD THE SAME SIDE EFFECT SYMPTOMS AS ME.

Lost almost 50 lbs in about 6 months with diet &amp; exercise the first time. Gained most weight back - on again and lost about 30 lbs with diet &amp; exercise. Off &amp; on about 4 times. Fat again - back on and got rapid heat rate so I stopped for more natural approach. Love the energy, some insomnia, very dry mouth but that was good so I drank a lot of water. Wish it didn't have side effects but very easy to stop taking - no addiction.

I am pleased with how it has allowed me to jumpstart my diet and I have been able to continue to lose even after stopping the medication.  My doctor only did a 6 months trial of the medication to help me stay the course.  I started working out and keeping track of food intake and this has allowed me to stay on target.  I still need to lose 45 more pounds, howeverI feel confident in the fact that I would not be doing as well if not for the phentermine.  
Overweight	DougW, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	2/10/2012 11:42:06 AM	I have been on Adipex for alittle over 3 months now and have lost 60lbs so far. I know it seems extreme but have also made some BIG changes like quit drinking regular soda, I was a sodaholic. I started eating better and going to the gym 4 days a week with a lot of cardio. Only side effects I have noticed and still continue is that I still get the dry mouth and what I like to call &quot;trash bucket&quot; mouth it makes your breath stink to carry gum lol. 
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/10/2012 9:42:36 AM	The 1st week was the only time that I felt any side effect. Extremely thirsty and very energetic. After that, I would have to say that I had no other side effects and would recommend this and have to friends. You must diet and exercise with the medicine as well.

I am very optimistic after reading all the reviews on this site.  I currently weigh about 235 pounds and have been having a lot of back issues after some surgery I had in July 2011.  I am very excited that I do not feel hungry and its around 3 pm in the afternoon.  I havent been this excited about dieting in a long time.  I hope and pray this works for me.  I would like to lose 85 pounds, but would be happy with 70.

Overweight	LON, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	1/19/2012 12:18:49 AM	I want to share my experience with people that has just started using this or are considering it. When you first start taking it, it does take a while to get used to. It is similar to being on an upper, lots of energy, no appetite, but you do have some trouble sleeping. If you are heart healthy and have great blood pressure ( like me) I had no issues with heartbeat or my blood pressure rising. The drug worked great on me losing 30 lbs in 6 months. I was on it another 6 months and barely lost any more, but maintained well. Of course this is with diet and exercise. My doctor kept upping my dosage until the max of 2 pills a day. Then I started to get bad withdraws because I had built up such a tolerance to the drug. I was falling asleep everywhere. My body just craved more. I called the doctor and he weened me off, and believe me it was tough. Bad thing is I ended up gaining some weight back over the next 6 months. ( about 15lbs) I did not stop exercising or dieting, but my appetite and energy level went back to normal. Surprisingly, I decided to get back on it. I don't want to gain more weight, so of course I'm willing to do whatever. Been on it 2 months now and lost 6 lbs. started with one pill a day and Yesterday went up to taking an additional half pill around 3 pm due to getting tired in the afternoon. My advice is to know when to get off it, it's better not to be on it long term, so you don't build a tolerance and get bad withdraws like I did. Hope this helps you! :)

Overweight	CantThinkOfaScreenName, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/17/2012 9:37:37 PM	I've been taking taking phentermine for a week now. The only side effect so far has been dry mouth. I can't say it has kept me awake, b/c I already had insomnia (taking ambien cr for that). I refuse to buy a scale, so I don't know how much weight I've lost so far, but I feel great. I'm in college so I usually take naps after/between/during classes (lol) but since I've been on phentermine, I stay awake, alert, and energetic the whole day. I love food, but phentermine definitely suppresses my appetite. I can do one meal a day and still not be hungry. I absolutely hate working out, but I started doing yoga/pilates videos on netflix. It's hard work, but I know it will help shed the pounds faster. My advice is to do some type of work-out regiment while on this pill... just start doing little work-outs at home and work your way up.

Before boot camp, after babies and to lose the seventy pounds depression seemed to put on me in my early thirties. I find it harder to lose the older I get. Been on it a year and just got off. Didn't reach my goal but felt better and look much better. But now, I have an irregular heartbeat, headaches often and an addiction to Benadryl for sllepping. I want to smoke like crazy when I take it and talk a mile a minute. Believe me, I love how this has helped me over the years but now I'm worried my cardio vascular system is shot. The worst part is, my doc warned and was weary of perscribing it and I don't want to talk about my chest pains. I told you so...

I have energy everyday, I get up in the morning earlier and still go to bed around 11pm. I had insomnia for the first week so I started working out at least 40 minutes in the evening to burn off the extra energy. I sleep sound every night. I fell so good! I am going down in size even though I'm still around a the 10 lbs lose. This has helped be eat right by not having the sweet cravings. I am creating a new way of life with a little help from this medication. I ave very happy with the results.

I dropped about 10-15 lbs the first month alone,i continued to lose but it got slower after a little while. I do love the medication because it gave me the boost i needed by giving me energy to work out again too. Today is 12/19/11 and im now at 135.0 and very happy about it. i still take the medication but only mon, wed, and fri. I do notice that when i dont take it or forget that i do have a stronger urge to eat more so im a little nervous about stopping. Any suggestions on something natural or a way to stay full since i will probably be getting off the medication soon. Im 5'3&quot; and now weigh 135.0 so my doctor is starting to push me off of it and i dont think he wants to prescribe it to me again.

I always take a low dose rahter than the 1 and a half pills recomended per day, i use about half.  I have lost over 40 lbs and have not gained any of it back even after being off the pill for several months.  The only down fall to this medicine is the depression it seems to induce.

It calms cravings and adds a boost of energy. But remember, there are no miracle drugs. You still have to put forth the effort. And this drug has the potential to be addicting. Monitor yourself, know your limits, and stay on track. Losing the weight is up to you.

When you initially use it, depending on how much you have to lose, you'll lose 15-20 lbs. per month.  I first tried it in 2008 to lose 40 pounds, now I get a prescription every few months for maintenance and go on it for a month as needed.  I've maintained my weight loss for over 3 years.  It does lose its effect over time so you cannot take it continuously without a break.

My goal is 2 get back to 145-150lbs. I'm worried i will start to plateau, so ima beef up my workouts. My doc gave me other 30 days percription so ima make the most of it.btw, my pulse was only 73 &amp; BP was 110/76 when i went for my 30 day check up, so bad side effects aren't really an issue for me, thank God.

Overweight	Silvana, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	11/27/2011 3:31:56 PM	I went to my doctor with the following symptoms: headaches, hairloss, rapid weight gain (20 lbs in 4 month), my period stopped 4 months ago, zero sex drive, night sweats, sleepless nights, no energy. I am 40, 5'2&quot;, and 140 lbs now. I have never had a weight problem before. my sysmptoms indicate hypothyroid or menapause, so I wanted blood tests to see what is wrong with me. I am awaiting my blood test results tomorrow, but he gave me this Phentermine priscription. I have taken it for 3 days now. I feel worse, since yesterday I have flu like symptoms, but only in my neck and shoulders, rapid heart beat, I feel dizzy.  I do have to force myself to eat, but overeating was not an issue for me to begin with. I don't think I will not continue taking it, I feel so much worse, I can barely stand. I think I should wait for my results to see what has caused my innitial symptoms, I don't know why he gave me this to begin with, but I will sure call him tomorrow. I am noticing a lot of people here with weight gain that is in my range, and I must say, we are NOT obese. This medication is supposed to manage obesity not a few pounds. I am convinced the hormonal imbalance I am obviously experiencing is the reason for my innitial symptoms and will figure out how to manage that without this drug.  I do see it's working for many of you, that is great, but it's not for me.

When I followed a diet plan it worked for me very well.  I have since somewhat fallen off the wagon in regards to my healthy eating, but I'm still maintaining my weight.  I have lost 17 lbs so far and have recommitted to getting back on track.  This drug is great!

During those 3 monthes I lost approx 55lbs, I did diet and excercise (weights, running, &amp;punching bag) 6-7 days a week. I continued the same habits after I quit taking phen and continued to lose at about the same rate.

It's not much, but it's 1/2 lb less than I've been when eating perfectly for weeks. That is encouraging. The first day on it was miserable. I had horrible nausea, and felt like I was in a dream state. The second day was a little better, but it did make me very sleepy, surprisingly. I can fall asleep at night but if my son wakes me up, then I can't go back to sleep. I forced myself to eat small meals the first few days, even though I didn't want to. Now I have some appetite, but get full very quickly. So far so good, and I am looking forward to where I'll be in a couple of months.

I only  have 20 more to go!  I have tried EVERYTHING on the market and this works.  Only side effects were dry mouth and not sleeping first week.  I do workout 6-7 days a week, 4+ miles a day. All Cardio, no weight training.  Diet is still minimum and have noticed that when I do want to eat, I can't so it definately shrinks the stomach.  Pretty easy to follow and make healthy lifestyle changes...less in and more out. Looking forward to my next challege, when I am completely off the meds.

Had some side effects for about 3 days but are gone now. Like lite headness and dry mouth. I started weighing in at 288lbs and now my weight is 282lbs. I started out taking 15mgs with good feelings of fullness up until about 7:30pm. Doctors said to take another pill around noon to help with the feeling of hunger. I go back to my doctor on the 21st. So here's to more weight loss. Good luck everyone. Check back next month.

Today is my first day on Phentermine.I have struggled with HBP over the last few years, which has been controled by medication as of this year. My doc prescribed this 2 me becuz of my 35 lb weight fluctuaion during the last couple years, also my parents &amp; all my siblings have HBP which led 2 my mother being diagnosed with heart disease at 36. I'm active and I jog approx 3-4 hours a week, but my HUGE appetite keeps me from staying a healthy weight. I tried WWatchers &amp; I lost 2 pounds each week, but i felt so deprived! I was a raving bitch becuz of it! My doc has also refered me 2 a nutrtionst &amp; i hope these things combined will at least get me used to eating smaller amounts of food until my stomach shrinks &amp; its apart of my lifestyle. I did experience nervousnes &amp; dry mouth 2day, but not too bad. I don't have much of an appetite at all 2day, but I've been forcing myself 2 eat little meals &amp; drink lots of water to help the side effects. I will keep posting :)

I will say that the side effects are rough.  Insomnia and dry mouth are persistant.  I stopped taking the medication when I was about 3 pounds away from my goal.  I didn't gain any weight back but I was extremely anxious and irritable during that time.

I weighed 139..now I weigh 120..(19lbs in abt 3wks) and it worked for my fatigue, and I guess the weight loss was a bonus bc I had no clue it was for that, of course until I was wondering why in the heck I was forgetting to eat until 2 days would go by lol..i could afford to lose a couple though..I am only 5'1 and since I had my daughter it was tough to get those last ten off--so yay!! I did have dry mouth though. So, apparently yes, it does work:)

I went off of it months ago because I started to lose my hair A LOT. I wanted to make sure it was the drug vs. stress. I did lose 34 pounds the first time I was on it and was on it for only about 3-4 months, however I have gained most of it back. J stopped taking it for about 8 months. I am going to try this again and see what happens. I'll keep you posted.

I gave it high marks because i hope this medication lives up to the hype. Little nervous for the side effects. I weighted in at 288 Ibs. and is 5'7. I hope to lose weight, get healthier, and learn new eating habits. I go back to the doctors next month for a monthly check-up. She put me on the lowest mg. Only at 15 mgs to start. I'll check back in next month to let everyone know what success i have had. Wish me luck.. God bless.

Overweight	kapeters, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/4/2011 7:07:46 PM	Day 4 of taking this med.  I knew that a whole pill would be too much at once so I put myself on 1/2 a pill at 7am and the other 1/2 at noon. (I take Ambien some nights to sleep) I have no urge to eat and don't get sick like some OTC appetite suppresants I've taken before.  I do get shaky if I don't eat so I have a piece of toast or some protein every few hours.  I have a racing heart rate but that just tells me it's working - my metabolism is speeding up.  So far, no weight loss but I'm sure it's coming. The dr would only give me this for one month due to side effects. 
Overweight	Ms_Determine, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/29/2011 2:55:10 AM	with the will and determination we all can reach our weight lost goal i sucessfully lost 46.lbs I weigh 230lbs now I weigh 184 and counting dwn. with the help of this drug eating write and excercise is a must. The pill supply u with extra energy too go the xtra mile all u have too do is get it done. I found soda of any kind is a big no no that was my biggest problem it makes you tired and pack on the weight it's like liquid candy even (diet) They did a study on diet versus regular and did u know that it was found to have the same affect on the human body. I believe that every one is empowered thats why u are here rather it's for information or u are making that change in your life right along with me.I don't drink energy drinks if i wanted something tasty i drink crystal light sugar free drop in and there is also so many low calorie sugar free tasty snacks of all kinds in grocery store.I hate dieting just as much as the next but it's about getting healthy. feeling confident and feeling comfortable in my own skin and taking charge of my life. Remember to take it one day at a time and good luck....

I have no adverse side effects, but was jittery the first day I took phentermine.  I feel more energetic, and my appetite is under control.  Only got a two-week supply and have to return to the Dr. on 10/07/2011.  So far, phentermine has been great.

Day 1 was strange - I was jittery, and felt &quot;high&quot; but had so much energy and was not at all hungry.  Had to &quot;make&quot; myself eat lunch.  I did however have horrible &quot;BO&quot; from sweating so much.  The 2nd day was better - no sweating and still having to &quot;make&quot; myself eat - A little trouble sleeping at night.  I work a 8-5 sitdown desk job and have noticed so much energy - and am getting so much work done and my house work is all caught up!  I felt like cleaning the past 3 nights instead of laying around watching tv.   I have recommended this drug to my husband and my friend....I'm loving it!

I was on the medication for 3 months. I learned how to eat so now that I have been off of the medication since the beginning of July I have lost another 10 pounds because I have learned to control myself and no longer overeat since my stomach has shrunk. I had a great experience.

I know everyone's body is different so it will have a different affect.I've lost 25 pounds since June which is ok but it's tough.I excercise and have changed my eating habits for the better but it's a slow process.I feel the pills still work somewhat but the weight is beginning to come off very slowly or not at all and what I've read from the other reviewers is it worth the long and short term effects that may happen to your body...

My doctor has given me my last 30 day prescription with strict instruction to take one every other day to start being able to manage on my own.  He will not give any further refills after this one.  The medication reduced my appetite significantly and you have to remember to eat. When I didn't eat properly while taking the meds, it made me feel jittery.  Other than that it has been very helpful in managing my appetite. I was so glad to have the medication in my intial start to getting a handle on reducing my weight.  I went from 265 to 235 since May 18, 2011. I still have 45 pounds to lose to meet my inital goal weight (195). I am off to good start!!!!!!!!!!!!

Overweight	SuzB, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/3/2011 11:48:17 AM	I LOVE THESE DIET PILLS!! In August-2008 i weighed almost 240 pounds &amp; i lost 80 pounds in a little under a year, with no carbs, sugar, &amp; i was constantly moving around with my new business and all. After i met my current boyfriend i totally gained most of it back. I was back up to 212 pounds in May 2011. I tried that akai berry diet, dieters tea, did cleanses, tried xenadrine. I tried everything. I hated taking 6 dam diet pills in one day and have to remember 30 mins after or before?? HATED IT!!! &amp; no results expect my heart beating a mile a min and my house &amp; clothes always super oragnized.Then my friend told me wbout phentermine. I did alllll the research i could before investing in more BS diet pills. I saw more successful reviews than i had expected. So i decided to take them. I started July 1st @ 210-212 pounds, i am now 199. Im more focused @ work, i dont mind getting up a million times a day, i NEVER get cravings, or hunger pains! I eat something small, usually a banana or a handful of RAW nuts in the morning with alot of water to shock my metabolism into getting started for the day then down the pill &amp; i accompany it with Biotin 5000(hair &amp; nails) I read somewhere that your hair may thin &amp; i love my hair so i took precautions. The phentermine usually kicks in after about 15-20 mins.. I take the pill around 7 am.. but i think i need to start taking it later cause around 7 pm it starts to ware off &amp; i can feel myself being able to start munching.. Sleeping sometimes can be difficult &amp; i smoke (marijuana) for my psoriasis, so that helps me in the area of getting to sleep. I dont get to exercise cause im constantly working, so id suggest to you out there, exercise may help in getting &quot;more tired&quot;..I hope this was helpful =)I dont recommend this pill for people who have hyper tension, high blood pressure or already have depression issuses. Alot of &quot;balance&quot; is required. I started doing yoga &amp; its amazing. I love the results im getting from these pills.

I drink lots of water because of the dry mouth. I have so much energy. My mood is fantastic...happy all the time. I have to make myself eat cause I'm never hungry. I lost 20 lbs in 4 weeks.

I have headaches everyday, feel slightly depressed (which I have never felt in my life) and have not seen any positive results for the past two weeks I have been taking it.  If anything my hunger has increased and my desire for exercise as almost totally went away.  I have heard so many positive things about this medication, but for me it has been a terrible experience!!!     
Overweight	Not as fat, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	7/28/2011 2:27:27 AM	It has been 3 months since I started to take this and I have gone from 261lbs to 225lbs.  I am 5'9&quot; tall.  It's been a loss of 36lbs.  I have gone from a size 20 to a size 16 &amp; it feels great! After the first 2 months I took a week off of the pills.  I had gone on vacation &amp; I wasn't losing as fast as I was before.  After the week long break I started to lose the weight again.  I also will give my body a break on the weekends so I can get a good nights rest &amp; also let my &quot;system&quot; get going again as I am still experiencing some constipation.  Stool softeners help but usually being off of the pills for a day or two helps more.  I am not going to the gym as much as I would like to but it seems that I am still losing without going regularly just yet.  I am sure I will start going when I hit a plateau.  I still have no appetite and still drink tons of water because of dry mouth.  I hope to keep on the path and be closer to my goal by the end of the year.  I recommend occasionally giving yourself a break from them every once in awhile.  I find I have no problems not taking them.  I don't have any withdrawal symptoms and I don't gain any considerable weight.  I am usually back to the weight I was right before I stopped taking them within a day.  Off the pills, I ate only a bit more than when I am on the pills.  I didn't need to eat sweets and turned them down when offered.  The only real problem I have with them is the constipation but stool softeners, laxatives, fiber pills and not taking them for a couple of days seems to help.  I am feeling better about myself than I have in a few years &amp; I can't wait to reach my goal!
Overweight	ashdwhill, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	7/27/2011 12:15:29 PM	I am on day 3 of the medication. I have seen changes. I no longer crave sweets and think about food all the time. And, because I have a lot of energy I am forced to get up and move around. I am going to remain postive and not think of the negative. Everyone's body is different, but I think this will help contribute to the weight loss. I have been better at eating the proper portions. No magic pill, just a helper.

I was down 20lbs in the first 1.5 months. In the last 2.5 months i am down 30 and with 10 more to go i feel happy. The side effects however like fatigue and some loss of energy have been worth it. I am ready to stop. I have been on this now for almost a month again with the last two off.

Overweight	Linda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/16/2011 6:58:37 PM	First, I'm under medical supervision while on this pill.  I see a weight loss Dr. every week to be sure I'm doing well.  In just 6 weeks I lost 15 lbs.  Under medical supervision, I was on a strict low fat NO CARB diet for the first 2 weeks and just light walks.  Week 3, I was able to add some of the low carb veggies to my salads.  I drink 90-100 oz of water PER DAY, which is VERY IMPORTANT and my excersice still consist of light jogs/walks.  You CANNOT lose weight on the pill alone.  You have to eat healthy low fat meats &amp; low carb veggies and LOTS of water and at the very least take a 30 minute stroll.  The first week on the pill I took 1/2 a pill at wake up.  The second week I took half at wake up half at 10 am and NO LATER.  On the third week I took the whole pill at wake up and still do that now.  I have therefore had no side effects and feel better than I have in years!! I still have 30lbs to lose but I'm optimistic as this pill controls my desire to eat anything in front of me.  Without the pill, I know I'd be starving in the evening as its my usual time of increased appetite.  I'm also addicted to soda pop and anything sweet but while on this pill (and with some will power), I am able to completely skip any and all sweet stuff.  I've been on so many diets but by the end of my day I'm almost always STARVING so nothing worked until I started on this.  I'm 39 and can't wait to look fabulous and feel fabulous for my big 4-0, which has not happened since I was in my 20's!! Does this pill work?  YES, but you have to be willing to do your part in eating healthy (light HEALTHY low fat low, carb meals every 3-4 hrs, drink lots of water, and excercise).  
Overweight	chickinabimmer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	7/13/2011 1:38:38 PM	I've been off and on phen for several months.  It works very, very well.  BUT, you must learn to eat sensibly and exercise along with taking the pill-or you'll just gain everything right back.I've been working with a local physician while on phen.  My PCP was too skittish to give me more than two months worth. This guy is more liberal.  Let me say that I was in great health before starting the program, except for being 40 pds overweight.  I am still in great health.  My BP has dropped and I have lost 36 pounds.  I am only 8-10 pounds from goal.No, this drug is not the panacea.  One must be careful and pay attention to warnings.  Lifestyle changes must go along with it...

I am also watching what I eat and I am running/Jogging every day, and drink three times amount of water! I take the pill right after I eat Breakfast, I haven't had any side affects really except that I feel full and satisified after I eat which I have cut my intake alot. I have a while to go before I get to my ideal weight but I am very happy where this is going. It's been a long road having a baby and then gaining weight during that and then trying to loose it! I still keep plugging away!

I exercise quite a bit but I was eating way too much and wanted some help with my appetite...I've gotten into the habit of midnight snacking.. I was given a 1mo Rx for phentermine 37.5mg tabs about a week ago. Definitely handled the appetite issue. HOWEVER... big however. I went jogging for the first time yesterday since starting the med. My goal was my usual 4miles, but after my first 1/2 mile I couldn't catch my breath. It was scary. My throat, neck, and shoulders were so tight. I decided to walk the rest of the route, but another 1/2 mile in with power walking, I STILL felt like I was breathing like I did during my most recent 1/2 marathon. SCARY. I'm curious how long it will take me to get back to normal, and I've only taken this med for less than a week!?!?!
Other	WestCoastDaisy88, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	6/29/2011 10:21:35 PM	I'm not overweight, but I have gained a few pounds recently and wanted some help shedding them. I've never used this med before, but some of my girlfriends have and look way slim now. I started taking 1/2 pill in AM, 1/2 in afternoon a few days ago. My appetite has drastically decreased. Today I decided to go jogging (1st time to job since starting the pill). I've been running on/off for 3yrs, it's not hard for me. But today, I could NOT catch my breath. After 1/2 mile, my throat and shoulders felt so tight, it was like I had just done a 1/2 marathon- even as I simply walked briskly I felt SO short of breath. I usually do around 3-4miles easily, sometimes much more. And when I got back home, my heart rate was STILL up- NOT normal for me in the least. This med DOES suppress one's appetite and boost energy, for sure. But the cardiovascular side effects INCREDIBLY outweight the long-term use of this drug. I've experienced something very scary and I've only taken this stuff for less than a week?!?!! 
Overweight	Maximus, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	6/29/2011 7:49:25 PM	I have been taking phentermine for 9 months and have lost 90 pounds.  I started on 30 mg and after 6 months switched to 37.5 mg because the effectiveness was wearing off.  It is not a magic pill, you have to put in the exercise and watch your eating.  What it does for me is help me with the self control to make healthy choices and eat smaller portions.  It does take some getting used to.  In the beginning I experienced the dry mouth and nervousness.  Within a few weeks that went away.  The medication is cheap and doesn't involve all the complications of surgery.  Keep in mind, you can't take this and just sit on your butt.  You have to exercise and you will see the results.  I am down to 240 pounds and look forward to losing 40 more.  I recommend you start exercising and being active, and then inquire about this drug if you need help with self control and to jump start your weight loss.

Overweight	SandyMHicks, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	6/29/2011 10:04:08 AM	I started taking 11 days ago and so far i have lost 7 pounds!!!! I have had some side effects dry mouth, insomnia badly, dizzy ness is getting worse and im very irrtiable, so use caution you can experence some or all. I just keep telling my self to power through it and i can get this weight off. I try taking a sleep pill and that dosent really help either and i do take my pill every morning at 7am. I am proned to insomina anyways so i figured it would make it worse. And that could be why im so cranky ;) The dry mouth some days is very bad today is one of them so im drinking tons of water which is good. The pill oddly for me is hard to swallow so i have to get my mouth a lil wet then try to swallow it but again the pros me losing 7 pounds in 1 days out weight right now the cons. Yes the dizzy spells suck so bad i feel like i have a bad hangover so just be careful when standing up . Good luck and hopefully i can report back in 3 mths how it went!

My doctor suggested that I try this, but to start off with half a pill and see how the first few days go.  I am hoping that this gives me the help I need...I do worry about side effects...I'll be sure to drink plenty of water (both the dr. and the pharmacist told me to do that).  I'll update how things are going.  
Overweight	Lori, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	6/15/2011 9:45:42 PM	I started this medication March 2011 and as of June 15, 2011, I have lost 30 pds.The medication curbed my appetite. I also achieved this goal with diet and exercise. I also took this medication along with Wellbutrin (which help control my cravings for carbs and sweets). I am satisfied with my progress. This diet has trained me to eat more fruits and vetgetables and also let me know that I can live without or very little carbs and sweets. The one side effect that is NOT mentioned is hair breakage/loss. Oh well, I rather wear a wig, than to be overweight!!!
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	6/15/2011 11:05:15 AM	I was prescribed this medication by a doctor and just took it for the first time today. I'm having horrible side effects!! Although I'm not hungry at all, I feel like I'm high! My whole body is warm and tingly, I'm dizzy, spacey, have dry mouth, and can't focus.  I definitely do NOT have any pep or extra energy. I am NEVER taking this again! I can't wait for this loopy feeling to wear off.

I went to a weight loss clinic and got it.  It worked great for the first 3 days.  Not too many side affects, other than the dry mouth.  I felt like this med gives me the oposite effect than most people.  It actually makes me feel tired and no energy.  I didnt have trouble sleeping because I take it early(before 8am)  after the 3 days I feel like it is not working anymore.  I ended up cheating on my diet and eating Olive Garden and boy did I pay for it.  I had diahrea all night.  I tried skipping a day to see if maybe I just got adjusted to it already but still not working very well.  I still feel I could eat and eat.  I am still taking it because I do feel it mentally helps me from over eating.  Instead of having seconds for dinner, I just eat half and thats all I eat.  No more snacking after dinner or at night. I have loss about 8 pounds so far so cant complain.

I weigh 157lbs, weight loss is not needed i still eat with it, but fixing to go thru divorce and believe it or not i am off depression, anxiety, and other medicines well tolorated no problem, energy out the rear able to spend more time with my children which i wasn't able to in the past...due to lack of energy and severe depression Phentermine does wonders but some people disagree. EVery body reacts differently. I have no woman parts ( full hysterectomy done at 22yrs old) so i feel less of a woman, but other than that i feel great. I hope all others agree, can be addictive, that's the only problem, i have knocked out 4 medicines because of this. I hope someone else can get the same relief &amp; results i did, and knock out other medicines. I have suffered severe anxiety &amp; depression since hysterectomy, but now i am  great.Feel good! I hope this helps someone else, most doctors will not give it, but mine did b/c she is trying to help me get thru this tough time. And she doesn't think i need 2 be around my husband any longer....15yrs together! And he was my stress!Thanks

Since then I have been taking it off an on. Recently however the drug has made me very sick. I stopped taking it without knowing I was to be weened off of it. I am super fatigued, irritated, have night sweats, cant sleep, bloated and at times my fingers and feet swell to the point they hurt. I DO NOT RECCOMEND this medication as it BECOMES ADDICTING. Why should I have to use a small dose to not have these side effects. ITs like Cocain or Speed you need a little to feel good.

She has started me on a very low dose 15mg, and I have had absolutely no appetite at all. Yesterday all I manage to eat were grapes, and a piece of turkey wrapped in lettuce!! I was super energetic this morning, and didn't get much sleep last night. Also I've been doing some jaw clenching- is this normal? Has anyone else experienced any of this??

In any case, at first it gives you the pep you need. It helps you get things done.I am currently breaking up the 37.5mg tablets in half. I couldn't even imaginae taking a full tablet. Hours later you crash! If you have a family watch out or perhaps they should watch out. You are so irritable and don't want to take it out on your family but you do. Furthermore,I hope you enjoy T.V because you will catch up on a lot of it at night. You won't be able to sleep. I have tried similar medicstions such as provigal and Nuvigal with all of the same side effects. I'm just not sure if there is anything out there that will work for me.

He kept telling me that it's like having a cup coffee. With my medical history of having Lupus, I should NOT have been put on this drug at all. I experienced Anger, depression and I had a heart attack, which I blame on this drug. DANGER!  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG longer than recommended. It is legal speed! Only prescripted.  I should have listended to the pharmacist.  Lose weight the old fashioned way, and focus on being healthy, NOT just thinner.

I also started weightwatchers online  and exercising on the same day. as of today I've lost 21 lbs! The reason I started ww is so that once I come off this med I would have learned new eating habits to help me keep the weight off. Been walking 45 min 3-4 days per week. Still have about 50 more lbs to drop. I'm taking 15 mg twice a day. Side effects....insomnia for about the first 3 days and dry mouth here and there.

Since I don't get hungry or get cravings with this medication, I eat very small amounts of nutricious foods.  Since it makes me thirsty, I eat lots of vegetables, soups, fruit and drink lots of non-caloric fluid.  I have been taking this medication for four months and have lost exactly three pounds per month, maintaining a 1500 calorie per day diet.

Overweight	sargeanton, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	5/20/2011 12:50:26 PM	I've been on phentrine for 6 weeks and have lost about 25 pounds so far. I'm only doing moderate exercise. My dosage is 37.5 mg which I find too strong to take all at once. So, I break them in half and take half late a.m., other half at about 3:00 p.m. Combined with coffee they make me a little bit jumpy...but that's okay. The weight is falling off and I'm not hungry. Generally, I drink a Slim Fast, take my vitamins, eat a small can of tuna fish, and munch on pretzels. I can get by on 500 to 800 calories a day without feeling hungry and have no loss of energy. I drink diet sodas and lots of water and have absolutely no craving for sweets or bigger portions of what I eat. Briefly, I am just not hungry enough to desire pizza or any other food that adds lbs. Even the tuna, which I usually NEVER eat, tastes good with a tad of mayo on wheat bread.

I weighed in at 203 and my ldl's and hdl's didn't come back so good.  So the doctor said to try this out since everything else, including working my butt off didn't seem to help.  Within 3 days I was hallucinating.  I was at home and everytime I moved my head I would see trails of colors.  I also couldn't sleep and my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest.  I called my doctor up and told him I would rather be 203lbs then feel like a drug addict.  So, needless to say I stopped the pills and just tripled my routine in the gym.  I am now down 45 lbs on my own.  
Overweight	K, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	5/16/2011 11:16:38 PM	I have been taking this medication for four and a half weeks now. The first day that I took it, I could tell that it was having an effect almost immediately. The first couple days, the dry mouth was terrible. Since then though, I have noticed and increase in thirst, (mostly craving water) but the dry mouth and bad breath is gone. However, I have had pretty steady insomnia. I usually take my daily dose around 9:00AM, and sometimes find it difficult to fall asleep before 1:00AM. I have adjusted, but some people may find it more challenging. I lost 4 pounds the first week, and I have lost ten pounds so far. I have only been working out for about 10 days, and it has made a difference. I highly reccomend this to anyone who overweight or obese. I had a BMI of 30.7 and I'm down to a 28.7 already. I have a total weight loss goal of 42 pounds, and I think that this will really help me get there. But, you can't just take this pill. It isn't magic. I calorie count EVERYDAY and I'm working out.

Overweight	boombalatty, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	5/15/2011 1:23:59 PM	I started taking this drug 3 weeks ago &amp; I'm down 19lbs already. Started out at 261 &amp; I am 5'9&quot;. I no longer crave or want sweets anymore. No desire to eat them even when offered &amp; I could never turn them down before. No longer have a diet soda addiction and even stopped drinking coffee. Didn't even intend to stop drinking them but the taste changed for me (diet soda tastes chemically &amp; uber sweet) and now all I want to drink is lots &amp; lots of water. My appetite is non-existent &amp; I actually have to force myself to eat something when I feel my blood sugar drop. I haven't even started to work out yet. I wake up early feeling refreshed, which I have never felt before being a grouchy morning person, but sometimes I do have trouble falling asleep. I am having a problem with alternating constipation for 2 days then a day of diarrhea for 1 day after but that may be because I'm not eating nearly as much as I used to &amp; my body is probably getting used to it. Would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the gastric problems. I notice I have a ton more energy daily. I actively seek out cleaning around the house. I am just shocked that I no longer crave junk food &amp; the only things I will eat are healthy whole foods because everything else sounds &amp; tastes gross. I used to LOVE fast food, carbs &amp; sweets. Overall very pleased so far.
Overweight	EmanFantastic, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	5/15/2011 1:57:13 AM	Works.  Short term only.  Is addictive.  Effectiveness wears off so you must use the loss of weight as a catalyst to begin exercise or you will find yourself back up again when your MD stops giving you this stuff.  Or, you'll act like a junkie trying to get your hands on more phentermine.  Effectiveness can be prolonged by taking two days off every 5.  Plan vigorous physical activity on those days or you will eat the house down! (Hiking, long distance bicycling, etc.).  In the long run I ended up getting the Gastric Sleeve Resection surgery (it's the newest, best, look it up) but the phen got me to begin the process where before it I wanted to die.

Overweight	Kate, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/8/2011 8:06:10 PM	I found that taking Phentermine was best taken as early in the morning to avoid possible insonia which the drug can cause at night.I used the tablets in conjunction with a good execise plan and a healthy eating regime.In the early stages of treatment I started to lose weight quite quickly, perhaps because coupled with an exercise regime perhaps it works twice as well.Do not take this drug and remain a couch potato.It will not shift those kilos unless you get out and start something simple, like walking, runnning, going to the gvym or getting your own machine to have on hand to use at home.12 weeks is the length I believe that you need on the drug and then when you cease using it,you NEED to continue that exercise and take it up one or two notches or you will just put any weight you've lost back on.It does help you kick start the weightloss, but exercise is the only way I've been able to keep the weight off since losing 20 kilograms,All in all, I would rate it highly for those who have tried all other weight loss plans. And make a care plan with your GP and see a dietician. They help you amazingly - you learn so much about nutriton, eating the right foods and when to eat them.Whatever you do don't stop eating on this drug - you will become very ill. Stopping eating altogether will not make you lose weight, in fact you'll gain it because the body stores fat for those times when your not getting enough,Drink heaps of water, take a muti vitamin as well as taking Phentermine.If you follow these instructions you should all in all have a sucessful treatment. Thankyou for letting me share my experience with you.

Played with 5 lbs for 4 months and finally gained all of it back plus one. I have changed to a different diet pill. I was also very congested after I took the medication and coughed the entire time I was taking it. I thought I had bronchitis or a nagging cold that would not go away. Then I noticed the coughing was after I took the pill, when I did not take it I did not have congestion or cough. hmmmm Don't have to be a rocket scientist. I changed to another pill

I know two people who have pulmonary hypertension (chronic and forever as it is not curable) after taking this drug for just a few months. It does NOT teach you how to eat, it is just a crutch. For those of you not willing to make the changes necessary, you will gain the weight back. I know because I did. Now, I am doing WW and have lost 30 lbs in 15 weeks and I am never hungry and I won't die due to these pills. Doctors who prescribe this medication should re-think this. It is DANGEROUS. You may not get pulmonry hypertension (which will kill you down the road) but why take chances? I consider myself lucky cause all that happened to me is I gained the weight I lost back. It is a lot of money to spend to lose a few pounds quickly. Vanity is not as important as your health. Please heed my warning. I am watching a co-worker die after only 7 weeks on this stuff. You are playing russian roulette if you take this drug. Will you or won't you get the bullet in the head? Not worth it. Join a good program and lose weight slowly and safely. Re-learn portion control and healthy eating. I am thrilled with my results and I know I will not die from WW...just get thinner and stay that way.

I told the dr. that I had no energy whatsoever &amp; I know I'm very overweight &amp; need the help in losing it. I started taking the pill on the 29th &amp; today is the 6th. The first day I felt dizzy/lightheaded,but after that I felt great. I started walking for 30 minutes a day &amp; it's curbed my appetite,but I've had trouble sleeping at night. Starting today I started a new routine where I'll walk 30 minutes in the morning &amp; also 30 minutes in the evening so I won't wear myself out trying to do 45 minutes at one time. I haven't weighed myself since I've been to the doctor &amp; I'm very nervous to see what it says. I hope it's working for me. I'm 5'4 &amp; weigh 250 lbs. I thought after I had my daughter the weight would come off,but I wasn't able to bf as long as I thought &amp; depression doesn't help,so that's why I asked about the pill. I've still been eating what I want,but just not as much of it,eating like 2 times a day at the most &amp; drinking lots of water having a soda every once in a while as my &quot;cheat&quot;. How do you know how good your MG's are for the dose? Mine says on the label &quot;phentermine 37.5MG&quot;..is that considered a high or low dose?

My Dr. put me on this because I don't have a thyroid. Sometimes you get engery sometimes your tired and then you put weight on, I have been eating the same way for years and I don't need a pill to put puonds on

Overweight	treedy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	4/25/2011 3:49:09 PM	I have been on this medication for a month.I've had dizziness and the dry mouth, but nothing else thankfully. I am still having hunger pains, which cause me worry cause I don't want to eat to appease the growling. I'm on a 1600 calorie diet with exercise. I have lost some weight which is great, the idea of taking it really reinforced the working out and the eating healthier which I think is the most effective thing about it so far. I have read many people say how wonderful and great their weightloss success is and I'm hoping to see the same results. Right now I'm still on the fence though. 
Overweight	smurfette02,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female		4/24/2011 10:38:11 PM	I started to take this medication 3 days ago. I was great the first day. Then yesterday I was ok until the afternoon,and I got really dizzy. Today I feel really tired I am not sure if it is because I was cleaning like I was nesting again or what. I have also been eating more today than I have the last 2 days. Is this because I wasn't eating enough the last 2 days or what? I am 201lbs and I am 4'11. Iam 38 years old. Any suggestions?

I am eating 1100 calories or less a day and working out 30-45 mins everyday of jump rope and weights. I would highly recommend. I used to consume 3500 to 4500 calories a day and was still always hungry, but now I have to remind myself to eat. I eat alot of white meat and veggies. I love phentermine, I will update at end of month.
Overweight	jeanmarie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	4/18/2011 9:06:12 PM	I have been taking 37.5 dosage of Phentremine for 1 month. I went to the doctors today and have only lost 4 lbs. Side affects:really bad dry mouth. I only get a few hours of sleep a night but when I do get up in the morning now I am not exhausted like I was before starting the pill. I have been trying to excersise but working 2 jobs almost impossible to fit in only about 2 times a week. I have to remember to eat something every 3 hours. I am not a big eater to begin with. I dont eat alot of junk food. So I am confused of my weight of 182 lbs 5'3&quot; age 49. I took another month supply but if I do not see a better # next month I will not continue. I done better with T-lite w/energy diet pill and plan 7 years ago. But then again I only worked 1 job then. We shall see. Good luck to all who is trying to lose weight and get healthy.

Overweight	Lorri, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/15/2011 10:24:59 PM	I started taking the 15mg. dose in Dec. 2010 and lost weight during the holiday season!  My doctor bumped me up to the 37.5mg dose in Feb. 2011 and as of April 2011 I have lost 30 lbs.  I've been stuck at this loss, but that is without any exercise.  I've just been taking the pill and trying to stay under 2000 cal./day and make healthier food choices.  My cholesterol is normal now and I'm hoping to lower my glucose levels as I've been diagnosed recently as pre-diabetic.  Usually have dry mouth and have been told that I'm hyper in the morning after taking my dose.  Going to try weening off of it because of the length of time I've been on it and see how I do.  Hopefully I can maintain with exercise and good eating habits.  I'll try to check back and let you know how I'm doing.

And I cheated on my diet like 4 times. I also didn't exercise... But I NEED to loose   AT LEAST 20 more lbs this month. So I begged my doc to give me the 30mg and It's been ok so far. I just hope it helps me loose weight faster. I'm also going to exercise 4 days a week and stick to my diet. What's the most weight you guys have lost in a month?

Overweight	Kohara, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	4/6/2011 9:46:39 PM	I was really happy the first week when the weight starting falling off but now i've been on for almost a month and i'm stuck at only losing 13 pounds! I have been eating very healthy, hardly any &quot;bad&quot; carbs and very little sugar, and only drinking water and exercising 3-5X a week.  I'm on the generic 30mg. When I go back to the doctor on the 21st I think i'm going to ask him for the 37.5. It is curbing my appetite some but not as much as I want it to. A lot of people on her say they have to force themselves to eat but i'm not having that problem I still eat 3 meals a day (very healthy meals). I really need to lose more like 35 pounds more!! Any suggestions?

Overweight	Rocksister, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	3/31/2011 12:19:07 PM	I started this on March 15.  My doctor said I needed to lose 40 pounds, and at age 54, I finally need help losing weight, whereas before I had been able to do it on my own.  This definitely curbs my appetite, and strangely, I'm not craving my beloved French fries or chocolate.  I don't know how THAT happened, but it is true.  And Easter is one of my most difficult times, with the chocolate bunnies and peanut butter eggs and such.  Ha ha.  Well I lost 7 pounds my first 13 days.  I go back on April 25 to see how I've done the past month.  The Adipex makes me feel a little like a thrumming guitar string, kind of edgy.  But not bad.  I would most certainly not be able to lose weight this time without it.  After two weeks the only side effect I feel is the slight edginess.  Other than that, I'm grateful that it is helping me.

The first time was for two months, it seemed to work great.  A few years later took it again and was very tired all the time, I just wanted to sit on the coach.  Stopped taking it after a month.  This last fall I took it again cause my friend started and was doing great.  I was very tired again and just wanted to sit on the coach, almost depressed.  One day I started having shortness of breath and racing heart.  After a few episodes I had a really big one and went to the doctors.  They took me off and I have been going to specialist.  They are trying to say maybe it is asthma but I can tell something is different and wrong now.  Also my distolic blook pressure is high and I have never had anytime of high blood pressure.  I have been researching it and pulmonary hypertension fits the bill but you have to have a catheder or die to be diagnosed.  I would not recomend this drug at all.  My friend is doing great now but she has had some side effects too and has ignored them because of the results.  Who knows what she or I will find out what it did to us.  allisha3558@yahoo.com

After just 1 week of taking Phentermine I have lost 8 pounds!! I still haven't really experienced any of the side effects, I did take my pill 2 hours later than I usually do on Thursday I took it at 10:30 instead of 8:30 and I could not sleep AT ALL Thursday night!  I can't wait for everyone to start noticing!(this will motivate me even more) I can feel it in my clothes that I have lost weight.  I still get the feeling of being hungry right around lunch time but it goes away quickly and after I eat lunch I feel very satisfied. Love this pill!! 
Overweight	litahni38, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/25/2011 1:57:15 AM	I really liked this medicine, I am 40 and I was having a tough time getting my body to loose weight because I had depression so I became tired and when I was I would eat. Well the dr. prescribed this to give me a jump start. And I haven't had any of the side effects like I have read. I also haven't had the urge to take more than prescribed. I have been taking it for 4 months now and my Dr. just stop refilling my script and that upsets me because he was afraid of taking it too long. But I don't understand I am not under weight it kept me awake in the day helped me not think of food all day I exercised was happy and now I am tired and eating and becoming depressed. Why if I don't have any issues that are negative, not even a bad heart or high blood pressure would you just stop someone from taking something. I really think it is healthier than the stuff you buy over the counter. I am 5'4 and I weigh 135 and became this weight after being 160 and I am a female.

I spoke to my physician, and made the decision not to take any more, I have I truly believe Phentermine helped me start my weight loss journey, I have lost 17.4lbs, but now that I have made the life changes to eat right and excercise regularly, I feel now any risks associated with Phentermine, are risks I don't want to take.

So far it has worked great and I haven't been hungry! When I do eat i've been focusing on making healthy choices and cutting way back on portions.  Has anyone experienced being really HOT while taking Phentermine? I'm not sure if it me because I Have a cold or if its the medicine. I have really experienced any of the side effects like dry mouth (I usually do drink a lot of water) or weird taste in my mouth. And I also haven't gotten a boost of energy.  Will this happen after taking it awhile? During the 6 months of taking Phentermine I would really like to lose 40 pounds. I'm taking a kickboxing class 4 days a week and with the phentermine I think its possible.

My starting weight was 348 and my current weight is 332. I have made several changes. Reduced my calorie intake, keep a daily log of what I eat, don't eat fast food, cut late night snacking (or only eat fruit/veggie if I feel the need to snack)increased fruit and veggies in my daily meals, included Zumba workout 3-4 times a week plus one 'intense' activity on the weekend like biking or swimming for 1-2 hours. The only side effects that I have had are headaches-not severe, just a little annoying. Insomnia-I find it hard to go to sleep and stay sleep before 11pm.

I am not as hungry and I have more energy. I take 30mg in the morning. I actually eat more since I know it is important to eat while dieting. Overall pretty pleased.

I decided to go get this because I have been working out 30-60 minutes a day 5-6 days a week with really no results. I am eating 12oo calories a day. I am starting out on half a pill once a day and 1 nophedra twice a day. Kinda of shocked these will cause you to fail a drug test so a note from the doctor is going to my employer today!! I am 35 yrs old, 5'5&quot; and 236 lbs and a mother of 4. I am ready to see some results!!!!
Overweight	alliegirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/16/2011 1:10:35 PM	My dr prescribed this for me on Nov 24, 2010. I weighed 204lbs and am 5'5. As of today I weigh 171 lbs - 33lbs total. YES it has worked. This pill has been a total miracle to me after having my baby in 9/08 and not being able to lose the weight on my own. I experienced dry mouth and some insonmia the first few weeks but otherwise, nothing. You do have to work out and eat right so you are not getting off &quot;easy&quot;...or if you are you will gain it back when you get off of it for sure. The months where i was not working out as diligently I did not lose as much. I am back to working out 5 days a week (walking 40mins brisk) and losing again at a rate of about 3-5lbs per week. My goal is 160 so 11 more pounds to go. Thanks to this pill I should hit that in about 3 weeks.   
Other	Lola85, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/16/2011 4:37:56 AM	I tried phetermine for the first time two days ago and already I feel like Ive lost weight. I haven't stepped on a scale because I work out and I may have gained muscle but I can feel it in my clothes. I am not overweight but my appetite has been out of control with the sweets and I needed something to help me from binging on sweet snacks after dieting all day.  I have a lot of energy for hours and hours. I was in a great mood while I was taking it but I believe when I wasn't on it I was in a bad mood. I'm just guessing that because I was in a horrible mood the following morning and from other posted &quot;side effects&quot; that was one of them, now I know why. 
Overweight	:), 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	25-34	3/16/2011 12:20:51 AM	It works for sure. You won't be hungry, but you still have to eat to keep your metabolism going. This medication will probably make you edgy, nervous, depressed and you might have trouble sleeping. If you take more than 1 pill a day, it will give you a euphoric feeling, but also will result in a jittery come down. I lost 15 pounds in a pretty short period of time, but I stopped taking it because I found myself getting addicted to it. It's like a watered down version of blow.
Overweight	Danielle , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/15/2011 9:17:34 PM	Very satisfied with the pill, I'm not jittery but I'm not crashing by 2:30pm either. I've lost 18lbs to date. The only side effect was the dry mouth but after the 1st 2 weeks of being on it, its not an issue anymore. I highly recommend training your body to exercise and eat a reduce calorie, fat and sugar diet. Increase your fiber too. If you don't incorporate these things you will gain the weight back. My girlfriend took it but she never worked out while on the pill and she didn't eat at all. So she didn't have anything to burn. Now she's been off of it for 2 months and I can start to see her weight coming back on. Remember a diet pill will only work as hard as you do. Workout and eat healthy.
Overweight	curvy gal, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	3/12/2011 6:50:33 PM	So I'll start with the bad, irritable is putting it lightly, no really. Other than that I have NO appetite and plenty of energy. Others who have stated they are tired may not be eating enough, which will leave you feeling depleated. I lost 7lbs the first week and force myself to eat every 3 hours to keep the metabolism burning. You must drink plenty of water and train yourself to eat right because when you come off it you will gain it back unless you reprogrammed your eating habits. Wish me luck!
Overweight	Sunshine101, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	3/8/2011 12:06:30 PM	This medication works but if you don't ween off it slowly you will have a severe increase in appetite. Works best for 3 months max then come off 2 months and back on again. Some of the side effects I've noticed is headaches and an energy crash at the end of the day but the first time I took it I lost over 50 pounds and the second time close to 25 pounds. It's very easy to gain the weight back after coming off of this medication. In my opinion you're better of eating healthy by cutting calories and exercising, the good old fashion way. 
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	3/7/2011 1:28:10 PM	WARNING!!! This medication is not for everyone! I started this medication about two years ago-had to stop after a year. My side affects included mood changes, insomnia, heavy heart palpatations and trouble catching my breath doing the slightest activities. BUT....the most serious was when I started to feel numbness,  tingling and swelling all along my left side from my jaw down my shoulder and arm. My fingertips and toes would turn blue and go numb. My blood pressure shot up (never once had problems with pressure before using this drug) I suffer still today from these symptoms off and on and have had several ekgs to monitor my heart health. Not worth the 26 pounds lost-and regained!

PLEASE DO NOT TAKE WITH ANY ANTIDEPRESSANTS. My doctor thought it was fine, and it WASNT!!!!!

I began losing weight immediately as my appitite decreased greatly.  The only thing is, it made me feel &quot;funny&quot; for lack of a better work.  I stopped taking the drug after about 2 weeks.  I am trying it again as I have gained weight!  I've got to lose and I know this medication does work.  I am currently weigh 195 and I am 5'5&quot;. I want to get down between 140-150.  We shall see:)
Other	Patticakes, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/23/2011 3:09:33 PM	I started taking this med in August and went off January 1, 2011. I am 5'9&quot; tall and had always been thin weighing between 135 to 145 most of my life until age 50. I gained &amp; gained weight no matter what I did. I use to play competitive tennis as my exercise until my knees gave out. The last straw was after knee surgery on one knee I weighed in at 198. While I took the medicine proper dosage and continued to exercise 5 to 6 days a week...with no side effects! I now weigh 155 and would like to loose 5 more pounds before my 60th Birthday Party on March 26th. Since I went off the med on 1/1 I haven't gained but am at a plateau. I count my calories but try to eat healthy not fad diets anymore. the only side effect I think I had was I lost alot of hair? Has anyone else had this problem? I still love the weight loss but am hoping the hair loss is temporary...anyone else have feedback on this?

I have felt real spaced out all day...which could pose a problem while at work. Does anyone know if this will cause you to fail a drug screening for employment? I hope not, I heard that could happen...and I hate surprises.

I have to force myself  to eat. However, I have horrible dry mouth from it. It is also essential that you take fiber with it. I am eating 20g of fiber a day and am still experiencing constipation.
Overweight	honeydew, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	2/18/2011 3:45:44 PM	I was prescribed this drug when I became discouraged because my diet and exercise wasn't working as well as I or my doctor would have expected.   I have a condition called PCOS which is caused by insulin resistance.  I was diagnosed as border line diabetic and was trying desperately to lose the weight I had gained the &quot;right way. I continued to exercise at least 5 days a week and didn't really change my eating patterns since I am a healthy eater, except that I ate less.   I found that this drup seemed to suppress my appetite.  I would like to add that I did not like the way I felt when I took it. I felt my heartrate increase and was a little more nervous than normal.   Overall I believe that in conjunction with my exercising I have lost @ 35 pounds in about 3 months.    I have maintained that weight loss  8 months later but I also exercise regularly and pretty intensley and try to eat no more than 1500 -1700 calories daily.   I feel great and would do it again if I really needed it.

I was working in the gym 2-3xs a week for 4 years.I went to my doctor (October 2010) and he prescribed Phentermine 30mg and swore he could get me to 155 before my back surgery this December.  I started taking it in the morning and waiting an hour before I took my Wellbrutin XL 450.  They both worked together and I did not have any problems.  Every thing I ate, I ate half of or took home half from a restaurant for the next day.A I write this the dy after Valentines Day 2011, I weight 152. I can fit into all my better clothes again.  I have only been able to walk in the gym since my back surgery.   But I am happy.

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/11/2011 10:33:40 AM	I started 3/1/2008 weighing 216 by 1/9/2009 I lost a total of 55.5 pds. Today my weight is at 173.9- I still use the pill daily- however, i do not take it on weekends. I think when I first started i was working out like crazy. I have cut back on working out- but when I look at the number i have gained since then, it makes me get back into the gym  and following the diet again. I still follow the low carb diet- but my main food I crave is sweets. The only side affect to me was the dry mouth and not able to sleep very well. I guess I have been taking this so long- my body could be use to this pill by now. I don't want to gain the weight back- so I will keep following the low carb diet and increase my work outs. I do go to the doctor weekly and get shots of B12's and weigh in.

Overweight	butterball o' love, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/10/2011 6:51:39 AM	I've taken phentermine off and on since 2010. I first stopped because I was drinking 4-5 cups of coffee a day AND taking phentermine. Woof - not a good idea : ) Anyway, when I do take it I make sure to cut back my coffee intake, increase my water intake, and EAT when my body tells me to. In three days I have lost 5 lbs, and that's w/out exercise and a severe cut in calorie intake (wasn't hungry). I don't expect to keep losing this much weight on a regular basis. When I start to plateau I'll slowly incorporate light exercise. But remember when taking this medicine: it's and AMPHETMINE!! Your doctor should have gone over your medical history with you and had you do an EEG BEFORE prescribing this. Also, have a realistic expectation of this medicine - sure it will work for awhile, but if you haven't learned to adjust your diet and exercise on your own, you'll just gain the weight back.

Overweight	KC MO , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/26/2011 9:25:37 AM	I have been taking the medication for 2 weeks now, and the first day I must admit I felt like I had been drugged. However, once my body adjusted to the pills I have been fine. There are no hungry signals at all, no stomach growling uncontrollably you almost have to remind yourself to eat. I have lost 4 lbs in 2 weeks. Not only can I notice the loss in weight, I can feel it. I think If I were to incorporate a workout plan into my diet i would loose more, I do watch what I ear generally salads for lunch, oatmeal for breakfast and a small portioned dinner. Water is essential you crave it taking this medication i can't say that i have the dry mouth symptoms any longer..but i am constantly thirsty...i take my pill every morning one hour after i eat breakfast and it has been effective thus far! I would definitely recommend it...

I work out 3-4xs a wk, cardio 2xs &amp; lift weights 2xs. I follow the book, &quot;How to lose belly fat diet&quot; &amp; have only dry month as a side effect, which makes me drink a lot of water. It's great. I don't feel any &quot;high&quot; or depression. I take only 1 pill &amp; I take it at lunchtime because I'm a snack-er at night. When I took it at breakfast, I still felt like I had to talk myself out of wanting a snack at night. A little adjusting &amp; it's good now.

I didn't exercise over the summer because my job is cleaning hotels so that is considered exercising. But I did join a gym in the fall and I got 3-5 days a week and at least get on the treadmill for 30 minutes. It comes out to over a little more than a mile. I don't go by the calorie count, because the side-effect to this pill is sweating and you do actually burn more than what the machine says. I also eat alot less, and I don't drink or eat anything that contains anything with caffine. This medcine has changed my life. I am 30 yrs old. When I was 25 my doctor said I wouldn't live to see 40. Now it's all different. When I first started taking them they made me real hyper and I was afarid of becoming addicted like alot of all you are saying. But I take mine every other day. Plus it's all in the will power. They ARE NOT ADDICTIVE!!!!!! I stopped mine for a week for antibiotics and was fine. You just have to tell yourself that you enjoy who you are becoming and not who you were before you started taking them. You started taking them for a reason. But you can not stay on them forever.

That is not phentermine (see spelling on label).  Go thru a clinic where they can monitor you.  The other thing is not to take any sort of caffeine with this drug as your heart rate and/or blood pressure may rise and your behavior may become more erratic.I believe I'm addicted to this drug.  It did great things the first year I used it.  After that, I ended up needing it more for keeping in focus and becoming more productive (like ritalin for ADD).  I've taken it for so long that when I had a terrible stomach flu and couldn't take it for a week, i experienced depression and felt so exhausted and couldn't focus on my work.  I gained all the weight back and craved fatty foods.  I'm back on again for the wrong reasons but I've cut my pills in half in hope to wean off it properly.  Use what this drug is intended for - accompany with a exercise and a diet program.  You will gain all the weight back if you do not learn good eating habits.  Please let me know if you have a dependence on this drug.  Good luck.
Overweight	im no longer in the 200's, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/15/2011 5:27:53 AM	I think the pill works, only in the first week i lost 4lbs. and I wasn't drinking enough water and exercising as i was supposed to, I had no trouble with not eating a lot (and before the pill i would eat a lot) because I couldn't feel hunger all day and night. At the beginning I would get really dizzy, and a very happy feeling, a very bitter taste in my mouth and my mouth would get really dry. I am in my 5th week and i notice that is not working as before, I am starting to get hungry at night and i no longer get that bitter taste in my mouth, I still get a little dizzy though. I know I am already addicted to the pills because just the though of not taking the pill for a day makes me nervous ( I don't want to feel hunger again so I can keep up with eating healthy and I feel like I wont be able to do that without it because I am usually always hungry). My doctor wants to schedule an appointment next week to see me and I know he is going to change my dose and it sucks because I don't think is going to be a bigger dose.
Overweight	Ziggie's Mom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	5	4	Female	45-54	1/14/2011 9:41:38 AM	I am a 53 yr old female going through menopause so my moods &amp; weight gain are all over the place. I am usually a skeptic in most things that sound to good to be true especially when it comes to using drugs to help loose weight, but I saw such a dramatic weight lose in a friend I decided I should give it a try. I have only used it for a week. My appetite has decreased &amp; my cravings seem to have lessened. I wear contacts, so my eyes dry out easaly anyway, but my vision seems a bit off, but nothing to worry about. My friend experienced headaches, but she was also cutting back on her Soda Pop addicition which I do not have. So far I have lost about 1 lb, but for 1 week that is not bad. I hope I continue to do the same each week. Taking it off slow is my goal. I need to loose about 40 to 50 lbs to be at a healthier weight &amp; do not intend to gain it all back.

The 1st 2 months it worked perfect I lost 29lbs. Then from June to Oct. I took it off and on with no more results so I have took a break from it to get it out of my system. I did good until Thankgiving and christmas break gain 9lbs. I plan to restart tomorrow since I have took a 2.5 month break. The only side effect I did have was very dry mouth, but it was worth it.

I have lost just over 11 lbs. and that part feels great.  Not wanting to eat everything in sight also feels great, but I'm not experiencing the energy boost that I was told it should give me.  Anyone else with this experience and if so did you tell your dr. about it and what did they say??  I have been exercising as often as possible (3-5 days a week @ 1hr each) and not eating much at all 800-1100 cal. a day.  I just feel I should have much more energy to do even more.

My goal is weigh 180 lbs, currently I am at 238 from 233... About two and half years ago, I was at 185 thin and loving every bit of me... Well I still love every bit of me but after seeing some pictures I was like on hell no - this weight has to come off. We all say we're our own best critic - well here it goes... I looked unhappy and miserable with that amount weight on me. Lucky me I have will power - I now eat like a vegetarian - and work out 3 - 4 days a week cardio only with light weights. In addition, to calorie counting throughout the day. As for my experiences to date - a little buzzed energy wise and my appetite has zapped that I now ask myself should I eat or should I pass on a meal.  Ok - I am rambling... I will be back weekly to give a status update.... By the way thanks to everyone for the positive reviews.... We can do it together one force.

Overweight	mimi, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/4/2011 10:57:38 PM	I'm 5.1/175 and started to take this medicine almost 3 weeks ago.  So far I lost 8 pounds, lots of energy and because I'm not hungry all the time I take my time and make better choices during my meals, more fruits and vegetables in my diet now.  I also purchased pedometer and walk at least 10000 steps 5 days a week.  To avoid problems sleeping I take it around 6:00am before going to work. The only issue is dry mouth but that helps me to drink more water every day.  The only concern I have is gaining the weight back if I stop, will ask my doc about that next visit.  This pill is GREAT!
Overweight	BetterThenEver!!!, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/3/2011 12:38:26 PM	I started taking phentermine on 09/15/2010 today in 01/03/2011. when I first started taking this medication my weight was at 198 i'm now at 168 total loss of 31 pounds. The first week of taking this medication I was sick and couldnt sleep at night. But once the medication kicked in I was back to the norm. Overall this medication WORKS! with a work out and better eating habits I will soon hit my goal.

Yikes. I always ate junk food and craved it. The pill reduced the need to eat sugar. Now, I eat a balanced meal-whole grains and lean meats. I have lost 6 pounds in 5 days . I am using the eliptical trainer for an hour everyday!

So my Doctor percscribed me this med. it has been 5 days and i am still feeling the side affects like upset stomach, imsominia, and dry mouth. However my doctor also put me on a low dose antidepressant and a anti seizure medication to help with the side affect, it still makes me feel like a zombie sometimes. I also completely stopped drinking. my doctor told me those side affects will go away. Also I have not lost any weight yet but it only has slightly suppressed my appettite. not what i expected but it only has been 5 days so I will check back in with hopefully better results.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/20/2010 3:45:29 PM	Female 27 start weight 236.  Started 37.5 mg in October.  Now in December at 218 lbs. Side effects I have experienced: irritability, bad breath and taste, jittery feeling at times, mild to moderate nausea.  The plan is to stay on for 3 more months and a goal weight of 180.  i workout 4-5 times weekly (3 aerobic, 1-2 strength training) but have been doing that for a couple years with little or no weight loss.  This has improved the numbers but sometimes the side effects can be a little overwhelming.  My appetite has been almost completely wiped out at times and i have to force myself to sit down and eat some vegetables or a bowl of cereal to keep from getting nauseated.
Overweight	kb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/20/2010 12:30:32 AM	I have been taking phentermine hcl for 7 weeks, total weight lost 22 lbs.  In the first 8 days I had lost 12 lbs. Then stopped losing for a week.  Then lost another 10 lbs over the next few weeks. The first side effects I noticed was a metallic taste in my mouth and had a very dry mouth. But that went away after about 2 weeks. It really helped with my energy, I was very sluggish before taking the meds and now I feel great. Do not have much time to excercise, but I have so much energy I am constantly moving.  The energy is not a jittery energy, it just feels like this is the way I am supposed to feel.  I love it! I have had no problems with sleeping.  I take my extended release pill very early in the morning, around 7 am and do not eat breakfast till 8 am. I do not snack anymore. I eat 3 meals a day, and not real big meals.  I am completely satisfied and never feel the need to snack.  Some days I have to make myself eat something because I am just not hungry. But I eat a little something anyway because I have found that if I completely skip a meal I do feel a little irritable and a little jittery.  But that is a small price to pay for 22 lbs in 7 weeks. Now I just need to fit in an hour on my elliptical, I am not doing any conventional forms of excercise yet. I know that I need to start. Because this is just a step to getting the weight off.  It will be up to me to keep it off once I go off the meds!

Got it for 4 months, worked great in 1st month when I was excercising daily but things got crazy and I didn't have the time anymore, so I stopped my excercise regimine. I haven't lost any weight since that first month. I'm satisfied with the drug but I can't help but wonder how much of it is all mental.. since I didn't drop a single pound after I stopped my exercise routine even though I still took the pills for another 3 months.

When I found out I was pregnant almost 6 years ago I weighed 130 lbs and 9 months later I was huge and weighed 205 lbs. (I am 5 ft 1 1/2 inches, quite petite)  After a lot of hard work, exercise, and a lot of graduall changes in my diet I was able to get to 165 lbs.  I just started my fifth month on this medication and am very thankful that I did except for one thing....My doctor informed me that she usually does not prescribe this for more than three months.  After taking it for the forth month I felt as though it was not working very well so I skipped a week.  I felt VERY TIRED and crappy.  I have had others tell me that after completing a full month AT LEAST a week should be skipped.  That way you can reset your motabolism.  I wish that I had done that, my body doesnt know what to do without it. I will have to speak with my doctor about cutting down slowly.  I did not enjoy that crash at all.

I wrote the review where i said im 25 and 335 pounds. I now weigh 320 pounds and the side effects r all gone.  If I wanted I could go all day without eating but I'm doin it the healthy way. My brain is not constantly telling me to eat which gives me time to realize that I was overeating because I was trying to compensate for the loneliness and low self esteem I had.  I watch my portion sizes and what I eat and Im so proud of myself. 15 pounds in one week and I feel great. 180 pds is the goal and IM GONNA DO IT!!!
Overweight	DD, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	11/24/2010 1:09:15 PM	Hello I started taking phentermine 30mg the lower strength 0ctober 25th, because I'm 5'1 and was 173lbs gained 20lbs after having my son. I was to take 1 pill every morning before breakfast. Side effect: it made me very hyper and energetic, some times moodier than usual, very allert, i had headaches the 1st 2 days beyond that no additional negative side effects. but everyones different so know ur body and pay attention to it! :). i did change my diet, i eat more fibers like oatmeal or cereal (cheerios) for breakfast at the recommended portion size on the box, a fruit in between breakfast and lunch. during lunch i ate fast food someday :) like mcdonalds but something small no big macs! salads or some healthy choice low cal meal from the grocery store. i ate snacks sometime but not daily if so it was yogart or more fruit. and dinner i ate whatever i wanted in a smaller portioned size. ill be honest i get icecream like every other week or an iced coffee every other week. lol. i did wrkout 2-3times per week 100 crunches, 20 side leg lifts 25 pushups and 50 squats. i lost 12 lbs. now weighing 161 so i think the pill worked pretty well especially considering it was lower dose and i didnt take daily (im forgetful) i still have 13 pills leftover. So i'd say better eating habbits and a little bit of exercise will help take the weight off. good luck guys!!!

I take 1 whole pill before breakfast, then another whole pill before lunch. My doctor put me on this dosage and medicine because I am 25 years old, 5&quot;10 and I wieghed an embarrasing 335 pounds.  It is now Friday, November 19, 2010 and I weigh 324.5 pds. which is a weight loss of 10.5 pds. in 3 days! I will join a gym on Monday.  I cant eat half of what I used to before taking this pill. I was being greedy yesterday and tried to eat a whole bowl of brocolli and cheese soup from Subway and I immediately vomited. The drug tells my brain that the sight, thought or smell of food is disgusting so I dont even desire eating.  Two setbacks though: 1.) I sleep only about 3-4 hrs a night. no more naps. nothing but energy but I hope this insomnia passes in a few weeks. 2.) I get a little out of breathe and heart palpitates sometimes when walking long distances.  Overall, so far I'm happy. I just want to stay focused, get healthy and not feel fat and ugly anymore. GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE! WE CAN DO THIS!!

My dr. put me on it for a little mental clarity (focusing problems), plus i was a little over weight. I have lost about 25 pounds but I have been exercising alot and watching what I eat. As for my lack of focusing...what a huge differene. I feel so much better. I couldnt get a refill when I needed it and had to go without for about a week.The weight stayed down but the mood swings were horrible.I am also hungry all the time which is a big change for me cuz i used to only eat once a day. Now I eat all the time and it has totally increased my metabolism. Love this medication !
Overweight	ladytex, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	11/17/2010 11:35:11 PM	Back with an update to my first review from 11/5. Have had 2 more weekly weigh-ins since my 10 and 3 lb losses the first 2 weeks on a doctor-supervised weight loss plan. Week 3 was 2.5 lbs and week 4 (yesterday) was 3 lbs, so a total of 18.5 lbs in 4 weeks. Not bad, but was hoping to lose at least 4-5 lbs per week consistently for at least the first month or so before dropping to the 2-3 lbs average, especially since I have been so disciplined at diet, exercise, and water consumption. At my doctor's recommendation, I increased from one 15 mg capsule once per day to 1/2 of a 37.5 mg tablet twice a day (1 hour before both breakfast and lunch) starting on 11/10. Still no side effects. Continuing to follow an 800 calorie diet plan and exercising 5-6 days per week. However, I lowered my Satisfaction rating from 4 to 3 stars because I am not seeing any fat-burning benefit from the drug as my doctor said I should. When I do the math on my resting daily calorie rate (per her machine) vs. my 800 calorie diet (sometimes less) and the average 350 calories burned daily through exercise, it accounts for 2.5 - 3.0 lbs per week lost on its own, so no apparent help from the drug in this regard.  It does control my appetite, but with the reviews I've read about the risks of long-term use, I'd like to see a little faster weight loss so I can reach my goal as soon as healthfully possible. I'll plan to give another progress report in a couple of weeks as I hope the info will be helpful to others.  In the meantime, does anyone have any feedback on Phentirmene, which supposedly works as well as Phentermine but not as risky?  I have read  several reviews online that are positive, but it would be helpful to know if they are too good to be true. Thanks and good luck fellow dieters, especially with the food-filled holidays just around the corner.  Blessings to you!

I was suppose to post back on 9/29/10 to let everyone know if I lost any more weight or not but have been busy since. Well, when I went to the doctor on 9/29/10 I went down to 173lbs which makes it 5lbs lost. Not too bad. My next doctors visit is on November 30 and I am hoping I lost a good 10lbs even though my doctor said she hopes I went down to 160lbs which should total 13lbs that I should lose by then. Crossing fingers for a good number. Post real soon.

However, after 2 weeks, I started having severe headaches, a dry mouth, sore throat, and pain in the thyroid and gland area under the neck.  I also experienced feelings that my heart was racing, and I felt tired.  I first thought I had a virus, so I stopped taking the pill, and the symptoms went away after 2 weeks.  I then attempted to resume the pill, and the symptoms came back after 2 days.  I stopped again, thinking I was not yet over my virus, and then I resumed the pills again, and the symptoms came back on the 2nd day.

I've lost 40lbs with a strict diet of 700-900 calories/day. The 1st 2-3 days I had more energy but after that I went back to the usual. The 1st week I lost 10lbs so when the weight loss slowed it was discouraging but I kept at it &amp; have been losing 2-5lbs/week since. The 1st month I was exercising twice/week at the gym for at least 2 hours each time &amp; lost about 17lbs total but the 2nd month I started a new job &amp; I now I only get to go every other weekend but I push myself hard the whole time I'm there &amp; I cut my calories a little more. After the 1st month my hunger started to come back around dinner time &amp; it was much harder to not each junk food so my doctor changed my dose to 37.5mg &amp; it's been working great ever since &amp; I lost about 16lbs the 2nd month &amp; another 7lbs so far this month.  I would like to lose another 60lbs over the next 5 months but my doctor won't let me keep taking it for that long. I'm afraid that once I stop taking the pills I'll gain all the weight back because  before I started taking them I felt like I was staving all the time no matter how often or how much I ate. It's so easy to watch what I eat with the pills but I don't know if I can keep up with not touching any fatty or sweet foods &amp; eating such tiny portions afterwards. I haven't had any side effects except for a few palpitations once or twice when I drank a lot of coffee with the medicine (a whole pot of coffee in 1 day once).

It works great I think the water really makes the difference though. I did gain all the weight back after I quit taking it. I had heard about this from other users and thought they were just going back to their old habits this is not the case for me. But yes it does most defiently work! I am back on them starting 11/4/10 with a weight of187.8 this am I weigh 184.0.  Yeah!  I have hoshimotos so weight loss is tough.

Overweight	ladytex, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	11/5/2010 3:59:14 PM	I started this drug on 10/19 along with an 800-calorie doctor-supervised diet plan.  I am 5'8&quot; and started at 252.5 lbs with a goal to weigh 150 lbs.  The doctor prescribed 15 mg for first 3 days then increase to 30 mg after that, but since 15 mg was doing such a great job of suppressing my appetite and I don't like to take more drugs than necessary, my doctor said OK to stay at 15 mg.  My energy level is up, and no negative side effects that I've noticed. Lost 10 lbs by 10/26. Next appt on 11/3 lost only an additional 3 lbs, which was discouraging because I had been doing cardio 5 days per week and strength training 1 day per week and not always consuming all 800 calories due to being busy and rarely hungry. I know weight loss slows down after the first week, but I thought I'd at least get a couple of 5 lb weeks in before dropping lower since I am so overweight, especially since I am being so diligent.  After reading several posts here, I am more encouraged and hoping to see steady progress. Good luck to everyone in reaching their weight loss goals!

Overweight	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Male	35-44	11/3/2010 4:07:16 AM	i started on phen on the 28 sept posted on the 8 oct loss of 11 lbs again on the 19 oct and was down by 19lbs and as of today total loss is 25 lbs. Side effects have all but disappeared. I have missed days taking the drug with no problems. I was staying in a hotel last week where price included full board so it wasnt as easy to watch what i was eating but back to normal routine again an find that i am still loosing the lbs. Just need another 6 lbs off to reach target. Loosing 25lbs in 35 days for me has been a huge achievement. I am now eating much more healthily and enjoying what i am eating. I have breakfast lunch and dinner everyday and fruit in between. I still have tea and a couple of chocs or biscuits in the night time.I do wake much earlier but am tired around 10.30 11 at night and can sleep at this time without any bother.Another couple of weeks should see me reach target, then coming off them completely is the goal. I would love to hear from people that has come off them and what was the best way to quit them 
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/2/2010 7:40:35 PM	Ive been getting treatment for Hypothyroidism for over 16 yrs. Still fighting my weight. No energy to workout. My doctor prescribed me this rx and i have never felt so good in my life! It gave me energy so i could and want to workout and stick to a program to keep me going for when i do get off the phentermine. I lost over 30 lbs in 4 months. At first i thought it stopped working because i couldnt feel the jitter anymore which only lasted about a week or so. Guess my body got used to it! Still had Energy and kept me going! Then i noticed my weight dropping. Always had low self Esteem so when i lost my weight, it was the best feeling. Ive been off it for quite sometime now and still maintaining my weight. Definately works! With Exercise and eating healthy makes the weight come off faster! The only side effect i had was dry mouth, but that just made me drink more water which i needed to anyhow! I didnt plan on wanting to take it long, just something to get me going! This was a great help!!

My doctor perscribed me Meridian, only to find out when I tried to get it filled, the it has been recalled. Which I was ok with, because I really wanted to try Phentermine. I just took my first pill this morning. I do feel a little jittery, not anything I cant stand though. When I went to the doctor, I weighed 190. Mr doctor said that 130 is a good weight for me. Im 5'3&quot;. Looking forward to some good results! Will keep posting. Next Drs. appoinment is 11/29/10.

I have been taking phen for a little over 2 months now the 1st month I had a loss of 18 pounds. That was with working out every morning and during my lunch break. My second month I only lost 8 pounds that was eating pretty much what I wanted and not working out. So yes the pill helps. I took myself off the pill for two weeks to see how I would do. As of now I have not gained any weight and have maintained my weight with out working out. Going in to my 3rd month I plan to work out again twice a day and eat better to see how my body reacts to the pill again!!!!  Again this pill does HELP you lose weight but is NOT the answer you have to be active!!! Will post again to update!
Overweight	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/19/2010 2:07:20 AM	My last posting was on the 8 oct and i had been on the med for 10 days and had lost a little over 11 lbs with dry mouth as the only side effect now down to 205 lbs which is a total loss of over 19 lbs in as many days. Still have a little dry mouth but other than that i feel fine. i am drinking over 2 liters of water every day and urinating quiet a lot. I now decide what i want to eat and when i will have it. Before i began on the med every time i went into a filling station for petrol I would buy something to eat. I drive fo a living so i was stopping a couple of times a day, i have cut this out and am filling only the gas tank when i pull over. If i feel hungry i eat an apple or pear. I know its only 19 days but i feel great and can see the belly disappearing. Everybody I meet comment on how well i am looking which helps. I am not sure how much of this is down to the meds or to the change in lifestyle. from reading all the posts on here my only worry is coming off the med and will i be able to maintain the weight loss as some posts say they put it all back on and more. My goal is to loose around another 12 or 13 lbs which would have me down to around 193 lbs which is 88kgs which would be fine as i am male 6f 4 age 36. I said in my last post that it is very important that your doc knows all your medical history and would strongly emphasise this again. I would love to hear from people that have reached their goal and if they were able to maintain the weight loss. I dont plan on staying on it long term as it is pretty powerful and and the longterm effects are not very clear. I have also read that if you are subject to a drugs test this can show up in your system the same as cocaine so please be careful.I am not sure how true this fact is. I would still recomend it with caution and again will stress the need for controle at the table. Regards to all trying to kick the habit of a lifetime (over eating)which is one of our highest killers.

I cannot stress those three factors enough!  
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/14/2010 3:04:47 PM	I have been on the drug for a little over four months. 65 lbs gone. I always go off the drug for one week, and I dont have the hunger that I use to have before I started taking this drug because my body is use to the intake that I have been doing since being on the drug. I use to have the dry mouth all the time but barely have it. Im hoping to lose 60 more lbs on the drug. However I work out, play a sport, and jog a couple times a week, and watch what I eat so I feel like Ive been successful with the help of this drug and my life change. I would recommend this drug to anyone because it has done wonders for me. Im a little nervous about stopping taking it but I think I wll be just fine with all the life changes I have made. Good luck everyone.

I began taking it on 09/28/10 and I weighed 168 now on 10/14/10 I weigh 156.4 puonds!! I like it because I use to think of food all day long and now I don't I feel good and I am not sleepy like I use to be which I believe it was the food and calories I was putting into my body!!! I have 28-30 pounds to go I am 5'4&quot;. The only thing that gets me is the dry mouth BUT it helps because I drink A LOT of water all day long! :)
Overweight	Thinkingthin, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/14/2010 10:20:52 AM	I was on a plateau after a year of being on weight watchers... I began this drug 37.5 dose on 082310 at 166 and now on 101410 am 153 and I am 5'4.  I would like to lose 13 more pounds at least while taking drug but only have 3 weeks left of rx.  Side effects include dry mouth the first two weeks, sleeplessness if more than one caffeine dring per day and occasional mild constipation.  I take this drug daily except for Sundays which I use to stay off of the drug so my body doesn't get immune.  I would love to hear from people who have lost and who have kept it off.  I still eat but I stay within my weight watchers points.  it would be easy to not eat and lose more because you're truly not hungry but I think the goal is to get in a habit of eating the correct amounts.  If you've lost and have kept it off please post your experience.

I have not experienced any side effects. Nervous about stopping, i've read some posts where they've gained the weight back but still exercised and stuck with the diet?  Very happy with results so far.

I am happy with my experience thus far, I have not had the jitters or any extreme burst of energy its more a steady burn throughout my day. I do forget to eat @ times I have to make myself eat more often than not. I have dry mouth so water &amp; chewing gum are my constant companions. i get a 30 min work out twice a day except for weekends my gym doesnt have hours condusive to my work schedule on those days but I still try to make it in once on those days. 
Overweight	sweetpea0810, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	10/9/2010 9:13:23 AM	I have been on this medication for a long time now. I have read that there are not any studies done for long term use, which I admit is concerning. Other than that, I have not had many side effects. When I first began taking it I did feel slightly jittery and did have the dry  mouth issue, but after a week or so it went away. I honestly have been on it so long I am not sure how much of my weight loss is due to the medication and how much is just eating better and working out. I do know that I am able to eat what I want, within reason of course, without too much of a problem with weight gain. I have hit a plateau with weight loss and have been at the same weight for the last 6-9 months. Also I did stop taking the Phentermine  recently to see if any of the weight would come back on. I didn't gain any weight, but I decided to get back on it after a month. Overall, I think it is a good drug that helps aid in minimal weight loss. Without somewhat watching what you eat and exercising I don't think people will see a substantial weight loss.
Overweight	Pretty, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	10/8/2010 10:42:59 PM	I am 5'2 1/2 and was weighing about 180.  I used this drug for about 3 months and got down to 138. The weightloss doc I went to prescribed this pill along with a water pill that I was only to take a half of per day.  My weightloss was so drastic because I took it the WRONG way!  When I wasnt hungry it was very hard to force myself to eat so most days, I wouldnt eat very much however, I ate what I wanted and I didnt workout much.  I also noticed that when I drank coffee or coke it increased the effect and I would be on the go all day long.  I did suffer side effects though..i couldnt sleep so I used the vitamin melatonin to sleep, I would get headaches which probably came from not eating enough (i didnt have them everyday) and thats about it.  I recommend trying it, as I read these reviews I see that most users havent had my luck so it apparently works different for some people, also I recommend getting it through a doctor not online because online they can sell you anything and say its phentermine, which is why some of the people who ordered it offline failed to get results.  
Overweight	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	13-18	10/8/2010 2:14:45 PM	This medication caused severe personality changes in me.  I was depressed, angry, and very agitated.  It worked as far as suppressing my apetite but I had to stop using it.
Overweight	top heavy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/8/2010 5:23:00 AM	I began med 10 days ago at 224.4lbs I am 6&quot;4 so didnt look too over weight but have been trying to get rid of a belly for years with different diets and exercise without success. now down to 211 lbs with fat around belly disappearing. no side effects eccept dry mouth so i carry a bottle of water with me. Loads of energy. Sleeping fine.I`v cut down on all the snacking between meals and replaced junk food with fruit. I have done alot of research onthe med and it works differently for different people but on the hole seems very positive.I have noticed the effects are not as strong as your body gets used to the med. The pounds will return if you stop taking it and return to your old habits. I found it brilliant to kick start me into action and now feel brilliant. I would reccomend it with caution. Make sure your doc knows of all your medical history before you begin on it. It will not work on it own you have to help it by doing a little extra excersise an cut out the fatty junk foods.Hopefully this helps and best of luck to everybody trying to get rid of the inches.

It really helped with cravings the first few months which helps to change eating habits. Lately has not been working as well, think my time is about up. Dr said it was to be taken no more than 6 months tops and I am about there. Would recommend it to anyone who needs help losing weight.

I take it as my dr. prescribes.  He says &quot;It is not addictive,but the body can develope a tolerance to it and it can become useless.  This is the reason for stopping the pill for 3 days twice a month. I have been eating better, and have lost 22 lbs in a little over 3 months.  There are times when I have stopped it for 5-7 days instead of just 3.  I still eat well, just more careful.  The only side effects that I have experienced is occassional nausea.  I am always looking for any changes in my health and/or behavior to be on the safe side.  This has been my experience.

I did not feel hungry .   I found myself getting hungry in the evenings though.   I have lost eight pounds.   Thought I would have done better since I have changed my eating habbits.   Dry mouth, bad breath and constipation are the side effects I notice. Today the dr added another pill.  Its 7am and I am wide awake. Not sure how I feel about it at this point.   It does curb appitite until you get used to it.   I am not giving up yet though.  It does not make me thirsty like the others have said.   Maybe I need to force myself to drink more water.

It made me become someone i am not . my wife, kids and job were all hurt by this med and to see that you can get this over the net in my oppinion is nothing more than the devil himself at work!I pray for those who are trying to lose weight and are relying on this for help

I keep it off until 2009 when I had a baby. I just re-started it and i love it. I started sept 2. and today sept 4 i down 13lbs. Most was fluid. I was up all night the 1st night because i took it after 7pm. Now i'm taking around 8/9 am. My energy level is up and i'm ready to do it again and drop this weight.

Overweight	energy1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/2/2010 11:16:17 AM	I started taking phen on 8/2 with a weight of 203. As of 9/2 I weigh 185. Thats 18 pounds in 1 month time. I have been eating healthy 3 to 4 times a day, I work out every morning and during my lunch at work. I started out with a weight of 225 and lost 22 pounds on my own but was stuck at around 200 for a while. So yes I do believe that this pill helps. But no you can't just sit on your butt and eat whatever you want whenever you want to. Get up start moving and feel over all so much better!! I have more energy and I am loving life. I did have dry mouth a time or to and did get angry easier than norm but not often. This pill is a jump start to a new life style just don't depend on it.

I ignored the symtoms and thought it was something else. Now i have the same problem again sinces taking it. Im up now at 4am because i can not sleep. Sad because it really works for me, I loose weight and have lots of energy. Thats is why i rate it so high. It really works! oh yes and very very dry mouth,but i dont mind that because i drink more than my required amount of water. 
Overweight	Tboy69, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	9/1/2010 3:31:51 AM	I am an overweight woman, age 41, with Type 2 Diabetes. With my doctor's approval, I started on Phentermine 37.5 on August 1,2010. I had never heard of this drug, until my doctor suggested it to me and prescribed it for me to try. I was concerned about taking any weight loss pill, in fear of side effects.Some weight loss pills out there, I heard can be bad for you. ( I am still seeing the lawyers ads on tv for people who have taking Phen-fen, and had bad problems with it) But I am very please with Phentermine. My doctor told me he has alot of his obese Type 2 Diabetes on it and they are doing well. So far, I lost 12 lbs in one month. Now I am not saying this is a magic pill, but with diet and excerise, it sure is helping me along with my weight loss journey.

That totals to 18 lbs in two months and a half.  Not bad.  So I am now at 178lbs and loving it.  I am continuing on the 30mg and so far only issue I have is dry mouth and that time of the month when my craving really strikes especially sweets.  Will be back to Dr on 9/29/10, crossing my fingers for another 10lbs if possible. Will keep posting. Bye!!!!

I have been on Phen for 2 days now and already lost 2 pounds!!! The 1st day I had so much energy I didn't know what to do with myself so I went to the gym, and for the 1st time in my life I enjoyed working out and it was amazing! However, that night I had trouble sleeping and the next day I didn't have as much energy I will keep everyone posted on my results so far so good. All I need to do is to eat a little healthier and I should lose more weight. I also don't feel my appetite suppressed maybe because my doctor gave me a lower dose I only take 15mg a day.
Overweight	DwnA9, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	8/26/2010 4:03:59 PM	I went to the weight loss clinic that prescribed this drug on Aug 23rd and also received the lipotropics injection that same day in the clinic. I started the phentermine 37.5mg the next morning around 7:30 am and take it daily. The day I went to the clinic I weighed 213lbs at 5'8&quot;. As of this morning, Aug 26th, the scale says 207lbs. With that being said, I have been able to watch what I am eating and I do not have anymore cravings or the urge to just eat for no reason. I was told to cut back to one diet coke per day and drink more water so I have been doing that as well. It has definately suppressed my appetite and seems to have an affect on my behavior with food. Since I am taking both the phentermine AND the lipotropics injection I am not sure which is the most effective or if it is the combination of the two but I am pleased so far. Right now I do not experience many of the side effects that I have read about but I am keeping a close eye on that. I will post again in a few weeks.  
Overweight	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	8/26/2010 3:54:02 PM	I have been taking the drug for 4 months lost over 32lbs. but it seems like I'm at a stand still, I'm doing the same things nothing has changed but it's been over two weeks and have not lost a pound but I haven't gained any either. anyone else done this?
Overweight	dieter101, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/26/2010 11:40:20 AM	Dr.'s scale had me at 199 lbs when I started Phentermine 37.5 mg. four months ago.  I have lost a total of 30 lbs. and two pants sizes. Doctor is very happy with the rate of weight loss and so am I.  Lose weight fast will cause you to gain it and more back.  Only side effect is dry mouth. Energy level is back up to where it use to be.  I take the pill around 6:15 a.m. M-F and eat yogurt or a low calorie cereal bar around 9:30 a.m.  That keeps me going until lunch then I have a salad / fruit or lean protein.  I have slimfast snack bars several times a day and a very sensible dinner.  Daily calorie intake is 900 - 1200 calories.  
Overweight	Grl30, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/25/2010 2:41:07 PM	I was 221 when I began taking Phen and I was at a loss, I just couldnt lower my calories enough. I started to take it and I didn't like it much at first. I felt jittery and my eye would twitch. I love diet soda and when I'd drink some while on it, I'd go through a bad anxiety/depression. I wasn't taking it daily and I was feeling too weird to really get serious about dieting the first month. Id even go off on the weekends. The following month, I decided to get serious, and I nixed the diet soda. I ate about 1550 calories per day and later began adding in exercise. I lost 17 lbs in the two months I took phen. Now when I stop taking it for a week, I am able to keep my calories low because my stomach has shrunk and I know that I need to use my calories in a more useful way. I fill up on veggies and fruit and make everything else a secondary, as it should be. I don't go overboard trying to do 1200 calories per day. I'm still doing roughly 1550 and exercising but I make good choices. I know this is a great drug but you have to work too. You cant expect to just get thin on it by starving yourself while on it and doing nothing else. Ofcourse you will binge when its out of your system if you starve yourself while on it. You should eat enough calories even if you dont feel hungry and make those calories ones that count. You have to be smart on Phen, you cant expect to lose 20 lbs per month because you will gain it back and look flabby... this drug can help you lose weight at a moderate pace if you use it correctly. It's for people who have the will but needed an extra push to help out.

Overweight	Che, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	8/24/2010 3:45:47 PM	The last time I posted was on 7/7/10 and I had lost a total of 64 lbs. since starting this medicine in January. Today I am happy to say that I am 72.5 lbs. lighter than the day I started this! I started weighing in at 330 and I now weigh 257.5!  Fabulous! I don't take the medicine everyday, like I stated in my last post. I find it works better for me when I skip days. I also find that on those days I don't take it, I continue to eat as if I were taking it. It's definitely a tool in behavior modification, if nothing else. But you must work in accordance with it. Point blank.  The pill does not do all the work, trust me.
Overweight	helpless, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	8/23/2010 5:52:51 PM	Started phentermine 2009..was on it off and on..everytime I go off of it I gain weight back fast..even though I'm still strict with what I eat and exercise..it doesn't matter! Works great while your on it but your doomed when you go off so beware! It becomes very stressful. If anyone knows of any help let me know.
Overweight	mamasusie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/21/2010 8:54:19 PM	This overweight medication is wonderful and I wish a person would not have to go to the Doctor for it.  It could help so many people.  I feel wonderful on it and also about myself.  I have been on it for 2 1/2 months and have lost 21 lbs. I have more engery then I have ever had and it REALLY works.  It will leave you with a dry mouth but you need to drink more water any way.
Overweight	runner, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/21/2010 10:20:04 AM	Very effective in supressing my appitite. It has helped with will-power and hunger attacks. It has also helped reduce my cravings. I would highly recommoned this drug to anyone who needs help getting started on the road to better health.

Overweight	momofone, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/19/2010 2:02:15 PM	My starting weight was 183 lb., and I'm 5'3&quot;. I started taking phentermine (37.5mg dosage) on 8/6/10. It is now 8/19/10 and I have lost about 13 lbs. I exercise 6 days per week for about an hour and a half. 45 mins of hardcore cardio and 45 mins of weight training and ab work. This pill has completely transformed my apetite, I find it hard to make myself sit down to eat because I'm usually not hungry at all. I try to eat between 750-900 calories per day. I now drink skim milk, no soda at all (not even diet), I drink mostly water and sometimes fruit juice. Upon first taking phentermine (for about the first week) I experience dry mouth and kept a liter of water with me at all times. I usually drink about 2-3 liters per day now. The first day I took it I also experienced a rush of energy (like drinking a 5 hour energy shot) but the next day and since then haven't felt that at all. Every Sunday I don't take it so I can feel it more during the week. One suggestion, if you start taking this pill make sure that you exercise because losing weight fast but with no diet or exercise will make you more succeptable to gaining your weight back almost immediately when stopping the use of this pill. Another little hint that I've found useful is if you get home from work and are very tired and don't feel like working out (I get up at 4:15am some days for work and feel exhausted when I get home) rest for about 2 hours and take half a 5 hour energy shot before working out and it'll give you the energy for a great workout (and they only have 4 calories). I'll keep everyone posted about how things go for me after my next doc apt., so in about 2 weeks....

Starting weight was 211 now 198lbs. after 10 days,weight has seem to remain the same 4-6days now.I lost the weight without exercising but eating healthy and no carbs,and lost of water.I believe it is due to the fact that I have not been eating much lately.Only side effects is dry mouth. Will resume at least 1200 calories and start to do some walking.Will check back in about 2wks. hopefully with more progress.
Other	Trish, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/19/2010 9:59:51 AM	This medication does work for weight loss and I was satisfied with the amount of weight I did loose in the first month. However I statred it to get me jump started on loosing weight. When i first started taking it I came down with severe bronchitis. My lungs were sooo tight that they didnt really expand when breathing in. I Thought it was a coincindence.I thought I had just caught a bug. Had breathing problems for over a month even after going to MD for breathing treatment and an inhaler. I had to go back for z pack. Felt good went back for my second month of pills and have lung/breathing problems again. And now getting headaches. I am going to stop taking the drug and diet and excercise as to not gain all the weight that I did loose back and to continue to loose weight. After all diet and excercise are the key.  I hope you all do not get the breathing problem as I did or any severe side effects for that matter.....Good Luck to everyone on your weight loss journey and dont give up.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/17/2010 9:11:17 AM	I've been taking Phentermine for about 1 1/2 months now and have lost 21 pounds. The side effects were present for the first week or two, but now I hardly have any. The side effects I experienced were dry mouth, jitters, not sleeping well and having so much energy I just didn't know what to do with it (I sit at a desk ALL day). But like I said the side effects subsided and I've lost the weight. I hate to admit this, but I haven't even exercised. The not wanting to eat and actually having control of my eating was enough. My caloric goal is 1200 (which is right for my height &amp; size). So I eat a fiber bar in the morning, lean cuisine or smart one at lunch and something sensible for dinner. I do allow myself a cheat day. Now I am down to 175. I would like to get to 135-140. TIME TO EXERCISE!! But to give myself some credit, before this medicine I would come home, make dinner and sit in front of the tv for the rest of the night until it was time to go to bed - I was VERY lazy. Now I make dinner, clean the house, take my little boy outside to play, etc. I don't stop until I hit the bed. To sum it up, I would recommend to my friends and family; and this has been really effective for me. 
Overweight	Lissie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/16/2010 1:37:31 PM	I have taken this for 8 months and have lost 80 lbs and at 120lbs am at my goal weight. However, I believe that weight loss is more mental than anything. The med helps with hunger, but unless you change your eating habits and exercise, the weight will come back when you stop any weight loss medication. I weigh,measure, and food journal everything I put in my mouth! I don't eat any processed foods, cut out all white carbs like sugar and flour. It's about being healthyand keeping off the weight.The meds just help get you there. The rest is up to you! GOOD LUCK!!! It's sooo worth it, it's not easy at first, but your body will look and feel amazing!
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	3	3	Female	25-34	8/12/2010 1:21:01 AM	I have been on this medication for 3 days now. I lost 4 pounds by the second day..wow..that amazing but the nausea, dizziness, gitters, and blurred vision is kicking my butt. hopefully it will pan out. I really don't have a desire to eat and anything and i can atest to the dry mouth which promotes drinking more water. I figure if I add a little more activity/exercise it will more effective. I haven't had much trouble sleeping...no bad news there. 
Overweight	Monica P, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/7/2010 11:21:32 AM	I started taking this drug 15 days ago my starting weight was 224 and now it is 210. the first &amp; second day I had such a boost of energy I actually exercised for about 1 hour and a half i felt like I drank 2 energy drinks and could not sleep at all had severe dry mouth and the thought of food did nothing for me. As each day passed my body started to adjust more to the medication I sleep great now I still do get random severe dry mouth but that only makes me drink more water I have changed my eating habits all together I exercise at least 5-6 times a week. It really does assist in not making you hungry and when you do choose to eat you want to make the choice not reach for a do-nut you reach for fruit or a veggie. I think so far it is great! It is a lifestyle change. I have noticed another side effect after others reviews I do have finger or joint strain on my hands like I have arthritis I thought it was because my office they run the air conditioner so high my office is usually somewhere between 68 - 70 degrees I thought my fingers were just freezing so I will talk to my doctor about that on my next visit. But 14 pounds in 15 days and a complete lifestyle change is pretty great with me! Good Luck to all of you but be aware of all side effects losing the weight means nothing if you are not healthy at the end.
Overweight	missy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	8/6/2010 7:06:38 PM	Well I have to share my experience with this stuff. It did help me to loose weight (about 35 lbs over 6 mos period) then I got pregnant. (did not know I was pregnant till about 4-6 weeks along) then I stopped taking it. however at 5 1/2 mos I lost the baby. Doctors are not sure why my body did this. Anyhow, now I am back on the phentermine(&amp; birth control) but cannot loose any weight at all. Im on full dose &amp; I just stay the same every week. ready to get myself off here in a week or two max if nothing happens. Doc says your body gets use to it, and maybe time to switch to another medicine.
Other	Amanda, 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4		19-24	8/6/2010 5:44:51 PM	I have been on the medicine for about two weeks (almost)! I have lost 5.5 pounds and still going down. I think the only thing that really bothers me is the dizziness,nausea, and constipation. I have had more dizziness than anything. Hopefully it will clear up. I am making progress.
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/4/2010 10:47:48 PM	I have been on this medication for 1 week today.  I would not weigh myself until I had been on it for one week and was happy with the results. Lost 10.2 lbs in a week. If nothing else, it has given me motivation.  I have to make myself eat and can only eat small amounts. (What a change for me) I don't think about food like I used to.  I have energy like never before. Having trouble sleeping and some constipation issues.  I am thirsty and drink water lots of water.  I am thankful for this opportunity and hope I can make life changes with this medicine.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	8/4/2010 1:32:44 PM	I have been taking this med for about 3 months I have lost 21 lbs I guess its better then 0! The only thing that I found bothersome is I have really dry mouth and need to allways have gum on hand because with dry mouth i get really bad breath. And its hard to fall asleep at night, but easy to get up in the morning and get going. 
Overweight	Anon, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/1/2010 8:24:34 PM	I've been on Phentermine for 1 week and have lost some weight, feel energized but not speedy.I haven't noticed the dry mouth but did have trouble falling asleep the first 2 days on it. I found that if I take it early in the morning (about 6AM) w/ a glass of water it works best. I eat small but healthy meals even though I don't feel hungry. So far, I am very pleased w/ this drug and this week will add exercise (walking) into the equation. If you are looking to lose weight, I highly recommend this drug! Take it early in the day and drink lots of water. Eat 3 small but healthy meals and exercise. By the time you're done with the drug, the change of lifestyle should be a new habit for you. I guess if you start gaining the weight back, you could just go back on it for a week or so. I am pleased so far with my results but I am making weight loss a lifestyle right now. Wish me luck!

The only side effect I have is dry mouth which just makes me drink more water, so no biggie there.  I've lost 9 lbs! I know it'll slow down but seeing that weight gone is awesome motivation.  I feel awesome.  I haven't had this much energy in I don't know how long.  The first day I took it I went to the gym and got on the elliptical for 40 min and did 3 miles.  I don't even remember the last time I did that.  Not to mention that even though I was breathing hard from the cardio, I wasn't winded or tired at all.  It's crazy! But it truly is a miracle pill.  I'm taking it supervised by a doctor which I do recommend.  I forget to eat sometimes and when I do it's small meals.  I ate half a sandwich for lunch yesterday, I don't remember the last time I ate half of anything :) If you need to lose more than 40 lbs this will give you the help you need.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	7/31/2010 2:11:59 AM	I've been on this med for 2 days now. Lost 1 pound. My appetite is completely gone and I have to force myself to eat small meals. My only complaint is that I can't sleep. In 2 days I have slept for 1 hour. I do have lots of energy but no other side effects.

Overweight	Shan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	7/29/2010 5:24:24 PM	I've been on Phentermine for three weeks now and overall results are good. Like others, I lost a great deal of weight in the first few days - 4lbs overnight and 7 total in the first week. Now I have lost a total of 10 lbs in three weeks (started at 209, now at 199). I think people should be aware that the initial huge weight loss is not the way it will be the rest of the time. After that first initial drop, the loss is definitely slowing down. I think that big initial loss we all see is definitely a result of the massive amounts of water were drinking to combat the dry mouth  so the majority of that first drop is most likely water weight. Ive been eating a very restricted calorie diet and wonder if I shouldnt be losing more than the 2 pounds a week Ive had the past two weeks. I think if I added exercise in, Id see bigger losses. But this is still working better than anything else Ive ever tried.My biggest complaint is that after taking it for three weeks, I get very irritable and unmotivated while on it. When I first started taking it, I felt great, had tons of energy and felt unstoppable. But this is typical for amphetamine-based drugs  just want everyone to realize that those great feelings you got when you first started probably will not last. Just be weary of this and make sure youre getting exercise to combat the lethargy.
Overweight	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	7/28/2010 12:40:44 PM	have lost 14 lbs since I started on June 13. Sometimes I have to make myself eat and I no longer crave sweets and ice cream like I did before. First few days felt a little bit jittery, but after a week or so the only problem I have is not sleeping well. I can deal with that as long as I continue to lose weight...hope to lose 30-40 more pounds. I try to eat low fat, low calorie, and high fiber foods. nothing but coffee and water to drink....so far very satisfied with this drug.

I lost 12 lbs. the first month and now average about 5-6 lbs per month.  I had a little trouble sleeping at first, but got used to it and now have no problems.  I would definately recommend.

I lost 88 lbs while on the meds and I was able to keep it off for about 5 months, until I found out I was pregnant.  I hadn't been taking it as I had reached a comfortable weight for myself. I did not find it difficult to keep the weight off as I had a new way of living after the 1st year.  I experienced moderate constapation and a lot of energy! I loved the effects this drug has on me and my life style!

I have never been so tired in my life. And as soo as you stop taking , weight comes back(some) because your system forget how to work. And I had hair loss.
Overweight	SuzyC, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/24/2010 11:41:09 AM	I've only taken this pill for 4 days, but so far I'm beyond thrilled with the results!  I'm 5'5 and have about 80lbs to lose.  In 4 days, I'm down 7lbs.  I fully expect this to loss rate to slow way down, but the initial loss has encouraged and inspired me.  The first day (37.5, whole dose), I had too much coffee and had a case of the jitters.  That wore off and became simply &quot;energy.&quot; I felt fantastic all day long!  The first night, though, even after taking my usual OTC sleeping pill, I was WIDE awake until 4am.  I would have gotten up to scrub the house from top to bottom but I didn't want to wake anyone else up. I read a book, watched tv, and eventually fell asleep at 4.  At 8am my husband woke me up and the minute I sat up I was wide awake and ready to tackle the day. I felt so great all day, and I would normally have been dragging my tail in the worst way after only 4 hours of sleep. Night 2, I was up until about 2am, felt great day 3.  Night 3, I slept like a rock.  So if you're having initial sleep problems, please try to give your body a few days to adjust.My plan:  About 1200 calories a day, I track all food, exercise, and daily weigh-ins in my calendar so I can see what's working for me), exercise 4-5 days a week (20-30 minutes on treadmill right now, as I exercised NONE before, but will be increasing that), only water or black coffee as beverages, I'm limiting carbs to only whole grains and fruits, trying to eat tons of steamed veggies, staying away from fried foods and keeping proteins lean. I had slight dry mouth, but nothing sipping water can't fix. I don't just have energy, I'm in a really good mood, too!  I wouldn't say exercise is a joy, but it's SO much easier to do now with my energy and the results I'm seeing. My only worry is that my body will eventually adjust to Phen quickly and it won't work for me. We'll see!  Remember that this is only a tool, not a cure, and take advantage of this opportunity to reset your mind and your body. Good luck!

It really helps me eat less and think about what I'm going to put in my mouth. The only things that have be a troubling was the dry mouth and the twitch in my arm, that my Dr. said will go away with time. Im 4 lbs. down and very happy, I have lots of energy and wake up in the morning refreshed. Although most Dr. will not give this to there patients as longs as you ask and have looked in to it and tell them how you are feeling most of the time they will help you out with getting it, although most insurance places will not cover it. Hope this helps! 
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/21/2010 1:57:10 PM	I started using this medication about a week and a half ago.  I am down 10 lbs already but think it may be more because I have been very constipated with it.  I have take 2 different types of laxatives for it and neither has seemed to provide good &quot;releif&quot;.  Other than that and the constant caffiene high I feel like I am on, the medication has worked well for me.  I will continue taking it and increase the fiber intake in my diet.

My doctor started me off with 1/2 a pill for five days.  The only side effect I'm having is &quot;dry mouth&quot;.   This actually helps me to drink more water.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/20/2010 3:17:23 PM	Well its been officially 2 months. 35 lbs down. Im very pleased with this medication. Im still walking and lifting small weights. I also take Vitamin D. I am very satisfied and grateful for the help of this drug. I still have dry mouth but that does not bother me. It just makes me drink more water. Hopefully my doctor lets me take it for 6 months. I think I should be close to the 130 that I want to lose by then. However, people have to understand that this drug is a boost to help you get started.You have to change your life style with eating and excersing to keep the weight off. Also, by looking at the info and reviews it seems like the drug works better is you have no health issues and are betweek 25-34 age. Just baseing that off the reviews on here. Good Luck Everyone
Overweight	elle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/20/2010 1:26:34 PM	I lost the nervous urge to eat, almost like it elmininates that as a coping mechanism.  I also lost cravings and food didn't seem SO desirable.  This truly is a miracle drug and I wish insurance/doctors were more on board with it and treated it like any other medication instead of keeping it on such lockdown, making it impossible to keep up weight loss sucess.  You can truly maintain weightloss on this medication with out having to feel deprived. I lost 40 pounds with it.

Overweight	amsnpo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	7/15/2010 3:06:10 PM	I absolutely love this medication. I'm 5'2 and on July 2nd I was 165lbs.  It is now July 15th and I have lost 14lbs.  That's 14lbs in 13 days.  I will say that I haven't noticed any side effects except maybe an occasional dry mouth but I would say this has happened twice in two weeks.  I just grab a sugar free mint and a bottle of water and it quickly goes away.  It really does curb your appetite very well and I have not experienced any jitters.  As a matter of fact, I feel better than ever.  Beginning to wonder if it has a mood elevator too.  I was in no way depressed before starting the meds but I have noticed that I feel much happier since starting them.  It also has helped me turn down foods that I normally would have gobbled down quickly.  That has been one of the best features I think.  I can go to a restaurant and want to order all the fattening items.  :)

Overweight	get in shape, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/9/2010 10:26:18 AM	Have been using this medicine for about 40 days and by combining it with a low fat, low carb and low cal diet and a medium amount of excercise (I should do more), I have lost 25+ pounds and more importantly, based on my body fat monitoring, all of the pounds that I have lost have been fat.  So, dont know how much is the medicine, how much is diet and excercise, but I know I have not had a difficult time eating less, so I credit the medicine for that.  
Overweight	Che, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	7/7/2010 11:05:11 AM	&quot;The last time I posted was on 4/12 and I'd lost about 40 lbs. Today I have lost a total of 50lbs. since starting this drug in January. Still eating low calorie/low fat meals; still exercising at least 4 days a week; still drinking alot of water. Still don't feel like I'm starving myself and I still don't deprive myself of something I like. Loving the way my clothes are becoming too loose for me!&quot;I wrote that on 5/14/10.  As of today I have lost a total of 64 lbs!  Still doing the same things as stated above, not much has changed in that manner. However, the effectiveness is not as strong as it was in the beginning.  But I find that when I skip a few days of taking the medicine, it works better for me when I restart it.  All in all it has been an amazing tool in helping me lose weight and learning how to keep it off.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	7/2/2010 8:15:58 AM	Someone else made this comment on 6/10/10:&quot;any side effects after stopping, thought i got a bad bottle. never made me tired before..&quot;I have been taking this off and on for about 3 years (after having babies).  I never had any side effects except dry mouth and mood swings.  I just got mine refilled 2 weeks ago and have since been having crazy skin problems (rash, dry patches), blurry vision, achy finger joints, severe gas, loss of ability to focus, and extreme munchies at night.  Again, I have never had any of these issues in the past 3 years.  I also was thinking it was a bad bottle because I've only had good experiences with phen.  Maybe there is an issue esp since this person posted this around the same time I got mine refilled...
Overweight	Peshu, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/1/2010 5:09:36 PM	I am in my 4th month of taking this drug, and have lost 30 pounds. Average loss has been about 2 lbs/week, which I am happy with; I hope the fairly slow rate will help me maintain weight once I'm off the drug.  I am 5'4&quot; and my starting weight was 200 pounds.  I was reluctant to take any weight loss drug for a long time, but after menopause I started gaining weight and could not lose more than 5-10 pounds on my own.  I have had no side effects other than mild constipation from time to time. I do sometimes feel very hungry late afternoon, but can't eat nearly as much as I used to.  I've cut way back on portion size, which was my main problem because I eat healthy foods and don't snack.  That was hard for me to do before I started Phentermine, and I tried many times.  I've now trained my eyes and stomach to recognize what a healthy portion is, and I hope that will enable me to sustain the weight loss.  I would like to lose another 10-20 pounds.  I have not been exercising much, and plan to ramp that up to tone and to help lose the additional weight.  I may ask my doctor to prescribe half the dosage he has been giving me, to wean myself off it. My goal of 150 may sound heavy, but that will bring me down to a size 10, and I believe that is a weight I will be able to maintain.  
Overweight	lily, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/1/2010 2:31:40 PM	Hi everyone! I'm back. It's July 1st and I went to my Dr's appt. today and I lost 9lbs. Not bad for not being able to exercise these past 25 days since I broke my toe.  My starting weight was 197lbs on 6/2/10 and today my weight was 188lbs. My Dr. did however increase my dosage from 15mg to 30mg, not because I didn't loose enough but because I began feeling a bit more hungry towards the early evenings these last few days, so will see what that will do for me this month of July.  She did stress for me to try to exercise even if I have to limp so that is my challenge for this month. I will get back to everyone in the middle of August after my Dr's appt. and let you know what my new weight will be. Again crossing fingers!!!!
Overweight	Mystic, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/1/2010 9:13:10 AM	Good morning I am checking in again I have been taking Phen for a month. My starting weight was 184 LBS and my current weight is 168 LBS. I could of done alot better but I stopped exercising after work I am to tired and I have a little one to chase and take care of I know its an excuse but I so tired I am going to start exercising at least twice a week that would help me shed more weight. I do wathc what I eat I eat what I want just in moderation like if I go to McDonalds I eat a happy meal they are only 410 cals minus the drink I get water instead and for lunch I intake 300 cals but if im not that hungry I eat a granola bar or an individual container of peanut butter. I am trying to stay focused but I am human and I do make mistakes abd when I do I make up for them the next day. I am very happy with this diet aid it helps me curb my desire to eat and i also like not belonging any more to te clean your plate club LOL.... My journey is not over yet I am a work in progress and I do see the light at the end finally. I will update in week I am hoping with more weight lost. Good luck to all of you in your journey and I hope all of you reach your goals.
Overweight	allison, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	6/30/2010 3:08:20 PM	I only noticed a decrease in appetite for the first week.  As I perused the listed review on this site I observed the older patients had less success than the younger.  Additionally, I am taking an antidepressant which makes me wonder if it is hindering the drug's effectiveness.

I took phentermine along with a water pill and lost the 34 pounss that I needed to lose.  I however exercise 6 day per week, so that helped as well.

Then I have to fight not to binge.The joints in my fingers severely ache when taking this medicine.  I am obsessed with cracking my knuckles throughout the day.  It is quite painful.  It feels like I have severe arthritis in both hands.

As of to date I have lost a total of 62,I still take 1 in the am and 1/2 at 1pm. I feel great all blood work is great, I walk Mon, Wed. &amp; Friday and do water aerobics on Tue &amp; Thur. I am so tired at the end of the day I have no trouble sleeping. I see some have problems with constipation I did to, but my remedy is I eat lots of spinach (I love it)I mix baby spinach in with romaine lettuce for salads or I like canned spinach and Sun sweet individual wrapped prums are very good also they make good snacks.

I was off it for a month Dr's order cause I was not loosing anymore weight. So I started the pill again last week and still have not lost anything. I am a bit frustrated I eat all the right things I walk 5 days a week.  Any new ideas that can help would be appreciated since this is last month of my pill. My Dr will not renew it.  
Overweight	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	6/24/2010 7:33:49 PM	This drug completely shut down my appetite from the very beginning. I have to force food down sometimes, but overall it's not a problem. I'm on my second month and I noticed that maybe the effectiveness may be slowing down a bit as I seem to be getting hungrier in the evening hours. I also have developed a little bit of a reaction, but I'm not completely sure if it's from the pills. My eyes are a little more puffy than normal, especially the bags under the eyes as well as the sides of the sockets. The area underneath and to the outside of my eye sockets have been itchy the last couple of days, especially at night. I'll have to go see the doctor and find out if it's an allergic reaction to the pill. The first 30 days of being on the medication, there were absolutely no problems. Now, two days into my second month, the eye area thing has started. I hope he doesn't take me off the drug, I love this drug for the appetite suppresant characteristics. I have NEVER gotten jittery or anxious while taking the pill. Let's hope it's something minor and I continue with my regiment.

Overweight	shamar, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/23/2010 9:35:11 PM	After being over weight for years and never losing all my pregnancy weight I went to the doctor and ask for a weight loss pill. He prescribed phentermine for me and I began taking it on May 23, 2010 and by June 23, 2010 I have lost a total of 13 pounds. Along with working out 3-4 times a week, and cutting back on what I eat. So far I'am very satisified except for my dry mouth and bad taste, so I drink alot of water and chew gum. The good thing is it gives me energy, but it hard for me to go to sleep at night and being irregular, so im trying to increase my water and fruit intake to see if this helps. I found myself getting bored very easily and anxious. At times I have no appetite or its very little and I'm satified very quickly after eating only a few bites of food and sometimes I can go half the day without eating anything so I will force myself to eat. I know this pill works wonders because I used to be addicted to sweets and ate desserts several times a week, very large portions, and now I may eat dessert once a week, usually on the weekends and I eat only a small portion because I only need a little to be satisfied. I will write another review when I hit my second month of taking this pill.
Overweight	lily, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	35-44	6/22/2010 12:23:27 PM	I am 37 and my starting weight at the time was 196lb. I started taking phentermine (15mg) on June 4 but to be honest I don't know if I have lost weight. On the 5th, I broke my toe and haven't been able to exercise.  I do however feel the difference in my clothes so I am hoping I have lost something.  My dr's appointment isn't until the 1st of July and that is when I will know how much I have lost.  I have been eating healthier and hope that has helped in some way.  This medicine does cause me to drink lots of water and has taken away my cravings for sweets.  I did experience some nausea and headaches in the beginning but they are fading away as the days pass by. I will post back on the 1st of July and let you know how much I have lost.

The only side effect i have had is dry mouth. I'm so happy my doctor suggested this medicine . I took it for the first three months then off one month and back on for three. I would recommend this to anyone in good health who just needs to lose weight. Luckily I changed my life before i developed health problems . I have changed my eating habits and my exercise habits and I have no intention of going back even after I reach my goal of 100 pounds lost . I don't consider myself on a diet I just make smarter choices and instead of channel surfing when i'm bored I go for a walk.

I have heart problems and I gained back all my weight after I stopped taking it.  Right after I stopped taking it.  My current Doctor says he won't even give it to his wife.  It really is very dangerous.  I weigh over 200 now and when I was on fastine I weighed l19.  Honest.  I won't go back to it.  It's evil, like ciggarettes.  Don't start on it.

Overweight	sistrpark8, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/7/2010 10:35:43 PM	I have been using phentermine since the end of April 2010 and have lost almost 30 lbs! I had been working out rigorously with a trainer and counting calories for over a year before my doctor prescribed me this pill. It has been great! I started only taking 1/2 of a pill twice daily and experienced little to no side effects. I would take them about 2 hours apart. Once when I woke up and once after my morning workout. I now only take 1/2 of a pill right when I wake up. You have to drink a ton of water because the dry mouth side effect can be rough. I'm interested to see if the weight stays off once I am finished.

Overweight	mackmama, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	6/5/2010 3:52:54 PM	I got my meds from costco it was only $14 bc my insurance would not cover it.Anyway I started on 6/2/2010 and I feel great I have to remember to eat and I have a lot more energy. I cleaned my whole house the first day and it cut out all my sugar cravings. I already ate pretty healthy and drank alot of water so cutting the sugar should help alot. I also take a step aerobics class twice a week so I want to increase my exercie but I am starting at 204 and I will report back in a month. I don't want to weigh myself everyday so I took the scale out of the house...good luck

Yes it does give u dry mouth for several hours after you take it, but well worth the weight lose. I walk at work about 2-3 miles a day and have cut down on food intake and better choices on eating out.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	6/1/2010 6:27:07 PM	The only reason I gave 4 stars for effectiveness is because I am only on day 3. Thus far, I have lost 4 lbs. I DO eat healthy and workout daily, and needed something to shed the last 30 lbs and my Dr gave me this after he checked my blood pressure and did an EKG. So far I have had no side effects except a little bit of sleeplessness-but it hasn't bothered me because I am just not tired. This stuff is awesome. But I only plan to do a 30 day cycle then break for a couple of months before I take it again (if I need to). Just research this drug because taken the wrong way can be fatal!!!

It has happened to me and all of my friends who have taken it. It works on your brain so you're not hungry. When you don't have it in your system, you're ravenous again!!

I also had an allergic reaction which made me itch every time I came in contact with something on my skin. Overall I lost 6lbs in 1 months and I could have done that plus more drug free with no side effects. I decided to stop after a month because I starting feeling depressed.

Although Phentermine gave me severe dry mouth, it was a very effective drug. After 3.5 months of taking the drug combined with exercise and my views on food intake, I have lost 60lbs, 40 inches, and 12% body fat.
Overweight	atheolet, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	5/25/2010 1:47:40 AM	I started taking Phentermine 5/19/2010. The loss of the lbs is amazing. I have lost almost 7 lbs in the first week. Hopefully can hit my limit of 140, as I am 203.8 lbs right now and I am 5'4. However this medication does seem to mess with my emotions a little bit, and I feel like I am geeking on speed. I dont know if that does go away over time. I also have to make myself eat. I feel the best when I have eaten fruits and vegetables. I am at the point where I cant stand anything too sweet.....something with too much sugar. I am getting myself on a good diet of fruits veggies whole wheats, and more fiber. I am also planning some more exercising as well. I am positive I can reach my goal

Overweight	fluffy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/19/2010 12:46:38 PM	people..... it doesnt matter how much you execise if your pounding donuts and cheese burgers, guess what? its not gonna help. niether does starving yourself. try eating healthy every 2 hours. example: small bowl raison bran, 2 hours later and orange 2more hrs string cheese 2 more hours a granola bar, 2 more hours a yogurt. and so on. by 3 of 4 you wont want to eat anymore. this isnt a magic pill. you have to make good choices. this is just a suplement to help you start a new lifestyle. go to weight watchers too, blast your stereo and dance around the house. but if your eating what your kids are eating, kids who need way more calories than adults, you might as well take a hose and attach it to your butt and pump crisco right into your butt, hips and thighs.

Overweight	loris, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/18/2010 10:05:08 AM	i took this med 4 years ago and lost 50lbs in 6 weeks. and my house was really clean lol. you have to eat healthy, not starve yourself and exercise. and you need to realize that when you start working out, you will actually slow your weight loss or gain weight amd this is because muscle weigh more than fat, but when you build muscle, your body will continue to burn calories whn your not working out. all of the sudden the weight will drop. DO NOT cut out a food group. eat whole grains, it'll keep you full longer. wheat bread, oatmeal brown rice. lots of veggies and yogurt. watch fruit, its high in sugar and too much will make you fat. i kept weight off with no pills for 2 1/2 years and recently started again. weigh every day to remind yourself what your doing but dont go by your weight, go by your clothes. its more accurate. cheat once in awhile so u dont binge. black jelly beans are a natural appetite suppresent and will help along the way. good luck!

I'm 29 y/o and 5'4&quot;. The first month I lost 10 lbs. Then 4 lbs. In March I didnt't lose a pound so I stopped taking it. Started back second week in April and I lost another 7 lbs for a total of 21 lbs. I do feel my heart racing at times but my sis took it and felt the same way. I am getting a little worried because my doc thinks she heard a heart murmur. However, she thought she heard it last yr at my physical and I was NOT taking this. I will take it another 2 months and see where I am. I'll update in June.

I have recommended this Med to friends but warned them about my experience.
Overweight	PhenterPRO, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	5/14/2010 3:47:24 PM	I have been taking Phentermine for about 2 years now on/off.  Let me tell you, after the first time I took it I lost 50lbs in 3 months, I continued to take it for another 2 months but it became ineffective, I built a tolerance to it.  Once I stopped I gained 75lbs back. (Yes the 50 I lost +15lbs).  I started taking this again in March at 248lbs and I am 51  and in an effort to get the weight off quickly, I cut my calorie intake DRAMMATICALLY (1000/day).  Bad Idea.  I only lost about 5 lbs in a month.  You have to remember that you have to take in enough calories to get your body off of starvation mode so that your body does not store fat and exercise.  In the past month and a half I have actually increased my calorie intake to 1700 and noticed the weight dropping off.  I have lost 14lbs with a total of 19lbs since March.  I had my thyroid testing done yesterday because I am still very sluggish, the doctor said if everything comes out normal, he will put me on B-12 injections as well as the Phentermine.  I will update in 30 days.

Today I have lost a total of 50lbs. since starting this drug in January. Still eating low calorie/low fat meals; still exercising at least 4 days a week; still drinking alot of water. Still don't feel like I'm starving myself and I still don't deprive myself of something I like. Loving the way my clothes are becoming too loose for me!

I lost maybe 20pds. Now I'm 53 and have CHF. Heart valves bad and BP has been up and no one thought about why. So people research before taking this drug. Eat healthy just cut out 3/4's of that junk food and you will see a difference. Take a walk with your BFF whoever that shall be. Just be careful taking this drug, it is a very harsh drug. I wish I had known more about the side effects back then.

Overweight	BUDDY, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	5/13/2010 12:58:58 PM	To all of those who are taking this drug ...STOP!  I took this drug in 2000 and lost weight very quickly however it left me with irrepairable kidney damage (THIS DRUG CAUSES HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE - THEN LOOK AT THE DAMAGE THAT HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE CAN DO TO THE KIDNEYS - I HAD NEVER PREVIOUSLY HAD HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE ) my brother also took the drug and is now awaiting a kidney transplant.  Prior to taking this drug we were both relatively healthy even though a little overweight.  I have since read reports of people in their 20's having heart attacks.  I would NEVER recommend this drug unless you want a life time of health problems/issues.  Sometimes we areall guilty of wanting a 'quick fix' but as I have said it could change your life for the worse.  This drug is nothing but a 'prescription version of speed'.

I lost 60 pounds on this drug in 2000 but over time it stopped  working, still to this day it doesnt work for me anymore!!!

I find that taking this medication gives me very dry cotton mouth, I find myself clinching my teeth (not grinding) kind've like tightening the jaw &amp; lastly, have trouble falling asleep even after the 12th hour of taking the medication. However, the medication is very effective at losing weight immediately. Helpful hint to all, drink LOTS of water. Good Luck All.

I started out at 235 now im at 210 i have been working out like crazy i run atleast 4mi a day walk 10,000 plus steps too.I've ran a 5k run and 10k run. It is HARD everyday to exercise,in 1mo i've ran over 100 miles  i make myself do it, 5-6 times a week. I'm not on a diet but i justs cut back on everything. I've been eating lots of veg, turkey, and wheat, fiber...If I must say my IPOD is my best friend, with a lil bit of music, it tracks my steps and my miles everyday. My Dr.is so proud of me she gave me another Rx for 30 days and im gonna continue to keep moving, I don't want to hooked on this drug, so I will be careful on mt intake. Well to all of you, keep doing what your doing and I wish all of you the best of luck. I will be back in 30 days for a update.
Overweight	mtbroadcaster, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	5/12/2010 5:08:03 PM	I started Phentermine on March 10, 2010.  Today is May 12, 2010.  As of date, I have lost 45 lbs in the last two months.  Using this drug along with exercise and a &quot;lifestyle&quot; change of food, has helped greatly.  I did gain 3 lbs one week because I wasn't listening to the pill and still eating even when I wasn't hungry.  This pill curbs hunger like you wouldn't believe.  Even though you forget to eat, need to make sure to get in your recommended daily caloric intake, mine is 1600-2000.  Going to low on the calorie side will result in the body storing the fat that you have so it can use it as energy, thus you're not loosing.  Changing your lifestyle and how you eat and workout is the most hardest thing I have ever done!  There are days that I could still go for that Double Quarter Pounder at McDonalds and trust me, I have failed and ate it all!  I'm looking at myself as we speak, thinking that I have lost motiviation to continue on this journey but reading others post on this topic has helped greatly.  Only side effect I have seen is an increase in blood pressure and becoming dizzy when standing.  Great drug in helping with this issue.

I was at 320(male 6ft 26yrs)and am now 259 but i also combined this with the P90X workout,30 min on the treadmill atleast 4 days a week, and I compleatly changed the way I eat.This drug is effective with exercise but just this drug and no exercise you will lose weight very slow. Remember to drink alot of water because it will dehydrate you. I was a lil jittery my first week on the pill but after that my body was use to the pills im glad my doctor put me on this. 20 more pounds and i will be able to join the army!!! 
Overweight	Kimberly-Ann, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/7/2010 3:52:07 AM	I am on my 3rd taking this med and i already feel great. Only because im never hungry so i hardly eat at all and im still full of energy. Obeisity is very strong on my dads side of the family so ive always been a large girl.Im 26 and i have a 2. I had no time to try to lose weight. Plus i was a massive overindulger in everything. I wemt to the Dr. he put me on lexapro and this new diet pill. I feel like a brand new woman even though i havent lost weight yet im still confident that its going to work and be great.Ive tried all the over the counter weight loss meds and got no results. I now feel like i cant drink enough water. Its like the best tasting thing ever. Somtimes i do have a craving for 1 soda which is fine by me with all the water ive been drinking. The one draw back is i dont feel like eating and i only want to drink water. I literally have to force myself to eat something and i never eat pass 6pm. I weigh 204 and it would be nice to get to 150 but thats a massive goal so right now i would be happy with 170. I didnt start ganing weight till i got depressed. Ive tried everything. Last year I busted my butt trying to lose weight and i lost 50lbs in 3 months. Thats because i starved myself and worked out likt crazy.But then i gained that back plus another 20. So im really looking forward to this. Im full of energy and it makes me want to always do something. Its like i cant let myself be a couch potato anymore. Im loving it. I will repsot in a month to see how things are going. Which from the way i feel right now its going to go great. Wish me luck.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/1/2010 2:57:33 PM	I started this drug Jan 09 and by June 09 I had went from 5'9&quot; 225lbs to 167lbs. This is a great drug. Unfortunately, I have found it highly addictive and cannot go without it. Be careful starting on this drug. It is now May 2010 and I have kept the weight off, but I am still on the drug. Be careful! 
Overweight	Shug, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	4/30/2010 10:10:53 PM	I started taking Phen and B-12 shots on 4/27. My starting weight was 201 lbs. I am a female, 5' 10&quot;. Today, 4/30 I am 196. 5lbs in 3 days...I'll take it! The first day I felt a tad bit jittery and didn't sleep at all that night. Also experienced dry mouth. I am on 900-1000 calorie diet per day. BREAKFAST- slim fast or 2 eggs with 1 slice of whole wheat toast. SNACK-grapefruit, 12 green grapes, 2 plums, blueberries, strawberries, OR an apple. LUNCH-Smart One meal. I have cut out all sweets, only drink water, very minimum carbs (from the meal). DINNER- I am not really hungry, and if I do get hungry I eat more fruit or yogart. Or I have the option to eat 4oz of meat, 1/4 cup of veggies and 1/2 of salad. I DO NOT EAT AFTER 7pm. play the Wii for about 20 mins a day. I also have not smoked or had a drink since 4/27. Cutting Carbs, smoking, and wine at the same time...imagine that!! but seeing my belly shrink is well worth it. I will start getting B-12 shots weekly and hopefully I will be able to get Power Walking or the gym in very soon.

I was at 197 pounds and have lost 14 pounds, I walk for an hour 5 days a week. The only side effect I have is dry mouth which I have no problems with I just drink tons of water. After reading all the review I feel I should have lost more. I have change my diet really working hard, I only have one month to go, my Dr only wants me to take it for 3 months.  Any ideas on how to loose more than the 14I have lost?  My goal is to be at 135 to 140.  I can use some new ideas on food, snack,I want to do this the right way please!!

Overweight	ReclaimingMyLife, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/27/2010 12:06:37 PM	I'm 26yrs old, 5'4, started at 170lbs in Feb'10 and lost 20lbs as of Apr'10. Diet and exercise habits were not drastically changed while on this medication. Smaller food portions were consumed during the day, which lead to increased hunger at night. Did experience anxiousness (similar to effect of caffeine) for first few hours after taking medication. Insomnia for first 2 nights. Also, noticed a slight increase of sweating. Appetite has been suppressed. Lighter foods, such as fruits, salads, and leaner meats, seem more appetizing than fattier counterparts of typical, Americanized, &quot;convenient&quot; foods. Energy was boosted, especially after losing 10lbs in the first 2 weeks. I still do not regularly and conventionally exercise as I find it highly boring. But I have increased the amount of physical effort I put into common daily activities, such as walking and lifting more at work (I am a diet aid and a waitress), scrubbing house floors instead of using an easy mop, washing dishes instead of using the dishwasher, push-mower instead of riding-mower, etc. This, in the past month, has increased the inches I lost as opposed to the weight I lost (for the past month I only have lost 5lbs, but have dropped 2 dress sizes), which is good because I know I am losing body fat and increasing lean muscle weight. Overall, this medication has given me the boost I needed for taking control of my physial health and nutrition. I am still on this medication and intend to lose another 15-20lbs. 
Overweight	lajjw1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	45-54	4/24/2010 10:29:55 PM	I have been takint this since march2010 I have lost 16lbs so far dry mouth is not as bad found that less carb makes it better as with some others I find that it is not as effective as in the begining at first I had no appetite  now at the end of the day I am very hungry so I started spacing out my meals and saving my snacks for that late afternoon hunger  have begun to exercise more but I realize that this is just an aid I still have to put in the work because I want this to permanent and I dont want to rely on drugs so if I have eaten all of the food that I am supposed to and I begin to feel hungry I get a cup of tea and some water and that usually fills me up until bedtime hang in there everybody we are worth it
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/22/2010 12:00:20 PM	I have been taking this medication for 2 weeks now and have lost 15 pounds! I am 29, 5'5 and my starting weight was 215. I have experienced some slight side effects like slight depression, increased heart rate, and I also had trouble sleeping for the first week but that has gotten better. I still have another 50 pounds to loose so I hope it keeps working like it has! Also my Dr has put me on a 1200 or less diet which I believe will help me in the long run once I stop taking this medication. I don't want to gain all this weight back when I stop the medication (like I have done with all other diets I have been on) so I am making a change in my diet that I hope to keep forever. Although this med has some side effects I believe that the benefits outweigh them.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/17/2010 9:45:42 AM	I am down 8 lbs in a week and a half.  I am doing this along with Weight Watchers and it is working.  I eat very sensible and exercise about 4-5 X a week.  I started taking this because I got to the point where I was staying the same weight for a long time.  This has helped my evening cravings tremendously!!  I have about 50 more lbs to go.  I notice only the dry mouth now.  No other side affects now.  I reccommend this under Dr. supervison.  I think you still have to count your calories and exercise to be successful.  I think if you do this, once you stop taking the drug you will then now how to maintain and keep the weight off without the drug.

I lost 20 lbs. in 2 months! I didn't start exercising until a month after I started taking the pills. Within the first month I had lost 8 lbs. I recommend this pill for anyone who wants to lose a lot of weight, but not for anyone trying to lose a minimal amount.

I dont know why this is, although I have not asked the Dr yet. I dont want to stop taking it because I am desperate to lose 20 lbs but I am begining to realize its no longer working for me. Anyone else have the same experiences?

I have been taking this med for 6 weeks and only lost 4lbs. I have noticed my clothes fit a little better, but the weight scale still shows 150lbs for a 5'0 short girl! Not one day of exercise other than doing daily chores. I have noticed an increase in concentration, but not in energy! I am sleepy at night and don't notice much with taking 30mg capsule.  I guess i was afraid to exercise vigorously as i thought maybe it will cause my heartrate to go way up.  I guess i will start some walking, but not sure i want to take this med for much longer.  It did cut my appetite, but i never ate much anyway.  I guess its not for folks who want to lose less than 20lbs!! FYI.

Overweight	MrsAndres07, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/13/2010 8:43:59 AM	It has been 3 days since I started Phentermine. I started out 21 years old, 5'8&quot; and 196lbs. I have lost a total of 4 lbs already at 192lbs. The diet plan the Dr has me on is to cut out all sweets, soft drinks, juices, and other sugary drinks. Eat a hearty breakfast, followed by a small lunch. Absolutly no eating after 1pm, unless its a salad with light dressing. Eliminate super all together. So far I have done fairly well. My hunger pains are almost gone. The drymouth is still there, but it helps me drink alot of water. The first night of sleep, I didn't sleep hardly at all, but the second night I slept most of the night. We'll see about the third night. I feel happier and have tons of energy. I recommend this drug to anyone trying to lose weight.

I have lost a total of 18.6 pounds since 3/5/10. I do get dry mouth but I chew sugar free spearmint gum and it helps a lot. I drink more water than before and also cranberry juice diluted with a little water.  I am very happy with my progress and should be good to go for summer camping at the beach!

I cleaned my whole house top to bottom! It is spotless! ha ha. I feel great, better than I have felt in the past 6 months. I'll keep updating on my progress! 
Overweight	Che, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/12/2010 10:23:13 AM	The last time I posted was on 2-17 and I had lost about 25 lbs by that time, after having started on 1-10. By 3-13 I was down 31 lbs from my original weight, 330. Since then I have lost another 10 lbs. A total loss of 40 lbs since starting this medicine. This is with exercising for about an hour a day, at least 4 days a week; eating low calorie/low fat meals; drinking at least 100 oz of water daily. This medicine has truly helped me in learning how to eat better. I rarely take the meds on weekends, mainly because I don't have a set schedule like I do during the week and I forget to take it, but yet I am still able to maintain how I eat on those days. I don't over do it. And I don't deprive myself of anything either, and that was a problem I would have in past diets. If I had to cut something out that I know I liked to eat, it wouldn't work for me because I'd always end up eating whatever it was. This pill has helped me to eat those so called bad things in moderation. So...it's like the best of both worlds for me. Good luck you all.

Overweight	Red, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/9/2010 11:42:12 AM	Overall it helps very much.  It reduces cravings and gives you energy to work out.  It does seem to make sleeping a bit more difficult but worth it.  I lost 16 pounds in one month using the drug and working out.  It does lose it's effect after a while.  I would recommend only taking it for 3-4 weeks then giving it a little break.  Then a couple weeks later start again. Meanwhile you will have to watch what you consume while not on it.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	4/5/2010 10:12:05 AM	There is not doubt as to whether or not this medication works. I lost 7 lbs in 6 days, however I have been very sick. I am not sure I would inform others to use it unless they are able to handle the side effects. I basically felt as if I had a severe case of the flu. Chills, headache, etc. My body just felt awful. I must mention that I am one of those people who can't take many drugs without experiencing side effects. High dosages of anything makes me feel weird, so this drug fell into that category. I have stopped taking it after only a week. After two days the sick feelings began so I stopped. Good luck if you have a high tolerance but it's not for everyone. I even tried lowering the dosage and I was still sick.

I've tried other weight lose substances and the result was me having more seizures.  Besides that, I don't hardly eat as much as I did before and I can exercise better and stay up longer.  I was the type to sit down for a hair cut and fall asleep.
Overweight	ambertwilight, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/2/2010 6:09:19 PM	I'm 5ft5, 30 yrld female. I started taking this drug on March 23 2010, when I weighted in at 287lbs. As of April 2 2010 I now weight 269lbs, which is about 18lbs. I had already stopped eating the really bad foods (losing a gallbaldder will do that to you) so my eating habits haven't changed over-much. I'm just not eating as much. I've also found that I have way more energy than I ever have before. I haven't been getting much sleep (only 3 hours the first night, and usually 4-5 now) but I'm never tired, so I consider it an acceptable trade-off. I highly recommend giving it a try!

Overweight	hopefulgirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/30/2010 6:53:26 PM	Started Phen on 2-24-10 at 239 lbs. Am 48 and 5'8. Today 3-30-10 I am at 222 - about 17lbs gone.  All side effects gone.  The dry mouth was helping me to drink more water - now I have to remember on my own. Had cold feet at night but that's gone, too.  Some trouble sleeping the first two weeks but that is gone as well.  Working with my doc - seeing him every two weeks for monitoring.  It's really helped me to control cravings and suppress appetite.  Have more energy now.  want to lose 33 more lbs.  You still have to control old habits like overeating and eating the wrong things but I find it easier to make good food choices since the cravings for carbs are gone.  I don't deprive myself foods I like, just limit how much.  I'll keep trying and seeing the doc.

I am 5'7&quot;..I am 50 yrs. old.  It is March 29th, and I weighed this am 216.so a 9lb loss.  The side effects that I have experienced are dry mouth..I was a little jittery but that is passing...I am not hungry at all have to remember to eat...I take it at 6 am when I get up for work so by the time I get to work like 7am or so I drink a Atkins Advantage shake and also for lunch....this way I know I am having something....for supper consists of healthy picks..grd turkey,chicken, or a fish..veggies, &amp; fruit...I don't come home now and binge eat like I did before..I do have more energy..I have to check in with my doctor a few days before my script runs out..as the company he is associated with doesnt allow a refill on in unless you see him...also he told me to that as soon as he writes the script for me to go get it that day as it is time sentitive my insurance wont cover it but it is cheaper than ALLI..cost 45.00 but a friend said she got it for 18.00 with Kmart Prescription Plan ? so I am going to check this out.  Just remember this is not a lifelong way of life ...to me it is a boost that I needed with getting back on track...just remember to drink your water and pick healthy choices...you will eat alot less...Good Luck and I hope this has helped you on making your choice..will let you know I am keeping a daily diary of how I feel and what i weighed and what I ate and I will be taking this to the doctor when I go to get my next refill...also try to put in some kind of exercising walking or get a DVD like lesile samsons Walking Away the Pounds...remember this will help with the weight loss also...I will keep you all posted on how I am doing ...maybe once a week.

Overweight	BelleAme28,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		3/25/2010 12:05:45 AM	I have been to three different doctors and not one will prescribe Phentermine, even though I am exercising five times a week, keeping a 1000 calorie (sometimes less) diet of healthy foods, and doing everything right. I just can't seem to get the weight off and it's frustrating that they won't listen. Any advice on what you said to your doctor? Is there anyone that is no longer taking Phentermine that I would be willing to sell it? I know that sounds skeezy but I don't know what else to tell my doctor! Thank you. (Belle Ame 28 at yahoo)
Overweight	Sadi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/24/2010 4:43:17 PM	I've been on this drug for three weeks now.  I am extremely pleased.  Not only is my appetite reduced greatly, I have been more energetic and active, happy in general, and more focused at work. I know this sounds funny but I've had adult acne (the kind that sits under the skin) for a long time.. and since I've started this pill, my skin looks awesome.I only see two drawbacks:1)I do have to take the pill early or I won't get to sleep at a decent time.  2) There IS an awful tast in my mouth all the time.  I'm so afraid it's also bad breath, so I am constantly brushing my teeth several times a day.  So, actually, food doesn't taste it's best anymore either.    Guess even though it's a side affect, it works... food taste bad, so I crave it less and my teeth get extra care and attention.

Feel fine except I have a constant bad taste in my mouth.  Even when I do eat, nothing tastes good.  I'm losing weight but hate this side affect. Anyone else have a bad mouth taste?  
Other	workinit, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	3/24/2010 11:44:57 AM	I started taking this medication about a month ago. I have two more weeks left. I have already lost 20 lbs. I take the medication in the morning on the way to work. It seems to keep its &quot;energy&quot; effect for about 12 hours. You can time it accordingly. I take it at about 730am, so I'm able to start widing down and getting ready for bed by 8pm. If you take this pill too late in the day, you will not be able to sleep at night. There have been 2 weeks in which I skipped a Sunday (because I woke up too late to take it) and during those weeks, I didn't see as much weight loss as the other 2 weeks when I took it daily. I make sure that I'm watching what I'm eating and make sure that I eat atLEAST 3 meals/day. Rather than snacking througout the day, I've added a, light, fourth meal. I have breakfast early in the morning, lunch around noon, something light (like an egg sandwich) before the gym, and dinner when I come home from the gym. If I'm still hungry, I have a weight watchers ice cream bar or a sugar-free fudgesicle. You NEED TO WORK OUT while taking this pill. Your results will not be as drastic if you don't go to the gym and get your butt in gear! I do an hour of cardio a few times a week, plus some weight training. I don't have myself on a strict gym schedule, but I end up going 5-6 days/wk, anyway. This pill has helped me change my lifestyle. I now realize the difference between feeling full when you're really full &amp; feeling full when you're snacking on &quot;small things.&quot; I would reccommend this pill to anyone who is SERIOUS about losing weight and making a lifestyle change. I am aware that the weight will come right back if my habits did not change. I've taken the initiative to change, and it has worked for me!
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/24/2010 6:48:32 AM	The key to this medication is making sure you drink a lot of water. I find myself not liking to drink as much caffine drinks as I used to. I also have been making better choices on the amount of foods I intake as well as the types of foods I ingest. So far I have lost 15 lbs. and have been able to keep it off. Eventhough I haven't gone back to gym, due to working, but when I do will have no problem getting back to my ideal weight of 150.

Overweight	Lil K, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	3/23/2010 1:11:45 AM	I take many drugs for depression=Paxil CR 37.5mg, buspirone(gen.

It was 75mg which is half of what I take now as Phentermine. Is it possible all the meds I take now and the fact I am taking a lower dose of Phentermine that it does not affect me like it did then? No energy, or weight loss. Any help would be appreciated.

I took it for almost 3 months and lost a significant amount of weight but i gained it back very quickly. I recommend if your not extremely overweight to continue to rely on diet and excersice instead.

I was a little jittery the first time I took it, but haven't had that side effect since, overall for me the side effects aren't too bad, especially if I can keep shedding the pounds like I am. It does reduce my appetite, and I don't feel hungry during the day, I never thought I would have to force myself to eat but with this I do. I'll keep you posted on my progress!
Overweight	annonymous, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/21/2010 2:25:05 AM	I started taking this medicine around the second week of Feb. I've lost about 15 pounds so far. After the first month I went in for a follow up and the dr gave me an additional 90 day supply with a check up to follow after. I've noticed in the last two weeks that the amount i'm losing is slowing down but it seems better on days where I drink more water than normal. I do have some minor side effects mostly dry mouth and occasional constipation. I try to eat a fiber 1 bar everyday and that seems to help the issue. I occasionaly get a little jittery but I find it's only when I didn't have much of a breakfast at all and then took the medication. Overall I am very pleased, my energy is better, not as much as when I first started the medication but it's enough so that I exercise more and I think the medication keeps me more motivated because I actually see the weight come off; which keeps me wanting to work out and eat right. I would reccomend this to anyone who wants a little help to kick start their weight loss. Just remember it's only a tool and if you don't make a lifestyle change you will end up back where you were.

I also go to the gym everyday, eat right, and I'm overweight. I can't tell if the medication is the one helping me lose 5 pounds a week or if it's me. I've had NO side effects. Except not feeling hungry, but I hardly ever felt hungry anyway. I will probably be taken off this medication on my next doctors visit which is March 18th. 
Overweight	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/13/2010 11:08:46 AM	I started 10/12/09 so I've been on it 5 months. I take 1/2 37.5 mg tablet around 7 am, other 1/2 around 12:00 pm. I also follow a high protein/low carb eating plan. Lost 30 lbs in 2 months. Sometimes I did forget to take it, but still followed my eating plan. It has slowed down but that is because I have cheated a bit (darn those yummy carbs). I've lost 40 lbs so far and look and feel great. Definitely helps control the appetite. Dry mouth off and on, more energy but not jittery. I actually was pretty tired at first and had no problem sleeping. You will need to shop around for price.  I've been paying over $40 a month for the tablets.

I definatly think its worth a try and my script was only like $28.00 @ publix for the 37.5mg
Overweight	Eileen, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	5	3	Female	35-44	3/12/2010 6:42:51 AM	I started on the med on Mon.  By Wed morning I had lost 5lbs. Only side effect was dry mouth. However, by Wed night started experiencing loss of sleep only got 4 hrs.  On Thurs, later afternoon my pulse was racing and I only got 2 1/2 hours of sleep.  I love that the med can really help me lose weight, but I'm concerned at what cost.  Will talk to Pharmasist to see if maybe this can be taken every other day instead of every day to relieve the sleep situation.

I go to the gym more and keep a journal of what I eat.I will keep an update as to my progress.The side effects..... The money, ouch...

Other than that this medication is superb!

I am about 5'3 and I started weighing 155 lb. Today 03/08/2010 a week later I lost 5 lbs and am at 150. I don't expect to lose 5 lbs every week, but we shall see what next week's weigh in is. My side effects were dry mouth and jittery. I definitely ate less. I only got a chance to exercise once that week. Hopefully this continues.

Overweight	Sophie11, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	3/7/2010 11:43:15 PM	Definitely helped me lose weight. However, I felt panicky and agitated and couldn't concentrate. Had a terrible time sleeping. Sweat smelled like rotting apples. After my first month it started losing effectiveness, so I stopped taking it and just lost weight the old fashioned way: diet and exercise. And guess what? It works.
Overweight	jsvill30, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/7/2010 9:44:54 PM	Have been taking it for two weeks now and have lost 10 lbs. No working out just eating less. No really big side affects but dry mouth and weird taste.
Overweight	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female		3/7/2010 5:17:50 PM	5'4 205. Starting weight 220.In the first month I lost 10 lbs. This is month 2 and I've only lost 5. Not exercising just eating smaller and more healthy portions since I'm never really hungry. I also make sure to eat breakfast to jump start my metabolism. I think that's how I was able to lose 10 in the first month. Trying to lose weight for my Aug wedding. Will update next month!
Overweight	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	3/5/2010 4:01:14 PM	Phentermine is the only thing that will control my weight.  I seem to have more energy, do more exercise, and have stopped thinking about what I'm going to eat next.  No side effects, but haven't used it more than 3 months at a time.
Overweight	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/5/2010 1:40:22 PM	I started taking Phentermine 12 months ago and I have lost over 70lbs.   I feel great.  I have these results with only taking 1/2 pill.  I went from a size 20 and I am now in size 10/12.
Overweight	Justjohn, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	5	Male	35-44	3/5/2010 1:08:23 PM	I only just started this med today so I cant describe side effects - none so far after five hours - or its effect on weight gain. But after reading many reviews I am concluding that the drug works differently for different people and a review is not a perfect indicator of whether you should take it or not.This is not a miracle drug. It is an appetite suppressant to help you get your eating under control and maybe make it easier for you to exercise.  I need to lose about 68lbs and am combining this with a very low calorie, high protein diet. In a couple of weeks I will add exercise. But its the whole package people and it has to change your lifestyle or it will do nothing for you in the long run.  Just saying.

Overweight	Gorgeous!!!, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/3/2010 2:03:02 PM	I started taking 37.5,mg in Sep '09.  I am 5'4' and weighed 250lbs. I weigh 210 lbs today. I exercise 5-6 days a week for at least an hour.  I have incorporated weight training to firm up, but the muscle is heavier than fat, so that also contributes to a slower weight loss. The weight loss slows down the longer you are on the medicine. My blood pressure is good.  I do experience the dry mouth, but I find that if I drink lots of water, it helps. It is somewhat frustrating when you do not lose as much as you do starting off, but I am pleased with the progress.  I plan to stay on the medicine to lose a total of 75 lbs.  My cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure are all really good, so even though it is not coming off as fast, the health benefits are great.  I am looking at possibly eliminating my diabetes medication very soon. The weight loss has made me a healthy person and I still have more to go.  I am very engergetic, and I do not sleep a lot (only 5 hours a night) but I did not sleep a lot before taking this medication.

No weight loss in 5 months. Doctor keeps dishing it out. I am getting off of it as soon as possible. Waste of money, doesn't work for me...doesn't seem like anything will short of starving myself. I believe I am developing a tolerance at this point.
Overweight	mommyof1, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	2/26/2010 7:20:49 PM	HI! I needed some advice from people who are taking this medication. I am currently an ex smoker (have been quit since may 20th, 2009) and I have a thyroid problem (hypothyroidism) and wasn't diagnosed until 2 years after my daughter was born. I am currently taking hormones for my thyroid and its right where it needs to be but I am having troubles loosing the weight I am 5'1&quot; and weigh 130 Ibs. naturally I weighed 100 IBS prepregnancy and would really like to be down to that again. My doctor prescribed me phentremine and I'm a little anxious on trying it. I've read articles on wikipedia, fda, ect. on phentremine and I am a little scared about taking the drug due to reading about the major side effects and how this medication can make your blood pressure spike and/or heart palpitate, and I've read about how it could cause you to have cardio valvular disease. Can anyone give me any advice?????

Became very tired, no energy at all. weight loss was about 12 lbs.My chest started to feel funny, arms tingly and numb. Stopped taking this after getting very dizzy. I never should have taken this medication. Went thru a weight loss doctor.Only seen the nurse.. asked her about the the side effects and if I should see the doctor and tell him. She just felt it was due to the drug.  Not going back and hoping I did not hurt myself or my heart.
Overweight	hopeful girl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/25/2010 6:33:32 PM	I started taking Phentermine on 2-24-10.  I'm 5'8 weighing 239 lbs. Been exercising intensely most of my life but not able to control my cravings and amounts of food consumed.  In just the two days I have been on the meds, there is a noticeable decrease in my appetite.  I used to come home from work ravenous and raid the fridge craving mostly carbs but I haven't felt that urge.  I have more energy and feel great.  Just a bit of dry mouth and a touch of dizziness the first day.  So far, I've lost two lbs with ease.  It's amazing...I used to eat everything on my plate.  Today at lunch - got a salad with chicken and could care less if I ate it.  Had to force myself to eat and I left half of it on the plate.  Do you know how long I've been trying to do this with will power?  Too long - don't know why I put this off.  We'll see how this works for me.  My goal is to lose 50lbs.

I lost 18 pounds the first month combining the pill with weight watchers, I lost 6 pounds the next month and am currently working on my third and final month! Total weight loss right now is 35 pounds! I can definetly say that I see the best results on a weekly basis when I make better eating choices and WORK OUT! It's hard to stay motivated sometimes but it needs to happen! My bmi is currently at 33. Putting me only 3 points away from being out of the obese category! The medicine is great as long as you put the effort in.
Overweight	thankful, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/24/2010 2:41:16 PM	This medication has truly helped me. I have more energy and my appetite has definitely decreased.  I now exercise daily and have lost 6 pounds in three days.  It gives you dry mouth which helps with encouraging you to drink water.  I have taken this in the past and will stick it out for more than one month.  I would like to do it for about 3-4 and lose up to 60 pounds.
Overweight	jww, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	2/24/2010 2:30:18 PM	this is the second time trying this medicine. after having my baby my thyroid got out of wack and i gained back what weight i had lost postpartum. the first week was great i didn't want to snack and had energy. after the first week i couldn't tell i had even taken it and i am having to stop after 1 month because i am burning up hot and sweaty all day after taking it. i lost about 5 lbs in 3 weeks with diet and exercise. i still need to lose at least 23 lbs just to be prepregnancy weight and that is still about 50 lbs over what i am supposed to be.
Overweight	HONEY, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	5	4	Female	19-24	2/24/2010 10:50:33 AM	I started taking phentermine 37.5mg pills on Feb. 22, 2010. I am 24, 5'1 and weigh 198 pounds my goal is to lose 45 pounds by May of this year. I took the pills before (the lower dosage) in 2009 for 2 months, I lost a total of 22 pounds then I stop taking them. While taking the pills the first time around as others mentioned I had large amounts of energy, so much to the point that I woke up 4am after going to bed at 1:30am and cleaned my place from top to bottom. This is now my third day taking the pills and along with the massive amounts of energy I have this urge to want to clean or work (just keep busy) I am not really sleeping well and I do have the dry mouth. I have yet to start exercising but will. I will say one thing I'm experiencing now that I didn't the last time I was on the pills are migraines the first and second day was horrible but today seems to be fine. I have yet to lose any weight as of yesterday but it is only my third day. What works for me is once I get up in the morning I eat breakfast, then take the pill no later then 9am that way if Im not hungry at least I had something. Shall keep you posted once a month on my progress. Much luck to everyone.  
Overweight	Christina, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/23/2010 2:24:51 PM	My doctor prescribed me Phentermine after my bloodwork reported a high cholesterol. After only 2 months, I've lost 23 pounds. The compliments I've received have encouraged me to exercise more and watch what I eat so I can get the most out of this prescription. The only side effects I've experienced are dizziness and dry mouth. 
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/20/2010 11:14:37 PM	5'3, 147lbs.  I have been taking Phen for a little over a week and I have lost 9.5lbs.  I have a significant appitite decrease and an elevated amount of energy.  I am only looking to take off another 15-18lbs.Some of the negative effects are making yourself eat something.  I really have no feeling of hunger(which is the general idea, i suppose), so I make myself eat at least 3times a day.  I would hate to stop taking the medication, then start eating normally and gain it all back plus some.  So even if your not hungry its important to take in atleast 1200-1500 calories/day.  Also, I take two 37.5mg pills/day.  Once in the morning, after breakfast and the second around 2:30pm.  This allows me to have energy for the rest of the night and also stops the late night eating.

Overweight	Che, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/17/2010 4:15:57 PM	I forgot to mention in my earlier post that the pill has also helped me develop better eating habits. It has actually changed my thought pattern when it comes to eating. I am now counting calories and fat grams and am consuming no more than what my doctor suggested. I am eating 5 small, low calorie meals a day. I've incorporated more fruit and vegetables in my diet. I'm eating way less sugar and salt than I used to. Before taking this, my eating habits were the total opposite of what I'm doing now. I'm actually satisfied with whatever I'm eating and I don't feel the need to go back for seconds and thirds or to pile my plate up with a lot of food. To me it has changed the way I view food and how to eat. By working in  accordance with it (meaning eating healthier and exercising) the medication has proven to be a very helpful tool in losing weight. HUGE tool.
Overweight	stanley , 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	2/17/2010 3:59:50 PM	Due to obesity and encroaching age (62) my doctor suggested trying phentermine.  However, he gave no instructions concerning followthrough, and I have had to do my own research.  I have had a weight loss of 25 pounds in three or so months; very satisfactory.  However, shortness of breath is a problem.  Knowing its addictive effects, my concern is withdrawal in the future and possible weight re gain.  My diet consists largely of copious quantities of fruit and vegetables, lean meats, whole grains, and water.  This is all too easy.  I am praying for no serious long term detrimental effects or re bound weight return.

A year has passed and I've gained it ALL back! I love the energy, and the low appetite, but the side effects of being extremely moody, feeling weird, little sleep and headaches are not worth it. I began a low cal diet and working out heavy on Jan 11,2010 and a month later I have lost 10 pounds the natural way. TRUST me it's easier to maintain when it's done without meds! But good luck to those who choose to stick with the &quot;magic pill&quot;.
Overweight	Che, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/15/2010 12:34:33 PM	I started taking this medicine on 1-10-10 at 330lbs. I lost 10lbs. by 1-18-10, and that was taking half of a 37.5mg pill per day. It cut my appetite tremendously. Like many have said already, I found I was forcing myself to eat some days, especially in the first week. I didn't experience dry mouth, mainly because I am a big water drinker anyway. It gives me a lot more energy, it has cut my craving for sweets like nothing else! I work out for about an hour, at least 3 days a week. My workouts are a lot better than they used to be. I'm able to push myself a lot further than before. As of today, 2-15-10, I have lost 25lbs. I've begun taking a whole pill now and the only real issue I have is the lack of sleep. I find that sometimes I wake up much earlier than I'd like to and I have trouble getting back to sleep when I do. Other than that, this has helped me tremendously. It's amazing.
Overweight	AnjellyS., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	2/15/2010 11:41:13 AM	I took phentermine for a few months in 2008/2009- My first exposure to it my side effects were more intense. The first pill I took made me so dizzy and loopy I had to lie down and make myself take a nap for a bit. The dizziness went away after a few pills. The pill was super effective for me in cutting appetite. I am more of a &quot;grazer&quot; and could nibble here and there rather than eat a meal- and this cut all of that out. . .Side effects for me- the worst was dry mouth- which I agree with another post, I hate drinking water but with this I actually liked water and drank it all the time. Also, the post that mentioned not sleeping much-I was never tired but always waking up super early no matter when I went to bed- minimal sleep. Other than that, headaches sometimes- that could also be from not eating very much. I worked out about 3-4 times a week and lost about 25lbs in about 3 months. Here is a BIG CAVEAT!- if you do not adjust your exercise, diet, lifestyle, etc. you will gain ALL the weight back upon stopping the pill. Any amount you eat- after not eating anything at all will make it harder for you to lose and/or maintain the weight. Expect to work diligently when you stop the pill. I ended up gaining all the weight back and then some. So after about a year, and gaining it all back- I started back today- I rated satisfaction lower because I gained the weight back- but then that's my own fault and I shouldn't expect a cure-all So hopefully this time will be better. . .Good luck!
Other	carebear, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	2/15/2010 10:49:05 AM	I started taking Phentermine on 1/26/10.  It was prescribed by my family physician.  I was rarely hungry (had to force myself to eat) and I had tons of energy.  I felt really, really good until the evening of 2/12/10.  I want to warn everyone that if you do not need to be on this (are not very overweight or obese), please be careful!  My husband had to call 911 on 2/12 and by the time the paramedics arrived at my house, my  heart rate was 170 (extremely dangerous) and I was dehydrated and malnourished.  While on this drug, I had been drinking a lot of water but the doctors stated that Phentermine dries a body out very fast.  It's kind-of like taking Speed.  Just please do your research before you start/continue taking this medication.  It may make you lose weight fast, but it's addicting, can cause heart problems, and there are other bad effects as well.  I felt on cloud nine for almost 3 weeks before the medication caught up to me and put me in the emergency room (transported by ambulance).

I got &quot;accidentally&quot; got intoxicated with some friends at happy hour after taking my afternoon pill .  I experienced a mood swing like no other.  Extreme uncontrollable rage.  I ended up getting into a fight with a person and nearly killed him.  I do not suffer from depression/anxiety or any other mental issues.  I had not been in fight since high school.  I do not take any other medications.  Do not drink alcohol with this drug
Other	 (Patient) 	5	5	5			2/14/2010 9:45:51 AM	I'm going to sound like many of you reviewing this medication. I am 5'7 and weighed 161 at the beginning of this week. 5 days later, I weigh 157.6. No real issues except a bit of dry mouth but I drink tons of water....and I've been waking up at 4:00am every morning. Have been doing spring cleaning -- lots of energy! Plan to use the drug for 2 weeks in hopes of losing 10 pounds and then maintain.

And usually the first day I can tell if a product will work for me and this pill is doing great so far.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	2/11/2010 8:26:20 PM	I started taking this after my sister lost 50 lbs I started the 37.5 mg Jan 4th, 2010. I'm 5'4 and weighed 220. As of Jan 25th I lost 10 lbs!! After less than a week my appetite was completely gone. My sister warned me because you literally have to remind yourself to eat. No snack craving or anything. At first I had the dry mouth and insomnia but it went away. Still get slightly nauseated but it's bearable. I only weigh myself monthly so hopefully by the end of Feb it's another 10 lbs. Goal is to lose 60 lbs by my 8-1-10 wedding!!
Overweight	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	2/10/2010 11:49:07 PM	I started taking this on 02/04/10 and have lost 8 lbs so far. It's definitely curved my appetite and I sometimes have to remember to eat. I haven't really started an exercise regimen but I will soon. I'm liking the results and hopefully it continues. The only bad things are the dry mouth which other users have stated and some jitteryness but not always, might just be from stress.

Overweight	hot momma, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/9/2010 8:09:43 PM	I have more energy so I do not mind exercising. My house is extremely clean and my mood, self esteem and my life are wonderful. I love buying pretty clothes instead of fat people clothes and my husband gets to enjoy the rewards because I do not mind taking &quot;off&quot; my clothes. I even love my time with my two sons more because I do not resent the fact I have to pick up after them which used to be an endless job. Now it is done!
Overweight	momma madden , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/9/2010 5:58:28 PM	I started taking it on 11/11/09 and to this date I have lost 32 pounds. I am very pleased with my results, my goal is 10 pounds a month or more. I take 1 pill in the morning about 6am and 1/2 after 1 pm no later than 2pm and have had no trouble sleeping at night, due to all the energy I now have I go to the gym and work out after work, and when the weather is nice I walk at the park first then go to the gym. I eat much healthier, I watch my carb. intake and eat more protein and fresh fruit and veggies. Never been happier.    
Overweight	shakyred, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	2/6/2010 1:12:58 PM	My endocronologist prescribed this medication because he thought I was obese.  Weight: 203, 5'7&quot; female. Normal healthy eating patterns, pretty much sedentary. Weight gain result of thyroid condition and going through menopause.  I started taking this med on 31 Jan 2010.  Took it for four days and had to come off, severe indigestion and constipation.  Before taking these meds I had daily bowel movements and no indigestion and no problem sleeping.  Congrats to those of you who its working for.  However, in those four days I did loose 2 pounds.  Have started an exercise program.

Overweight	TexParamed, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	45-54	2/6/2010 7:25:16 AM	I took 37.5mg initially but it  was too much and I had some pretty severe diarrhea and I would wake up in the wee hours of the morning. I had dry mouth throughout the whole experience even when the dose was reduced to 30mg. My initial first bit of weight loss was due to my total fast that I was on, and I'm afraid too had to do with the copious amounts of diarrhea, lots of water loss. But I did lose about 10 pounds in the 1st week alone! So diet and limited food intake was fairly effective. I also didn't feel hungry or like eating under the 37.mg regimen, not so effective with the 30mg regimen.

My asthma is now under control and I have lost 44 pounds in 6 months.  I am very happy with the results and no side effects.  Being on this medication and keeping a food journal will hopefully guide me to a healthier life style after I discontinue the medication.

Phentermine has taken away the urge to eat... what a relief. 15 mg. If I take it mid morning it last until late night to avoid the late night munchies. Has increased heart rate a bit. So far down 10 pounds to 185. 1 pound a week seems doable:)

Overweight	doctorofstyle, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/26/2010 10:38:14 AM	This stuff is the greatest thing since Penicillin.  Whoever came up with this should get the Nobel Prize in Medicine.  I've been blessed to have relatively few side effects.  Some minor dry mouth, and some low grade constipation which has been easily managed with increased fibre and fluid intake.  The worst thing about it was there was some sexual side effects for the first 7 days.  My wife and I joked that it was a preview of what I had to look forward to when I'm 70.  That &quot;problem&quot; vanished as soon as my body acclamated to the drug.  Again, wonderful medication.  Couldn't be happier.
Overweight	Pugsyann, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/26/2010 10:13:45 AM	I am 33 and 5,5.  I started this drug 13 days ago and have went from 199.8 to 191.6.  A loss of 8.2 lbs.  Very dry mouth first day than has continued to get better.  I drink lots of water and exercise almost daily.  (Bike and have just started pilate's on DVD a couple days ago.)  I have lots of energy and WANT to exercise where before I dreaded it.  My appetite has decreased dramatically but I find that in the evening hours I am hungry.  Try to ignore it or drink a glass of 1% milk.  I try to eat around 1,200 calories a day.  Low fat and healthy food.  I would recommend this drug. 
Overweight	25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2		25-34	1/24/2010 9:26:14 PM	Took Phentermine for for 11 days, Blood pressure went sky-high, usually is in the very low range of 112/70s, was reading 160/110. It has taken over a month for blood pressure to return to normal with the help of medication. I had taken Tenuate for 3 months prior to this with no problems at all and a 30 pounds weight loss.  Would recommend something besides Phentermine.

Overweight	Gorgeous!!!, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/20/2010 4:52:47 PM	This pill has worked well for me.  I started taking 37.5m in Sept '09 at 48yrs old and 250lbs and have lost as of today 31 lbs.  The weight loss slows down the longer that you are on the pill. I have had to increase my workouts to 4 days per wk mostly cardio.  I feel great. I did have some headaches and the dry mouth.  Try drinking more water and that has helped with both the headaches and dry mouth.  My doctor wants me down to 160lbs which will take me probably 6-7 mos.  I am fine with that because I am also learning new eating habits so that when I stop taking this pill I can sustain the weight loss. I have dropped two sizes and I have lots of energy.  I also have hired a personal trainer to help me with having effective workouts.  I intend to have the trainer for a couple of months.  I have been overweight most of my life and this pill has been truly helpful.  It will take me a while to get to my goal weight of 160-170lbs, but I am committed and I try to remember that I did not gain this weight over night, so I will not lose it over night!! Stay encouraged my friends, it is a journey and not a sprint!! As we all get healthier, it will be worth it.  Hope that this is helpful to some of you.

Overweight	stephanie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/19/2010 7:48:28 PM	I was presribed this Sept.08. My doctor told me I literaly had no metabolism. With this drug I lost 16 lbs. in 3 months then I had a death in the family and gained it all back. I quit taking it for awhile and just got back on it.  I lost 11 lbs. the first month, but then the holidays hit and yet again I gained it back.  I've been commited to exercising and diet for the past 2 weeks and have lost 6 lbs. So it definately works, but you do still have to diet and exercise, and it is very easy to gain the weight back if you don't ween yourself off of it. And I've discovered that as long as I exercise or do something active within an hour after I take it I don't get a headache, but if I take it and just sit around I get a headache and get dizzy.

But I will say, I have had a constant, but tolerable headache ever since starting this medication.  But it's nothing that Tylenol or Ibuprofen can't knock out.

I am now at 268 pounds.I have lost 15 pounds in 13 days. I am combining the phentermine with healthier eating and regular exercise. Eating more healthily has been a breeze since my appetite is so small now.Exercise is easier because of all the energy that I have. This has really given me the jump start that I needed. I feel great with the only minor side effect being dry mouth. I can certainly deal with that minor inconvenience for the amount of weight that I have been losing.
Overweight	ready4thechange, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/17/2010 9:21:24 PM	Female, 27 yrs old, starting weight: 275, current weight: 264. Okay with out giving you my life's story..I have been on this for 19 days and I have already lost 11 pounds. If you have struggled with weightloss which I am sure you have if you are looking at this, please give this a try. I know people complain about the side effects, but dry mouth is worth it if you get the opportunity to like what you see in a picture. I have an extremely busy schedule, and I have managed to do this successfully and re-think the way I look at food. I no longer crave junk food. This pill has given me enough control to really think about what I am about to eat which is not something I have ever been able to do. Just give it a try!!

Overweight	swanfish, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	1/12/2010 1:18:44 PM	I have been taking this medication for about two months now and have lost over 20 pounds, which is about half of my initial goal. I struggled with binge eating and in the past have had success with losing a lot of weight, but always struggled to maintain. I find that it is important to address the behavior of eating and not depend on the medication to do the work. The medication, like many others is simply a TOOL to help you lose weight. You are the one that has to do the work. The medication does awesome with giving more energy and reducing any desire or cravings for junk. It was frustrating and overwhelming when I first started taking the medication due to not having any appetite; I had to plan my meals and snacks and make myself eat appropriate portions. The lightheadedness and feeling like you are going faint is in huge part to not eating enough. I work with a dietician and see my doctor every three weeks like clockwork to make sure that all is well. I journal everything that I eat, and like I said before, I plan out my meals based on what my body NEEDS for fuel and not what I want. I also set monthly fitness goals and currently go to the gym and attend yoga class three times per week. I don't agree with people taking the medication if they're just a little overweight, but definiately find it helpful and useful for people who are in the obese/morbidly obese category. 
Overweight	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	1/10/2010 11:05:35 AM	Under Dr. monthly follow ups and supervision, I have lost 65lbs. since Feb 09. I'm a 53yr old male that was weighing 265lbs in Feb 09, and as of Dec 09 I weigh 198lbs. I watch what I eat ( healthier foods, and REDUCED intake). There was a little adjustment period at the beginning, as the pill made me a little anxious, and jittery, but it subsided withing a few weeks.  At present I feel no side effects.  My goal is to get down to 180 lbs. I'm getting there!
Overweight	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	1/9/2010 7:49:43 AM	I've been using this med (generic) since Nov. 23rd, and have lost 20 lbs as of today. I don't crave beer, alcohol, or junk foods, and have dramatically improved my eating and food buying habits. If anything, I often have trouble forcing myself to eat 1800 cal/day. (I am also tracking everything on livestrong.com - check it out, its free and very helpful).I have found that dieting without exercise is not very effective for me, so I am re-committing to exercise and will quit making lame excuses for not doing it. Dosage: 1 tab early AM, 1/2 tab 8 hours later. Side effects: Dry mouth, BP controlled well with medication, I was jumpy and jittery at first, but not so much now, and I used to wake up at 3-4AM and not be able to go back to sleep. After consulting the doctor, I reduced my afternoon dose to 1/2 tablet, and am now sleeping through the night.  Since I started using this, it is a little more difficult for me to achieve/maintain an erection, don't know if this is related to the drug or something else (age or physical condition). Hoping it improves after I stop using the drug. I have a long way to go (another 50 pounds) but am feeling confident, energized, and focused on my goal. I will succeed. Having tried lots of different diet groups and plans, I find that this is much easier for me to manage.  I should also add that my spouse is very supportive and has contributed to my effort and success with her delicious, healthy meals. (She was a diet counselor at one time).  I also am getting lots of support from family, friends, and clients.

When you started taken the pills, did you feel a warming sensation on your face? Again this is my first day taking it, and this is what I feel.  I am just wondering if this goes away over time.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/6/2010 4:28:38 PM	I was 27 years old and 152 at 5foot2. Mother of 3 and wife. I was short and chunky my bust size had increased to 36DDDand about a size 12. I had what appeared to be acid reflux or ulcer. I had back pain stomach pain chest pain and depsson. I have tried a lot of other pills diets etc. I dont have the time or money to just devote 100% to a diet that would work for me. So, I went to my doctor. I been on the pills one a day for almost 6 months. I lost 25 pounds and its a lot for a short person:) I feel and look amazing. I havent had and of my prior medical problems. I havent even been depressed or felt the need to got back on prilosec. I always recommend this to friends.Prilosec turned me into a zombie. This has cured it along with everything else. (It is kind of hard in the first fiew weeks you start because of the side affects but they all went away. Im able to function normally. Wont just give you the runs and dehydrate you. This with exercise and water helps. Takes away the cravings. So you have a chance to learn healthy eating without feeling deprived.
Overweight	lfetsko@gmail.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	1/6/2010 3:50:26 PM	My doctor started me on 1/2 a pill a day, 3 weeks later a 1/2 is all I need. There is some noticeable effects, not the shakes but heart palpitations which are a little annoying. I have little to know desire to eat although I know I need to eat therefore I am making healthier choices like fruit, green tea, water and such. I monitor my blood pressure several times a day too.

Overweight	staceyxxrenee, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/4/2010 2:36:53 AM	I've went from 261 (June 09) to 222 (today Jan '10) and I love this medication. I have many of the side effects but nothing major. It helps with the appetite. I took Bontril for the first few months of my diet, and Phentermine worked 150% better/faster than Bontril. I plan to finish my goal of 100 pounds by July. I would recommend this pill to someone wanting to lose weight. But also remember, it's you losing the weight, let the pill help you, don't let it do it for you!

I am able to function and deal with every day life.  
Overweight	Mama2two, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/2/2010 12:11:44 PM	200 lbs 5'8&quot; female 35 yrs oldI love this drug. To make sure it works, you have to take it on an empty stomache. If you have dry mouth, you aren't getting enough fluids. If you have diareha, then you're eating too much sugar. If your heart is racing or feel jittery, cut your caffeine intake. This is my experience. My problem is my brain says eat and my body says NOT. Sometimes it is the other way. My body and brain are confused and want to stay fat. That's why we have a hard time losing weight. The pills help, but it's you that puts food in your mouth.

I use the dry mouth side effect as motivation to drink well above the recommended 64 oz of water per day - I usually double that.  I also learned to watch my calories using The Daily Plate @ livestrong.com There are also motivational weight loss and fitness groups &amp; members encourage each other in our journeys to health. I would suggest anyone check out livestrong.com to learn more about a healthier lifestyle.  I am no longer the lazy, boring person I was less than a year ago. I'm so glad to be starting this New Year as a new person! I started at 317 lbs and am down to 261 lbs. Size 24 jeans, needing size 26. I'm now in size 18 jeans, and plan to be into 16's by the end of January.  GOOD LUCK ON YOUR JOURNEY TO HEALTH!

I went for my first month check up and my blood pressure was great and only side effect besides being very thirsty all day is extra energy after I take my dose in the am. Today during my first check up I lost 13lbs, to date I have went from 183 to 170 and feel like i'm on my way back to &quot;pre husband size&quot; and my closet full of jeans is gonna thank me for it! I have a follow routine exam planned w/my normal dr on Feb 3rd and plan on telling her of me being on the drug since she did not prescribe it to me hopefully she won't be to upset that I went to the weight loss clinic to seek help :)

I went from 249 lbs. to 150 lbs. My energy level has gone up significantly. I am more aware/alert and clear minded. For the past 2 months I am taking 1/2 a pill and it is still working fine. The only side effect I've noticed is dry mouth but the benefits are definately more beneficial. I would recommend it to anyone that is struggling with weight and ofcourse, with the supervision of a weight specialist doctor.
Overweight	Toni, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/28/2009 9:45:06 PM	A friend who had lost 40 lbs told me that her Dr prescribed this and that it had been very helpful to her. A little personal/family history: Morbid obesity is a serious issue in my family. Both of my sisters (12-18 yrs older than me) have both had gastric bypass surgery as well as my oldest neice. My mother died morbidly obese. I have struggled with gaining and loosing weight for the past 10 years. I had all but given up as I was 5 lbs from my highest weight. I weighed in at the Dr.s office at 207 and my eating was out of control. I went to my Dr. to beg her for help. I asked her to prescibe an appetite suppressant and this is the drug she gave me.  She told me only 6 months and that I had to agree to exercise.  I told her I was completely out of control and needed help gaining control of my eating.  I was as desperate as an alcoholic!  I asked how effective I could expect it to be, she told me that the medicine was very successful, but that once it was stopped typically the weight comes back on.  I have to say the first day I took the medicine I could not believe how effective it was. Dr told me to take 1/2 a pill. I did, it didn't seem to work, but a whole pill worked so well that I ate because I had to, not because I was hungry. I ate VERY healthy and kept to the basics Protien, whole grain Carbs, Veggies/Fruit, good fat. I did as my doctor told me and I started exercising as well. Side effects that were annoying, but servivable EXTREME dry mouth and hard time falling asleep at night (taking it early made it better, but didn't solve the problem). I made one REALLY important decision: I decided that I would only take it until I got control of my eating and then I would only use it when I really felt I needed it.  This was the BEST decision I made. I took it for about 1 month then only for PMS going to a party etc I have now stopped even taking it for that. The last pill was Thanksgiving. The best part: I survived Christmas on my own and still lost. I now am 155 lb
Overweight	Purple Leopard, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/27/2009 12:41:53 PM	I'm obese not overweight. In less than 1 week of taking this med I can say that I don't feel any negative side effects at all. If anything, I have to remember to eat! I've warmed up food or served myself, take a few bites and then go off to do something else.  Up to 1 hour later I remember that I left my food somewhere! I hope this continues. I tend to eat out of boredom or stress. I'm a teacher (stress) but enjoying the 2 week break. Maybe because of that I'm relaxed, etc. I naturally drink a lot of water because of my allergies and love to take naps. However, my 3-4 hour &quot;naps&quot; have turned into 1 to 1.5 hr naps!! Reading about 100 posted comments has been like having a support system at my fingertips.  I've been curios about the lapband but have a friend who did it and has only lost 16 lbs. in 16 mos. Hello?! She says its because she can't eat as much but does eat as much as she can of something BAD and fattening. Just weighed in at 237 lbs. I'd be ecstatic to weigh 155 again and be size 14 with no flab hanging out. I'm hoping to get a huge jumpstart to my weight loss by taking Phentermine every morning. 
Overweight	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/23/2009 5:53:08 PM	I lost 17 lbs in first month.  Could never stay on diet, would excerise 2 hrs a day and would either stay the same and eventually fail and put on more weight.Phen has killed my carvings.  My idea of a diet was to drink diet soda all day skip meals, then blow it with a huge dinner and binge on sweets after dinner.  Would also wake up in the middle of the night and binge on sweets. I have also started taking St John Wort which has improved my mental attitude and I feel very encouraged with my diet.  The only draw back is that I have experienced some Constipation.  My Doctor told me that I must drink more water.  My goal is to lose antoher 25 lbs, hoping can do it in another 2 months.  Phen is great,killed my cravings and allowed me to stay on diet, instead of all the yo-yoing I had been doing
Overweight	Not Sure, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	35-44	12/23/2009 3:21:34 PM	My experience has been great but I have been experiencing red, swollen and tingling legs and feet.  Sometimes they feel extremely hot and then extremely cold.  It's weird but I don't take anything else and it all started when I started taking it. I was just wondering if there is anyone else out there experiencing the same thing.  It is not constant, it just comes and goes but it is very annoying and at times painful. I've been on and off of this pill for 3 years, it does take the weight off but when you stop taking it, the weight comes right back and I truly eat very little but I'm 43 and I just think it's a hormone thing that I gain it so easily.  I would hate to stop taking it but if it is doing something bad to me I need to.  Anyone's input would be greatly appreciated.

I am 37 years old, 5'4&quot; and weighed 180lbs- one week ago when I started Phentermine. Today I weigh 175lbs. So I have lost 5 lbs in one week. I'm on 15ml I noticed that if I don't get active after taking my pill, my heart starts beating faster. But once I get up off the couch and take a 20min. walk, my body is fine again.Also, I drink a glass of whole milk before I excersize so my body thinks I ate something. It works for me. I'll check back in a week

I begun taking Phentermine this morning, knowing the side effects and warnings. Despite this I was not prepared. After only an hour I felt an extreme rush, and a fast heartbeat. I know this was to be expected, but it has given me an escallating energy boost. So far I have been channeling this into walking, so it's effects won't hit so hard. I unfortunately smoke too, and with the nervousness, I'm craving them more than ever. I need to speak with my Dr. today about help with this. Or else my heart is going to give out on me or something, haha. I will repost after my first weigh-in in a month. Phew!!
Overweight	Monica, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/10/2009 6:25:57 PM	I started as 185 5'4'' and lost 23lbs in 3 months. Its not a magic pill- you need to think what you eat and exercise. I read that we tend to underestimate our calorie intake and overestimate our exercise. Ive never been a couch potato, I exercised but Ive been eating too much. I thought if I exercise I could eat what I wanted  not true, unless I would exercise 7 days a week 2 hours a day. We are what we eat This medication helped me control my cravings!!!!!!  I was one of those people who would keep saying: no matter what I do I cant loose any weight. The truth is I was eating more calories than my body needed. Phentermine pills help me control my appetite. But I still had to educate myself more and more about smart eating and of course exercise. I have 22 more pounds to go!

I started taking this medication because my Doctor thought this would help in serveral ways, the most important was my blood pressure was way to low and I had no energy, tired , drained all the time. I lost 51 lbs in 4 1/2mos and my blood pressure is now around the normal range (but that is with the meds), and I can stay alert and accomplish my daily task now for the fist time in a long time I can stay awake throughout the day and through a whole movie. But BEST of all I can fit into clothes 4 sizes smaller than I have in years, so of course its all new stuff for me even some shoes were too lose

It caused blood pressure issues, and so it scared me a bit. I am dissappointed, since it worked really well while I was on it.  Lost 27 lbs and of course it was pretty much predictable that I would gain the weight back after stopping the use of the medication for a while.
Overweight	lil mama, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	12/1/2009 9:36:57 AM	I love Phentermine, back in 2007 I started taking it in January weighing 232 lbs.-by June of that year I weighed 169.  It was a real help to me.  I did walk and do exercise videos too though.  I started back on this med about 3 weeks ago because I had a baby in September and gained all my weight back, since starting back I have all ready lost 7 lbs.--starting 216 to today 209, so I am a real believer in this med, yes I've had constipation, dry mouth, and some irritability, but to me that is a very small price to pay for the long term outcome...I feel so much better when I weigh 170 than 230!!  It's not for everyone though, I work in a MD's office as a medical assistant and I have seen some negative side effects--at my office we actually have all pt.'s who want this med have an EKG first as a screening to rule out heart irregularity because Phentermine does increase your heart rate.  For most, this drug is completely safe and effective, but as with everything else, it's definitely not for everyone.
Overweight	bagjam, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/29/2009 8:50:33 PM	I had a baby at 38 years and it seemed impossible to lose the weight.  I would lose 10 gain 5, etc.  I have been using phentermine for 6 weeks.  In the 6 weeks since I started I have lost 18 pounds.  I have maintained a diet of approx 1,000 to 1,200 calories daily and also an exercise regimen of 9 - 12 miles weekly as well. Side effects are slight headaches at times, insomnia or difficulty staying asleep, but a small price to pay for the results I am seeing.

Overweight	Loving the new me!!!, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/29/2009 1:22:15 AM	I started taking phentermine in 09/20/09 and I weighed 250 lbs; after 2mos I have lost 24 lbs! I exercise 2-3 days per week. I plan to increase my exercise after reading some of the comments.  The only side affect that I have is dry mouth.  I was hesitant about taking a diet pill, however, my dr is monitoring my blood pressure closely and it has been fine.  I am also diabetic and just recently took my AIC and I am waiting for results, but my glucose numbers have been much better.  This drug has been a blessing to me. I am making smarter choices in food selection and the portion sizes have been reduced greatly.  With the weight loss, I feel better and I know that I am healthier.  I have a long way to go but I thank those you for your encouragement and candor.  I am going to increase my exercise to five days a week.  This has been a great drug for me.  It has given me the stamina to make better food choices and I know that this is indeed a life style change.  I have skipped the meds a couple of times to see if my appetite would reappear and if I would gain the weight back and I did not. Stay encouraged, this drug has worked for me and I intend to stay on it until I reach my goal, which is around 170lbs.  Be encouraged and hang in there if it is not working as well as you would like.

I completely stopped taking the medicine about a month ago because of an increase in my blood pressure. This medicine does work and I really liked it. I lost around 38 pounds. Since I have been off, I have gained about 10 pds. It is a good product if you can control your eating once you stop taking the medicine.

Overweight	lgbchoc, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	11/25/2009 2:16:42 AM	I have been on this medication since July of 2009.  I have lost 20 pounds.  The only side effects I have are dry mouth and insomnia.  I was on this drug over a year ago and got off it, I saw a total difference for about the 8-9 months I was off of it.  I was tired all the time, no energy, and ate all the time!  I would recommend this medication for anyone who needs assistance with a jump start to losing the weight.  Just beware that if you don't keep it up after you quit taking it, you will gain it back.  Good Luck to all!

I take 37.5 mg first thing in the morning. I walk 20-30 mins daily or every other day. It gives me energy and controls my appetite. It works great for me. Except I hurt my shoulder and doctor put me on Medrol tabs (corticosteroid) for pain and inflammation and gained 5 lbs back. Ugh! Cannot wait to get off of the steroid med. Always check with your doctor if you are on other meds. Phentermine may not be as effective or may cause drug interaction. Wish you all the Best!

Overweight	Purezone09, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/20/2009 2:30:57 AM	Started taking this pill 6/15/09 and started with one 37.5 pill a day. I took it in the morning at 6am at 7am I would eat lite breakfast of 400 calories and do a cardio tape for 45 mins. I would eat a lowfat 1200 calorie diet cut out pop, fast food, and I didn't eat fried anything. for snack I eat cheese stick, fruit, or 20 dry almonds. lost 40 pounds first 3 months. My appetite was fine but my energy was low so my doctor let me go up a half that I would take at 2pm. I have lost 65 pounds now and I workout only 4 days a week now. my only side effects were dry mouth(lots a lots of water) first 2 months then I started to sweat alot no matter what I would do(hated this it was embarrassing). And when I would miss a day I noticed that I would get the worst headache and when I would take the pill it would go away in about 1/2hr.So don't give up just tweek your diet and your times and it will work for you. You cant eat what you want and just sit on your butt it wont work then. Good Luck(pls consult you Dr.before increasing your pill your BP will have to be closely watched)

Overweight	LadyJ, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	11/19/2009 12:07:45 AM	I have been taking phentermine for 3 weeks now. For the first few days I was slight nauseous but then it stopped by the fourth day of being on the medication. I have had really good results while on this med. Unlike some of the other I did not experience insomnia, because I take it in the morning right when I wake up. I have combined this pill along with exercise 4 to 5 days a week and a 1200 t 1500 calorie diet each day. I have lost a total of 13 pounds in 3 weeks. Just remember not everyone will have the same side affects or have the same results when taking this medication. Good Luck to All!

Obviously you will need to continue your program of healthy eating/exercise in order to keep lost weight off or regain down to a minimum.I have noticed when stopped (slowly decrease amount due to lethargic condition) that you will gain 5-7 pounds back.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/13/2009 11:14:22 AM	I started taking this a few months ago and I have gone from 216 to 164 so far. It took cravings away and helped to shrink my appetite. The only side effect on me is that it makes me a little more OCD than normal, but considering how well it works, I look past that. I have 40 more pounds to reach my goal! I have included a six day workout of three days 20 minutes and three days 30 minutes. Mainly cardio, but three days a week I add a few weights in as well. It has been a blessing!!!
Overweight	G-ma, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	11/12/2009 12:31:14 PM	I've been taking this med for 1 week today and lost 5 lbs. Very excited about this because I have tried everything and nothing works! However, I'm also taking meds for high blood pressure, high cholestrol, estrogen &amp; progestrine, caltrate &amp; daily vitamin, whew! My blood pressure was a little elevated today. Has anyone experienced this? I'm leary about diet pills, I want &amp; have to lose weight but I don't want to fall dead of a heart-attack either. And after treatment,does your appetite come back, do you gain twice as much weight as when originally started?

I exercise for 30mins 5days a wk. I feel great!  I have lost 10lbs in 7days!!!!!  Good luck to everyone!

During my first pregnancy almost 4 years ago I gained a total of 88 pounds. It has been almost impossible to lose any of it! Today is week #1 and I have lost 10 pounds, with my current weight at 200. I did experience side affects bad the first 4 days.. Insomnia, constantly felt like I was going to vomit, and very bad dry mouth. The side affects are gone now! I only work out 2 days a week right now, but I watch what I eat and my calorie intake. My goal is to lose 50-60 more pounds! Lots of luck!

Overweight	KLacroix, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/8/2009 1:13:27 PM	I started taking this medication in July and stopped taking it in September. I had lost a total of 36 pounds by then. Even though I am not taking the medication...I am still losing weight. I am now down a total of 51 pounds. I am 5'9&quot; and now wear a size 12. Everyone tells me they can't believe how skinny I am, but my BMI says I am still overweight. I will take this pill again in December. I still need to lose another 18 lbs to be considered &quot;normal&quot; weight and that will make me a size 7/8. I found that taking 1/2 a pill a day was more than enough to help me with my appetite and I have been working out 3 times a week. I strongly reccomend this drug!
Overweight	fatboy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	11/8/2009 1:52:36 AM	I was given a 30 dose prescription (1/day for 30 days). First 5 or 6 days took a bit to get used to my heart feeling like it was going to jump out of my chest, but after that, i really didn't even notice it... it works as advertised. I combined my adipex with a 1000 calorie diet (i averaged around 1100 or 1200 cals a day) with less than 30 grams of fat per day. I also ran/jogged 3 days a week &amp; got on a pushup/situp plan 3 days a week. I lost 20 lbs over the 29 days that i took Adipex and it was VERY easy to only eat 1000cals/day once u get used to actually counting the calories and the fat. Now, the one thing i had a problem with was day 29. I had to work through lunch with NOTHING to eat. By the time i finally found a nutrigrain bar at around 2, i was very light headed. Got home &amp; started to prepare dinner, and experienced fairly substantial chest pains just left of center of my chest (assuming heart) and a TERRIBLE headache that lasted for nearly 2 days. I drank lots of gatorade thinking it might be dehydration related, ate a GOOD meal that night and the next day as well, and it eventually all subsided, but i decided against taking my 30th dose just as a precaution.  Overall, VERY excited about the results of Adipex, AND the motivation that came with seeing the almost DAILY losses on the scale.

I have been way more active, and no longer eat over my limit. I exercise with dumbbells, and wii fit. No bad side effects at all.

I take the pills five days and then skip Thursday and Friday. I have not started my exercise program as I had intended and know my results would have been much greater if I had.  Since I started around 160, I still think my results are great!  I am never hungry, have to force myself to eat, and have more energy.  Because of my schedule, I am up a lot at night, sometimes all night, and I think the medicine helps me not to be so exhausted the next day when I can't catch a nap.  The only downside I have experienced is that after I eat, I often feel slightly nauseous for a few minutes, but it is only slightly. I still have 17 pounds to lose and hope I can do that within the next five weeks. Good luck to everyone!

I've gained 7 pounds back and am trying to watch what I eat. Hopefully I can go back on it. It worked great. It kept me up a lot though and I only got about 4-5 hours a sleep a night. I'm still battling the insomnia but its getting better.

I would definitely prefer to workout and change eating habits than to have those side effects. I also tried taking half of a pill daily which did lessen the side effects.
Overweight	Ginny, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	10/14/2009 9:16:32 AM	I have been on this for 3 weeks and have only lost 8lbs.  When I gained 37lbs in only a few months tests showed an underactive thyroid.  My Dr. has me on 800-900 calorie food plan so I don't understand why I have not lost more. He told my not to exercise but I can walk. My weight when I stated was 167 lbs. and I want to get back down to 130.  At this rate it will take a long time.  I am experiencing severe headaches and some dizziness.  Don't know if it is from this medication or not.

It does not work the second time around as well as the first one.

It is not a cure, but I have found that I use it for about a month, then have weaned myself to a half pill a day, to none, you can't use it forever! I have also found that when I started eating no more than 2 &quot;white&quot; carbs a day, I also started losing.  I eat between 1000-1500 cal/day, depending on my appetite. I don't starvr myself because I love food.  The only side effect from it I have seen is constipation &amp; gas, which lowered with a half 37.5 mg pill. Also, I drink plenty of water &amp; exercise 4-5 x week!!  I losing 4-6 lbs a month, mostly on my own.  My goal weight is 150-160 lbs. I have been overweight all my life, though I did lose weight when I was 18, but got pregnant!  This time, I hope to keep it of!!

I was on 15mg and I asked the doctor to put me on 30mg a day. He made me do a liver enzyme test and they were elevated so I had to get off of it. I've never had any problems with my liver. My blood pressure has never been a problem but it kept on increasing until I finally got off of it. It does work and I like to have all the energy but I didn't like all the other complications I was having. Good luck to everyone!

I lost 25 lbs. felt so good. the b-12 shots got expensive, so I quit going. I have now gained back 10 lbs, and feel like a whale. I just wish I could lose weight, keep it off, without meds, and feel good again.

I have lost 12 pounds, I work out 30 minutes every night after dinner and I eat a 1200 calorie diet daily. I couldn't stand the jitters I had in the beginning but they have passed so overall I have almost no appetite, take tylenol pm to help me sleep and I have so much energy that I pretty much don't stop until 10 at night. I am loving it, and I would recommend this diet to anyone. Starting weight 241 now 229!

I am always thirsty (cotton mouth) not too bad though.  Overall I have lost about 12 pounds, I started at 220-ish and am now 208, my goal is to be a size 10-12 I don't know what weight that is, I just think it's a good size.  Good luck to everyone else!

The first week i felt great I had more energy, less cravings, I was a little wired and had a little trouble sleeping but nothing too bad. Now during my second week I am experiencing severe migraines and headaches that last all day. The headaches cause me to not be able to workout or even do some of my normal everyday activities. I heard that the side effects last for 2-3 weeks. Are my headaches going to go away or should i get off the pill?
Overweight	y2katielou, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/26/2009 9:42:24 AM	I have battled with losing and gaining weight over the past 4 years.  I got engaged last November at my heaviest ever...163.  I started a rigorous exercise routine for the 1st time in my life (5 days a week) and cut my calories down.  I also live more or less by the South Beach way of eating.  However, after 7 months of this, I was stuck at only 11 lbs. lost.  I started taking this drug in August and have lost 10.5 lbs. since then (with a 2-week hiatus due to wisdom teeth surgery).  I only had side effects for about 3 days.  Now I feel normal.  It's like that part of my brain that is constantly telling me to eat has just been turned off.  I eat three meals per day, but have zero cravings in between meals.  My incessant chocolate and dessert cravings are gone with this drug.  I currently weigh 142 lbs. at 5'2&quot; with only 6 weeks left until my wedding.  I am hoping to get down to a healthy 130 in the next 2 months by going back to hitting the gym pretty hard.  I am also confident in the fact that once I get to my goal weight, I know I can maintain due to the fact that I now work out regularly.  Good luck everyone!

I can stay on the medicine for one more month and then I have to go off from it for 6 months. I am hoping that I have changed my eating habits enough that I can continue to lose weight without the pill. I would like to lose at least 50 more pounds.

I hav only been taking one half of the pill everyday at lunch time. I went to weigh in yesterday and I am down 18 lbs.!! I started at 208 and am now 190. My goal is to lose 10lbs. per month until I reach 160. I have an 8 month old and after I quit nursing I gained 6lbs!! Now that I have been on the medicine for almost 2 months, I can even skip a day and not take it and I still don't have food cravings. This medicine is great in helping promote a healthy way to eat. I have been very pleased!

Overweight	losing it!, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/24/2009 12:12:21 AM	I started taking half a 37.5 mg pill everyday before lunch on 9/9/09.  Today, 14 days later, I have lost 15 pounds.  I started large at 242 and am down to 227 - i know the bigger you are, the faster the first pounds come off, so I expect to see my loss taper off.  However, I am very pleased.  I do have dry month alot, so I'm drinking lots of water, which also means lots of potty breaks.  I got the sweats the first few days, but those seem to have went away now.  I have more energy, but still sleep well at night.  My doctor has advised me not to start any exercising other than normal daily activity until the end of week 3, she said that will help prevent a plateau of the weight loss.  Also, I can bump up to a whole pill a day if the half dose starts to lose affectiveness.  I also only eat 800-1000 calories a day, I'm not hungry and I get much fuller feeling quicker.  However, I have changed my eating habits and I am eating whole grains and lots of fiber, so that might have something to do with it to.  I don't like having to cut the pills in half, it seems I can never get it right down the middle, so I am convinced some days my dosage is stronger than others.  Otherwise, I'm happy with the progress so far and I would recommend phentermine to anyone who had a large amount of weight to lose.
Overweight	clou79, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/21/2009 12:14:10 PM	I am currently in my second week of taking this medication (37.5mg pill taken in the morning).  I went to my doctor seeking prescription weight loss pills due to the extra 30 pounds I was hanging on to after have my two boys back to back (17 months and 2 months).  I started the pill on Sept 12, 2009 and in 1 week I lost 5 pounds.  I haven't been exercising and wish I had the time to do so.  I have cut soda out of my diet and usually make myself eat a little.  I am probably eating less then a 1000 calories a day.  The only side affects I have experienced (and the get better as the day progresses) is sweating and the feeling of being a little jittery.  Other then that, nothing.  It hasn't given me the energy everyone else has seem to get, but I am up at all hours of the night with my 2 month old.  I am hoping to lose the 30 pounds in 2 months.  My beginning weight was 174.6lbs and I am hoping to return to my pre-pregnancy weight of 145lbs.  Good luck to everyone.
Overweight	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		9/21/2009 9:44:30 AM	Phentermine has been a true blessing to me.  I took my first 37.5 mg pill on Wednesday, September 9, 2009.  That morning I weighed 234.4 lbs.  Now, less than 12 days later, I am down to 125.6 lbs.  I cannot believe I have lost 9 pounds in less than 12 days!I've experienced virtually no side effects.  The first day I took Phentermine, I tried to lay down and take a nap in the late afternoon.  Obviously, that didn't happen.  My thoughts were racing and although I felt relaxed, I was never able to fall asleep.  However, I had no trouble sleeping that night at bedtime, which was what was really important.Other than that, the only side effect I've experienced is mild dry mouth.  In fact, I wouldn't even go so far as to say it's dry mouth...more of just a general thirst at random times throughout the day. In terms of effectiveness, I'm very rarely hungry.  I've been eating less than 900 calories on most days, not because I'm trying to, but because when I do eat I become full after only half a meal.  When I was reading reviews for Phentermine before starting it, I would read people say &quot;I had to remind myself to eat!&quot; or &quot;I had literally no cravings!&quot; and thought to myself &quot;Yeah right...that would NEVER happen to me in a million years.&quot;  I've always been a member of the &quot;Clean Plate Club.&quot;  I always got annoyed when I had to share my food and was constantly thinking about when my next meal would be.  It's no wonder I weighed 234 pounds, right?!  However, with Phentermine my habits have totally changed.  I love to share my food now and am practically never thinking about my next meal.  Let's hope I can keep this up for the next two and a half months and keep the weight off after that!

I have only lost another 8 lbs. I guess that is pretty good, but I do notice that it is not supressing my hunger as much. I think I am going to go off it for a few weeks and then start up again. I have been working out like crazy and I still need to lose another 26 lbs. Wish me luck!

I stated Phe 8/25/09 and I have lost 12lbs I'm very excited about the results..I have started working out more the first 2wks I would just walk here and there but now I'm going harder and I try to walk 1.5 miles a day if the weather permits. It has stopped my sweet tooth alot I will eat a cookie here and there but only half, I don't have that desire for candy, cookie, and snacks anymore I rarely have the desire to eat food. But I know that I have to eat or I will get light headed.Phen helps me use portion control I eat half of my food now sometimes I don't even finish the old me would eat my plate and go back for 2nd and 3rds.The only side effects that I have noticed is the headaches that only happened a couple of times the first week, my breathing has been fine but one day I noticed I would take a deep breath here and there so I took myself off of the pill for 4days to give my body a break and then I got back on. For the dry mouth I chew Sugar free gum and water, water, water.. I take my pill in the morning so I never experienced the sleep problem. I did alot of research on Phen before taking it and I'm glad my Dr. choice this for me it's helping alot. My goal is to loose 60+ lbs by Jan and it's possible with Phen, exercise,portion control, and most of all &quot;Discipline&quot;.. If you are in desprate need to lose weight like I was give Phen a try it will help you out and you will feel better about yourself once you see those numbers drop on the scale.For those of you who have been on Phen for a while how long do you recommend for someone to stay on the pill??

During those months, I was climbing a lot of stairs because of where classes were located, but I have not lost one thing, and I feel like my appetite has come back to its original state. I am working on going off of it right now, gradually. My plan was to get to a healthy weight and then get off, but I haven't even made it there, but it's not working anymore and I probably won't get another prescription anyway, so I'm just getting off of it. If you don't have much weight to lose, it's pretty good, but if you have over 30, like I do, talk to your doctor about other options. That's what I'm going to do.

Did not start this med until I gained 20 pounds back after losing 97 pounds (without surgery); have lost about 12 pounds in less than 3 months---results were effected by foot surgery, hope they will improve now, especially with the change to 1/2 tablet twice daily.

I'm emotional eater and have tried a lot of things. I have been on this medicine for a little over 2 weeks. I have lost almost 8 lbs. I took a full pill the first day and it about killed me I felt. I was so dizzy and weak. I took half a pill for next week. Then switched to full pill. It makes you not want to eat at all. I have very bad dry mouth, had trouble sleeping. I feel very weak and dizzy a lot. This past weekend I was in my bed or on the couch for almost the whole weekend but a few hours. Lately I've been having a little breathing trouble. Like its hard to take a deep breath. I went to my doctor to get the medicine and he told me to take a full pill. I'm cutting back to a half of pill. If I dont start feeling better I will have to get off of it. But its hard because I'm loosing weight :(

Overweight	happy chica, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/12/2009 11:06:50 PM	Tons of energy. Lost 20 lbs in less than 8 weeks. Was not hungry - could leave half my food in my plate (NEVER able to do that before). I was 5'4&quot; &amp; 150 lbs. Now I weigh 130 lbs. I feel AWESOME. Had to buy new clothes. Finally feel I am the size I am supposed to be. I've always been against using any medical/chemical assistance in losing weight, but I could not shake the extra 10 lbs after my 2nd child. Lost the 10 then lost 10 more. Now my BMI is 22 - which is optimum for being the healthiest I can be. I had energy to do everything I wanted - even with 2 young kids (2 &amp; 5 yrs). The only down side for me: occasionally I had a difficult time settling down at night.Sounds too good to be true - I wonder what the negative is...

I have gained about 30 pounds over the past year and was told by my sister-in-law, the pharmacist, that a lot of people are using this to have quick results.  She suggested I take it for five days and then skip two to see the best results.  My plan is to start on the treadmill again this evening.  I hope this medication will enable me to lose some weight quick which will motivate me, and my workouts will help me keep the weight off.  I took my first pill about 3 hours ago and feel some giddiness, but I'll have to monitor how moderate or severe that gets.  Good luck to all.  
Overweight	deh,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		9/10/2009 12:08:59 AM	Started July 24th.  I'm on Weight Watchers as well and Phentermine per doctor's orders.  In 7 weeks I've lost 22 lbs.  36 lbs total since starting Weight Watchers on June 10th.  My doctor has me on the Phentermine for another 6 weeks then she will be taking me off it and I will continue on Weight Watchers.  No real side effects except dry mouth which isn't all that bad.  I do have an occasional difficult night's sleep but nothing serious.  I've never experienced the jittery feeling, just an overall slightly elevated level of energy.  I do monitor my blood pressure regularly.  Overall Ive been very happy and will continue on Phentermine per my doctor's orders.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/8/2009 6:36:41 PM	I was originally prescribed this medication for weight loss but didn't discover until I came off of it that I didn't have a migraine the entire time I was on it.  I have had migraines since I was 11 and nothing has worked like this medicine.  I have taken every migraine medicine and migraine preventative medicine on the market and none of them work.  This is the only thing that has ever worked for more than a few days for me.

I quit smoking 09/08 and put on even more weight. (20 lbs) I have tried everything. My Dr prscribed this medication and I have lost 13.5 lbs in a month. I have inc weight watchers with it and it is coiming off a bit slower. It is a TOTAL life style change. I have had no side effects from this medication at all. I drink 90+ oz of water a day and after I hit the 20 lb mark I will start Taebo and  hopefully it will speed the process up a bit.Good Luck and many blessings to all who are fighting the battle.
Overweight	losingnow, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	9/6/2009 2:39:50 AM	I had taken this drug before but it did not help me.  My Dr. increased the mg of the prescription this time and it has worked for me for 2 wks.  I am starting to get that hunger feeling again however I am learning new ways to fight that with my dr.'s help.  The worst side affect I have felt is the dry mouth.  Some of the other side affects are present but are worth it for how well this medication works.  In 3 weeks I am down 8 lbs and feel great.
Overweight	TheMrs, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/5/2009 3:59:57 PM	I've been taking half a pill a day for 10 days and I have lost 10 pounds. The first 3 days I was tired by 8pm. I would force myself to stay up until 10pm but I would still wake up around 4:30am. Other than that I haven't had any side affects. Maybe a little dry mouth but not much. I have a long way to go before I reach my goals but I don't plan to take it longer than a year.

It worked well at first... after 1 year around the 6-8 month, it had no affect on me, not curbing and I need 38 mg. to lose more and still it was very slow.  I mainly use now for energy... I do have the dry mouth, nervousness at times, sleep issues at times as well.  I'm been off and off for the last 2 months.  Trying again to see if I can lose more weight.

I now have been on it for a month and a half and with eating just a slim fast at breakfast and lunch and a not to big dinner I have lost 23lbs. I have not changed what I like to eat. &quot;love pastas&quot; and just kept with the same routine at work and home also. just cut out all the non diet pop and candies. YOU HAVE TO CUT THE CALORIES WITH OUR WITH OUT MEDS OR YOU NEVER LOOSE. 
Overweight	desiree00711, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/4/2009 2:22:45 PM	My endocrynologist prescribed this medication along with synthroid as I had gained a lot of weight due to a hormonal imbalance caused by Acromegaly. Together with the synthroid it is the first time my weight has started to drop on a regular basis without an special dieting. I did not over eat to gain this weight, and I am still on the same diet and losing regularly. I do of course (as I did before the weight gain and hormonal imbalance occurred) follow a very healthy diet plan. But since I didn't over eat to get this overweight, changing my diet didn't make a difference in the weight loss. The addition of phentermine with the synthroid has definitely made a big difference.
Overweight	rhonda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	9/4/2009 12:50:13 PM	I have been on this drug for about 2 week and lost 6 pounds. I have bad dry mouth, but chewing gum helps and drink lots of water. I have some trouble sleeping but not to bad. Some feeling of a heavy chest (not really a pain but a tighter feeling). Most symptoms have decreased some overtime. This is going to sound funny but my tounge is sore. I still feel hungry but stomach feels full of air most of time. So far I love the results.

I had to cut the pill in half and take 1/2 6:30 AM and 1/2 b4 lunch,12 PM.I feel great however and will continue this medication. For me it sometimes take 2 mo for my body to react to medication. :)

Overweight	jlowery, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/3/2009 4:35:40 PM	At 35, I weighed 236 lbs. I cried at night, miserable with myself. I take thryoid medication and always thought that diet pills were out of the ?, however, with my Dr.s help, and supervision, I am now down to 155!!!  I lost 22lbs the FIRST month.  I had taken this drug several years ago, and had kept the weight of for about 4 yrs. But over time, I eventually weighed the most I have ever weighed in my life.  I have been on this for about 13 months.  However, for the last 8 months, I have only been taking a pill every other day or so, and usually not on the weekends.  I went from a size 18/20 to a size 8.  I never imagined I would feel this great.  People I haven't seen in a while, don't even recognize me.  I have recommended this to several friends, and they have also had success with it.

Overweight	Sandy, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/1/2009 10:13:12 PM	I have been on this medication a few times and it works wonders. I lost a total of 65 pounds the first time I took it (was on it for about a year). But you will gain weight once you are off it if you don't watch what you eat.  The second time I lost 10 pounds.  I have been of it for about 4 months and have gained a few back,(due to working around food all day).  I had no problems whatsoever taking this pill and will most likely be taking it again.

I started at 185 and now am 179. I had high energy the first two days but it has died down with the last couple days. It gives me mild dry mouth, but that is really the only side effect. I was getting headaches almost everyday and have not had one since I started this, don't know if it has anything to do with it or not.Thanks for reading and Good Luck!

My doctor was shocked but very pleased. My blood pressure is good, only side effect is dry mouth. I have been working out on the Wii Fit and would suggest this to anyone who hates to work out. It makes exercise fun and it does give you a good workout.
Overweight	tinkun, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/28/2009 10:10:10 AM	On April 30 I weighed 301 pounds. Today I'm 235 and still losing. I'm using one 30 mg. spansule a day and eating about 1000 cal. This is one of the best diet drugs ever made. For everybody thinking about gastric bypass surgery; do yourself a favor and find a doctor to administer this therapy before subjecting yourself to that body altering process. Who knows, it may work. Also, don't take this pill after 3:00 P.M. unless you work nights.

I always had trouble losing weight and with this medication not only did I lose 18 lbs. my first month I also have the energy my body needs. Being a sinle mother of 4 I need all the energy I can get. Also I sugest everyone to take multi vitamins always specially while dieting.

For the first week or two I had the normal symptoms of dry mouth, dizziness, but it was nothing I couldn't handle. I am coming up on completing my 3rd month on the medication and I am very pleased with how it has worked. This is life style change for me while on the medication and after the medication. That means Eating right and staying fit to maintain my weight forever. I only have 20 pounds left to meet my goal weight! Best of luck to everyone that is taking this medication or planning on taking it!

WHAT THE HELL ARE SOME OF YOU THINKING???  chest pains and vision changes are not &quot;worth the weight loss&quot;, they are indicative of impending cardiac arrest!  Oh and one side of your body suddenly getting weaker is A SIGN OF A STROKE and you should go to the hospital.  phentermine, as i have recently found out, was recalled by the FDA for causing heart valve damage, cardiac arrhythmia, seizures, and death.  but i think it was called phen phen back in the day.I know that there is a tiny percentage of you who have legitimate reasons to resort to taking this dangerous drug.  This is not the majority!  As far as my personal experience with phentermine (legal meth), I took 37.5 for 5 days and that's when the chest pain started.  I don't know how much weight I lost, but at the beginning of the week i was at 135,(5'7).  Yeah i know, stupid right?  I am 27 years old and my BP is through the roof and now I have heart damage.  My point being, this is happening to SO MANY people!!Taking this drug is the equivalent of being depressed and opting for a lobotomy.  IS IT WORTH IT???

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	8/21/2009 3:41:26 PM	I started adipex July 23, 2009 - and have wonderfully enjoyed it! The first couple of days I experience the &quot;jitters&quot; but after that, nothing but dry mouth. So be sure to drink lots of water and you can chew sugar free gum to help with that side effect.  Also, the first couple of weeks, I did experience headaches quit a bit. But tylenol or advil did help with those. Those side effects have really been all that I have delt with. I have lost 21 lbs as of today (Aug. 21, 2009) and have completely changed my eating habits and incorporated an exercise program. I started walking and have slowly started to &quot;power walk&quot; 3 or 4 times a week. Also helps if you keep a journal of everything you eat and drink during the day: just to see how many calories you are taking in. Remember: you must burn more calories than you consume to effectively lose weight.
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/20/2009 10:45:24 PM	I had always had problems with losing weight until my Doc. gave me this prescription and within 1/2 hour I didn't think about food I was not hungry I would even go for 6-7 hours without eating which is not good since your body goes into starvation mode but over all I would recommend this product start out with 1/2 pill and see how you do then go to whole pill if you have overdose you will get heart paltatons as if you had too much caffeine which I don't recommend you drinking either. Anyhow it does work I was 210 lbs and within 8-9 months I lost 68 lbs and have kept it off I don't take phentrimine on regular basis due to it helping you make right decisions when eating.  It's a good no great appetite suppressant.

Overweight	It's working for me, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/20/2009 11:15:41 AM	I am 34 years old and I started this pill the second week of July at the weight of 236. Although people have always looked at me and said that there was no way that I weighed what I weighed...my doctor felt the need to tell me I was obese. I wore a pants size of 14 and am 5'9&quot;. I have been working out and swimming a lot (I was a swimmer in college)It is now august 20th and I weigh 209...That is a weight loss of 27lbs. I am not sure if that is good or not, but it is a start. She wants me to lose a total of 50lbs which is funny since that will make me thinner than I was at 17 when I was swimming as a Freshman in college. I think this pill has helped with not wanting to eat as much and I tend to have to force myself to eat which helps me make good food choices. The only side effects I had were nervousness and dry mouth. The nervousness has gone away completely and the dry mouth is pretty slight. I must say, though, you need to be active too because you can't expect the pill to do all the work. I will check back in a month and let all of you know how I am doing:)

Experienced dry mouth and sweated more than usual, maybe from all the water I was drinking for the dry mouth combined with the heat. Still got hungry, but ate smaller portions. Having chest pains, not sure if it's anxiety or the medicine so doctor will probably take me off of it for a month to thoroughly check me out. Overall, this medicine can change your life!

Then I would take a whole pill one day and then a half the next day for a week.  After I did that I didn't feel so woozy.  I haven't been really exercising.  I do have the dry mouth but that tells me to drink more water.  I have gone down in 2 clothes sizes.  I have lost a total of 25 pounds and have 15 more to go.  My eating habits have changed.  I pretty much eat what I want but I cut down on the portion size and eat more slowly.  Positive attitude.  I feel good about myself.
Overweight	Mrs.Espinoza, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	19-24	8/18/2009 4:49:28 PM	I posted a review back on July 22, I believe that's when I started taking the pills, for a good week in the beginning I had to stop because I got extremely nauseated and light headed as well, so I let myself recover and started back on them after a few days, and started off by taking halves then moved up to taking the whole one, in total as of today I've lost 10lbs. would have been more if I hadn't been down for that one week and if I would be working out regularly. I have little to no appetite now, although I don't feel the energy as intense as it was in the beginning it is proving to still be quite effective. The dry-mouth is still horrible, and I don't know if this is part of the side effects or not but I noticed I have been breaking out alot and have a bad case of acne right now, wasn't like that before I started taking these, but hopefully that will clear up in time w/ my proactiv I'm using for it! Other than that, the restless sleeping is not there so much, my first week and part of the 2nd I wasn't able to sleep much, but now I fall asleep like nothing. I go back for my monthly check up and refill this weekend so hopefully my BMI has gone down along with the weightloss! I hope to see more and more results, my goal is 80lbs, when I started I was going back and forth between being 215-225..and now I'm at 206lbs =).

I'm trying to do some form of aerobic activity everyday but take one to two days off to recooperate.  Once in awhile I have problems sleeping at night and those are the nights when I haven't worked out during the day. I'm not eating as much as i did before and no longer have the cravings for sweets or junk food like I did before.  Infact, the sweet stuff sort of repulses me now because they are TOO sweet.  I woke up the other mornin with a rapid heartrate and grabbed my stethescope to hear for abnormalities.  I did hear a change.  I no longer am going to take this med d/t to this reason.

I began taking it on Aug 4, 2009. Today is Aug 16, 2009 and I have already lost 11.5 lbs. I am extremely happy. The first night I had a little trouble sleeping. After that I have had no side effects. I work 6-7 days a week 10 hours a day and I don't have time to squeeze in exercise between work chores and family time. I am full of energy now and can actually keep my head up when I read my children a book at bedtime. I feel great and I eat but I don't overeat. I have took an annitiative to choose better foods. I don't touch vending machines except for my one diet Dr. Pepper a day and my orange juice on the go. I eat small portions all day and make sure that I don't let myself get too hungry. I feel hungry and can't eat I eat some nabs such as Chex Mix or cheese and grapes or even just the peanut butter and crackers. I have had great results and will continue to take this medication and I hope everyone else the best of luck and don't give up. If you wanna change you can.  
Overweight	Chrisluv, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	8/16/2009 3:11:26 AM	I started taking 37.5 Aug 3, 1/2 @ 10am the other 1/2 @ 2pm per clinic's instructions. The 1st wk I could tell the difference: I had little to no desire to eat, my taste buds had changed, if there was salt in food it tasted saltyer, if there was sugar in food it tasted extremely sweet. I did have dry mouth which was fine, I had a hard time sleeping the 1st few nights, a major headache only 1 day. I worked out 4x that week 30min-60min of cardio high intensity w/ 30mins of strength training alternating body parts. I followed the WeightWatcher's points system exactly! But when I weighed in on Aug 10, I had only lost 3lbs! This disappointed me, because in the past w/ just diet and exercise when just starting a program I would lose 4-5lbs. During the week of Aug 10th, the medication doesn't seem to be working anymore. My taste buds are back, I am desiring to eat the way I use to, it just doesn't seem to be effective anymore I'm only in the 2nd wk! I wonder if I should stop taking it and try Bontril. Has anyone else had this experience? What are your thoughts? I need to lose over 80lbs and I am desperate. The clinic originally wanted me to take Bontril time releaseed capsule but I heard so many good things about this medication that I insisted on taking this. I wonder if I made I bad choice.

The only change i've noticed is that i dont get hunger pains from not eating although i still want to eat and crave food. I cant sleep at night and i have extreme dry mouth. I maybe taking it too late in the day. Does anyone have any recomendations to make it work better?
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/13/2009 4:49:05 PM	This drug is great! I started taking this drug(37.5 MG) back in April and to my surprise I lost 14lbs. I started back on it last week and hope to loose a total of 50lbs before the end of October. The only side effects I experienced was dry mouth and sometimes I get restless at night. Overall this is a great way to loose weight if all things have failed.

Overweight	SkinnyK, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/12/2009 1:19:16 PM	The first day I took this drug I was unable to sleep it has been a week now and I can now sleep through the night. I have also noticed that I am not as energetic as I was when I first startd. I have lost 6lbs so far in 7days whch is awesome cause one can only be expected to lose 2lbs a week with diet and exercise. I have not been working out just eating less. I am now 183lbs and am wanting to lose at least 30lbs more. I think I may join weigh watchers after I lose all of the weight so I can keep the wieght off and do a cleanse in order to get rid of toxins that this pill may be leaving in my body. I feel great!!

I decided to try it again this year in 8 months I have lost just 25lbs. I have just started changing the way I eat trying to make changes that I know I can stick to after I stop taking it. I eat even though I am not hungry. I started taking it again because I am turning 40 and didn't want to be overweight.

I'm still wondering what I need to add to my routine to make the pill work better. If the entire point is that I consume less calories, if I also don't go to the gym regularly it won't be very effective, right? If I drink more water with this pill it will also help suppress my appetite, I think that will also help. Good luck everyone!

YEA!!! in just one month I lost 22 pounds and my BMI went down 3.3 points. I have energy, I am not hungery anymore, I don't crave sweets anymore. WOW is the best word to describe this drug. Thank You Thank You to the person that invented it. It is just awsome.The only side affect is I have a bad dry mouth, but I just drink more water. Which is a good thing.Take my word for it, if you have tried every diet and failed, just try this drug, and you will be so happy with the resolutes. 
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	8/7/2009 10:22:26 PM	This is my 3rd day on the medicine and the first two days were great. My appetite was definitely suppressed and i didn't feel tired. I had a difficult time sleeping both nights, but i also have a lot on my mind because of my job. Today (day 3) i am feeling a lot of anxiety and my appetite has increased a bit from the fist two days. I feel like my heart rate is up and it is making me a little nervous and uncomfortable. Again, i'm not sure if the way i'm feeling is stress from my job or from the medicine. Hopefully the weekend will relax me and the anxiety will go away!

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/6/2009 4:26:08 PM	I am a cna and have a very busy job constant walking and lifting all day and after having two kids it's impossible to have a workout to boost your metabolism to burn anything I was 208lbs when I started, I eat what I know I can stick too later, and continue to do med/hard intensity workouts every two days then third day rest. And 100-300 crunches a night. I have used phentermine for almost 2 months now and am down to a very muscular 174 (34 lbs). The only side effects I have are dry mouth and mild constipation....Good luck everyone
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	8/6/2009 2:44:35 AM	I have only been on this for 3 weeks. For the first 2 weeks i took just 1/2 the pill. I lost 1 1/2 lbs. the 3rd week i have lost 1 lb. yes i have had dry mouth, but what bothers me the most is i cnat sleep..ugh. I have notice that i have to tell myself to eat, for lunch i willnot be hungry but i will eat a 1/2 of a sandwhich with a side of fruit/veggie. it is working, i am about 10-15lbs over weight. so this is helping. I just hope by the end i can get in a food pattern, so when i do reach my goal weight, i cnat stop and not worry to much about the cravings :)
Overweight	JJ625, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	8/4/2009 11:12:05 AM	When I first started taking Phentermine, I had little to no appetite and felt great. After a couple of days I started to feel hungry again. Plus, I could barely eat anything without putting the 5 lbs on that I had lost. I only lost 5 lbs in a month, as far as I am concerned this drug did nothing for me, I basically starved myself and it still didn't work, I would have been better off without the drug and dieting on my own. I can't understand what the problem is, I have 2 more months to take it before I see my physician, I guess she will have some answers for me.
Overweight	Newbie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	8/4/2009 9:24:57 AM	Hi everyone! I just started with this medication taking a half pill about 3 days ago. I'm starting to wonder if I'm doing something wrong. I haven't had a huge change in my appetite, possibly because I didn't really need to be hungry to eat in the first place. :-) Maybe I should be drinking more water and that will also help with the appetite suppresion. I'm hoping that once I start on the full pill I will notice more of a change. We shall see, I'm excited to notice a change!
Overweight	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	8/3/2009 6:17:29 PM	I was 40 lbs overweight and lost all 40 while on the drug for 6 months. However, when you go off of it, your appetite will come raging back. It works on the part of the brain to suppress hunger. When it's out of your system (takes about 4 days), if you've always &quot;thought about&quot; food, you will again, eating when not even hungry. That's the problem w/it. It works, but when you're off it, you go back to old ways. I've regained 15 of the 40 I lost, but you can't stay on it, so I'll have to battle away on my own!

Overweight	missle1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/2/2009 4:32:11 PM	I read a few of these reviews where people were getting dry mouth as a side effect and getting bad breath. I go to school for dental hygiene and I thought maybe I could suggest some information that would help a few people with this problem. I am also taking this medication and experiencing the dry mouth. The bad breath is from bacteria because there is not as much saliva being produced in your mouth to remove or neutralize the acid. There is bacteria in your mouth and when you eat, the bacteria and the sugars combine and create an acid. There is an &quot;acid attack&quot; in your mouth after everytime you eat or drink(besides water). It takes approx. 20 min. for saliva to neuralize an acid attack. With out as much saliva in your mouth it has a harder time neutralizing the acid which in turn there is more bacteria causing the bad breath. Some things that can help are sipping on water, biotene which is a product that helps lubricate/moisten the mouth(can be found at retail stores). Another thing you can do is chew SUGAR FREE gum with an ingredient called xylitol in it for about 5-10min after everytime you eat. The xylitol should be listed in the first three ingredients (gum that has xylitol examples: icebreakers cubes and trident but check the label there are other brands with it as well). Chewing gum with xylitol helps produce more saliva and neutrelizes the acid quicker than 20min. which reduces the bacteria. Xylitol also reduces plaque and tarter which in return helps reduce the chance of cavities. This along with good oral hygiene(brushing 2X's per day for 2 minutes each time and flossing 1X per day). I hope this helps.
Overweight	missle1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/1/2009 7:58:45 AM	I gave this all 5 stars because this is my first day taking it and don't know what to rate it yet. I am 25 years old, 5' 4&quot;, and I weight 185. I was on paxil which made me gain about 15lbs and was already overweight when I started the paxil. Now I am on welbutrin and have not gained anymore. My doctor put me on this med to help me loose the weight I gained while on paxil. I am also in the military and have been haveing a hard time loosing the weight and in the military this is problem. I am hoping for the best and I need to start training for my PT test. Hopefully this will help me get a start. I will report back after I have been on this drug for a little while. Good luck everyone....It is possiable to loose weight only by eatting healthy and exercising but sometimes it takes alot of motivation drive to get yourself to do it because it is hard. But it is possiable!

I feel more energized and more like my old self.  I have lost 5lbs so far.  My taste buds have changed slightly, I've noticed that I no longer crave sweets and foods such as yogurt or foods with sugar seem to taste &quot;too sweet&quot;. I have energy to workout now and have had no problems with sleeping at night.  Infact, I sleep better now.  I've been monitoring my blood pressure and has not seen an increase at all.

That was amazing for me! At first I had a really big problem with drinking sodas and just snacking ALL the time.(I work in a grocery store)I stopped all of that in the first month and began exercising and I lost 19lbs. my first month!! so i believe that if you do your part while on that pill you WILL get awesome results! Im satisfied with my current weight but I will love to loose about 40 more pounds.

Despite watching what I eat and exercising regularly (1 hr on the elliptical plus weights), I haven't lost more than 2 pounds. The only thing this drug has done is lower my appetite by quite a lot. I am 5'7&quot;, 160 lbs and not quite overweight. This might be the problem, as everyone I know who had results with Phentermine were overweight. Will try for 2 more weeks and then I am giving up.

It obviously works but I've been working out 5 days per week also.  Sometimes seem dizzy after workouts even with good hydration.  Thinking about stopping within the next month or so even though I'd like to lose another 30 lbs. at least.  Usually original dizziness goes away.

Overweight	Christian, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/25/2009 1:22:55 AM	I have lost 82 lbs. in the past and had to have surgery because I was not eating enough especially fat, or drinking enough water.  My mouth stayed dry. I exercised (walking I found to be best exercise).  My husband hated this drug because it chaged my personality and I was not kind to him and only him.  I did not sleep hardly at all the first 2 mths.  It took me 71/2mths. to lose the 82lbs.  I mainly ate sugar free jello.  I was obsessed with losing the weight.  Because of continuous constipation, I developed a fissure.  Had to have surgery and ended up gainly my weight back plus 20 lbs.  This has been 13yrs ago.  I now have diabetes and can't get my B/S undercontroll, so I am back on Phentermine as of yesterday.  I love this medication, I feel it is my only course of action left.  I do a lot of praying and have a wonderful support group.  I need to lose 90 lbs. but, this time it will take me longer and I will do it the right way by exercise and eating right.  had a bad headache today and I do not have as much energy as I did when taking it before but, I can sleep.  I am not irrtable this time either.  In fact , I'm very sweet.  My advice is to drink plenty of water, take some kind of Metamucial, eat right and walk, walk, walk.  You have to exercise or you fat will turn into flab that you can't get rid of later. Lean on the Lord and ask Him to give you the strenght to get to your goal and He will.  I quit smoking after Christmas cold turkey and have not missed the cigareetes I smoked for 40+yrs.  I ask God to take them away from me and He did. Good luck and stick to the program. 
Overweight	deh, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	7/24/2009 2:40:05 PM	Well, I just started today.  I am not taking any other medications, I take in very little caffeine and I'm on Weight Watchers in addition to this.  I've lost 15 in 5 weeks on WW and have just recently started light to moderate workouts.  I have a 30 day prescription for the Phentermine from my Dr to assist the WW program.  Drinking enough water is not an issue for me and since I'm learning portion control and healthy choices on WW I think this will be instrumental once I go off Phentermine to continue to lose or maintain.  I have approximately 75 more lbs to loose.  Today about an hour after taking the Phentermine I started to feel it kick in.  Nothing to extreme though.  No other side effects yet either.  Once I'm on it for a few days I'll be able to better tell how it's going to work for me.  Best of luck to all of you.
Overweight	Shy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	7/24/2009 1:47:31 PM	I started Phentermine 15mg the first week in June and within 4 weeks I had loss 8 lbs. My doctor increase my dosage to 30mg this month and 3 weeks later I've loss another 10 or so lbs. I'm glad that I'm down almost 20lbs but this week I've noticed changes. I now have an irregular bowel movement. It could be the fact that my diet consists of 2 slim fasts and one regular meal per day. I know... that's not enough... also Im not drinking enough water. But it seems like the water is making me gain! Within 4 days I've gained 4 lbs back. That's disturbing. Realize that I haven't mentioned exercise. That's because I haven't been working out the way I should either. The lesson in this is: Although you may lose weigh without, you still have to eat healthy foods, drink plenty of water, and exercise to continue the weight loss. Overall I'm happy with my progress. 30-40 more lbs to go!
Overweight	Mrs.Espinoza, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	7/23/2009 9:51:20 AM	I've been taking Phentermine for 4 days now, well except for today, I've had to skip this day because I felt very light headed and on the verge of fainting. So far I've lost 5lbs in 3 days which is excellent. I've really stuck with lowering calorie intake and fat grams and it's helped a great deal. The downside is the side effects, I have horrible dry mouth, and I haven't been able to sleep much since I started taking them, I feel slight body aches and at times my chest tightens up, my friends that are taking them say it's normal but suggest that I start taking only half then gradually move up to taking it whole. Very powerful pill.

Overweight	Life, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/22/2009 11:27:22 AM	I have taken phentermine off and on over the years.  While on this drug life is good.  I have tons of energy (a spotless house, laundry finished etc.), a very decreased appetite, and I fill full much more rapidly.  I lose weight very quickly with this medication.  The first time I took them I was on the prescription medication Effexor.  I do not recommend mixing the two.  I developed an eating disorder.  I literally would count every calorie that entered my body.  I was eating around 400 cals per day.  Not good!  I also developed severe mood swings.I am currently taking phen. and not effexor.  I started my pills on Friday, and I have already lost 6 pounds.  This is a very large amount of weight in a very short time.  It is not healthy, but being overweight is not healthy either.  One of the main things I can tell people that are starting this drug is: develop good habits.  This drug gives me more energy and willpower to eat better and exercise more.  Once you stop taking this medication keep these good habits.  I lost fifty pounds the first go around with the pills.  I went right back to my old habits and gained every bit of it back plus 10 more pounds!  This drug isn't an obesity cure, it is a diet aide and should be treated as such.

I have lost 5lbs so far and enjoy exercising again. I do wake up durring the night once in a while.

Say about 10 minutes ago, so I really don't have anything to report yet, but will report back. After reading all of the side effects and being on Effexor XR and palpitations in the past, I kind of freaked, but my doctor prescribed and said it's safe.  So will report back after a week or so.  Need to loose 30lbs.

It has really helped alot to keep me awake. At first i didn't have any side affects, but after taking it about one year, now the medication is really starting to keep me very aggatated alot. As a short med for sleep disorders I would recommend it, but not for a long period of time.

You have to drink a FULL glass of water when you takae this pill and every one cannot tolerate the full doseage. Try taking half the pill at first and work up gradually to a full pill. You may never be able to take a full pill. I can't.....Since may I can only take half.........

Did not lose as much as I though I would the first month due to my own fault. You must eat at least 5 small meals a day. I was not eating during the day so at night I was eating too much. I was also not exercising. I now eat 5 small meals and walk at least 2 miles a day. Hopefully will have better results next month.

Overweight	milleg92, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/17/2009 12:10:48 AM	I began taking Phentermine, 1 pill a day as of June 2nd 2009. I was 5'4 198.4 lbs and now it is July 16th and I am 178.4 lbs. The first two days made me shakey but I do not do well with caffiene so my body took a few days to adjust. I did adjust and now all I notice is loss of appetite, daily constipation (which is cured with a laxative on occation), and dry mouth. The dry mouth is good because it encourages you to drink water.  I have been eating healthy, around 1200-1500 calories a day, and most times have to force myself to eat.  I have tried Weight Watchers, and am using that knowledge and the appetite supressiveness of Phentermine together. I have not worked out yet, but I plan to in the future. I recommend this highly, but you must see a doctor regularly. Only weightloss doctors recommend this and it is not covered by most insurances. The cost is about $35 per month for a 30 day supply. To me, it is worth it. I am lighter and much happier.  I am losing about 2 lbs a week now (with most of my weightloss being water weight in the begining).  I do not recommend buying this online without a prescription because you need to be monitored while on this drug.  Also you could get fake medicine online. Good luck to all!
Overweight	Stacy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/16/2009 11:55:30 AM	Hello all phentermine enthusiasts :)  I am on my 4th week taking the 37.5 dosage.  Prior to going to the doctor I set my mind that I was going to make a serious life change.  I have had tremendous amount of energy, feel productive/non-lazy, and for the most part have felt great.  I have lost about 12 pounds so far.  At first, I felt nauseated all day.  I have found that if I eat 1 cracker right before I take the pill I have no nausea.  I have been walking/jogging 4-5 miles 4 times a week.  My only problem that I have experienced (if you want to call it a problem) is that I don't have a desire to eat and can go all day without eating.  When I finally make myself eat I feel like my heart is going crazy.  The pill has not made me irritable but makes me cry when I'm emotional.  I highly recommend the LoseIt application for those with iPhones, it has made a huge difference for me ...otherwise I'm not accountable for what I eat.  I eat between 800-1100 calories.  Best of luck to all!  LOSE WEIGHT, FEEL GREAT!!!

Overweight	nette, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/15/2009 10:56:30 AM	I took this drug about 5 yrs ago for about 6 months and lost 45lbs, along with diet and exercise. 2 1/2yrs ago I had my son, and gained all my weight back and then some. So I just began taking them again on July 3, 2009, and I have lost 8lbs. I like not feally hungry all the time, and I am very irritable. But nothing else was working and I am miserable being this heavy. I would recommend them to anyone who can tolerate them. Also the excessive sweating occurs, just going up and down stairs causes it. But getting back into the gym and eating better is a lifestyle change, and this is a jumpstart to it. So for those of you that can, take advantage of the benefits. I know I will and I will continue with the change in my life in order to be a better mom to my son, and be able to be more active.

I sure am. And it is curving my appetite a wee-bit, but i am still hungry. I do like the new energy I have though. Im going to hang in there and see if i get better results. Oh, i have been on these pills for about 2 and a half weeks.

I've lost 40 pounds in 3 months with proper exercise &amp; lots of water. The only problems I run across is dry mouth &amp; sporadic headaches... Other than that they are awesome...

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/9/2009 4:00:28 PM	I have been taking it for 8 weeks now and I am down 17 pounds. I am very happy with the way it's been working, becasue it isnt happening too fast, but I along with others notice the weight loss. I'm a little over 5'2, not quite 5'3 and was weighing 152 which was the most I ever weighed.  I was unhappy with the way I looked and none of my clothes fit so i thought I'd give it a try. I completley stepped up my workout game from going when I could squeeze it in, to making it a priority and taking cardio and weight toning classes about 4 or 5 times a week.  I actually ejoy working out now, which I never did before. I also, have changed my eating habits, and portion control is a BIG thing. I weigh my food (meats, chicken) and load up with salad and veggies. I really don't miss eating until I'm bloated. These meds help me not to be starving and to push my plate away when I am comfortable.  I was a big sweet eater, and I really don't miss it, I treat myself to a half a cup of frozen yogurt each night and at around 3:00 I eat an Atkins Advantage bar. They are awesome, chocolate and totally take the edge off of my sweet craving and fills me up.  No bad side effects what so ever. I want to lose 10 more pounds, so hoping to wean off it in another 8 weeks.

Averaging 2 lbs per week.Any GOOD doctor will tell you only lose 1/2 to 2 lbs per week.The first week was tough I was hungry, tired and the dry mouth was constant.It did make me want to drink alot of water, which is good.Suggestions: keep a food diary, change eating habits (read LABELS watching calories AND sugar content) drink lots of water and walk, walk, walk. It isn't a miracle pill but a good way to jump start a new you. If you want ot keep the weight off you have to change your eating habits and get exercise.I'm not talking about becoming a work-out fanatic, just good old-fashion get off the couch AND MOVE kinda exercise.

Overweight	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/6/2009 9:17:23 PM	Been on this for about a year-did it 10 years ago to lose weight for wedding. Both times I have gotten down to my goal weight because it makes you forget about food,puts you in a good mood and gives you energy. I go from a full pill a day 37.5  to a half or 3/4 a day sometimes but NEVER more than one a day.I am concerned about the faster pulse rate but have still a low blood pressure reading. However, DEEPLY concerned about a possible raise in eye pressure as in glaucoma concern/warning? Has ANYONE heard of this or experienced this? PLEASE write your experience about that. I also know people who have taken this pill and either are up to 3-4  A DAY(ridiculous-you have to stop it completely for a week or two to get it to work again) OR who take it and then don't change their eating or exercising habits and expect the pill to do it all-it can but not for long if you aren't doing your part... I completely changed my eating habits but exercise is something I get a little winded from now....All in all, it's quite an amazing thing-went from 155 lbs to 134 lbs 10 years ago and 168 (post babies!)lbs to 131 now. AGAIN, PLEASE write if you have ANY news about glaucoma pressure increase in the eye...Thanks.

Haven't really changed diet and exercise yet, but guess I will need to before I stop taking the med.  Take 37.5 once a day in the morning.  Have dry mouth, constant bloating (feel like I have to take deep breaths all the time, especially after I eat), and extreme sweating in moderately warm weather and even with the slightest bit of exertion.  AC staying on 75 or lower all the time, plus two fans going 24/7.  May have to lower my caffeine intake.  Descrip. says caffeine may increase side effects, so hoping cutting back on the Diet Pepsi and chocolate will help.  Will post again next month.

I've only been on this magic pill for less than a week, and have already lost 6 lbs.My pharmasist said to take it for 2 weeks and stop for a week, then go back to taking it for 2 weeks, and off for a week. He said that u will loose the most weight the first 2 week that you r on it,give it aweek rest and start again. My husband took it last year 4 about 4 months and lost about 65 lbs. but has gained it all back plus more. He's now doing it again 4 the 2nd. time.

Overweight	Tam I am, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/2/2009 9:11:58 AM	I started taking phentermine in late Feb. '09, and the results have been amazing.  When taking this medication, I don't constantly think about food and snacks.  I have lost 43 pounds, averaging 10 pounds per month.  It is important to note, though, that my success is not due solely to the drug.  I have completely changed my lifestyle to eating very healthy (lots of fruits and vegetables and healthy meats/proteins).  I joined a women's gym and work out 3 to 5 times a week, and actually enjoy it, which I never thought I'd see the day on that one.  I am on 37.5 mg dosage, but I have recently started cutting the pills in half because I don't want to be dependent on them forever.  I just have a few more pounds to go to reach my goal, and then I will stop taking them.  I am going to keep them on hand, though, for times that I feel like I'm starting to slip back into my old &quot;bad habits.&quot;  Side effects that I have personally experienced are dry mouth, which makes me drink much more water (a good thing) and I had trouble sleeping for the first 30 days.

I have been taking a 15mg dose for 11 days now along with a strict 1200 calorie a day diet plus working out for an hour a day and I have lost 11.6lbs! I haven't had any side effects to speak of and I am no longer having issues with my sweet tooth! I think that this pill is what I needed to jumpstart a healthier lifestyle!

But i stopped taking them because i had a episode where i felt like i was going to pass out. The feeling was so scary that i actually when to the emergency room, where the doctor told me to stop taking the immediately and instead follow another diet plan like the south beach. I am really happy i lost the weight but the feeling of passing out was too scary!!!!!

(Actually i went through 30 pills in about 6 weeks). I noticed that even when I don't take it, I still don't get the hunger pangs. I sometimes forget to eat even. So far I lost 20 pounds. I did also start walking when I took it so I think you definately should try to add exercise in with it...  I am very impresses with this pill...

Overweight	smokefree, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	6/25/2009 12:47:11 PM	Started taking 30mg once a day on 6/15/09. So far so good. I've lost about 5 lbs or so. Have had a few side effects, biggest one being dry mouth. I've noticed some get lots of energy and some seem to have none. I have been alternating between the two. Has anyone else had this. Also, the strangest thing and I'm not sure if it's the phen or not but sometimes my abs feel a bit tense or sore (not painful tho) like I've been doing lots of crunches. Is this just me? By the way me and my doc decided to try this for a couple months to help counteract some of my weight gain since I quit smoking. I started the phen exactly 6 months to the day after quitting. I've gained about 20 lbs and was so frustrated that I sometimes contemplated going back to smoking.  When I quit I needed to lose about 10-15 lbs now I need to lose about 35. I'm hoping this will jumpstart everything for me. Doc will only give me 1 month at a time (check up in between refills) and no more than 3 months total. Good luck to all and I look forward to reading more posts.
Overweight	shortie, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	6/23/2009 3:01:49 AM	Phen. is working WONDERFULLY for me. I started taking it 06/20/09 and have lost a little over a pound EACH day! I am really short, was unable to lose weight, and really wanting to lose at least 30 lbs. I have hypoglycemia and this drug has controlled it completely to which I can hardly eat! I too have the little side effect of dry mouth but all I am drinking is water anyways so its not really bothering me. I highly recommend this med to anyone haveing trouble losing weight.

I lost around 5 pounds a week. I had an amazing increase in energy and a dramatic decrease in my appetite. I took it for 3 months. Then everything came to a halt. I couldn't loose any more weight. I suddenly needed the drug to stay awake. Almost a year later I weigh almost twice what I did when I started. I decided to take it again. After about 2 months on it I have lost no weight. I'm extremely tired constantly. It no longer gives me energy. I'm always hungry. I'm extremely moody. If you've never taken this drug my advice is DON'T!! It can cause major heart problems. It is also expensive and you can bet you will gain all + your weight back.

The first 60 days I would take the pill every day at about 11am and it work fine, the first week I was slight jump but after that I felt fine. I basically kept my calorie intake to about 1500 calories but no bread or pasta for the first couple months. I lost 30lbs the first month!! The last two months I dont take the pill every day, usually not on weekends because I am so active. I have slowly added pasta and bread back into my diet. The Omega 3 wheat grain pasta from barilla is great!! So the last 4 months I have lost 25lbs. During that time I went on 2 week vacations and I have kept it off so far! I want to try and lose another 25lbs but I am going have to work out more I think to get there. The only thing that sucks so far is I am buying NEW clothes, I am loving the new clothes but my wallet is taking a hit. BUT ITS worth it!! Good Luck to everyone!! 
Overweight	celestejane, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	6/18/2009 5:39:28 PM	Just started this med about 2 wks ago and I can tell an instant change the first day.  OMG! Lots of energy!  The problems I started having was having extremely dry mouth, slight irritability and headaches. I can tell I lost some weight, but haven't been back to the doctor yet (have 2 more weeks to go).  Doc said to be careful and to monitor your blood pressure because it can increase blood pressure. I'm on 37.5 mg, but going to have to halve the pill because I think it's too strong. My appetite has decreased tremendously, but I eat just because I should.  I think this pill will work, but you should monitor yourself and notice any side effects, if any.  Listen to your body and report anything unusual.  Stay safe.

Last month I got bumped up to the 37.5mg (1/2 pill in the am half in the afternoon). I lost 8 pounds right away nothing since. I feel like I should be losing more. I completely changed my eating habbits. I only eat 1,300 calories a day. I work out 4+ times a week. I dont know if taking the whole 37.5 pill in the morning would make a difference...? I just feel like I'm not doing something right. I dont have any symptoms anymore. I still have very little appetite though. Any suggestoins?
Overweight	Linnea, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/17/2009 6:09:08 PM	I lost 20 lbs on Phentermine two years ago. I gained 10 back, so dr. was willing to give me another one month prescription. However, when I took the first 37.5 pill, I felt weird and hyper, something I hadn't experienced when I was 174. So, I cut them in half, and taking 1/2 dose is much better if you're at a lower weight. It's the only med that works on your brain so you just plain aren't hungry. You must change your habits when you go off, or you will gain it all back. Eating is habit since you will not want to eat on Phentermine

Some would say it is a slow weight-loss, but I am satisfied with how it's going for now.  I take 1/2 a pill at 10 am and 1/2 at 4 pm because a whole one seems to lead to a Ms. Cranky-pants situation.  I also count my calories on livestrong.com, which is important because it's not healthy to get below 1200 cals a day which leads to 'starvation mode'.  We should all be doing this the healthy way, don't abuse this drug, let it help you do what you need to do!

Overweight	GagesMom2, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/16/2009 1:44:43 AM	 About two and a half years ago I managed to lose 53 pounds on my own with diet and exercise.  Over the last year the weight started creeping back after a dramatic change in living situation, loss of my father, etc.  I went back to what I had done before and, alas, it wasn't working this time.   Upon the recommendation of several friends I joined a diet program, including a prescription for the (Adipex) Phentermine. Though at first I did experience the usual side effects of jitters, racing heart (couple of days of fluttering) and difficulty focusing I stuck with it and finally the side effects levelled out. I have lost 34 pounds in 10 weeks and have become re-accustomed to smaller, more frequent meals and a moderate exercise routine, going from a size 14 to a petite 4. However, remember that this is short-term and meant only to jump-start a lifestyle change that includes permanent changes in attitude towards food and exercise.  After just 8 weeks I reached my goal weight and was &quot;graduated&quot; from the diet program I had enlisted in.    By all means, if is deemed safe for you to do so, try Phentermine if all else fails.  However, take advantage of your time with this drug to learn to moderate your eating habits and exercise so that, when it's not available to you, you will still have good habits to fall back on.

I found drinking apple juice helps with the constipation.  Let me know if it works for you!  In response to questioning the weight loss and eating...I do eat, it's just less. My family eats a lot and this pill has made me eat quite a bit less. It's usually yogurt, Special K, or oatmeal in the morning, a 90 calorie snack pack for a snack, and a salad with chicken and cottage cheese for lunch.  It seems the weight loss is starting to slow down, but I'm still optimistic.  I haven't made it to 1 month yet so we'll see!

Overweight	weightlossfriend, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	6/12/2009 1:42:34 PM	Hello.  I have been on this medication since 04/30/09.  As of today I have lost 13 pounds total.  I was really excited the first month because I lost 10 pounds.  But this second month on this pill is coming off really slow!  I increased my amount of excercise to 35-40 minutes per day.  I also so a lot of ab work and cardio/walking.  I watch what I eat and I have decreased my carbs to at least cereal in the morning.  My major issue is the constipation...I drink tons of water.  My doctor told me last month to take Miralax daily and it helped but I found no matter what I did I could not lose weight.  So I finally quite taking that last week and I have lost 4 pounds.  Does anybody have any ideas how to rid yourself of the constipation?  I really don't want to get laxative dependent!  Thanks.  Also, how are some of you losing 18 pounds in a month...do you eat at all?
Overweight	Bill, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	6/12/2009 1:37:29 AM	My doc has prescribed this med for me to assist is weight loss with the boost of metabolism. He has always had me on the lowest dose, once a day. I was 5'11&quot; 295 and now as low as 211, now away from the gym I stay at 214 and still eat well balanced meals. It has been great for me. Although, there is a lot of bad info out there coming from some doc's. I guess I would rather take the chance at some minor side effects than be severely obese with many medical problems caused by being severely over weight.

I first took the pill May 27, 2009 weighing about 173 at 5'9.  Today I weigh 158.  It's been very effective.  I have been eating quite a bit less, while still maintaining a healthy diet.  But, I have a question for the females taking this medication.  It's that time of the month and I feel like I am eating more than I have since I started the pill.  For the first time in 2 weeks I have eaten every meal and finished my plate!  I'm hoping the pill hasn't stopped working and it is just my hormones. lol Any other females experience this?
Overweight	2boys4me, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/9/2009 4:26:58 PM	I went to the doctor after seeing an ad for weight loss and he started me on 30 MG on May 13. I went back a week later to the doc and lost 5 pounds. I was excited! I was not very hungry, but towards the late afternoon, I would feel a little hungry.  When I went to him the 2nd week (he requires the first 2 visits a week apart, after that it can be anywhere from 3-5 weeks, plus you get the meds right from him in the office included with the visit price)he increased me to 37.5 MG and another 8 MG to take around 4:00.  This takes the edge off so I don't over eat at dinner.  The only side effect I have had so far is some nights I wake up and I'm wide awake for a little bit, but I have always dealth with insomnia issues, so not sure if it is related. So I am 4 weeks into it and based on my scale I have lost 12 poounds in a month. I have always exercised and for the most part eat healthy but now in my late 30's just kept gaining. I inceased the intensity of my workouts, and am really eating good (no more bar food!) and I feel great. My goal was to lose 30 pounds. I'm 5'2 and was 152 which was my heaviest I have ever been.  I have been as light as 105 (way too thin) when the kids were younger and I was always running after them, working full time, but now they are older and so am I (39)so I needed a boost, to get me motivated and it;s working.  I am just hoping to get to get to 120-125 and which would be about another 15-18 pounds and then wean off the medicine and continue my better habits. That is the major part of my weight gain, is I started picking up bad eating habits, so i needed to get back on track.  I will have my offcial weigh in tomorrow and update, but I'm happy with the 12 lost so far in 4 weeks!
Overweight	phnetermine, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	6/9/2009 11:13:11 AM	I start on Phentermine about 2 years ago.  The first 3 months I took it I lost 10 lbs a month.  You have to really want to lose weight, but if you do, this really helps!The next issue is keeping it off without taking this drug too long, as it eventually will not work for you and or you could become dependent on it.  So my doctor has allowed me to get 1 30 day rx about 3 times a year, maximum.  This works for me like a on going maintenance.  I do not take one everyday but make the rx last 3 months or longer.  But I manage to keep the weight down!  That is major for my health and self esteem.  Good luck to you guys, it is great if you respect it and work with it.

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/8/2009 9:26:50 AM	I started taking this medication just a little under a month ago and I have lost 10 pounds so far. I was gaining weight and I was the heaviest I had ever been. I have hypothyroidism and I take my thyroid medication about 30 minutes after I take the phentermine. But I have been feeling sick to my stomach and dizzy. I am not sure maybe I am not eating enough. I eat 5 times a day (3 meals and 2 snacks),  and I exercise, but I think I am not eating what I need. If anyone could let me know if they are having the same effects I would appreciate it. I love this pill and I am so glad I started it.

Extremely happy with this drug, but you have to be serious about changing your eating habits, or else you WILL gain the weight back. Good luck ya'll
Overweight	Sparkle56, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/7/2009 7:43:22 PM	Started taking 30mg 2 days ago and besides a small headache! I am feeling great, lots of energy, decreased appetite and other than that no other side affects.  I am not craving sweets things at all and I have lost 6 LBS in 3 days.  I have ate 1,500 calories and worked out.  I think with diet and exercise anyone will do well on this.  When you feel lightheaded or sick you need to eat.  I think some people confuse the side affects with your body's response to being hungry.  YOU MUST EAT WHILE TAKING THIS. If you do not eat your body will starve and then when you go off the meds you will gain the weight back!  I am excited to see how much I will lose.  I started at 210 lbs, 5'6 inches tall.  I am already weighing in at 204 3 days later!  Good Luck to all!!!

I am a little worried to take both?? I like the way I feel when I take the phen (more energy, less tired) but worried I will get shaky and/or anxious taking both.  Is anyone else taking both??

Overweight	KIM, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/2/2009 9:44:52 AM	I have been taking Phentermine for about a month now and have lost 13 lbs. I haven't had any side effects (except maybe staying up longer at night). I have really been working on my eating habits and walking more. I have been concerned about all of the people who write in saying that as soon as you go off of the pill that you will gain all the weight back. Well, I talked to my doctor about it yesterday at my follow up appt and she said that the only way someone will gain the weight back is if they have not been eating approx 1500 calories a day and have put their body in starvation mode, so when you stop taking the pill your body tries to store as much fat as possible because it thinks it's starving or that a persons eating and exercise habits haven't changed. She said the weight is not going to magically re-appear for no reason unless you are still eating more calories than you are burning(thats how we all got overweight to begin with).

But all of a sudden I can't take it anymore.  I peak and then fall into a valley!  Take it at 7:30am and then by 2:30 or 3:00 I'm quiet as a mouse, don't want to talk, very withdrawn and very depressed!!!  I don't understand how I took it all that time and now their is no way I could take it.  Very WEIRD!!!  Oh and you definately will gain all your weight back and then some.  Now i'm 20lbs heavier than when I started and cannot lose a pound to save my life.  I have a personal trainer AND on a strict diet now for over 18 weeks and barely getting any results at all, doesn't make any sence at all.

Overweight	ann mick, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	19-24	5/27/2009 5:39:00 PM	i am on my 5th day of phentermine. today i did not take my pill, because i have been experiencing some big side effects. i am on the 30 mg blue capsules. i'm 5'6'', 158lbs, and hope to lose 15-20. My clinican said that this would jump start since I haven't been able to shed much. However, I have found this drug to be quite scary. Yes, it makes me feel powerful by not wanting to eat anything and giving me LOADS of energy but there are more negatives than positive. I have had horrible headaches, lack of sleep (I lay in bed and my mind races), heat flashes, and heart racing. I will probably decrease my consumption to 3-4 times a week. Overall, this is not a magic pill. It will help in a short time that you need to lose weight, but going to the gym and eating the right foods are the way to go!!
Overweight	erin k, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	5/27/2009 1:23:20 PM	today is my 3rd day on phentermine 37.5. i am overweight from having my 2nd baby(i gained 70 pounds this pregnancy) and my metabolism took a dive. to get to a safe and healthy weight my Dr. suggested i lose 35 pounds but i will be thrilled to lose even 20-25! i started out taking half a pill for the first 2 days and i definitely noticed it taking the edge off my hunger and giving me more energy to work out. this drug was recommended to me by friends and family members who have taken it and had great results, but all of them warned me about the heart palpitations and headaches bieng scary at times. today i actually took 3/4 of a pill because i was scared to jump to a whole pill when i was already getting the results, and im glad i didnt take a whole pill because my heart is racing and my right arm feels cold.i will take it easy today, and tommorow i will go back to half a pill because i was doing fine with that and i dont want to have any episodes that make me go off this medication because so far im liking it. ive felt starving all my life no matter how much i eat, my appetite is insatiable even after a thanksgiving dinner, so im enjoying the novelty of not feeling like a slave to my hunger for once. i wont weigh in for another week, but i will come back and post my results.

Overweight	vance134, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/25/2009 10:50:20 PM	Hey all... I have been on this med since Feb. 2009 and have lost almost 42 lbs. I have not had any of the side effects and am really happy with the way this drug has worked. It suppresses the apetite and gives you that little bit of boost of energy. Make sure to follow your doctor recommendations and maintain a healthy diet. If you want to change your eatting habits and really have your mind set to changing your lifestyle you will not gain the weight back when you get off of the pill. You MUST change your eating habbits. Good Luck and if you have any questions please feel free to email me at vance134@wbfrec.com! 
Overweight	hindsightis2020, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	5/25/2009 10:26:45 PM	I started taking Phentermine in mid-2002.  I took it with a doctors prescription for almost 1 year.  I then became highly addicted to it to the point I was hiding it from my husband.  I took it for at least another year and lost a total of 65 pounds.  It gave me an incredible amount of energy and I felt great!  One morning shorly after taking it my pulse started rising very quickly.  It shot way up and I was very shaky and almost passed out.  My husband called 911 and I was taken to the hospital.  My pulse was over 230.  My doctor told me to quit taking Phentermine immediately.  I went through severe withdrawal - extreme tiredness and irratability.  For the next year I made about 4 trips to the hospital for tachycardia.  I never had any problems with my heart before I began taking this pill.  I was referred to a cardiologist who prescribed a heart medicine for me that I must take daily now to keep my heart rate in check.  My doctor says the Phentermine didn't have anything to do with this but I am not sure I believe that.  I have now gained back almost everything I lost and am desperate to lose it again.  I have had thoughts of trying Phentermine again because I know it works fast but you will NOT keep weight off with this.  It is great for the short term but a lifestyle change is necessary for long term.  Please use extreme caution with this pill.  If a pill makes you feel that horrible to come off it can't be good for you.  There is no such thing as a magic pill.
Overweight	cancerqueen, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	5/25/2009 2:17:58 PM	Update**** I have been taking this med. 37.5 mg since 3 weeks ago and so far I have lost 9lbs. weight in at 189lb and looking to lost 45-50lbs. Started out take the whole pill in the morning, but I could not deal with the pressure headache, dry mouth chest pain and short of breath, now I'm taking 1/2 at 7:30 am and other 1/2 an 1 hour later, that made a big difference, only sideaffect is the dry mouth. I think its working really well.. I thought I would more lbs than that, but I heard that is not good, so I think I'm on the right track. Also I do work out cardio and weight, toning, 4 to 5 days a week...so I am building muscles at the same time. I have my one month check this week, will see what my doctor says... I am worried that this med increase my blood pressure... I hope that is not the case... I don't plan on taking this for more than three months... will keep yall posted and good luck to all on their weight loss journey...
Overweight	fabandforty, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	5/23/2009 4:46:51 PM	I have been taking it on and off since Feb. '09.  I have lost 23 pounds and want to lose 15 more.  However, I am now afraid to stay on Phentermine because I am starting to have a clinched jaw, sore teeth, and twitching.  At first it didn't bother me, but now it's getting really annoying.  Sometimes I have red eyes.  I have the dry mouth as well, but no constipation, insomnia, nausea or headaches.  Has anyone else experienced the clinched jaw and twitching of the toes?  I go back to the doctor in 5 days and can't wait to get his report.  I am scared though that he will want me to switch to the more expensive Adipex, which I don't think works as well at surpressing your appetite.  You can e-mail me at librarymom34@yahoo.com  - Thanks!  God Bless!

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/22/2009 6:30:25 PM	I cannot say enough positive things about this med! As with anything though, it does need to be monitored and used carefully. I've been taking it on/off for 1 year. I go in monthly for BP checks &amp; if my MD thinks my BP is too high OR if I've lost either too much (or not enough) weight she won't refill. She says it is important to still do all the other &quot;right&quot; things...exercise portion control, calorie intake. Each month I've been on it I've lost anywhere from 5 lbs to 17 lbs. I haven't had bad side effects aside from insomnia but I've always had that. In the beginning, I did really have to force myself to eat. I was concerned that I would balloon when I stopped but the months I've not taken it I have been able to maintain.  So far (over 1 year) I have lost 103 lbs. Unfortunately, I think she is probably getting ready to stop giving it to me!!! :( Best wishes to all!!!

It is working wonders for me and once the initial side effects wore off I didn't have any problems with it. Due to other reasons I stopped loosing weight and stalled so my doctor increased my dosage after monitoring my blood pressure and pulse so I am now adjusting to the higher dose but I feel great and have started loosing again. It is great for those who have a lot of weight to loose - I was dreading loosing weight once I hit 215 lbs and had started to convince myself I was forever going to be over weight because nothing was working. Once my doctor cleared me medically and put me on this medication and I started to see results I gained renewed hope that I will again be 135 lbs!

YEAH!!!  I feel great.  Hardly ever hungry.  I have to force myself to eat.  And when I do, I make sure that it is fruits, veggies and some form of protein.  I don't crave junk.  Had a little trouble in the beginning with the sleeping at night but all is good now.  I do wake up earlier in the morning but I feel rested.  Good luck to all and I will post again soon with progress reports.

This is nuts. I think it really starts to wear off after a while cause now I want to eat and don't really have the full feeling all the time. I can relate to the sleep. I get off of work and all I want to do is sleep but when I lay down all I do is toss and turn. I had my doctor give me sleeping pills, they help but i kinda feel droggy in the morning until I take my phen. I hope it's not wearing off! Did anyone have to get theirs upped at all? Just wondering.

My bottle says Phentermine Hydorcloride.Does everyones say that.I am not having the usual symptoms I have been reading about.No yawning, no dry mouth and the appetite hasn't vanished. Stomach is still growling. I hope my dr. isn't trying to fool me and giving me sugar pills instead.
Overweight	gracie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/14/2009 10:39:33 AM	My first day on the meds was 5/12 and I love it.  I have a desk job and I was eating all day.  Now I barely eat.  I am forcing myself to eat.  I don't want to make myself sick by not eating.  I have a lot of energy as well.  The only thing I don't care for is the not sleeping.  I wake up a lot during the night.  But when I get up in the morning, which has been earlier than usual, I feel awake and alert and ready to start my day.  So we will see how this goes. Looking to lose about 50 pounds.  Best of luck to all who is already taking this and best of luck to the one's that is considering.  
Overweight	KIM, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/14/2009 8:50:14 AM	I have been on it for two weeks now and have lost nine pounds. The pill does make you not want to eat at all, but you have to make sure you are getting around 1500 calories a day or you are going to put your body into starvation mode and mess up your metabolism for when you stop taking the pills. 
Overweight	Wondering???, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	5/13/2009 9:40:30 AM	I started this medication on May 9th, and since then I have had a sandwich to eat.  Food just doesn't look good to me and I am at the point where I can barely force myself to eat and even at times feel nauseas just thinking about it.  Is this common  your first couple of weeks on this?

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/12/2009 11:39:42 AM	I have been on Phentermine for a week now. I have lost 8 lbs without even exercising...I do make sure I eat 3 meals a day. The side effects I have experienced are dry mouth(which helps you get your water in), and i require a lot less sleep. I tend to wake up in the middle of the night feeling wide awake. I feel the Phentermine is doing all that I was told it would. I have energy and I don't think of food all day. Actually I have to force myself to get my meals in and become very full right after a few bites. I feel being active all day enhances the drug. If I get sluggish at the end of the day i have a cup of coffee.

Overweight	christy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/8/2009 3:41:00 AM	I began 11/20/08 at 197 lbs and today I am down to 157. I do get some bad cotton mouth and sometimes constipation.I have found it to be more effective when every few weeks I take a 2-3 day break from it. Also, by taking it an hour before breakfast on an empty stomach.
Overweight	rebelgirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	5/8/2009 12:08:04 AM	I have been on 37.5 mg going on my 4th month. When I started, I weighed 155 &amp; now I weigh 125! My doctor told me to eat only meats, cheeses, eggs, &amp; lettuce. I exercise daily &amp; keep a food journal. However, this drug does make my heart flutter and cotton mouth. It also makes me feel anixety within the first hour I take it, making me want to smoke to calm my nerves. I've never smoked before this pill &amp; now I have to, to calm my anxiety. It also has caused me high blood pressure. My doctor told me not to use it over 6 months and you have to be off of it for 6 months. I read some other people's posts &amp; don't understand how they are taking this pill &amp; not losing weight! It is a sure effective way to get the weight off, but I wouldn't say the safest... I hope me telling all of yall this has helped some!
Overweight	Phil, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	5/7/2009 10:58:44 PM	Today was my first day on phen. I felt high for a good two hours after I took it. After reading some reviews i think that feeling goes away after a few days. I didn't feel hungry at all. I was wondering if anyone drinks alcohol while taking this? I usually like to drink a glass or 2 on weekend nights. I'm taking 30mg at 6:30 am and it may be mostly out of my system by evening. I thought i would skip one dose on the weekend if i would be terrible affected by drinking.  Anyone have any suggestions?
Overweight	scorpionwoman, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	5/7/2009 5:33:34 PM	I have taken this off and on over the years, it worked great as Fen Fen but they made the other drug illegal now which is a shame.  This drug works great for about 3 weeks at a time, then you get used to it and you're just as hungry as you always were before.  Dry mouth, toilet troubles, I knew about from past experiences.  Today I find out this is causing my facial muscles to twitch, thank God this is the cause and I'm not developing some kind of neurological disorder!  You can be thinner with twitchy face, toilet problems and dry mouth or be fat, you decide.  I never developed the rash thank goodness, nor the heart valve problems.
Overweight	KATHY, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	5/7/2009 4:38:52 PM	I started this medication on 12/24/08. As of today 5/07/09 I have lost a total of 27 lbs. I was hoping for more, but my doctor stopped prescribing this medication. He said four months is the maximum time frame he allows his patients. I started with the weight of 198 lbs. Today I am 171 lbs. I could keep going another month or two, but have no way of getting this wonderful phentermine. 
Overweight	KIM, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/7/2009 4:33:07 PM	Ok, I have been taking one pill each morning for 1 week now. I have lost 5lbs so far. I really haven't had any side affects (maybe falling asleep a little later than I normally do). It really stops cravings completely and I'm rarely hungry. I am however very concerned with gaining the weight back once I stop taking the pills. Everything I have looked up on the internet says that once you stop you gain the weight right back. Has anybody kept the weight off?????
Overweight	gethsemane, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/7/2009 2:41:06 PM	I have been on37.5 mg a day  since March 30, and went for my 4weeks check up and lost 9.4 lbs. I stopped all sweet sodas, breads, and pasta. I take a multivitamin everyday, and feel great. I also work out 4 days a week, walking 2 miles, and doing crunches and weights. I know I can lose now, and am so excited to see all of the reviews that are positive. I am positive, I can do this, even when I am taken off the pill next month. 2 months is all my dr. recommends, then the 3rd month I will be on my own. the 4th month I can go back on, if I haven't reached my goal.Eat alot of fruit, and vegetables, and no sauces: Ranch dressing, shrimp sauce, mayo etc. I think that helps too. Lots of protein, low carbs, and no fats!!! I will be a size 7/8 again, I can't wait.
Overweight	hatcreek29, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/7/2009 11:39:59 AM	I started taking this med. On 4/30/09 I weighed this morning, I lost 9 lbs in one week. I have dry mouth and can't sleep. I am working out 3 times a week. I do have a lot of energy. And I don't want to eat very much.

Overweight	jane1959, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/6/2009 2:17:34 PM	This pill has helped me a great deal!  I take mine an hour before breakfast and it seems to work all day.  I've been on it 1 month and I have lost 15 lbs.  I did have a blazing headache the first 3 days then it went away. I now have dry mouth and consitpation but it is so worth it! I'm eating 1/2 what I did, making better choices and I feel better so I do more.  I do get on a treadmill when possible for at least 20 min.  I am 50 yrs old and my metabolisim had slowed down considerably after I quit smoking.  I had gained about 50 lbs and could not get it off after 2 yrs.  I realize this may not be the best way but it has really helped me get on the right track!
Overweight	bb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/6/2009 11:49:04 AM	This drug worked very well for me. I am usually not hungry at all which helps me not overeat.  I have lost 19.5 pounds in about 7 weeks.  It was very motivating for me to watch the weight come off without feeling hungry all the time. I have experienced a few side effects.  Dry mouth...make sure to drink plenty of water.  Constipation....again...make sure to drink plenty of water.  At first I felt a little weird when I took the pills, but that was gone after the first week.  I don't think pills are the best way to lose weight, but this helped me to get the motivation to start eating healthier and to have more character in my eating habits.

Overweight	Dahluxe, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	35-44	5/6/2009 12:54:45 AM	I have been using this since February. I lost 15lbs.  I'm still not sure if I want to continue using it because it has given me extreme constipation and heart palpitaions. I tried to stop taking it and I became severly tired as one of the side effects. It is a little scarry for me.
Overweight	wieghtlossfriend, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	5/5/2009 2:31:04 PM	I have been taking Phentermine 37.5mg since 04/30/09. So far I have lost 5.5 pounds.  I am a daily weigher.  I have to or I lose my motivatation. I started this at 180lbs. and I am 5'2. After having my first born my metabolism totally changed.  I was nervous and scared to take this med but it is doing ok for me.  I eat sensibly. I cut my portions in half and I have decrease my carb intake.  I also work out daily for 20-30 minutes by walking or dancing aerobic tapes.  I hope to lose around 30 or so pounds.  The only side effects I have had is dry mouth and some sleeplessness but overall not bad.  
Overweight	Gina F., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/5/2009 2:13:02 PM	Don't get discouraged, I almost did.. It took me about 3 or so months to lose a noticeable amount of weight and inches. I started at 172lbs in Dec '08 by April '09 I was down to 150lbs and went from a size 12/14 to 8/10. Everyone at work has noticed the drop in weight, so don't discouraged if it seems like it's not working, might just take a little longer. Worst side effect I think would be the dry mouth, initially I had the shakes a little but they went away. Please remember to drink a lot of water, don't drink alcohol (at least not often), and make sure that you do watch what you eat (like junk food, etc), although eventually you will not crave those foods very much at all... it's really interesting how the cravings go away. Good luck!   
Overweight	Jan, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	5/5/2009 12:11:50 PM	I STARTED TAKING THIS MED 5 WEEKS AGO. I have a horrible itchey rash all over my body. Has anyone else experienced this? Also bp is high.
Overweight	Eve, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/5/2009 10:04:17 AM	I was hesitant at first to take pills for weight loss, but I have lost over 40lbs since Feb '09. The dry mouth is the worst part, but it causes you to drink more water, I'm very satisfied with my results so far.  I started at 278lbs, I was 231lbs last week and will get weighed in today.
Overweight	Needtoloselots, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	5/5/2009 9:16:05 AM	I have been on phentermine for about 2 1/2 weeks and have lost only 3 1/2 pounds. I am following the diet prescribed by my doctor and am not hungry (that part is working), but don't seem to be getting anywhere. I take the 37.5 mg dosage appx 2 hours after breakfast was prescribed by my doctor and follow the low carb, high protein diet he recommended. Am I doing something wrong? Everyone else seems to be dropping the weight so much quicker than I am. I have been able to lose weight in the past at a much greater rate. I also seem to be retaining alot of water on this medicine. Any advise?
Overweight	weightogo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	35-44	5/5/2009 12:42:06 AM	Wow after reading all the reviews, I wonder what I am doing wrong.  I have been taking this for 3 weeks now and have only lost 2 lbs.  I work out 5-6 days a week for an hour.  I am hoping to see better results soon.  I am envious of those who have lost alot of weight.  I hope to be one of those success stories too.
Overweight	vangev, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/4/2009 10:39:29 PM	I started taking this drug 2 weeks ago and have lost 16lbs and over 4 inches in my waist and butt.  I am 36 years old, 5'3and weighed 214 when I started.  I could not loose weight after my fifth child.  My hairdresser gave me a few after she noticed me always working out but not loosing any weight. I did go get my own after seeing the positive affects.  I too had the sleeplessness the first day or so but it got better.  I still work out and eat well.  This has given me the boost to keep going.  I am motivated.  My husband is pleased and I am getting compliments a lot lately.  Love it.  
Overweight	jayme, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/4/2009 7:20:55 PM	UPDATE! I have been on this med for  almost 2 months. I went to the doc for a weigh in, and I lost another 1lbs. Total of 24lbs in less than 2 months. I feel so much better about myself. I do still get the dry mouth and noticed that I yawn all the time. I thought it was because I was working a lot of hours at work. But things have been back to normal at work and still I yawn all the time. I didnt know that yawning was  a side effect. there should be a phentermine support group or web site or something we could all join and compare stiories and encourage another. 
Overweight	Shannon, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	5/4/2009 4:36:48 PM	I followed up with my dr. about my reacttion. He said to stay on the blood pressure meds for at least one month.  If after one week all side affects from the phentermine are gone then I could starting taking Meridia.  I have to see my dr. twice a week the 1st week to monitor my blood pressure on th Meridia.  On the upside I lost 11 lbs. on my 1st week with phentermine.  Good everylone!-Shannon
Overweight	Jessicia, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/4/2009 4:30:18 PM	Well I have been on this drug for 3 days now. I feel a little different. I do have the dry mouth but that's it. The headaches I think are coming from lack of caffiene. Seeing as though I'm trying to give it up and with the dry mouth I want water not soda. I found I don't really have trouble sleeping. If I get a good excerise in after dinner. I can sleep really good. I do take sleep aids too. But I was on those before I started taking the pills. I hope this works for me. I just make sure that I'm doing it right. I don't want to gain the weight back and don't want to have to depend on this drug ever again. I do have the feeling of not wanting to eat but I will eat something just so I know I'm getting nutrition! I don't want to be anerexic!!! I will keep you updated. I will way myself in 4 days so that is a week. 
Overweight	KIM, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/4/2009 9:22:49 AM	I started taking 37.5 mg on 4/30. I'm amazed how it just kills your appetite. I have to make myself eat to make sure I'm getting the nutrition and enough calories so my body doesn't go into starvation mode. I don't want my body to get used to too few calories so that when I go off the med I don't gain the weight back. I haven't had any side effects yet. I'm not weighing myself until it's been a week. I was 213 (I'm 5'10) at my last Dr. visit and I will go back for another visit in one week. Keep you posted!

I love it but....I'm having trouble sleeping at night. Does this go away? Also, does this med change your basic chemistry? I'm scared I'm going to gain the weight back when I go off it. I understand making lifestyle changes but if it changes your basic chemistry and you just gain the weight back then what's the point. Any input?

Overweight	Shannon, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	5/2/2009 6:00:40 PM	I started taking phentermine on 4/23/09.  I just found out today when I went to the doctor to have my vitals checked that I was having a reaction to the medication.  It caused my blood pressure to go from normal 130/70 to 134/100.  I had pain and burning sensation on the left side of my neck,upper chest,shoulder, shoulder blade, and arm.My fingers would tingle and often my arm just felt heavy.  I was also having trouble breathing and began to experience anxiety attacks. I Immediately stop taking the drug and saw my doctor but should have went to he ER.  He put me on blood pressure medication and anxiety medication to make the pain and the shortness of breath go away.  If you have any of these signs do not take them lightly seek medical attention immediately.  I want to wish everyone the best of luck while on this medication and may you have great results from it.  I wish I could have been on the journay with you.-Shannon

Overweight	a.yeager, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	4/30/2009 8:19:58 PM	This is my 2nd day taking this medication. The first day I took it I felt weird. It was like my body was as light as a feather. This went away after a few hours. Yesterday as well as today I felt extremely tired. I can hardly keep my eyes open at times. But I am really hoping that in a few weeks I will be able to shed the pounds that I gained from the Depo Provera shot which caused me to have acute ovarian syndrome. My OBGYN was who prescribed it and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this will work. Good luck to everyone. xAnjellax

My question is sometime around yesterday I started feeling nauseous and then i went away.  I was fine this morning and had a wonderful workout.  Later when i finished lunch i started to feel nauseous again.  it kept up and finally i forced myself to eat and now i am feeling better.  is this normal?  Someone please reply.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	4/29/2009 1:51:13 PM	I have been on 30 mg once a day for about a month now so far I have dropped about 20 lbs I was very good when i started this drug I ran and at well but life got busy and i have not had time to keep up running i think thats why the weight is not coming off as quickly as it did before. I have had dry mouth but not a huge deal drinking water is good for me anyway. my only question is if anyone has had a sever acne breakout? I have bad skin to begin with but lately its beyond control and i just started thinking that it might be related to this drug
Overweight	Ashley, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	4/28/2009 1:54:45 PM	Today is my fifth day on phen. I love it so far. Im not checking my weight until I have been on it for 1 week and will then post any weightloss. Im so glad to hear others are yawning non-stop! I thought I was the only one! I also noticed that I must be grinding my teeth b/c my jaw is very sore. I got very nautious yesterday afternoon after I took my second pill but as soon as I ate something I was fine. I honestly didnt think my dr would put me on phen b/c of my age but he had no problem putting me on phen and stated that he has several other patients on it as well. I was also warned that if my BP increases at my next visit that I will be taken off it. Im finding these reviews to be very helpfull! Good luck everyone! (yawn)
Overweight	Christi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/28/2009 10:47:59 AM	Hi Big girl, when I went to my dr (she is my general and OB dr) the nurse told me good luck b/c the dr hardly ever writes this drug for her patients...well I told my about my being on Weight Watchers and not having much success on it...then I told her about all of the research that I have done on this drug and reading the reviews.  She took my vitals which are normal and told me to make sure that I excercise and eat healthier and after one month if I am not losing any weight or my vitals are up then I have to come off of it.  So I would tell your dr that you are trying and that you have been researching this drug that you would really like to try.  If he doesn't give it to you then I would maybe go to another dr.  The nurse went out of her way to wish me luck and congratulate me on getting the dr to write the prescription.  I hope that you can get your dr to do the same for you b/c this drug really does work, my family and I have had success on it.  Good luck and keep us updated!!!
Overweight	big girl, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	3	1	3	Female	25-34	4/28/2009 3:37:35 AM	I am having a real hard time getting my Dr. to give me this med - he had me try something else (can't for the life of me think what it was) that was supposed to curb appitite, boost energy and aid in blood sugar regulation... needless to say it did not work and cost an unbelieveable amount.  Any suggestions on talking to my Dr.?  I work out, eat the best I can, though am a nervous/stress eater.  Thanks!
Overweight	juliesjewels, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	4/27/2009 9:38:53 PM	I have been taking this medicine for about 3 days now.  I am so tired I can hardly move.  I am wondering if I am having a adverse reaction to this drug.  Any comments would be appreciated.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/27/2009 6:23:18 PM	I have been on this medication for only 4 days and have already lost 6#'s!! So far the only side effect I've had is the dry mouth but gum and water can easily take care of that. 
Overweight	Christi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/27/2009 4:50:28 PM	Shannon, I totally know what you mean!  My dr. told me that when I go back in on 5/14 if my BP is high then I have to go off of the medication.  I really hope it stays normal b/c I would like to continue taking it due to the sucess that my family has had on it.  I will def. keep you updated and look fwd to hearing about you as well! Christi
Overweight	Shannon, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	4/27/2009 4:12:40 PM	Christi, that happened to me too.  I slept all night last night and I am still yawning like crazy.  I am due to have my vitals checked on Friday.  I hope that this will go away.  My doctor did say that this medication can cause your blood pressure to go up.  If it does then I have to stop taking it.  Well keep me informed and I will do the same. -Shannon
Overweight	Christi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/27/2009 3:21:58 PM	I have Shannon!  I started this medication the same day you did. Even though I have lots of energy I find myself yawning all day.  I thought it might have been b/c I wasn't really getting any sleep but last night I was finally able to sleep through the night.  Today was the first time that I felt a little heart racing so I went to the Pharmacy and had my blood pressure and heart rate checked...my heart rate was 129 and the Pharmacist said that the normal heart rate is 70....she also said that this is typical of this medication and to monitor my heart rate and report it to my dr. at my next appointment.

Overweight	mzcperkins, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	25-34	4/27/2009 10:05:55 AM	I started taking it February and took it for only one month. It is almost May and I have lost 20 pounds. I did not want to get addicted so I only took it for a month. It really boost my energy and gave me motivation to diet and exercise better. It really allowed me to stop my cravings and not to over eat. I'm on way to a better way of Life.
Overweight	amieeb!, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/26/2009 7:29:53 PM	I have been on phentermine 30mg for exactly 3 weeks. I weighed in at 157 (I'm a 5'4&quot; female with a small frame) exactly 3 weeks ago and now I am right at 141. Had bad dry mouth and the jitters, comparable to drinking too much coffee, nothing severe- for the first week, those side effects went away. To bo honest, in the first week I did not eat right at all, since I was not hungry, I just didn't eat but maybe 600 calories a day. Didn't want to gain weight back when I go off of it, so I am now following a low cal (1200 daily) low fat diet and have been doing great. Dry mouth has actually helped me want water not soda. Seems too good to be true, a little scared to go off when I reach my goal weight of 130, will keep posted.

I'm also on Lexapro which causes weight gain according to my dr. The Phentermine has worked very well for me. I started in Feb. 2008 and around Oct. 2008 I stopped. At that point I had lost 27 lbs. total. I went thru the holidays and did not get back on this until March 2009. I hadn't gained ANY weight, matter of fact I had lost 1 more lb. So as of today I am down to 267 lbs. from 302 lbs. My dr. has of course encouraged me to exercise and it would come off faster. I'm now to the point that it's not showing up on the scale but I'm becoming more toned and people are noticing more. So I'm very satisfied with the outcome!!I have noticed something since I started taking it again that I didn't notice before. It's causing me to have a very strange body odor. Can't describe the smell, it's almost bitter smelling. I can smell it all the time and it drives me crazy. But my husband and son have said they can't smell it. Has anyone else had this problem and if so what can I do about it??
Overweight	Christi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/25/2009 12:58:19 PM	Shannon, I thank you for your updates, I started the same day that you did and reading your reviews really help me.  Today is my 3rd day taking Phentermine 37.5MG, I feel great.  I will admit that I have had some trouble sleeping at night but my aunt who took it for 4 months said that it will go away after a week or so.  I have PolyCystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) and have a very hard time losing weight on my own.  I finally resorted to going to my dr about being put on this drug.  It's so great to not feel hungry all the time!  The dry mouth is no fun but it forces me to drink lots more water!  If you are thinking about taking this medication then I strongly encourage you to read everything that you can on it before going to your dr.  I read several articles and hundreds of reviews before finally deciding to do it.  Good luck everyone!!
Overweight	Hairdressermom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/24/2009 3:23:33 PM	This drug helped me to lose about 60 lbs. It is very effective, but, after taking it for awhile and then coming off it, I have had very severe depression, loss of sex drive and reality. It is very hard to overcome these symptoms and often think, was it worth it!
Overweight	Shannon, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/24/2009 1:58:59 PM	If you go back to the drug results link for phentermine oral.  Under precautions you will see it says to avoid alcohol consumption.  I hope that answers your question.
Overweight	Ashley , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/24/2009 12:51:31 PM	Today is also my second day on the pill. I find that I dont ever feel hungry which makes it a lot easier to choose a salad over a not so healthy alternative. I did have a bit of trouble falling asleep last night but I did not feel tired when I woke up this morning. I have been told that drinking alcohol is not a good idea while on this med as it makes you sick... does anyone have an input on that? 
Overweight	Shannon, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/24/2009 10:06:14 AM	Today is my secong day taking the medication.  I have learned that you must eat 30 minutes after taking the meds.  This will prevent you from having a headache later.  It also keeps you from feeling like your starving later.  Remember that I was cutting the 37.5 tablet in half.  Today I took the whole 37.5 tablet.  I'm doing great and no side effects.  Hopefully I will lose some weight and I will update later. -Shannon
Overweight	convictguard, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	19-24	4/24/2009 4:33:01 AM	I have been on this medication for 21 days now. I started at 315lbs, and while taking this medication, combined with my diet and exercise regiment which were already in place, I have dropped to 293 pounds. I have a little over a week left before I see my doctor for a check-up and possible refill of the perscription. This medication is working great. I have yet to experience any of the negative side effects, my energy level is back up, I sleep better, and my mood has actually improved.

Overweight	UpdatedMan, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	25-34	4/23/2009 5:46:07 PM	***Update*** I have been taking the supplement for exactly 3 months. I dropped from 268 to 230 doing a reduced calorie diet and watching sodium and fat.  It is really effective with getting your metabolism up and curving your appetite. I do think decreasing your dosage helps to if you are taking it for a while. I had to reduce to half a pill because my mood swings were out of control, I was having difficulty sleeping, dry mouth occasionally, and sometimes I would sweat easily. After 1 1/2 month, I reduced to half a pill and everything got better. The biggest mistake is not eating or not exercising while on the pill. It will curve your appetite but if you dont eat healthy you are messing up your metabolism. I would also try to eat heavier meals during the day too. I had to take the pill 30 min before breakfast so it became almost a task for me to eat in the mornings. But afternoon hits, pill wears off, and I was ready for snacks! I didnt exercise the first couple of weeks too - so that added to my mood swings and trouble sleeping. I would take this supplement again probably wither a reduced dosage and a shorter period of time. Hope this helps!
Overweight	Ashley, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	4/23/2009 5:44:47 PM	I took my fist pill this morning. I have so much energy and currently am not expierencing any negative side effects! I have been drinking a lot of water to prevent any drymouth. I had a small bowl of cereal for breakfast and a grilled chicken sandwhich about 4 hours ago. I am not hungry at all! I am on 15mg/twice a day &amp; hope to see some great results! Now I need to go do something with all this energy!

I followed advice of some of the people on here by only taking half of pill of the 37.5mg to start with.  I'm really glad I did because I have a headache, although that is the only side effect so far.  I have tons of energy, and it seems to have some effect on my appetite.  I will post more later.

At first I could not sleep and had severe dry mouth. Now I am not having any symptoms. I have a huge energy boost and feel alot better about myself. I would def recomend taking this is you are over weight and are having issues losing it.

I haven't noticed any weight loss yet (but that was expected in only 3 days) I have had a lot of trouble staying asleep at night, even with sleep aids.  I have noticed a definite increase in energy and my overall mood.  I will check my weight in 4 more days and hopefully see a decrease!!! If I have lost at least 5-10lbs I wont mind not sleeping well for a while :)

I went to my check up and I lost 11lbs in 16 days. I know I have lost more since then.I have been expercing the normal sideeffects, like hard time staying asleep, dry mouth. If your thinking about taking this med. take a big bottle of water with everywhere you go. Trust me you'll need. I think the dry mouth is the best side effect b/c it makes you want to drink water. For me drinking water was like making me clean up after the dog. Also, I ran out for 4 days before I could get more, and I felt so tired and I felt like I was mad at everyone. So be warned, come off the pill gradually. My mom took this and lost almost 150lbs. She did gain some of it back because she didnt stick to the life changes you have to make. Phentermine is a tool to weight loss, not the life style. Good Luck to all of you.

Overweight	Nana, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	45-54	4/17/2009 8:46:50 PM	uncomfortable dry mouth. Headaches. Effective as an energy boost. Gives me the push I need to get moving. Effective in reducing my weight.Following weight watchers, exercising 4-5 times a week, and walking over 10 miles a week did not break my plateau. I was stuck on a plateau for well over a year before this. Now I am loosing weight again. I strongly recommend weening off to avoid withdrawal. I cut my does to 1/2 pill a day, then 1/2 pill every other day, then 1/2 pill every 2-3 days until I stopped. When I stopped all at once, I suffered incredible withdrawal. I had to take the med to keep functioning. Weening off as I did worked beautifully, with no symptons of withdrawal at all!
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	4/16/2009 3:01:52 PM	This medication does work well but has side effects dry mouth constipation and not being  able to sleep at night are some of the side effects I have experienced.  I missed a dose one day and the next day I was very lethargic and could hardly get out of bed until I took another dose.  So now when I reach my goal I hope coming off this medication will not be troublesome for me because my doctor only will prescribe it for 3 months.

If my schedule is busy I sometimes don't have time to eat breakfast or know when I will get a break so this makes it difficult to take the pill 30 min before breakfast, especially if you don't know when your getting a break, if at all.

When I eat it feel like all of the food doesn't go down and I feel like I need to throw up.  I have been on the medication for three weeks and have only lost three lbs. and am constantly constipated.  I am seriously considering coming off of it to see if these side effects go away.
Overweight	robin23, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	4/12/2009 10:43:54 PM	I started taking this drug on 2/24/09. Im 5'10 and my starting weight was 295. While taking this drug I ate a 1500 calorie diet. I rarely exercised. Two weeks later I was down 10 lbs. As of 3/10/09 I weigh 276. I have lost 19 lbs in a month and a half. While taking the drug I experienced dry mouth and insomnia. If you are thinking about taking this drug then I would start off by taking half the pill EARLY in the morning. Also, keep a bottle of water or some kind of light drink with you because your mouth will be dry. I love this drug because it keeps you from thinking about food and takes your appetite away! I would also advise people to excercise at least 30 minutes a day, and eat a lot of fruits and veggies! DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF!

Overweight	kymber, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	4/10/2009 5:20:20 PM	I am 29 yrs old I started this med on March 10th my weight was 282lbs. I take 1/2 tab twice a day of 37.5mg. The first couple of days I felt sick and light headed and didn't get good sleep at night, dry mouth. I have a phone job so I pretty much sit all day and that was hard at first to have all this energy all bottled up, so at first i would leave work early because I was sick. Then after about a week in half I started getting use to it and being at work. I started to exercise every night about 4 days after I first started using the drug, I would either walk for about 20-30 mins a day and or do exercises at home. I went back to DR on April 7th and I lost 15 lbs I now weight 267 lbs. Ive lost 1inch all over my body. My clothes are starting to feel baggy. I feel great. Cant wait to see how much more I will lose. The drug is a great boost. I am not hungry anymore. I only eat a little I am learning how to use proton control. Good luck to everyone!
Overweight	dawnp73, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/9/2009 5:42:05 PM	This drug has worked WONDERFULLY for me! To date, I have lost a total of 30lbs in the last 3 months of taking it.My biggest problem was I had no will power to stay away from fattening foods. I loved my pizza, cheeseburgers, fried foods, &amp; chocolate. Now, I have no problem saying &quot;no thanks&quot; &amp; not touching it. When I started to see the weight coming off, that made me more motivated to start eating healthier &amp; exercising more.My Dr. closely monitors me on a monthly basis so to make sure I don't have any problems. I'm currently on meds for high blood pressure, thyroid hormone replacement meds, &amp; nasal spray meds for allergies. Soon after starting the drug, I experienced a pretty bad dizzy spell, but haven't really had any problems since then. The only real side effect I deal with on a daily basis is dry mouth. So, I always have gum or a bottle of water with me everywhere I go. But if that's the worst of what I have to deal with, I'll deal with it in order to be skinny again! I recommend this drug to anybody whose fed up with trying everything under the sun to loose weight &amp; just needs a little help getting on the right path to loose the extra weight.

Overweight	Andrea, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/9/2009 9:32:35 AM	Start weight was 192.5. I started taking 15mg twice a day on 1-19 lost 10 pounds by 3-4 then started 37.5mg that same day. As of today 4-9 lost 10 more. 172.5! I have always exercised at least 2 times a week but have started to really exercise on the 10th of march. I'm doing the weight watcher points diet and I go out with friends and have some beers once a week. I let myself have one day a week where I can eat what I want. I have notice I don't eat as much and I am not as hungry. Which was my down fall every time I went on a diet. I would be so hungry all the time. All I wanted to do was eat. My goal is to loose 30 more pounds. I know I am going to get there and once I am there I will never get back to where I was. I always wait till I get to 190 then I go on a diet and exercise like crazy and then get down to around 150 then I stop dieting and exercising for a while and It starts over.

Overweight	chatfoux, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	4/7/2009 9:57:41 PM	This medication has help me lose 42 lbs in less than 3 months..it prevented me from having knee replacement for now..the only thing I have problems with is the dry mouth which comes and goes..the high's that I get for the first couple of hours on it. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it but since I've been on, I decided to eat scramble egg which I microwaved and I thought about 1 hr later that I was dying...it was worst than food poisoning and I know that my family eat those eggs this week and today..but it does keep you on your watch of foods..so be careful, if you dropped a food item since you've been on, i'd moderately take that food item lightly..
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	4/7/2009 3:26:03 PM	I have used phentermine several times over the last 2 years and have had mixed results.  I used it for about 3 months the first time and lost 15 lbs (I have never been obese, but have always carried a little more weight than i would like).  This pill is the only thing that has ever truly suppressed my appetite, which was great, but unfortunately, as soon as I stopped taking the pills, my appetite came back and eventually the weight came back too.  I have tried to get the same results with phentermine as I did the first time, but i think my body has become somewhat immune to the effectiveness and my body doesn't seem to tolerate it very well anymore.  Even though I have stopped for several months &amp; then tried to start over, I have only been able to take it for a few weeks before my body just seems to have enough of it.  The last time I tried phentermine it actually made me really sick after about a week.  So, my suggestion is, if you use phentermine, once you start to feel your body becoming immune to it, it's probably a good time to stop taking it and then make sure you don't fall back into your old habits (that was where I failed the most). I have heard different opinions from my doctors on the &quot;safeness&quot; of this drug, but for me, there were always side effects with it, such as really bad dry mouth, insomnia (for the first few days), blurry vision at times, occasional headaches and random moments where my toes would go numb for no reason.  However, the last time I used phentermine, I had heart palpitations, a constant feeling of heartburn &amp; indegestion, terrible headaches and didn't sleep the whole week I was on it.  So, based on my experience I think if you use the drug as a tool to change your habits and to give yourself a &quot;jump start&quot; you will probably have very good results, but, if you try to use it as a permanent way to keep weight off, without out changing your lifestyle, you will probably have mixed results.I hope this helps!

Overweight	Suzy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/1/2009 8:38:03 AM	Hello, I began taking half of 37.5mg of Phentermine on 3/27, my weight was 239.  Today is 4/1, six days later and I way 232.  I already lost seven pounds! I eat breakfast lunch and dinner but of course healthy things such as 100% whole wheat bread (martins) with salad, turkey or baked chicken, i also have the baked lay chips and in the evening i try to bbq or bake chicken. On weekends I bbq ribs or churrasco. I bought myself a juicer and for breakfast I make myself natural juice from pineapple, oranges, blueberries..its really good and also gives you a great energy boost. I think this drug is really good but do NOT skip meals bc then your metabolism will crash and when u get off the pills you will eat like crazy and regain the weight and then some. Get your body used to eating smaller portions throughout the day and if you cant handle the 37.5 take half of it. If your heart is going crazy at night you should tell your doc right away and take a smaller dose. Good luck to all!

Overweight	jay, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	25-34	3/30/2009 2:39:06 AM	I weighed 240 lbs on 03/01.  I started to cut calories and on 3/23, I started Phentermine and I weighed 235lbs. As of today, it has been exactly one week.  I have walked for 30 minutes to an hour 3 days this week.  I am 5'8&quot; tall and I am now 232 in just one week I lost 3 lbs.  I guess that's good. I have a bad case of dry mouth though and I felt jitters the first 2 days.  This really does suppress my appetite.  I will post again when I go see my doctor on April 20th!
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/30/2009 12:48:04 AM	I have been taking 30mg of Phentermine of almost a month now.  As of today I have lost 26 pounds! The weight in the first week or so was falling off then stopped for about three days then began again. It is now a pound every other day, but its still going. I have changed my eating habits and with the pills, I havent even gave it a second thought.  I have a few side affects...dry mouth, cold alot, kinda moody but and can suffer threw these if it means me having a healthy life.  I do have a ton of enegry and feel the need to be busy all the time. My worst fear is the doctor wont renew my pills for next month! 
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	3/29/2009 8:05:08 PM	I started taking 15mg for 4 weeks and lost 3 lbs. I had a bad headache for the first three days but I am fine now, felt a little jittery but not bad enough to stop. After a visit to my Dr. on the 4th week he recomended I take 30mg and come back and see him in two months. I have taken the 30mg for two days and dont feel any more jittery than when I was on the 15mg but i do get heart palputations occationaly. hopefully I see more positive weight lose soon.
Overweight	Open_Book, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	3/29/2009 8:30:06 AM	Started treatment 1/20/09....one pill a day before breakfast...using reduced calorie diet and watching sodicum and sugar. I went to one of those caloric calculators onlne to calculate my calories. I havent exercised lk i should be but planniing to start soon. So far I have lost 15 lbs in one month! down 4 pants sizes! Side effects are the downside: I couldnt sleep for first two weeks ( i was getting around 4 hrs a night) and really bad mood swings for at least most of the treatment. Also felt as if I had to get up and do something or make list of things for the next day (that hasnt went away)I have really bad allergies so I had to get off of them for a week to tk a decongestant. When started taking again, side effects came back. Have also noticed I am very moody and quick to blow them out of porportion. I can only take it 3 mths so havent decided I want to finish treatment. I do think it has helped curve my appetite (somedays literally I force myself to eat) and my metablish and energy levels have gone upp.

I started taking adipex in March 2008, I stopped in August 2008, however I continued taking a few pills now and then, but I noticed if I take them now my energy increases but my appitete doesnt decrease like before. Also beware if anyone decides to have a few drinks while taking this medication, it will make you very ill, I had to find out the hard way.

It has worked well to curb my appetite. I find I have more energy. If I stay active I dont eat but if I sit in my recliner and watch TV I can fall back into my old habits. I am 6'4&quot; and 225 now. I would like to get to around 200. Activity and staying away from fatty foods is the key. I have not had any ill effects as of yet. Good Luck to all...

Overweight	happylady, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/21/2009 12:06:06 AM	I am 30 years old, 5'6 and when I started taking Phentermine on 2/18/09 I weighed 184 lbs. In exactly four weeks, I lost 21 lbs.  I am very happy with how this has worked for me.  I have more energy and seeing results helps keep me motivated.  Every week, Tuesday through Saturday, I get up at 5:15 am and do a four mile, 1 hour walk/workout using one of the Walk Away the Pounds DVDs and in the evening I do a 30 minute 2 mile walk/workout from the same DVD.  I have felt so good!  I have had the usual side effects of dry mouth, but it just makes me drink more water which is good!  I watch what I eat and I cut back on portion sizes.  I have had a little bit of constipation, but my Dr. recommended that I take Benefiber 3 times a day and that has helped.  I just had my one month follow up with my Dr. and he is happy with the results.  My blood pressure is normal and I am having a Echocardiogram done this next week to make sure that my heart is not having a reaction to the drug.  My Dr. isn't concerned or thinks there is a problem, but he is very through and wants to check everything to be sure.  He is expecting me to only have to be on Phentermine for another two months and then I will be done.  I have been very happy with it.  I have gone down two pant sizes and I feel so much better about myself.  I have tried for years to lose weight on my own, but no matter what I did, nothing worked and my weight stayed exactly the same.  After some blood work, my Dr. determined that my metabolism was extremely low and that is why he put me on this. I know that everyone's body can react differently to a medication, but I think with diet, exercise and careful monitoring from a Dr, this is a great tool in helping someone to lose weight! 
Overweight	jeanie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/20/2009 7:30:23 PM	i have been taking for 4 months have lost 25lbs, i am 41 started at 221 lbs, im 5'4, never had any blood pressure problems or heart , diabetes, all of which is genetic, and i dont want any of these problems, the medication has helped me alot and my dr monitors my blood pressure monthly, when it seems to loose effect, i skip couple days, but its usually due to stress factors or menstrual cycle, makes me over eat, i think as long as your dr monitors your progress it is safe, it also helps with some underlying depression i deal with, my dr says thats very possible, i took the same medication in my early 30's and lost 40 lbs in a year, i had no health problems afterwards, so i felt after gaining so much weight it was worth another try, just have to learn how to keep it off after the meds do the their part

Overweight	chavela, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	3/19/2009 6:55:07 PM	I started on Phen 37.5MG on 7/20/08 and about a two days ago I threw them in the garbage.  Yes this medication works wonders but the after math is terrible.  I started at 214 lbs and after 7 months I've gone down to 173 lbs.  (Total of 41 lbs) Which is what I wanted at the time.  I went into the doctors (different Dr. than the one who prescribed the Phen) office for strep throat and ended up staying for over 3 hrs.  They checked my blood pressure which was 166 way too high.  The Dr. then took X-Rays of my heart which showed the left atrial enlarged.  The Dr. took it a step further and did a EKG test on my heart.  Needless to say I have an appointment next week for a Echo of my heart.  I think this explains a lot.  Ladies please please think about it before you start this medication.  You have too much to loose should it turn out like me.  I WAS a healthy, married 33 year old with 2 kids.  Now I wonder if this medication will be the cause of me not living long enough to see my grandchildren.  BEING THIN IS NOT WORTH IT!  I only took this route because my doctors kept telling me to lose wait, I was tired of hearing this every time I went in.  I was perfectly fine before, now who knows?

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	3/18/2009 5:43:57 PM	I started phen the first week of February at 173 pounds.  As of today, March 18th, I am 151.  I have lost 22 pounds in 6 weeks.  I am 31, female and 5'4&quot;.  Not to say that I have just sat around, popping pills and hoping the weight just falls off, but I have changed my lifestyle as well.  I walk/jog on the treadmill 5-6 times a week for thirty minutes.  I have changed my eating habits.  Yes, I do eat junk now and then, but not on a frequent basis.  When I say I eat it, I mean one piece of candy, a cup of flavored coffee or half of a donut maybe once a week.  I drink a ton of water; close to 100 oz a day.  I consume about 1200 calories a day.  I also take vitamins to help make up for the lack of nutrients I have had for the last five years.  Phen will help to give you the energy to make the changes needed to change yourself.  I have gone off for a few days here and there and have been able to stick with my new life.  I went from a size 14 to an 8.  I can do fun things with my kids, not just hang out in front of the tv.  We went for a three mile bike ride/roller blading trip this weekend and I was able to keep up with my four children.  This alone is well worth it.  Yes there are side effects; dry mouth, cold hands/feet, change in sleep habits, and constipation.  But they are minor in comparison to being obese, which I was.  And we have all heard about the side effects of obestity; diabetes, elevated cholesterol, fatigue, high blood pressure.  I was looking at all of these as future issues, but know I know I can avoid them.  Oh, and I take the generic phentermine.  My dose is 37.5mg per day, but I will often use half the tab unless I know it is going to be a rough day.  Good luck!

But my only problem with this is that I have not lost any weight since Dec 08, it seems like it stopped working, I have heard that after a little while your body adjusts to the med, my doc says to exercise more but thats impossible with a fT job, 5 kids and a husband, ok 6 kids:)))) Good Luck everyone with your Journey, and stay strong, U CAN DO IT!!!:)))

I lost 11 lbs. I wasn't hungry, lot of energy too. My problem was that I didn't excersise and didn't do any changes to my diet. I do tend to eat to much even if I'm not hungry. My Doc then put me on Bontril, been taking it for 25 days. I'm hungry all the time and have NO energy. Gained 2 lbs and just don't feel good. I'm walking 2 miles 3x a week now yesterday I started going to the Y. I'm going back to see my Doc today, I need to get back on the Adipex and give it another try. This time I'm going to be a lot more active and I'm trying to eat a lot less carbs. I don't know if she will give them to me again since they are habbit forming. I have seen online where you can buy Phentermine 37.5, but are they the real thing ? Anyone here buy them online without a prescription ? And is there a differance between Adipex and Adipex-P ? Please if anyone has any info, let me know on here or by e-mail.. alexandalex@mchsi.com Thanks!

Although that weight has only brought me from a size 18/20 to a 16 I am still very happy. I had the jitters and the dry mouth in the begening, they went away. The only isue I have now is that the last week I have had a really bad head ache. I go to the doctor next wed. and I will continue to use this med. I feel as though I have hit a dead end in the weight loss the last week though. I have faith it will get better. I drink water and sugar free tea cause I dont get the jitters but I cut out bread sweets and other snacks.

Overweight	froggy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/13/2009 12:33:19 PM	I just started taking this med 15 mg, but my Doc also combined this med with HCG shots and a med called Phendimetrazine 35mg. I have lost 15LBS. in just 3 weeks. I had dry mouth the first few weeks but it has gone away. The first week I did feel energized but it has also gone away. My eating habbits have change dramatically. I don't crave sweets or breads and I make healthy choices. I do exercise 3 times a week for bout 30 to 40 mins. I know this has to be a life changing process and if I do not keep doing what I do now after I stop taking the meds I will gain the weight back. I am very pleased with the meds and so far I haven't had any major side effects. I feel fine, I don't get the jitters I sleep well and I eat but not as much as I did and not the foods that I did. THIS MED IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.  
Overweight	tra45, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	3/13/2009 3:25:54 AM	I have been taking this medication for approximately 13 weeks now, or just over 3 months. This journey feels as though it's been literally a year! Anyway, I have lost exactly 40 pounds to date- I started at 226 lbs. and I now weigh 186 lbs. The weird thing is that I have only dropped maybe 2 dress/pants sizes. I started at a size 18/20 and now I can just barely fit iinto a 14. You would think after losing 40 lbs. the clothing size difference would be greater. I have to agree with other users in that my body has DEFINITELY become &quot;immune&quot; if you will, to this drug. In the past 5 weeks I have only lost 8 lbs, while my diet has not changed at all and my exercise has only increased. I have noticed the mood swings, where I am completely depressed for absolutely no reason at all. Luckily, I haven't had a swing like that in a while and other than that the only other thing I've experienced is dry mouth. My ideal weight is 155 lbs. so I guess I have just over 30 lbs to go and who knows how long it will take me to lose that. Each month my weight loss decreases, which is a little discouraging, but I am definitely commited to a lifestyle change. 
Overweight	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	3/13/2009 12:03:56 AM	I Just started taking this Med. on Tuesday the 10th. Its to early to see weight results, but the change in my eating behavior is amazing. I'm not hungry at all, and for me that is an odd saying. I eat healthy foods(mostly) about 4 times a day in small portions, and I have been exercising about 1 hour a day; plus the physical activity at work. So I am 245lbs. man with a goal of 200, wish me luck.

Over the next few months I lost fewer lbs each month.  This is my 2nd month to be taking two pills a day.  I take 1st one @ 9am, 2nd @noonish. If I don't pay attention to my thinking I am hungry or just eating because the food is there.  I work 6 days a week at a meat market so I already do a lot there, but if I go home and sit in my recliner then I have trouble sleeping.  If I come home and stay busy say do laundry(means I have to use the basement stairs), any housecleaning or even taking the kids outside then when I am ready to go to bed I can go out like a light.  It's just that moment of not thinking you'll sit down for very long and then before you know it it's 2am and you haven't done a thing.  I went in last week to get my refill and lost another 5lb  I am anxious to see what it will be next month if I keep up the pace and the food out of my mouth.  I find that chewing gum helps that out a bit.  i started out at 272 down to 244. my ideal weight should be 170 Ive had 2 babies, didn't work for 3-4 yrs so I got some catching up to do but I am on my way

I'm not overweight, i weight 133 but i wanted to lose 10 pounds before summer. I had taken it before and it really helped curb my cravings and eat only when i was truly hungry. But, after a month, my body got used to it so i went off again for a while.
Overweight	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	3/10/2009 3:44:49 PM	I started taking this medication November 2007. By my wedding in January 2008, I had lost 25lbs. (taking medication every now and then, not everyday) I stopped taking it for a while (I didn't gain weight though) but I started taking it again. In total I've lost 45lbs. I started at 250lbs and I am now 205lbs. This medication works great, but I can make you shakey at times and sometimes it's hard to sleep at night. You gain LOTS of energy. It can also cause headaches. I will continue to take the medication regularly until I'm down to 180lbs (my recommended weight).

I am now down to 332 and that is really without even trying.  I have adjusted my diet and excerise knowing now that the results will only get better. I do have the dry mouth but that is about it.  And I also have PCOS and the pill still works just fine. I don't believe in gastric bypass. I feel you should be more disiplined so I will continue to take it and reach my goal. Ladies remember slow and steady wins the race. you will feel better about yourself knowing you lost the weight without the quick fix of the surgery. The pills just assist in getting you closer to your goal.KStar Balad Iraq 2009

Well last year in September of 2008 I was on the medication for 1 month only and I weighed 192lbs .. with healthy eating and &quot;some&quot; exercise I lost 15lbs.  Now I only gained about 2lbs because I stopped eating healthy. But I have just started on the medication. This time I will add more exercise and eat healthy.. My goal is to go back to being 130lbs- hopefully this works!!

I lost originally 17 pounds but platued after that. BECAUSE i stopped exercising and eating better, it still does a great job at battling my chronic fatigue but doesn't help with weight loss unless you are taking the initiative to eat better and exercise. and on that note ... i need to get to the gym. oh and if its causing you emotional strain lower your dose with your dr. :)

Overweight	Patty, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	3/1/2009 9:26:51 AM	I have just begun my Phentermine 30mg (By the way - this is a Prescription Drug given by Doctor's only) The one they advertise on internet or GNC without an RX are NOT THE SAME. God only knows what you are getting. When prescribed this drug the Dr. is monitoring you and any side effects and weight loss usually on a month to month basis or more. This drugs works in 2 ways. It is an appetite suppressant and increases the Metabolism that causes weight loss. Eating high protein and fresh vegetables and fresh fruit are suggested. Drink water constantly! A Multi-Vitamin is good, as well. NO SOFT DRINKS! DIET OR NOT. Try and stay away from White Food. Meaning Pasta, Potatoes, Bread (Other than whole grain) Sugar. Protein is Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast Baked. Fresh Fish and some Red Meat baked not fried. Eggs. Eating small amounts throughout the day helps the body burn more calories. Than eating 1 large meal a day. This should be used as a JUMP START to weight loss. Take advantage of it-however, new life changes are necessary to stay leaner. You must change your eating habits and begin a safe exercise regimen appropriate for your body. Exercise daily for at least 30-45 minutes. You can begin with baby steps. Start walking in place instead of sitting while watching TV. Gradually increase activity daily. I need to lose 51 pounds. I started 2/26/09 ~ I will keep you informed. I feel great!

The reason I am writing this is because there was a review on here from 2/18 where the lady said she feels very weak on one side of her body.  STOP taking this NOW!!!

I don't know why it stopped working. I am still taking it hoping to lose more, but I don't know how much more time before I see more weight come off. When I started taking this it took about two weeks for the side effects to ware off, like dry mouth, jittery, could not sleep, once it wears off, its's gone. Has anyone else plateaued in the weigh loss like I have?  I would like to hear from you. Or should I stick it out a couple more months see what happens??

As of today I am 124, I stopped taking the meds in August 2008 with pills and refills still left, I do take them now and again for extra energy, or I will take 1/2 of a 37.5mg.. I too have had that &quot;tired&quot; &quot;sluggish&quot; feeling, and even still I get dry mouth... all the side effects I have read here are normal, I have experienced them, also a bad side effect is when you go off of them for a while you have to let your intestines heal, so you may have diahrea and sometimes your food literly goes right threw you.

I lost 20lbs in 1 month and the additional 10 in 2 weeks. I loved me. I was extremely happy with the results. I continued to take phentermine through 2006 and some of 2007. I never had any problems accept the normal dry mouth and feeling like the energizer bunny. Of the 30 pounds I lost I gained back 35. I decided to try my luck a 4th time. Well my luck has run out. Upon taking the 37.5mg, the left side of my chest has begun to hurt and I wasn't feeling quite myself. I also began to feel cold. My doctor gave me 30mg and 37.5 mg. I haven't experienced that problem with the 30 mg pills. I want to know if anyone else has experienced this problem, not to mention the fact that they just don't work anymore. Please email me at krispykreme335@yahoo.com. I would like to know if anyone else has experienced this problem. I am concerned and will be going to my doctor to check it out. Good luck to all those first timers on phentermine. It's a wonderful feeling to fit into whatever you want, but it's short lived and I'm starting to feel it might be dangerous.

I was hoping to loose another 15 this month, but it doesn't look as though that's going to happen. My weight loss has definitely slowed down since first starting this drug. I have literally gone weeks  without dropping but a couple of ounces. For example, I have been the same weight since 2/6. I keep hitting these plateaus which is very frustrating! I am doing tons of walking and doing weight exercises with low weights as not to bulk up, but tone up. She reccommended that I eat more calories every other day so my body does not have a chance to adjust to my calorie level, which always remains under 600 calories a day. She said eating more will speed up my metabolism, which I knew and I am going to try. The only thing that worries me is gaining the weight back. I was without this medication for 2 days and I was absolutely starving! I wanted to eat everything in sight, especially sweet foods and junk food. This medication absolutely helps cut down on those pesky cravings.

I used to get so hungry even after I would eat something that was soppose to keep me satisified. I was hungry all the time! Now I am noticing I am not as hungry which is easier to eat healthy then just eating whatever is in sight! I do think about food all the time and it is hard not to eat when I am not hungry but I am working on that. I am the kind of person who ate when I was hungry, sad, mad, happy, bored, and also because it was in front of me. I have always exercised because it makes me feel good and is a great stress reliever.  I have pretty good muscle tone so not sure exactly what my end goal is. Both sides of my family have diabetes so I just want to be at a weight that is healthy. I just want to feel good about myself again and have the energy to keep up with my 3 children! 
Overweight	noelle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/10/2009 11:16:11 AM	I have only been on this medication for a few days, but I am happy with it so far. I am going to weight watchers as well.  The side effects I have had were a little dry mouth, but not bad.  My doctor told me this stays in your system for ten hours,so plan what time you take your pill. She was right at the ten hour mark I felt it leave.  I have had no insomnia, in fact I have been sleeping better. I hope this helps with weight loss, because I also have hypothyroid,and losing weight is very hard. For those people who re looking for a cheaper price, I paid $18.00 at wal-mart with my AAA card, it gives you a $10.00 dicount! Good luck to all.

To people who are just starting this,write down everything you eat, you should try and eat small snacks during the day like cheese anything with protien in it.  You won't be hungry on this, but if you don't eat you won't loose the weight. I am doing no pop not even diet,water and poweraid zero.  Watch the carbs and take in all the protien you can.  good luck sandra67410@yahoo.com
Overweight	CORINA, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	2/9/2009 2:21:45 PM	I started taking this medication on 12/24/08. As of 2/4/08 I lost 17 lbs. Don't know if this is good or not. I was kind of hoping for more. My physician said in the first two months is when you lose weight the fastest. After that you have start exercising and of course watch what you eat. I still have a ways to go. I started at 198 lbs. and now weight 181 lbs.

It is now 2/9/09 and I have lost a total of 14 pounds.  I have stopped munching during the day.  My appetite has decreased tremendously.  I thought I would feel shaky or have upset stomach with this medication, but so far I feel great.  I am only on this for another week and am so thrilled how it worked for me.  It gave me my start to losing weight and eating less.

I decided to try it again since I never lost my pregnancy weight.  I only was able to take it for 3 days.  From the first day I started to take it, I had severe headaches.  As soon as I stopped taking it, the headaches stopped.  I was disappointed as I know it worked before without any serious side effects, but I guess this time, it's just not right for me.  
Overweight	manda, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	2/8/2009 1:29:01 PM	I have been taking this medication for wt loss. I started a month and a half ago and have lost 25lbs. I don't take the pill everyday because it can keep you up at night so most of the time I take it Monday through Friday. I do have to make myself eat when taking the pill and most of the time I don't eat that much because all foods just don't satisfy me. I am not jittery any more becuase that only lasted for like 2 weeks. I am very pleased with the results of this pill. Started at 175 or 180 and now 150.

So in 12 days I have lost that much.  I personally feel like those lind of results are fantastic.  But who wouldn't wish they could lose more and faster?!  I find that trying to find things to eat for lunch seems to be the most trying for me.  As well as the weekends!!  The only side effects that I have expierenced are dry mouth BIG TIME and a very intense lack of appitite... I have noticed that I have to MAKE myself eat...its crazy!  I'm really excited to see what I lose at then end of my first month.
Overweight	lilypad, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/6/2009 1:44:25 AM	I wrote an earlier review that this is the second time in my life I have taken this weight loss pill.  For me, it takes about a week to jump start the good habits.  I lost 60 pounds the first time around and am now taking it again after the birth of my fourth son who is now 2.(I have around 40 pounds to lose this time.) The side effects do decrease.  If you feel jittery and are taking 37.5, half it and take one half in the morning and one in the afternoon.  Just eat healthy and try to exercise.  It is a really great tool to help you lose the weight.  I met my goal the first time around and kept it off until I got pregnant with my fourth child.(7 years later!) People are asking if they are losing weight fast enough on this pill, basically the heavier you are the faster you lose it in the beginning.  It does taper off eventually, and those final pounds are tough to lose.  Eat low fat...look at labels when you buy food.  Eat at home and don't eat fast food or at restaurants. The side effects are definately worth it to me! I have a ton of energy and appreciate the boost. Caffiene does heighten the effects of phentermine, so be careful! Give it a chance for a month or so and see if this the weight loss pill for you. This has been an amazing tool for me to lose weight and to get healthy.  It is NOT a miracle weight loss drug.  It really helps to curb your appetite, but you also have to do the work! I started phentermine (again) on 1-19-09 and lost 20 pounds to this date.  Good Luck and TRY TRY TRY!

I lost 62 lbs in 4 months.After staying on it for almost a year I stopped shedding the pounds. i stopped taking the meds. Now after a lil over 5 years I have started taking the phentermine again. I had gained all the weight back plus some. I started taking it on 1/29/09 and already I have lost 6 lbs. I am feeling different this time around than last time I took it. I dont have the zip I had before when i took it and I am having to make myself eat and drink. The only side effect I have had is that I have a really bad taste in my mouth especially when I eat. I was 269 When i started taking phentermine so far I have lost 6 lbs in a few days and my goal is 100 lbs. Any one that has any info about some really good meals to fix for me and my family that would help me while on this diet please let me know. E-mail me @ dragonflies135@yahoo.com. Thanks and good luck to everyone.

I ALSO FOUND OUR RECENTLY THAT MY VITAMIN D LEVELS ARE LOW. NOT SURE IF THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MEDS.
Overweight	tina, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/31/2009 4:23:32 PM	I have been taking it for close to 4 months and have lost 48 lbs. I am also going to Weight Watchers which hopefully will help me to make this a lifetime change, and not &quot;a diet&quot; until the weight is off and then resume my old eating patterns. Since I started out at 294 lbs. I still have a long ways to go, but really find the combination of the two to be great.  Have learned too, that you don't want to be too restrictive or you lose fast for a few weeks and then this slows your metabolism down, which you don't want and then you stop losing.  With Weight Watchers you have a certain amount of points that you should consume in a day, and you can eat anything you want as long as you don't go over your points consistenly.  And you have 35 extra points weekly that you can use during the week or all on a special occasion that week. I would highly recommend anyone taking this drug to also join Weight Watchers to make it a Lifetime change. I also love how much better I feel with 48 lbs. less to carry around.  Also greatly love the energy I have from taking the phentermine, and the wt loss. As far as side effects, I do get dry mouth, but this makes me consume more fluids which is a plus.  I always take it around 8-9am. Had some insomnia at first, but sleep fine now with taking Tylenol PM about 1 hour before I plan to go to bed.
Overweight	UClatino, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	1/30/2009 7:35:06 PM	I started taking phentermine march 2008 and it worked right away. In a total of 6 weeks I lost 47 pounds w/ a high fiber/protein and low carb diet and exercise. I have kept the weight off since then. The thing's a noticed being on it was the smell of my urine was stronger but I added a liter of water and that went away. I got dry mouth some days but either than that I love it! It does stop working after 24 weeks so try to alternate the days you take it so you don't burn your body out on it Phentermine-poop out. The medication actually stayed in my body 6 weeks after I stopped taking it and my hunger came back gradually that was tough but just had more veggies. I found it helpful when beginning a new diet and/or exercise plan. I didn't sabotage myself by my cravings. 30mg is what i was on a day for 6 weeks.

Other	Menjoo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/25/2009 5:31:46 PM	I was recently prescribed Phentermine, however, before I was prescribed this drug there was a strict screening process.  My doctor wanted to make sure that I wasn't on any medication(s), that I didn't have a pre-existing medical condition and that I was in good health.  I was warned about the side effects which could be headaches from the body adapting to the medicine, dry mouth, constipation, and insommia for the first week or two.  I was given mult-vitamns, pyruvate fat burners, colon cleanser for constipation and 37.5 mgs of Phentermine. I take half in the morning and half in the afternoon.  I do not take the second half after 2:00 p.m. which helps with the insomnia, and I do not eat after 5:00 p.m. I am on 1,000 calories a day and a 5 day a week, 30 minute exercise program. My health and progress are monitored weekly by having my blood check checked and weigh-in.  So far I am doing well on the drug, there is a decrease in my appetite and my craving for sugar has tremendously subsided.  For the dry mouth I alternate between bottled water and Vitamin Water.  I have more energy and I can relate to those who are cleaning house.  I can do fitness programs on my treadmill that I was not able to do before.  I hope my information was helpful and beneficial.

I am pretty amazed. I still have a lot to go, but I'm confident I can get there quickly. I am eating around 1200 calories /day and exercise 3x's /week. But the days I don't exercise, I find myself cleaning or just trying to be active. I love it. I haven't felt like this since I was a kid. I do have the dry mouth and trouble sleeping but other than that, no problems.

Overweight	ccd4682, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	1/24/2009 4:46:13 PM	I have been on this medication for almost 2 months now. I will say that my weight loss has definitely slowed down. In the first month I lost 19 pounds and this month I have lost about 7. I was at a plateau for about 2 weeks where the weight would not budge, which can be very discouraging. I was hoping to lose another 16-20 pounds this month, but I guess that won't be the case. My doctor said that the weight fell off so quickly in the beginning because it was mostly water weight, which makes sense of course. I still have another 40 pounds to go before I reach the ideal weight for my height. My doctor and I thought I could lose about 60 pounds in 4 months, but again, I guess we'll have to extend that deadline. I exercise about 3 times a week and I am on a strict low calorie diet. I do get dizzy at times especially when I get up too fast, and I definitely get the flushed face and neck everyone is talking about. Overall the worst thing about losing the weight is that the bust is the first thing to go!! My clothes are loser which is great, but my bras are absolutely huge (I'm guessing I've lost at least a cup size and a half), which is the last thing I wanted. I guess I'll have to take the good with the bad!

My hunger stayed with me for a few days, but I found myself getting fuller on less to eat.  And when i do go to eat I would rather go for the healthier things like flax granola which also aids digestion and energy.  If I get snackie then i grab a pear, carrots, or even some tropicana 100% pure jucies my fave is Acai Berry &amp; Rasberry. I take the pill once in the morning and 30 min. later I am off and running, I have found it hard to stay still I just have a desire to do work.  I have to loosed at least 30lbs to be back at a healthy weight for medical conditions with my back and have struggled on my own to the point of depression with my weight and I am so happy to find  something that just gave me the extra push to get out of bed again.  The medication has help with all 3 of it's target areas for me.  I do not have trouble sleeping, but that may have to do with all of the other medications I take and the only real side effect for me is dry mouth and I find myself biting down real hard on my back teeth wich makes my jaw hurt from time to time.

Overweight	miss b, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/23/2009 4:08:50 PM	I started taking this medication the beginning of November and as of today,1/23/09, I have lost 25 pounds. In the beginning I was quite jittery even cutting the pill in half. Now I am use to it. I avoid all caffine and I am allowed 150 carbs a day. I also exercise for 45 minutes 3 days a week. I do get irritated easily on this medication so my doctor recommended taking 5 days off the meds when it gets bad. Aside from that no other side effects. I still stay full and I am able to concentrate on how much and what I eat. I am 200 pounds now and I am hoping to get to 155. Follow your doctors directions,take the medicine in the morning and drink lots of water and this should work for you too.

I am a person who is very sensitive to medication, so when my doctor prescribed it I was a little skeptical to take it. I must say that I take it every day and I feel great. I dont feel the need to eat all the time. I dont get irritable at all nor do I have trouble sleeping. I must admit I get dry mouth, but that just helps me drink more water. In the 2 months I have taken it I have lost 25+ pounds. I recommend this drug as long as you take what you are prescribed!

Overweight	Lilypad, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	1/22/2009 2:05:42 PM	This is the second time in my life I have taken Phentermine.  The first time I took it I was over weight from three pregnancies.  I lost a TON of weight in a record amount of time.  After my fourth and final pregnancy, and after done with nursing, I am taking it again.  I remember some of these side effects I am having.  I feel like I am going 100 miles an hour sometimes, and I have trouble sleeping at night.  Caffeine does heighten these feelings.  Over all I think this by far the best weight control/loss pill I have ever taken.  I am splitting a 37.5 in half and doing one in the morning and the other in the afternoon.  My first time around I lost 80 pounds.  I need to lose around 40 this time!  Good luck!

I lost a total of 35lbs in 3 months and am still going, just another 15 to go and i will be through.  Other than dry mouth i dont notice any other changes.  My husband says that i am irritable but i think its just because i started working the night shift.  Worked great for me.

Overweight	Bcas, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/19/2009 1:24:45 PM	Along with the loss of weight; I find that it gives me alot more energy and awareness. I don't feel like in a fog or groggy. I am more efficient in my work and everyday life; I am a business manager to two different automobile repair facilities, so I'm always on the go. I am a single mom of 5 children and after a long day at work, I am still able to go about the rest of the afternoon with driving the kids to different sport practices and games, as well as coming home and cooking and checking homeworks! My day ends at 10:00 pm with the kids and even after I give myself at least an hour to unwine and get ready for rest. It has been an overall great experience with this medication and so far I have not experienced any side effects. I have been on this medication for 1 year; taking 1 pill in the morning at 8:00 am when my day starts outside of home.  I would greatly recommend it to anyone that is fit to take it to lose weight. I have lost at least 104 lbs. in 1 year and I feel great about myself!

I tend to gain around 100lbs when pregnant.  The first time it just fell off this time it's a little more difficult.  This is not a miracle drug.  You do need to watch closely what you eat and exercise regularly to get results.  But they are wonderful results.

I have seen an increase of energy and the main side effect has been dry mouth. I drink lots of water, which is what I need. I do have to make myself eat and sometimes may not be eating enough. I'm not getting much exercise right now and I know that will help the medication work better. I need to lose about 30 more lbs. and as long as I can see some progress I'll stick with it. I Look forward to warmer weather so I can be outside more and walk at the local track.

Going through menopause really changed my metabolism and I needed this to get me motivated, plus due to a back problem I can't work out like I use too.  The worst thing I have noticed is the dry mouth. It has basically elminated by sugar cravings - no more cookies !!! 
Overweight	memphismom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/13/2009 10:59:11 PM	I've lost 25lbs in 3 months by taking 37.5mg of Phentermine and limiting my fat intake to no more than 20 grams of fat daily. I do reward myself from time to time and I've still managed to lose weight. I had dry mouth and jitteriness when I first started using the medication but these side effects subsided after a few weeks. I still have to limit my caffeine intake or I get jittery. It's a great medication to help lose weight, but it works much better when you couple it with fat intake reduction or exercise.

This allowed me to increase exercise which is easier with the weight loss. I follow an alkaline diet which is healthy and fulfilling. Im quit smoking 11 mths ago and suffered from depression. I drink water, green tea and limit caffeine. I'm over 50 and the mother of 4. I cut back on the dosage as I build my diet and exercise regimen so I'm in control. I also have God in my life. I hope this helps you too.

I went off of it the fist of October cause I stayed sick, wasn't getting enough rest, I gained 13 lbs back.  I went back on it in Nov. and I am still on it and I have not lost anymore weight.  In the begining I was jittery, dry mouth, wired but then it wore down.  I have been having problems with muscle cramps in legs and mid-back (tightness), tiredness, the last few days I have had swelling, really bad tightness in my back upper area.  I used to have a problem with smelling a certain smell in everything I ate and it was awlful smell.  It went away.  It seems I have a slower reaction to things.  I think I am going to go off of this.  I still have a craving for sweets that has never gone away and a craving for a Dr. pepper everyday.  It curved my appetite but not my sweet cravings.

After taking as prescribed, I did lose eighteen pounds in two months, however, I began to experience headaches, dry mouth, dizziness, nausea, and seeing small black specks or spots. The spots seem to be more prevelent when I stoop down and then get up, leading me to believe it may be caused from an increase, or possible decrease in blood pressure, or when I am doing things like yard work and become tired. I am basically in good health, other than elevated blood pressure (hypertension)and have never experienced this before taking this diet drug. Could age be a factor? I'm not sure. I stopped taking and informed my doctor, he seemed surprised at my symptoms. We agreed that I should stop taking and in doing so these things cleared up,including a very dry mouth condition. I waited for two or three weeks and tried the medication again, and again, same results. I have now discontinued use and will be seeing my doctor again soon. Has anyone experienced these side effects, especially the small black spots? Dry mouth, dizziness, nausea, headaches, small specks or spots in vision field (I searched this on MedInfo and found something similar called floaters which are associated with age, but I didn't have these &quot;floaters&quot; before the medication). I am trying to determine if the spots are a known side effect, a coincidence, or if I might have additional concerns. Any info helps, Thanks.

Seeing great results, have lost 29 lbs. so far. Felt anxious and had headaches for the first week, but they went away. Seems to lose some overall effectiveness as time goes on, but still a huge help! Just a little worried how I will keep the weight off when the medicine is gone.

I am going to weigh in again this week (haven't since Nov) anyways I don't take the medication everyday b/c sometimes I will go a 1 1/2 days without eating. I still get horrible dry mouth, which I can deal with b/c then I just drink more water!!! The only bad thing that I have noticed is that I have been having terrible mood swings lately. I don't know if it is the medicine, work, or my home life, or a combo of all of the above, but its not fun!! I'm going to talk to my doctor about it this week. I have been going to the gym again and working out at home so I'm very excited to weigh in this week. So I totally like this medication other than I'm having insomnia again!

Overweight	cris, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	4	Female	35-44	1/9/2009 6:13:45 PM	Just wanted to respond to the person who said they get sleepy.  Ive had a similar reaction to you.  I felt very sleepy for a few days and also had a calmness to me that felt the way I did when I was taking Zoloft (antidepressant/anti-anxiety).  I never feel jittery, though I do feel dizzy sometimes if I stand up too fast.  I dont feel unusually sleepy anymore but I dont have the increased energy that others talk about either.  The dry mouth is more than I can bare sometimes.  I woke up one morning with bite marks on my tongue and the inside of my mouth, maybe from my mouth being so dry it causes my lips to stick to my teeth.  Really gross!  I also get stomach pain occasionally.  Other than that, I have had no major problems.  The benefits are great.  In the first couple of weeks, I never thought about eating until I heard my stomach growling.  It got me through the holidays wonderfully.  I worry that maybe I am not getting enough nutrition.  I am now journaling my eating on www.thedailyplate.com (through www.livestrong.com).  I have lost weight but I have recently decided to wean myself off.  Everything that I read says that most people more than likely gain the weight back.  The idea of losing 30-35 lbs and then regaining it is heartbreaking.  Ive decided to do it the hard way and hopefully it will pay off in the long run.  I wish you luck!

This morning I woke up feeling like I had to severely vomit... ran to the bathroom and nothing came up. Been on it for three weeks now... took only half a pill the first 12 days. Lost about 8 pounds so far. Oh boy, I just hope it's not morning sickness instead. :(

Overweight	sandm71, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/3/2009 9:04:07 PM	I am taking half of the 37.5 mg dose.  I was taking the full pill but it made my bp go higher than normal and really shakey so I take half.  So far I have no issues with it but the other day after I ate a small breakfast and took the pill my sugar went down to 65.  I had gestational diabetes with both pregnancies so I keep an eye on my sugar especially when I feel bad.  So my question is has anyone else experienced this while taking this pill?  It has only happened once so I am not TOO concerned but I am just curious!

I found that I can get a 90 day supply (with my prescription) for under $100. I have never ordered meds on-line before and was wondering if anyone has any suggestions or has used drugstore.com.

I have lost over 20 pounds in 2 months. I know alot of people that have taken this and you do have to becarefull of the side affects, the main one I have heard of is anger people getting mad really fast. And when you come off of it. You will have to fight to keep the weight off. My goal is to help get the weight off to the point working out will not be to painful on my knee. Then use both.
Overweight	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/1/2009 6:54:04 PM	This medicine has saved my life. I started takind it in July and I have lost 55 lbs. I exercise one hour everyday. Ive had to learn to eat right and exercise, because this is not a magic pill, but it really gave my the drive I needed to change my deadly habbits. I was a 22 and now Im a size 16. Ive regained my socail life, and overcame my depression from obesity. Ive had lots of hair loss, but it grows back as fast as I lose it, so noone has even noticed.  Id reccomend this to anyone who is serious about losing weight and dedicated to making life style changes that you must continue, after you stop the pills. If you stop the medicine and go back to sugar, fried food, and no exercise, you will be back to square one within no time.

However, you MUST change your eating habits. Phen works on the brain so you're not hungry. The day you go off your appetite will come rushing back and you will go back to those old bad choices. I gained 12 of the 30 back and my doctor gave me 30 days worth of one 37.5 pill once daily. I hope it works again and I can keep it off after the month is done.

I have noticed since I have stopped completely, that the weight gain has been around the 8-10 pounds due to eating a meal two times per day. Your taste/habit for food is easily replaced to your old habits. So definitely practice a regimen of healthy diet/exercise after ending medication.

Overweight	twotwo22, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/20/2008 1:24:56 AM	I have been taking Phentermine (37.5mg) for just over two weeks now and I'm really loving the results. I've lost over 12 pounds and I have about 30-40 more pounds or so left to go. I have noticed other users who have had excellent results without changing their lifestyle at all, not the case for me. I am exercising atleast 5 times a week and I have cut out basically &quot;all the good stuff&quot;. I try and stay away from sugar, salt, fat, and excess amounts of dairy and eat fruits, vegetables, and fat-free products. I have also noticed that some days I feel more hungry than other days and I'll crave things I know I should not have which can be stressful. The only side effect I have had is the flushing of the face and neck which can be quite embarassing and dry mouth which comes and goes. Overall I would recommend this drug to anyone who wants to lose weight, especially those who have tried to lose weight in the past and have been unsecessful.
Overweight	Ronnie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/19/2008 6:08:51 PM	I started taking 30 mg on 12/01/08. The first night i couldn't sleep so i started taking it at 5am. I took it every other day the first week because I used to have Tachycardia as a result from taking Phentremine for a period of 6 months. I stopped of course, was put on hear medication until it went away after 5 years.    Anyways, my doctor thought it would be safe to try it again every other day then work my way to daily. First week I only lost 2 lbs. I'm on my third week and I've only lost 7 pounds. I do walk 2 miles a day. I love the energy it gives you and the fact that I dont think of food all day. I haven't experienced any major side effects. I do get the red face and moodiness. I'm also getting these horrible headaches though. Anybody else experiencing them?
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/19/2008 6:30:11 AM	I lost 52 pounds the first time I used this drug, but it is not without problems. Sure I had no appetite, but I had a very rapid heart rate of around 140-150. Nausea and dizziness came and went. I could not sleep very well, and my family said I became angry very easily. (not sure if it was from the lack of food intake or the med.) My weight dropped quickly, but when I came off the pill, within a year all the weight was back, I couldn't get enough to eat. Now here I am trying it again, and trying a dose to prevent the side effects. From what I see, it's either all or none.

However, I am experiencing the stomach pain that others are reporting here.I take the pill in the morning about an hour after breakfast. The pain starts 2 to 3 hours later where I feel really nauseous. As far as hunger goes, I'm not hungry and have no cravings so that part is good. I do have the dry mouth so I'm also drinking lots of water, which is a good thing.We'll see how it goes and hopefully stomach issues will decrease.

I was one of the people having issues with blood pressure spiking and my face getting flushed.  I saw my doctor yesterday and she put me on a water pill to see if it helps with those issues.  So I guess I will see how that works.
Overweight	manda b, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	25-34	12/18/2008 8:51:28 AM	I just started the 37.5 yesterday. I was very jittery and had the headache. When I finally went to sleep I woke up almost every hour.In the first day my appetite was already supressed and I had tons of energy,but I felt like someone who was on speed. My heart rate has been staying around 100. Today I cut my pill in half and am going to try tha for the next few days to see if that does any better.

Overweight	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/17/2008 12:07:00 AM	when I first started phentermine I was very excited. Within 6 months I lost 60lbs. This was about 3 years ago. I loved it, I was able to control my food intake, didn't have sugar cravings. I never felt so good in my life. 3 yrs later I haven't taken it for about a yr and half, and have slowly gained weight. Will be starting again in about 2 months, can't wait. For the person that wanted to know a good time to take it I would recommend around 11:30am, so by noon you will be ready to eat lunch. Works great!!!!!!!!!

I am going to take it before breakfast in the morning for the first time. I am so excited! I am an emotional eater with a huge appetite. I was around 130 before I got pregnant with my son. Now I am 212 - 6 pounds heavier than I was when I went to the hospital to deliver! I am 22 years old and in nursing school. I am an avid gym goer (at least 3 days a week) and have not lost any weight since I joined in February of 2008. My goal weight is around 150, if not less. Wish me luck! I will repost my results soon!

Now at 32 years old, about 10 years later, I am not doing so well. I have lost about 10 pounds in 3 months. Many nights I would wake up around 1:30 am and be wide awake. I do not take it every day due to having the issue of not sleeping well and I was a lot more active the first time I took it.

I am supposed to see her on Wed. (for a refill), but I don't know what to expect.  Also, what dosage do you take?

I have 20 lbs. to go. I feel wonderful. I do have a dry mouth which forces me to drink a lot of water (a plus) and I do get constipated, but other than that, my bp is normal and I have ZERO cravings. I am a sugar addict and choc-o-holic and have not even had a desire for chocolate! I never in my life thought I would say that. It has been a huge blessing for me.

The first two days I was so hyper I couldn't stop myself from moving (my house was spotless :-) ) but it has balanced out.  I have way more energy during the day.  I have had the flushed face and blood pressure spikes, some dizzyness, insomnia and  some abdominal pain but nothing out of control and each day those things are subsiding.  My doctor started me on the 15 mg to wean me onto the med then he will up it to 30 so I have time to adjust.  So far I am happy with this med but my biggest concern is when I get off it if I will gain the weight back even with changing eating behaviors and being more active..

I am scared to report to the doctor that I cant even lay on my left side and put pressure on my heart anymore. If they take it away I know I will get fat again, I will be that mom again that cant even play with her kids without getting winded. I wish there was another option. I have lost 35 pounds. The joy I have is worth what ever side effects I get. The red face sometimes, the high and low blood pressur,fealing like Im going to have a heart attack, insomnia till 4am, sometimes cant take a deep breath. I try to stop on my own and I feal like I am posessed by a demon. I am horribly angry for no reason, I sleep for days at a time, could sit on the couch and stair at nothing for hours. Worst of all Im in nursing school, Ive had my CNA for many years, I know better than this.

It seems to be working great for me! The only side effect I have experienced is the dry mouth..nothing a little water cant fix!! I am soo glade that I dont have the jittery or hyperness most people get from using this drug. I dont like that feeling at all! It could possibly be the lower dose im on. So if you are experiencing that side effect and you dont like it..consider talking to your doctor about lowering the dose!

I do feel a little jittery, and a little racy, but I'm giving it a week, b4 I make any changes.

Overweight	Sydney01, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	35-44	12/11/2008 8:39:35 PM	This is my second time around using Phentermine. I had alot of success taking it the first time for 3 months. Lost a total of 35lbs. Once off it the first time I felt withdrawels and had a lack of energy. I found another doctor 2 months later who gave me 3 months worth again. I basically remained at the same weight but felt that it was in control. I've just finished the last pill 6 days ago and have felt depressed, low energy and now I'm sleep walking. It's the only medication I've taken so I'm thinking that it's realted. Also I have amnesia with the sleep walking and have no recollection of my actions....very scary. I know that I probably took it to long so I'm almost sure it's messed up my brain or something. I'm heading back to the doctor that gave me the second dose and from the research I've done looks like I may need a sleep clinic or something.

It definately works, but I stopped taking it b/c just in the last week, around the same time every afternoon, my face would get flushed and my blood pressure spike.  Before taking the drug, my blood pressure was normal.  Has anyone else had this experience?  I am taking the 37.5mg every day.  I don't go to the dr until next week so not sure what she will say.  Does anyone have any similar experiences or problems w/ blood pressure?

I was a gym goer who exercised 4 times a week and was staying at the same weight. Since taking this without working out as much I have lost 26 pounds. Not sure about what will happen when I stop, hopefully going to the gym and eating right will keep me where I am and to continue to loose. My goal is to loose 30 more. I would recommend this

I really like it and want to continue using it BUT I'm worried about long term results-KEEPING the weight off! I know with the help of this drug I can lose the weight but am I learning how to eat right? Am I learning what my triggers are? Or am I just depending on this drug? And is the drug changing my metabolism around and when I stop taking it will everything go back to the way it was and I'll gain again? Does anyone know the answers to these questions? I really want to take it but I'm afraid it's not a long term solution and I'm tired of losing &amp; gaining. Please respond.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	12/6/2008 6:26:47 PM	Just a word of caution... after you stop taking this drug you will slowly gain the weight back.  I lost 40 pounds in a period of four months and I loved it. Now I have horrible anxiety and heart palpataions directly related to this drug.  Yes, it works and yes its easy, but theres something to the whole--if your not putting any effort into it, it's probably too good to be true-thing.

I have taken many prescription diet pills in the past and none have worked like this. The only side effects I have are dry mouth and constipation. I take 500mg to 1000mg of Magnesium Oxide a day to relieve the constipation(talk to your doctor before taking Magensium Oxide). To help with the dry mouth I drink a ton of water!!! My prescription is for 5 months which is the most you can have for refills because it is a controlled substance. I do skip taking it on Sat and Sun just to take a break from it so it will keep working for me. I hope to lose another 64lbs to be at my goal weight of 145.

They do not work!  I have been taking phentermine for 3 weeks now and I have lost 11 pounds.  I love it!  The biggest problems I have with it is the dry mouth and constipation.  But I can live with it if it helps me loose weight.  The first couple of days I took it, I had trouble sleeping, but that went away. 
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/3/2008 6:01:48 PM	I JUST HAVE A QUESTION... IS THIS MEDICATION ONLY AVAILABLE BY PERSCRIPTION?
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/2/2008 10:13:20 AM	I started this medicine at the end of September. I have been on it for 2 months now, going on month 3. The doctor will only let me get on it for that amount of time because it can be habit forming. If you read online about this medication you will read that you should not take it for more then 2 weeks at a time, and that you can become co-dependent on it. I believe this depends on the doctor and patient.  I took it everyday the first month, then the second month I took if every other day because it seemed to be working. When I started I weighted 155, when I did my first weigh in I weighed 142, although my scale at home said I weighted 138. For my last weigh in I was at 131. This medicine curves my appetite and gives me energy. You should so some exercise and diet with this medicine to get optimal results. I do about a 1 &#189; cardio a week broken up over 4 days and I use retention bands for my muscles, and do some yoga. You have to remember muscle weighs more then fat also. I also am a big snacker. I got 100 cal. pack from the store and these fill me up for a mid-day snack. I do get dry mouth, and my eyes do get tired, but these are common side effects. I might also add that I am on 37.5 mg.
Overweight	stylistgal, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/2/2008 10:07:08 AM	I started taking this medication almost 8 weeks ago and I love it!!  I've dropped 32lbs and have about 18more to go.  The dr that prescribed this to me has me come in once a week to weigh in and take my blood pressure.  She only gives me enough of the drug for one week so that she can regulate the use.  I also am on a very strict diet. Lots of protein, veggies, and fruit....no bread or sugar and limited dairy.  I have gone from a size 16 to a size 12, and this is with limited excercise ( i do try to get 10000 steps a day).  The first few days on this product I was all jittery like i had way to many redbulls, but that feeling went away quickly.  I take half a pill in the am, and half a pill around 2pm.  I havent had any sleeping issues, or any loss of sex drive (my bf keeps saying how skinny and hot i look lol, so that helps ;)   ).  The dry mouth sucks...and it doesnt go away, but i drink a TON of liquids so it doesnt bother me too bad.  Any questions??? email me at vena26@comcast.net.  Hope this helps.  Good LUck!!!

Three pregnancies in 2 years put the weight back on, and this last July I decided to try it again. I've lost 52 pounds in 6 months. I have no side effects that bother me. I do sleep less - 6 or 7 hours a night versus 8-10 before, but I sleep soundly and have no trouble falling asleep. I would recommend this drug to anyone that has trouble with emotional overeating. It helped me control that instinct, and I've learned how to channel that into something more productive. I want to lose 22 more pounds and then I will slowly start reducing my use of the drug. I should add that my doctor also gives me an injection once a week of B6 and B12. This has boosted my energy as well. 
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/25/2008 9:24:30 PM	Before the drug I was eating 6 small meals a day as well a completing 1 hour in the gym every day. I was losing little to no weight. I started taking this drug about a month ago and have lost a total of 10 pounds so far, (without any exercise) so I'm avering about two pounds a week. I experienced:*Dry mouth(it made me thirsty more than usual)*Insomnia(I take the drug early in the day if possible, if not I won't be able to sleep later that night)*Little appitite(I'm not as hungry as much) *Great energy(I find yourself doing a lot more than before, so much that I even have to do the gym anymore :)**hope this helps :) **
Overweight	somethingnew, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	11/25/2008 3:20:27 PM	I have been taking this med for 12 days and have lost 5lbs with absolutely no exercise. It does a good job with my appetite, I forget to eat and my growling stomach reminds me. I do get hungry in the evening, but do not eat as much as I used to. It gives me dry mouth, so I have water by me at all times and sugar free gum to promote salivation. I have noticed some dizzyness,  nausea and insomnia, but the appetite control outweighs the cons. I have a hectic schedule right now, but in a week when it calms down, I plan to start implementing exercise, so I am exited about the results at that time. I do pretty well with maintaining my weight, so I plan to do a month on/off to achieve a 40lb weight loss. I would not recommend this to a person who snack mindlessly or uses food as comfort as it will not have an affect on a habit.

I noticed that I was full of energy and not hungry the first day but then on the second day I still wanted to snack and I wasn't tired but I didn't feel the huge energy spurt like I did the first day. I don't have any side effects accept dry mouth but that helps me to drink lots of water. I'm a lil concerned though cause the 1st day I lost 1/2lb, 2nd day I lost 1lb, the 3rd day I lost 3lbs! Okay here is where the concern comes in...the 4th day (today) I GAINED 3lbs back!!! ERRRRRRRR That discouraged me quite a bit! I do 50 sit ups, push ups, and J. jacks along with a 30min. workout video every other day. I am going to start doing this EVERY day and see if it helps. I also have PCOS so I take Metformin as well as pain pills occasionally when I need them for my back pain. I have cut back on what I eat A LOT and drink nothing but water. I'm just wondering if somebody can tell me what I might be doing wrong or if anyone else had their weight go up and down as well? Please coment back or e-mail me at shorty6112@hotmail.com and help me out!!! I am currently 5'2&quot; and weight 183lbs!!!! :0(

I went from a size 16 to a 8! I had more energy to exercise and didn't eat as much because it supressed my appetite. My Hemoglobin a1c also dropped to an amazing 6.5. Then my doctor moved away and i could not get any one to write me another prescription. Unfortunately within a year I had gained all the weight back. However, I still believe in this pill and if I ever get a rx for it, I will definitly keep the weight off this time.

I have gone from a size 26 pants to a 20-22. I have had 3 back surgerys and can not exercise. But with the medication I am in less pain and tend to walk a lot more. I have no side affects except having problems sleeping. I also feel happier and not depresed when I take this medication. I do not take it everyday, i take it everyother day. I would recommend this to anyone. Just not for a long period of time.

I also gave me energy to workout. An added side effect is it puts me in such a great mood. The problem is when the rx runs out and I could not get it anymore the weight came back.

So I started Phentermine last week after it being prescribed to me 3 months ago. I was very skeptical about it and not to mention nervous. I am also going urinating a lot but I think it's because since the pill gives me dry mouth I drink more water. I'll let you know when I get results.

During the first 2 weeks, I lost 8 lbs. and was extremely encouraged.  Since that time, and for the last 6 weeks, I haven't lost anything.  I have chronic constipation issues in general and am wondering if this is the reason for the ineffectiveness of the medication.  If anyone else has experienced this, please let me know.

I do feel jittery and energized, but don't seem to have much of an appetite, so that is a good thing.  I have two sisters who have taken it and each lost 50 pounds and kept it off for almost two years now.  Hopefully I will have the same success.  I will comment back when I have taken it longer.

In the beginning I was quite jittery.  The jitters have disappeared since though.  I began to eat something like oatmeal and a banana for breakfast, then take the pill always drinking plenty of water.  Since, I have been doing that, no more jitters. My goal is to loose 20 more lbs, I am going to exercise 5xs weekly instead of the 3 and we'll see what happens!

The only side effect that i have noticed and hives a few times.

I'm going to stop taking the medicine since I can't take these new side effects. I love the effects it has on working with weight loss but I can't stand this feeling.

I don't use it every day, but in 2 months I have lost 19 pounds and 2 pant sizes.  I have changed my eating habits and started exercising more, walking at least 2 miles a day, 5 days a week.  I have just recently started walking this much, but I love it.  I also don't take the phentermine every day now.  I may skip 2 or 3 days in a row, and I only take it during the week.  You just have to learn to control it.  My goal is 65 more pounds by Jan of 2010!!

This pill isn't a crutch, I've lowered my carb intake to about 20g a day at the most and don't eat any sugar.  I pay attention to the Nutrition labels. Absolutely no fast food.  I drink at least 8 glasses of water a day and have done vigorous walking 2x/week.  I eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner..but have small healthy portions because my Dr. said not to skip meals and to make yourself eat.  I'm extremely happy so far...I do have frequent urination, and the only side effects have been dry mouth and increased energy/heartrate (maybe not a bad thing?).

Due to a couple of car accidents a few years ago, I put on about 50 pounds.  I really like to work out regularly but I now suffer from Grade IV osteo-arthritis, fibromyalgia, and carpal tunnel syndrome. I am only 36, and I am a size 16.When I take Phentermine, I DO have the energy to keep going (especially if I take Vitamin B supplements as well), and my appetite decreases noticeably.I am in the 4th month and I have noticed that the effectiveness is wearing off exponentially, so I will have to find another way to keep up my energy.Also, some of the generic versions of Phentermine do NOT work and the pharmacies will try to pass off the bad kind, so make sure you're getting the right pill --Adipex works the best and is still considered a generic of Phentermine.I highly recommend this for &quot;getting over the hump&quot;, but even if it doesn't hurt you, it loses its effectiveness after several months, so keep that in mind!
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/29/2008 10:06:45 PM	I started this medication on Feb. 23, 2008 and have lost 145 lbs as of today!  It's important to remember that this is just a tool for weight loss and not a long term solution.  In order to lose the weight and keep it off, you have to make life changes that include a regular exercise plan and a balanced diet. I work out 5 days a week for 1 1/2 hours a day and I eat 1200 calories a day. The biggest side effect is dry mouth, but drinking a lot of water makes it bearable.  40 more pounds to my goal weight-wish me luck!

I have began exercising 5 days a week.  I feel great and will stay with Phen until I reach my goal of 150 pounds.  I am hoping to reach in the next 4-5 months being a total of 58 lbs lost in 5-7 months.  Happy I found this option, be smart listen to your body.  I have had many health problems from being over weight and think the possible risks of this med are better than the definate risks of being over weight for the rest of my life.

After having my kids I have found it hard to loose the extra weight. I exercised, Dieted and nothing worked.  I have never been a believer of taking pills to loose weight. But this weight loss pill has really helped me.  It gave me the energy i needed, I had a more positive attitude I really love it. Ive finished my treatment the doctor prescribed, I have lost 38 pounds in 3 months.  I feel great.  I love this.

I had no prior history of siezures, 30 years old, and am healthy other than my weight-just under 200 lbs (which I gained during pregnancy and have been trying for 4+ years to lose the 70 lbs I gained).  Though the ER doctor could not tell me EXACTLY what caused the siezure, when I told him I was taking this medication, he immediately directed me to stop. (I had blood &amp; urine testing, a chest x-ray, and a CT scan of the brain completed-all were normal).  I am not a doctor nor do I have any medical training, but my STRONG opinion is that this medication was the cause.

Yes I had dry mouth, peeing a lot, anxious, irregular heart beat, always needed water!!! but seeing the pounds dropped seemed worth it. by Aug I lost only 1lb and Sept I gained 2. I hit a plateau. Although still eating clean n exercising, the weight wasn't dropping. For 25 yrs been blessed great skin, I started to have bad acne on my cheeks, chest started hurting extremely and went to Urgent Care and was treated for anxiety and sent 2 cardiologist, heart palpitations due to the weightloss meds they said. So by Oct I got off of them, since then I am EXTREMELY tired, feel lonely, and have gained 9Ibs. So I dont know my thoughts on this drug other than yes, it is a temp fix I think and in the long run can cause EXTREME health concerns. I still work out 5-6 days a week but I do crave thigs I didnt when on the meds. :-(

I am 5'2 and weighed 158 pounds before taking the medication. It is now October and I have lost 25 pounds. I only took it for 2 months off and on and did not take it on weekends. On some days I did not take it at all just to take a breather. My doctor also prescribed a water pill for me to take along with the phentermine to regulate blood pressure. I do exercise at least 3 times a week.I'm impressed with the performance of this  drug and plan to keep the weight off.

I have been on this med (37.5mg) since July 31, 2008 and I have lost 19 pounds. I am happy with my weigh loss, but I also fear what will happen when I stop taking this pill... I already notice, when I take a few days off, that I tend to eat more... more of the things that I don't eat when I am on the pill. Oh, well time will tell. One good thing, during my second month on the pill, I was contantly aggitated and angered easily... that has gotten much better and I am actually a little bit happier now. Thank God, that was the worst side effect and I am grateful that it is better now. Hope my experience helps someone.

I had a really hard time telling myself no when I was hungry. And I don't mean starving myself, I mean I craved whole meals after eating a whole meal. Its really helped me eat only 3 meals a day. The only real draw back is that it makes you kinda jittery. So you really need to monitor your blood pressure and heart rate very carefully. And tell your doctor of any sudden or odd changes.

Experienced diffculty with deep depression, personality changed for the worse, crabby, irritated, bad taste, abnormal heart rythum and needless to say didn't like myself.  The 'false sense of well being' is not always true.  I find myself wanting to avoide people and delay going into town for grocerys.  Hope this helps someone. 
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/19/2008 12:04:47 PM	This pill is great. I lost 20 pounds in two months!! I don't exercise but I changed my eating habits, I eat a healthy breakfast everyday(which is important for your metabolism) and I drink almost a gallon of water per day. I was not obese (5'4, 150), but according to the BMI index I was overweight. I have been off the pill for the last six weeks and have not gained a pound!

Overweight	jium, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	10/18/2008 2:36:31 PM	I too have had very frequent urination while on Phentermine. I'm on my third day and am drinking 64oz of water per day which I've done before I started the drug. Now I'm peeing all the time. Every half hour for the last 12 hours. More annoying than anything. I'm wondering if its normal.
Overweight	Juicy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/18/2008 12:55:54 PM	Most people think this pill is a quick fix to being overweight, wrong along with taking this pill you also need to implement a change in diet and excercise behavior.  Otherwise, once you discontinue the use of this pill the weight you lost will return double time.

It is October 18, 2008 today and I have lost 31 pounds now weighing 163. My doctor was very helpful and also gave me orders to adhere to a lowfat lifestyle from here on. I exercise every other day. I have had an excellent experience with this drug. I would highly recommend it to anyone that is overweight! I am truly greatful for this drug. My thanks to whoever invented it!!

I gradually got off of the phentermine by taking 1 pill every two days and then got to where I was only taking one every 3 days. Since I have been off of it I am extremely tired and sleep all the time. I am constantly starving and seems like nothing can make me full. I have gained the full 30 lbs I had lost and plus some.

The last time I checked I had lost 3 lbs so far at only taking a 1/2 a pill for 1 week. 3lbs doesn't seem like much, but for me it is a lot. I have finally started taking a whole pill and I have more energy and I feel more alert!!

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	10/9/2008 4:52:01 PM	After working out continously over 3 months and only losing 6pounds. My doctor prescribed this at 30mg. It's been great! I've lost a total of 28pounds on this at an average of 1pound a week or better. Which I think is healthy. It made it where my appitite was half (I ate recommended portionite size and felt full) I cut out caffeen out of my diet except coffee which I've learned with the pills makes me to jittery. If I didn't take it early(as soon as I woke up) I didn't sleep well.-I've heard of people having shortness of breath while taking it(particularly at night) but I haven't had a problem.

Overweight	Paul, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/7/2008 3:46:27 PM	I was very skeptical when my doctor prescribed this med. I started taking phentermine (37mg) and have found it to be almost miraculous.  I started at 280 about 5 months ago and am now at 215. I have one more month to go. This drug really helps me not obsess about eating. It does give me a dry mouth and a shorter temper but that's a small price to pay for the benefits.  The dry mouth is worse if I get excited.  I was taking Ali but stopped due to the side affects and I just did not need it if I was not eating so much. Phentermine is great and I would recommend it to anyone.

I have lost over 30 pounds in 2 1/2 months taking this medicine along with going to the gym five days a week. have not had any problems with taking this medicine. i began at 288 pounds almost down to 250. to whom ever reads this it is hard work but hang in there it is worth the hard work.i have more energy to play with my wonderful baby girl plus getting a better looking body.it has lowered my blood pressure also i am going to finish by saying hang in there an hope everyone gets the same results that i have    
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	35-44	10/7/2008 12:52:25 AM	I started Phentermine on September 13 and I have lost 13 lbs. I have had the worst side effects, constipation, nausea, dizziness and hives. The hives started about a week ago and the nausea I have had from the very first pill I take the 37.5 once a day. I have had insominia the whole time. I initially lost 20lbs. in about 4 monthis with diet and execise put I hit a plateau and found a doctor that would prescribe the pills. I also experience nervousness and have been jittery. I guess overall I have been pleased with the weight loss and I was not working out as nearly as much as I did before I got the pills, The nausea kind of put a damper on my workouts but I still managed to walk a 1-2 each day.

Overweight	Nervous Nelly , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	10/5/2008 11:35:25 PM	I just started taking Phentermine last Thursday. My Doctor gave me a range to keep my blood pressure and also said it could elevate my heart rate. I work at a hospital and she told me to check my BP and HR while I'm working...So I did. I stayed a little under what she told me to on the BP, but my heart rate jump up to 100-130's and that was sitting down. I am only taking a 1/2 a tab in the morning (like the dr told me too) but I'm scared to take a full tab. I have taken this med about 4 years ago and I don't remember feeling this way plus I was about 70lbs lighter too. I also sometimes feel whoozy and if I end over I get really dizzy. I have noticed I'm not hungry, which is good. I'm not sure if I lost anything but I am scared of some of the side effects. I think I may need a smaller dose (less then the 1.2 tab) I'm very heavy for only being 24 but the dr said my blood work is good, but I'm afraid of heart problems. Does anyone have any advise? 
Overweight	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	10/5/2008 3:48:27 PM	I just started my fourth month of treatment and doing fine!!  I just had a check up with my doctor.  My blood pressure has gone down (not that it was high to begin with) and my cholesteral, which was high, has gone down too.  I have lost a total of 14 pounds, but I am working out AND exercising while on this med.  I recommend to increase exercise, just loosing weight isn't healthy enough.  Working out and building muscle, while loosing fat will help you maintain  weight once you are off the med.  Do not take this med after 4PM, it will affect your sleep patterns.  Good luck to all

I had trouble sleeping the first night, but have been fine since.  The only side effect (besides the dry mouth) that I am experiencing is acid reflux.  I read a lot of the reviews and didn't see many people having this issue.  I almost feel like there is something stuck in my throat at times, and I am constanting wanting to burp to try and get it out.  I can't figure out if this is from the pill or something else.  I don't take any other meds though, and I am a very healthy eater.If anyone has experienced this side effect, please let me know!  I'm contemplating stopping the pill for 2 or 3 days just to see if it goes away.

I am very impressed with this pill. I have tried several other diets and was even on Metabolife 356 when it had the ephedrine in it. The doctor prescribed a 45 day supply for me and then I have to go and see her to get another prescription. When I first started I had trouble sleeping but now no problems. I still have a dry mouth.

It works wonders, but you have to be carefull w/the side effects. The 1st 2 days I was unable to sleep and now I've developed a rash. Well, not quite a rash but hives. The hives has spread all over my chest, back , neck and now chin in a matter of 2 days. Since I'm not allergic to anything I believe it's due to the pill. What messures have I taken, well outside from applying hydrocortizone and takin benadryl, I've decided to stop the pills for 3 days to see if there's a change. I will keep you posted.

I did my research and am a little concerned, but giving it a try anyway.  Feeling really jittery right now, which i suspected i probably would.  I read a lot of posts from people taking this for months.  My research says it should only be taken short-term.  My doctor took it himself and says it works.  He only gave me a 30-day supply and that's it, so I waited until I was ready to start exercising and curbing my diet (today).  Hope it works for me...will let everyone know in a month.

I was diagonis with sleep epena and use to be tired all day long and couldnt stop eating.  So the doc prescribed me this med and man its changed me for the better, I could tell a difference the first day.  hate the dry mouth and arribility. i get upset real fast but not all the time. Only thing im scared of is when the doctor takes me off the med whats going to happen.  My energy went from 20 percent to 95 percent. Wife and kids can tell a big difference in energy and no more going back for seconds at dinner time. GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE ON LOSEING YOUR WEIGHT!!!!
Overweight	artblonde, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/27/2008 11:57:56 AM	I just got this pill and I'm very excited! Two things I'm plucked about that might help people who want to try this. The first doctor (she was only a PA)I went to did not want prescribe me the drug. She believed in diet and exercise. I have been dieting since 8 I'm 32 and now weigh 300 pounds. So I left and demanded my co-pay back. Second this drug was not covered by my insurance! (it wasn't expensive less than 50 buck per 2 month supply) Even though they will cover gastric bypass. 10 people in my department of 230 have done gastric bypass. The last person IMO didn't need it and she only paid 2K out of pocket. Does that make sense! Viagra is covered by medicade.  They think having sex is important but losing weight isn't! No one ever died from not having sex. People die for being overweight.

Other	RECONSIDER, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	3	Female	25-34	9/26/2008 6:09:29 PM	Ok so I am going to be very honest and say I didnt get this med by prescription, my friend told me about it and i thought Id give it a try! Its been two weeks, but when I first started using it I expirenced severe cotton mouth, DIZZINESS, headrushes (i would bend over and when I came up it would get dark), jittery, nervous, depressed a little, tinggly lips, SEVERE INSOMNIA, constipation, difficulty breathing, and most importantly A POUNDING HEART BEAT!!!! I started off by taking a whole pill then lowered it to half a pill after that experience.  The symptoms after that were mild but I still felt pressure in my chest. I have to have oral surgery and I was upfront with my dr about it, he recommended that I stop immediately!!!! Before I started out I was in good health, 25, and 140 pounds, I just wanted to lose those last 10 pounds...OK I know I didnt take this med under the supervision of a dr but the side effects are SERIOUS! Please consider and pay attention to what your body tells you. Oh yeah I did lose 8 pounds, I just hope I dont find them!!!

My mother, who is over 50 yrs old, who was pushing 300 lbs, starting taking this a couple months ago.  She's loss close to 30 lbs.  We both tried to loose weight FOR YEARS.  Finally, this has helped.  I also read a comment about hair loss.  My doctor explained it to me this way.  When you are stressed, it can cause hair loss.  Losing weight is a major stress on the physical body.  And at the same rate, I'm eating nutritionally better, so what hair isn't falling out, is more thick and beautiful.

Overweight	It's Me!, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	9/23/2008 7:55:25 PM	For the person with hair loss, did you loss a lot of weight at once?  Usually hair loss is caused by the rapid weight loss more than the med. itself.  People that get gastric bypass OFTEN lose a lot of hair.  The good news is, you will probably get your hair back once you stabilize.  Of course I'm no expert, but wanted to give you some hope on that.  I, as most women, am very attached to my head of hair and I'm sure that can be a very SERIOUS drawback.  Blessing!

I had severe depressio w/ this medication after taking it for a little over a month.  I lost 25 lbs. but gained it all back (my fault ddn't keep up diet/exercise). I am actually taking it again under strict supervision (I'm only going to be on it for 1 month).  If you experience depression that is severe make sure to tell your Dr. immediately so your dose can be adjusted.  Good luck dieters!

At no fault of the phentermine.  I am back on it at the 30 mg dose 2xdaily and have to remind myself to eat at times....I know I have to eat for my metabolism to work properly so I make sure to do so.

Yes, I have called my doctors and I am waiting to get in to see him.  I am still having the same symptoms and I am thinking I may have had a underlying problem that this has just esculated. Thank you for your oppinion and I will keep you posted. FYI, I didn't take the med today to see if I felt different. Too soon to tell yet.

One of the biggest (or most serious?) side effects of this drug is that it can raise your blood pressure.  To me the symptems you describe could easily be from elevated blood pressure.  You can have high blood pressure with no symptoms, but to me the symptoms you describe would worry me that my blood pressure was REALLY high.  I don't want to worry you, but I would get that checked asap to at least rule it out.  The side effects I have from the drug mostly subsided after the first few days, but I wasn't having anything as bothersome as what you describe and I wouldn't want to &quot;wait and see&quot; if I was in your position.Please let us know what you find out.Blessings

My Dr. put me on the med. to help get my bloodpressure under control.I weighed 220 when a I started taking Adipex in Oct. 08.I lost 10 pounds in the first week! I started taking it again in May 08 with a 3 or 4 month break in between with no weight gain and currently weigh 160 and my blood pressure is back to normal. It works great!

Overweight	Kim, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	45-54	9/16/2008 12:21:26 AM	Hello; I was on Paxil for 25 years and called my pharmacist when I was perscribed 37.5 Phentermine to ask if it was ok to take with my other meds. Thankfully I called, because it is unsafe to take together. So I weaned off of the Paxil very quickly over a weeks time so I could get started. I started taking the Phentermine 37.5 a 1/2 tab in the morning, then was told a week later at the doctors to start a full tab. I was having issues when I started the Phentermine and still have the side affects of feeling whoozy, my head feels dizzy,my lips feel tingly, and I feel like I am tippsy when walking, after I eat I feel nuasious and have hot flashes with sweating. I get the head aches too. I started the med. Aug.22 and this week I have decided to lower the dose back down to a 1/2 again until the side affects get better or go away.  Does anyone else experience these problems and how long did they last? I am concerned whether the side affects go away or not. I guess I haven't been on it long enough yet to loose allot of weight, but I haven't seen anyone say how bad these side affects make you feel.  I am afraid to drive sometimes. I feel like a zombie most of the time. If this is normal fine I will stick it out, but if this is not normal then I need to know. I would apprecaite any help possible. Kim :)

Overweight		4	4	4			9/8/2008 5:26:07 PM	If you are taking this medication with any other type of Serotonin re-uptake inhibitor drug, like paxil, cymbalta, etc, you can get a very dangerious condition called, Serotonin Syndrome. Research it on webmd.com. Make sure that your doctor and pharmacist know you are taking both drugs. I started to take Phentermine with Paxil and in 3 days, developed seretonin syndrome and was off work for two days until I got better. It knocked me on my Butt. Since then, I have gotten off of the Paxil and have started back on the phentermine. So far, so good. I don't know yet if it was worth all the problems.

I can't say anything bad about it. Yes, like some of the other people who have posted. I do get a little irritable sometimes and if I don't drink enough water through out the day I get a serious headache. Overall I won't complain. I hope to continue taking it for a few more months to reach my goal. You do have to change the way you eat/drink. You can't expect it to be a miracle pill. I also use alli on ocassion when I feel like I have eaten something with alot of fat in it.

My dr was upset. Well the next month I gave a 100%! No fried food, sodas, sweets, or carbs. Just eating white meat, fresh fruit, veggies, walking 1 hr a day, and only drinking water. I lost 11 lbs the first week. The med is great but you have to change your habbits or it wont work.

Overweight	It's Me!, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	9/5/2008 7:24:54 AM	Allergic reaction?Has anybody ever had an allergic reaction to this med?I have been taking the blue and white capsule for a month, with nothing but the standard side effects.  Yesterday I started a new month and, because I got it from a different pharmacy, I got the yellow capsules.  Last night I broke out in a rash, I itch all over (even where the rash isn't present and especially the bottoms of my hands and feet) and I woke up this morning with my eyelids almost swollen shut.  The only thing I can think of that was different yesterday was that I changed to this new form of the drug And I was bitten by some ants (not fire ants though, just some red ants)  I've never had an allergic reaction to ants or any other bug though.  So I was just wondering if and inactive ingredient in the capsule could have caused it.Anybody have any ideas?  I'm going to call the pharmacy this morning, but thought I would ask ya'll as well.Thanks in advance!

Overweight		5	5	4			9/3/2008 10:07:46 PM	Hi,I wanted to post the bad that comes with taking this drug.  I lost 25lbs in the first month, the weight came off quickly.  After the first 3 months I started having side effects, my skin looked horrible and sunkin in, dark circles around my eyes, jitters, irribility, headaches, tiredness, unable to sleep and most of all HAIR LOSS.  I lost big clumps of hair in the shower and my brush would be full of hair when I would brush it.  It was great to lose the weight but the side effects was horrible.  I'm spending more money to try and get my hair back and I now have muscle spasums that I can not control.  My sister also took it and had the same problems.  So beware of the HORRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF THIS DRUG!!!!!
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	9/2/2008 3:12:44 PM	Good Afternoon, I started this medication on 08/12/08, and up until this date i have lost 10lbs.  I have done a lot of searching and investigating on this drug. And a lot of people are concerned to the reason why the pounds are not coming off.  Phen has a appetite suppresant and you will not eat because you are not hungry.  The problem with that is our bodies needs calories to survive.  If you are not eating enough calories per day your mind will think that your body is starving.  So it does not matter if you excersize,  your body will not burn calories that it thinks you will need. It will store all fat in your body if it believes that you are starving. You have to eat enough calories for your body to survive.  Several people that i have spoken to have stated that they eat a 1500 calorie healthy diet along with excercise and lots of water and the weight just flys off. I believe this to be very true.  So for those who have a problem with seeing results they have to find out how many calories there body needs to thrive and it goes by how much you weight.Example: weight before phen 222according to my weight my body needs 1700 calories. I hope this helps. 
Overweight	googlehead, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	9/2/2008 2:47:37 PM	The good and the bad: It worked fabulously for me, after my metabolism bombed from Epstein Barr and Lymes, I lost nearly 20 lbs on only half a pill in the morning. Tons of energy to work out, little appetite. Okay, so now it's time to stop. Guess what? Starving. Exhausted. My 3-mile runs feel like marathons. My &quot;old&quot; diet feels like starvation. Do not kid yourselves into thinking that this is a magic bullet you can use forever! Your body cannot stand to stay on this, so use the lowest dose you can, and be prepared for the opposite feeling from the energetic optimistic business while you are on it. Keep your dose low!!! This drug is psychologically addicting because you feel so good about your weight loss and energy. Please be careful.
Overweight		5	5	5			8/31/2008 2:30:10 PM	I lost 35 lbs. being on Phentermine for 6 months, so to the poster that said her doctor would only give it to her for three, mine said 6 months max. I've been off of it since May, and I have gained back 5 lbs. Went to GNC and bought Fastin (not the prescription one, it's natural ingredients)and just take 1/2 dose. It helps as an appetite suppressant.

On the other hand, I have been on the pills for 2 weeks and I have lost all of 3 pounds! What am I doing wrong? I had the side effects, head ached and light head the 1st week, but I've been ok since. Dry mouth? Yes. I walk only about 15 minutes a day bc that's all I can endure, and I have been following a low calorie diet...why am I not seieng results?

I saw somewhere a comparison of the different types of phentrimine.  I know some of the generics are more effective than others.  I just got mine refilled at a new pharmacy and it is indeed different.  I want to know if I should be worried about the effectiveness of this new batch (I won't actually start it for a few more days).  I'm taking the 30mg capsule.  The first ones I took were blue and blue/white speckles.  These are a yellow capsule.  Any info you may have or where I could find it would be great.(been on it since July 28th.  I've lost about 10 lbs. so far)Thanks!

I am down from 224 to 160. I haven't really noticed any side effects, but I drink a lot of water anyway so I might not notice the dry mouth others have mentioned. I also changed my eating habits a great deal and I walk a very brisk 4 miles almost every day. Usually about a 51-53 minute workout. I have been really dedicated and worked to get the weight off in conjunction with the pills. My main concern is what will happen when I start to ween myself off of it in about 2 weeks. Will post an update to give others an idea of what to expect.
Overweight	4health11, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/23/2008 1:31:03 PM	Hi, I started taking this medicine on July 11, and I saw my doctor Thursday August 21 and lost 23 pounds. I am taking 37.5, half in the morning and the other half about noon. This medicine is wonderful in the fact that it gives me so much energy that I can exercise. I am lucky enough that I have a Nordic Track Eliptical it tells me how much calories and carbs that I have burned which I felt that I needed, because I put myself on a low calorie diet this helped me keep track, plus I do other exercises. I think that is how most people lost a lot of the weight is adding exercise not just changing how much they eat or the way they eat. The pill is only good enough if you are willing to change the way you eat and exercise specially if you have to lose a lot of weight, like me. I have another 25 pounds to go, but with this medicine I know I will be able to make. I drink a lot of water so I didn't experience the dry mouth, does curb the appitite so sometimes I forget to eat or just don't eat much. Thank God I don't crave the sweets, chips,fatty foods,etc. anymore. Which made it much easier to watch what I eat. For those who are really serious put yourself on a low calorie diet. Add exercise to it and put yourself on a cut off TIME. For me 5:30 no matter what time I go to bed. I eat cherrios for breakfast, turkey sandwich with mustard and banana peppers and no mayo and I have a pickle and sometimes applesauce, dinner lean cusine nothing else. Weekends a little different.

I've drank 6 water bottles a day so far while at work (the normal .5 L)and have had energy to actually workout which I did last night for the first time in MONTHS!!

Remember to eat and to workout even if it just two days a wk. i workout two - three days a wk which is cardio and strength training. i also have POC which makes it hard to lose and can be very stressful if you are eating right and working out. i belive Phentermine if taking correctly and not abuse can get you to your goal.

I lost 5 lbs. right away and then completely stopped.  I assume I wasn't eating enough and my body went into starvation mode.  So I decided to take the weekend off.  I gained one pound back but have now taken that off and am hopeing it has kicked me back in gear.  I'm going to try to make myself eat 1200 calories a day.One thing I wanted to comment on...I saw where some people took the pill 2 hrs. after breakfast instead of first thing and then eating an hour later.  I decided to try this, to see if it worked for me better.  I was too hungry to do this.  After 2 days, I went back to my old routine.  I'm hoping I will see some more results this week!  I was very frustrated, but I'm trying to refocus and not worry so much about it.  I still have 40 lbs (at least) to lose.

No problems sleeping, some constipation. I am finding that in the last couple of weeks I have become very irritable and cranky! Im considering stopping the drug for the sake of my family. I also believe that I have started having some involuntary muscle spasms (mostly while sleeping from what my husband says)and sometimes I have a hard time getting confortable.  I have used this in the past with great results and no side effects, but had only taken it for a little over a month that time.  I was about 8 yrs younger then I am now, which could be part of it. From what I have heard, some side effects come after you have been on it a while, which seems to be my case. 
Overweight	sweetone42, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/13/2008 10:34:58 PM	I have been taking this for about a week now and cannot believe the energy i have , its like a bolt of lightening. The first night i couldn't sleep but now i am ready to go . I take 1 pill in the morning and am going all day. I am redoing my house, pulling carpet and painting and this has given me the energy to stay with it, only thing is sometimes i forget to eat then when i remember i eat healthy.I am pleased with it so far, the scale says about 6 pounds but i am not sure. The one thing i don't like about it is it makes me sweat so bad and i am one who doesn't like to sweat and feel dirty,but if i get the results i want i guess sweating isn't so bad. 
Overweight	REALTORCHIC123, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/13/2008 6:48:36 PM	I was reading the posts to see what response others had to this drug because i was so pleased with it. This drug has changed my life totally. Just like anything you do in life you have to be willing to work for results. When I first start taking this in June 08 I weighed 218 pounds every one always sd how good I looked because I'm a Realtor I have to dress very nice. The thing people didnt know was I was good at covering up my problems areas I was so unhappy on the inside because I tried so many fads along with exercise sometimes I didnt even eat. I gained alot of weight with the work I do being on the go and just eating fast food. I have changed my life totally instead I opt for fruit and yogurt as my breakfast and or lunch. I drink plenty of water as well. You can nix in a salad or if I eat out I always get something grilled and ask for a to go box and save 1/2 for lunch the following day. If you make a few changes in your diet it does get easier to make healthy choices. To date I have lost 30 pounds not 2 mention the inches off my arms,hips and waist. I can wear a size 11/12now which is great because I was in a size 14/16.My target weight goal is to get to a healthy 150. I did this a clinical trial for a six month program which will be completed in November. Im taking it one day at a time but to those who are condering the drug dont just take the pill and expect results please try to change your eating habits even if its a small change and try to exercise for at least 30 min a day. Its very hard to fit exercise in my busy day so I walk for 30 minutes on my treadmill when I first wake up and run up and down the steps for like 5minutes to get my metabolism up. I even invested in a dog which is great because I can go to the park to walk and run my pet.The only side effect I had was pretty much like every one else it will be hard to sleep for the 1st week and you will have dry mouth for a week or so. Other than that the results out weigh these side effects. Good Luck

Overweight	Mike, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	25-34	8/13/2008 4:28:34 AM	Just started Phentermine 37.5mg on 8/7, i'm taking 1/2 tablet every morning before breakfast. I'm really enjoying the increased energy and waking up refreshed not tired or cranky. I experienced insomnia the first night but after the second and onwards it was normal again. I did sweat more sometimes i felt dizzy probably because of the lack of food i been taking in- sometimes 1 meal a day, but i try to fit in 5 tiny meals a day when possible. so far i lost 3lbs but its probably just water weight because i've been drinking lots of water.

But the outcome has been better then the dry mouth and anxiety (moving constantly).  I have been taking it for a month and have lost 12 pounds.  I can't wait to see what the next month holds. 
Overweight	LEX, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	8/10/2008 6:53:07 PM	To the person who is taking Cymbalta with phentermine - DON'T!  I began having issues, did research on the net and found out that the two combined have caused deaths!  I was forced to get my Cymbalta from mail order due to insurance, the script I got from the endocrinologist I filled at a local pharmacy- THAT'S WHY IT WASN'T CAUGHT!  Dr. said he was sorry, didn't catch the error, meanwhile I thought I was having a heart attach, and could have permanent damage.  I take Prozac with Phentermine - hope this helps!  CALL UR DR!
Overweight		5	5	4			8/10/2008 3:55:04 PM	I have taken this beofre in the past and lost a lot of weight and feel like I am slowly putting weight on again. I started on the pills 4 days ago and already lost 3 lbs. Definitely agree with everyone about the dry mouth. Also please be careful...this medicine can change your perception so much that you forget to eat. Definitely make sure you are eating regularly. I also had another scary side effect which is extreme dizziness. I will monitor this and may even cut my dosage in half if it gets too much. Lastly...watch out for the mood changes! Good luck and remember to still eat regularly and drink a lot.
Overweight	readson, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	55-64	8/10/2008 10:41:47 AM	Have been on this med since Aug 2, 2008. Have no side effects at all.I had read here that there were so many side effects so I went back to the pharmicist to ask if the pill had been on the shelf to long. He told me I am in the 5-10% of individuals who will have no side effects. I do find my appetite has decreased. I eat a small breakfast , take my pill 2 hrs after, have fruit for lunch, and barely eat dinner. Have not weighed myself since I have started. I will wait another week before I weigh in. I really hope to see a some weight loss. Keeping my fingers crossed.
Overweight	It's Me!,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female		8/10/2008 9:14:12 AM	Okay, updating...I'm extremely frustrated!  When I first started taking this, I lost 5 pounds right away.  I haven't lost anything else the last week and a half.  I'm not eating a lot, but I'm not losing either.  This is what I do when I'm not taking anything....lose a little, then stop.  I still need to lose 40 lbs.!  What do I do?  I didn't take it yesterday and I'm not taking it today, just to give myself a little break and hopefully a &quot;do over&quot;.  I'm hopeing that when I start back on Monday, I'll see a restart.  Anybody have an experience like this?  If so what did you do?
Overweight	30by30, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	8/9/2008 4:25:42 PM	I have been satisfied so far.  I have lost about 4 lbs so far.  I need to lose 30 by Dec. 19th.  My 30th Bday!  I started on 8/2 and the first night I was wired.  I learned that if I take it earlier in the morning it has worn off enough at night for me to sleep.  I have experienced increased energy and lack of an appetite. The only real complaint I have is extremely dry mouth.  I have to have something to drink or gum at all times.

Overweight	LAL, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	8/8/2008 9:34:53 PM	After leveling out - worked like a charm.  It does constipate me, along with dry mouth.  The trick is to start exercising immediately when it first gives you that energy or you will level out and not have that same energy level.  Does work in reducing appetite and making some things unappealing, especially soda (cokes, etc).

Overweight	DG1980, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	8/8/2008 11:46:29 AM	I started taking Phentermine 37.5 on July 31st and so far I have lost around 6lbs. The first night, I had a hard time going to sleep but it has been better since. I wake up in the morning feeling refreshed. The biggest side effect for me has been the dry mouth, I drink around 15-20 bottles of water a day. I was a big soda drinker before, but now when I drink one they taste too sweet. I took a break from the pill yesterday and felt a little lost, but my appetite was starting to increase again and I was afraid the pill wasn't working. When I ate dinner at Subway last night is when I knew that it is, my usual sandwich made me sick... way too much sauce and I could only eat about 2/3 of it after raking all the sauce out. So far I am happy with this pill, I just really hope it works and is not hard to stop taking.
Overweight	Jenn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	8/7/2008 9:20:04 PM	I started taking Phentermine 6 days ago.  Experienced very dry mouth, insominia and a bit hyper the first few days and it got better.  Then, suddenly today, I experienced very strange breathing problems (something wierd in my chest) along with weakness and anxious. It scared me. I feel better tonight but still do not feel right. I will not continue with this medication. I must loose weight the healthy way.  This is simply not worth it.... 
Overweight	It's Me!, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	8/7/2008 8:43:38 PM	For the person below that just started today...I didn't notice a decrease in my appetite for a few days...about the same time the other symptoms stopped.  I now don't get hungry and even when I am, it's a lot easier to fight the urge to eat too much or something I shouldn't be eating.  Give it time, it will probably kick in in a few days...slowly, you may not even realize it at first.  It sort of snuck up on me.I've been on it a week and a half.  I lost 5 lbs. right away (like in 5 days) but haven't lost any more, even though I'm not eating much.  I'm hoping the scales move again soon, because this is exactly what I do when I'm dieting without any help...lose a bit and then stop.Anyway, just thought I would answer your question.

Overweight	Snacker, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	8/7/2008 2:22:39 PM	In late December I began taking this medication and stopped after 6 weeks. I have polycystic ovaries and simply could not shed weight from diet and exercise alone. Combined with exercise, 6 SMALL meals a day and a diabetic's diet - no sugar! I went from 238lbs to 155lbs. Roughly 2-3 pounds a week. After 5 weeks I personally decided to wean myself off because I felt it had in fact &quot;kick started&quot; my metabolism and I could handle the rest on my own. The drug made me very energetic in the AM, but truly helped me understand when I was full.

It is great I have been taking it for 2 months and have lost 21.5 lbs. The catch is I get my rx from the Dr's office. Another person I went with to their rx to the pharm and their pill looks different and is different. There are several forms to this pill and per my Dr he says the FDA only requires manufactures to be within 30% of the name brand. That is a huge difference. The yellow I take has Lannett 1310 on it.

I was confused because I was exercising and changed my eating habits.  I returned the pharmacy to inquire about the drug to make of the expirations date.  They said they several complaints that they were not as effective as the other brands.  Tney have reorder from a different company.  The pill is pale green alost a blue with speckles.  This is a first day taking them I will keep you updated.  They have 50/30 on one side and they are by Quality test.  Is anyone familiar with that brand?

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	8/3/2008 10:48:09 AM	Hi, I too have the pills with the labeled 273. I took this drug one time before filled it at CVS. The ones at CVS are more expensive and they are shaped differently. I think the grocery stores and small town pharmacy get theirs from the same MFC. The pills with 273 does not work as good as the others from my prosepective. I lost my energy after the third day and the appetite picked up a little. But...according to the scale I have lost eight pounds in a week..so I am going to see how it turns out at the end of the month. Will let you know! If I feel that I need to go back to the more expensive one..I will. I did call CVS to ask them about the different MFC. From what the Pharmacy told me it is still the same pill just diferent MFC. She said by law/FDA no drug store can sell anything less than what the presciption say!

Overweight	It's Me!, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	8/1/2008 5:29:17 PM	I just posted a few days ago, but thought I would update.  Almost all my side effects disappeared after the 2nd day (even the good one of extra energy!). I do have maybe a little dry mouth, but not like before.  I do wish the energy thing had stayed with me! LOL  I'm also not having any trouble sleeping as I did the first night.  Since I started on Monday I have lost 5 lbs.  I can feel a difference in a few of my clothes that were getting too snug, but now fit again.  I think this has curbed some of my cravings and snacking habits, but, unlike others, I have no problem eating. I could still put it away if wanted to.  Which makes me wonder how much this is ACTUALLY doing for me.  I had already modified my eating habits before starting.  However, I had come to a standstill on weight loss (after only 8 lbs) and now I'm down 5 lbs. more so I guess it's doing something!  I'm going to stick with it.Blessings to all of you!

My doctor put me on 15MG since she wanted to monitor how the pills will effect me. Honestly I am neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. I am haven't weighed myself but my clothes do feel a bit looser. I am 5'4 and weigh 248, hefty I know but I am more solid than jiggly...But aside from the cotton mouth I am not really experiencing any side effects. I guess the only reason that I am not completely satisfied is b/c the pill hasn't actually given me a boost in energy, I am pretty much the same as before....I do want to know however if anyone is on psych meds and taking the phentermine at the same time...I am on 300mg of Lamictal for Bipolar and I just want some feedback please feel free to e-mail me...amia2025@hotmail.com

Overweight	It's Me!, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	7/29/2008 1:18:40 PM	This is a continuation of my last of my last post....(right before or after this one depending on how you are viewing them)..I have family members that have used it, lost weight, gained it back and told me they wouldnt do it again, but I want to be thinner again.  My husband never makes me feel bad about my weight, but I know he would love it if I looked more like I use to..mostly so I would stop whining about being fat and looking terrible!  He loves me no matter what!  When we started dating I was a size 1!  Im now a 16/18.  I need to lose about 50 lbs.  Hubby doesnt want me to get down under about 140.  Ill be happy to see that number again (160 looks good to me at this point!) but if I can lose more I want to.  My ideal range (according to the charts) is 104-139, I think 104 would be too small, but I wouldnt mind around 125 to 130!  It seems like such a long way to go.  That first 20 will make all the difference in the world though!  I would love to have a chat buddy if anybody has an experience like mine and would like to go through it together OR if you HAD an experience like mine and are in the maintaining without drugs stage.  I can be reached at sidandbell@bellsouth.net  Blessings to all!
Overweight	It's Me!, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	5	3	Female	35-44	7/29/2008 12:15:10 PM	Hi!  I just started Phentermine yesterday, so I've taken two doses.  I'm on the 30mg. capsules.  I have a 3-month supply, but if I do well, my Dr. may prescribe it again.  I have cottonmouth (of course) and lots of energy.  My eyes feel a little funny, maybe an indication of an increase in blood pressure?  Ill monitor my pressure any time I go somewhere that I can measure it.  I normally dont like water (I have cut out soda, and sweet tea, but I still drink water with crystal light type stuff added) but I have noticed that water tastes better to me now, so hopefully I can get off the artificial sweeteners as well.  I did have a little trouble with sleep last night, but nothing I cant live with.  I havent found the time for exercise yet, but really want to.  If I cant figure it in before school starts back, I will at least be able to at that point (right after I drop off the kids).  I obviously cant critique the drug yet, but Im hopeful.  I was thin growing up, but gained weight as I got older (milestones - marriage, birth of first child, then second, miscarriage, and then third child).  Ive never been able to lose more than 30 lbs. on my own and I havent even been able to do that in years (before my last child).  Im 37 (approaching 38 quickly), Im 53 and I weigh about 179 (I started at 187, lost a little on my own, then got stuck and started getting sad again and knew binging and giving up was heading quickly in my direction).  My Dr. prescribed this to me in early May, but at the time I was still nursing my youngest AND scared to try a drug for my weight loss.  I told him I would take the Rx with me and think about it.  Well, Im no longer nursing, hubby and I have decided we are done having babies and I was not making it on my own, so yesterday I had the Rx filled and started it.  Im hopeful but also nervous.  I dont want to mess up my body and Im scared about gaining back when I go off of it, BUT nothing else has worked, so Im giving it a try!  I

Overweight	tdoh3@msn.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	5	3	Female	45-54	7/25/2008 4:51:30 PM	Today was week 2 for me on Phentermine and I lost 4lbs.  I am kind of disappointed reading all of your success.  However, I know that losing it slow will keep it off longer.  I don't have the great burst of energy that everyone has nor do I have the dry mouth.  I never ate breakfast and now I do, I eat a healthy lunch and dinner also. I keep a journal of everything I eat.  I walk on the treadmill everyday for 10 min. have a foot problem so I can't over do it.  I hope that as time goes by this is going to kick in high gear and I will see some better results.  Any suggestions please email me at tdoh3@msn.com, please put phentermine in the comment line.  Thanks for listening.
Overweight	KISS..keep it simple silly!!, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	7/23/2008 9:09:28 PM	I have been on this medication for 1 month and a week and have lost 18 pounds. I work in EMS and find that it gives me extra energy throughout the day. The key to the medication is to DRINK LOTS OF WATER!!! You get dry mouth because you aren't drinking enough. Anything that is designed to increase your heart rate and decrease you food intake is going to demand more energy from your body. Metabolism is your body creating energy. If you creat more you there for need more. You can't think that maintaining your normal water intake will cut it. More Fluids(not a diet coke either) Also you may not feel hungry but if you don't eat you will get a nervous shakey feeling. Eat a small portion of fruit or veggies maybe a energy bar. This will cut down on the feelings and also will cut down on the headaches. Your stomache will have something else to do besides hurt and make you feel bad. You are getting headaches because your body is use to being fed a certain amount. If you stop feeding your body, the brain is going to react to make you think to eat..IE the headache..Also the side effect of high blood pressure can also cause a headache. Increase your red blood cells increase the amount of pressure it takes to move them around the body. I find that if I have a bad heahache eating a small healthy snack and one Aleve does the trick. I haven't noticed this but some have stated they are having issues with constipation. DRINK WATER..also keep in mind if you are cutting back in the amount of food you are putting into your mouth or the quality of food, it will effect the amount that is elimanated. The less you put in the less you get out and the more the body uses to produce energy. Issues with sleeping are simple...burn the enegy your body is producing..walking,jogging,swimming. Get your butt active burning enegy leads to sleeping better at night and cut back on the coffee. You don't need the jolt if you are already taking medication that gives you the jolt, your just doubling up!!
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	35-44	7/23/2008 5:22:31 PM	It helped me to not eat but I started to get sick from not eating.  I tried to just stop it after 3 weeks and had some issues with deperession/anxiety/and lack of energy. I would say DON'T take this if you have any mood disorder.  It really messes with the emotions and other meds.
Overweight	rebreps, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	7/23/2008 5:15:49 PM	As of 6 weeks ago, I weighed in at 239 pounds.  I am working out (30-50 minutes of cardio) every other day and have completely changed my eating habits.  Granted I am also taking Phendimetrazine (another weight loss pill) and Hydrochlorothiazide (water pill) I am not down to 209 pounds.  The medication of the additional 2 pills really doesn't show much as far as side effects.  The Phentermine does give me terrible cotton mouth which then leads to incredibly bad breath.  Drinking plenty of water and always having mints in my pocket really helps.  I need to slim down to 180 and will try to stop the pills cold turkey.  All in all nothing negative to report.  I just wish I knew the strength of the pills.  The Phentermine I am taking is a capsule, clear on half and a royal blue on the other half.  Little white amd blue balls on the inside.  The Phendimetrazine is simply a small round blue pill and the Hydrochlorothiazide is a very small round pinkish pill.
Overweight	caregiver, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	5	3	Female	45-54	7/23/2008 12:51:07 PM	I have been on this med for 3 weeks.  1st wk I lost 4.5 lbs, 2nd gained 1, 3rd lost 5 lbs.  I feel shaky on the inside but not seen on the outside.  VERY dry mouth but no other side effects.  I expected more weight loss but slow is good.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	7/22/2008 8:46:28 AM	I started taking phentramine 7/1/08 and have lost 15 lbs.  I watch my caloric intake and walk only 3 times a week because I have strange work hours.  So far everything is good, only side effect is dry mouth, but that has helped in my water consumption.  I never take a pill after 2pm otherwise I have trouble sleeping. 
Overweight	b, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/21/2008 9:46:11 PM	I have been on phentermine for 4 1/2 months and have lost 105 lbs.  My doctor wants me to lose another 75, but my goal is another 100. The only side effect I have had is dry mouth.  It's important to keep in mind that while this drug curbs appetite, it is your responsibility to maintain a low calorie diet and exercise.  When I started I only ate 600 calories a day and walked for 30 min/day 5 days/week.  I have now increased to running 45 min a day 5 days a week and weight lifting for 45 min a day 4 days a week. When I increased my exercise routine, I increased my caloric intake to between 700-900 calories a day.  I'm not advocating that anyone else cut calories to this extreme, but merely trying to state that eating less volume of food does not equal eating less calories.  Also, once the weight is off, my doctor has said that it's a good idea to have a red flag weight, which is usually 5-10 lbs more than your goal.  My goal is 160 (I'm 6'1&quot;, so that's a healthy weight)and my red flag weight will be 165-170.  I'll weigh myself once a week and if i get above that red flag weight, I'll know that I need to immediately start working out more and eating less to ensure that I don't become obese again. 
Overweight	hbedelman, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	7/19/2008 9:53:18 AM	This is my second time taking phentermine.  I could not stand the 37.5 mg tab...heart racing, fuzzy head, &amp; headaches.  A week ago I started 1/2 a pill, joined Weight Watchers, and sweat for 15-20 min. per day on elliptical as per my doctor's orders.  It is a perfect plan for me while the phentermine curbs my appetite I'm eating healthier portion-controlled food and getting support.  My clothes fit better already and I have more energy.  For occasional headaches I take Fiorcet and it nips it right away.  I want to lose 30 lbs. and I just know this time the overall plan is working!!  With this med, I'm up earlier but that's a good thing.  hbedelman@yahoo.com if you have any questions.  P.S. You MUST wean yourself off this drug slowly as you MAY have depression symptoms for a short period...it happened to me...no fun! Also, thanks for the advice of taking the pill every other day.  After 2-3 months on the 1/2 pill, that's what I plan to do.  Good luck everyone!  
Overweight	giantsgirl85, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	7/17/2008 5:00:51 PM	I took it for about 2 1/2 months and lost 20 pounds! I didn't start out too heavy (164 pounds) so I didn't expect it to work so quickly and effectively. I took it every day for the first 2 months, then cut back to 1/2 pill a day for a few weeks, and now I just take it sporadically about once a week or so. I have kept the weight off for 3 months but I am continuing to watch what I eat and am exercising regularly (which you must do in combination with this pill!) It definitely helps jump start the weight loss and the side effects aren't bad at all. I have recommended this pill to friends who have had success, as well.
Overweight	mrsmlbaron27, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	7/17/2008 6:45:40 AM	I started taking this medication on 7/14/2008 so far I have lost 4lbs . I have found eating breafast and then having the 100 calorie packs or the special K cereal bar really helps and I eat alot of fruit and veggies so far I have lost 4lbs. I have noticed that my pupils are dialated and I have a headache sometimes. I have also noticed that I sometimes feel anxious. I have had some trouble with sleeping. I am going to keep with this pill and see what happens I want to be able to go into a store and not have to look for the fat girl clothes. I have 2 daughters and I want to show them a confident woman and being fat makes me want to hide and that's not good. My goal is 100lbs. I weighed 222lbs at the begining of the week and today is Thursday and I have lost 4lbs.

Other	willsrus, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	7/15/2008 2:17:03 PM	I started taking Phentermine a week ago Monday and took Sunday off, mostly due to feeling very tired, and I have not lost a pound. I haven't been eating much, but have been eating. I haven't worked out as often as I was because I feel fainthearted when I do much physical activity. I do like the medication and hope it works, but I have seen no results even though I am strictly watching my caloric intake. Any suggestions? Why am I not losing weight?

The only side affect I have is in the morning I feel sick to my stomach, weak feeling. I do have more energy to do things, once I start something I can finish now. Sometime its hard to fall asleep, but I noticed its so easy to get up in the mornings. I'm going to try to do more exercises so I can shed these pounds off. Anyone have any good advice please share, I would love to hear.

I fell fuzzy, my face/neck feels bloated, could not sleep last night at all.  I am now on day 2 and I do not have that boost of energy like everyone else does.  I have no desire to eat but I force myself to.  Other than that I am eager to see the outcome.  I want to lose at least 80lbs.  Any advice would be appreciated.  If you would like to email me my address is tdoh3@msn.com.  Please put Phentermine on the comment line other wise if I don't know you I won't open it. Thanks in advance.
Overweight	Tam, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	7/11/2008 12:00:58 PM	I started June 7th on this pill.  I took the 15mg for one week.  I felt a little fuzzy at first but then it was better.  I then was to start taking the 37.5mg pill, which I did for one day and felt awful.  My head was full feeling, terrible headache and I could not sleep, so I quit taking.  I just restarted taking the 15mg pill on 7/8/08.  I actually feel hungier when I take the pill.  Seems odd to me after reading other reviews.  To date I have lost a little over 11 lbs.  I'm not sure the pill helps me, I may try the 37.5mg again once I go back to the Dr. next week.  I am also on a 1200 calorie diet.  I have actually been eating less, but see not much weight loss.  Does anyone have any comments or suggestions?

Overweight	ItsPBJtime, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	7/10/2008 3:18:34 PM	I have been taking this medicine since 6/23/2008 and have lost about 13 lbs already (today is 7/10/2008).  The first day I took it, I felt VERY weird and experienced numbness in my arms, legs, and face.  The only side effect I am experiencing now that I believed is linked to this is dry mouth/bad taste.  My food cravings have shifted in a much healthier direction and I am not constantly hungry.  I only had a one month prescription since I am not classified as overweight so hopefully these lb's don't come back!

Overweight	stephanierb, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/9/2008 6:19:45 AM	started 4/29 on 15mg 2x/day.(capsule) did that for 2 months. the first 2 weeks were hell. i took a 3 day break from it and when i started again it has been great every since. the key is to EAT! eat something. it dont work well if you dont eat. i learned that the hard way. i now eat something even when i dont have any desire to. on 6/23 i started the 37.5 once a day.(white pill with blue dots) i cant take that much of a dosage at once so i break in half and take in morning and afternoon. i am 5'8 and started at 180.i just weighed and am down to 159 (21 lbs) and very happy. do have the dry mouth a little but the biggest side effect for me is the anxiousness. i notice after my afternoon dose i have a bit of racing thoughts and talk alot. i am normally a thinker anyway so this just magnifies it i think. i am having a sleep issue but have a lot of stress in my life so it is a combination of both im sure. i guess what i cant stress enough is to eat even when you are not hungry and have no desire, my dr told me the pill cant work if you dont eat. as to excercise, unfortunantly i dont do any other then my normal running around with 2 kid in sports.also in the first month i didnt lose as much as i thought i would but i have started seeing the results in the last month and a half! if you start to see a slow down of progress, back off it for a few days (like the weekend) and start it back up. i have done that a few times and i cant wait for the next 10 lbs to go!!!!!
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	7/8/2008 12:45:08 PM	I've only been taking Phentermine for 4 days now so I hardly feel qualified to 'review' this drug. I came to this site in search of information about side effects, though, and have found reading these posts quite interesting, encouraging, and helpful. I see a lot of mention of dry mouth, which I'm not experiencing. However, I've had a persistent, dull headache since taking it, and haven't slept well either. I take it first thing in the morning and wonder if anyone else has this difficulty? My work life is currently very stressful and there was a recent death in my family, as well. It's hard to know if this is the drug, or if I'd be sleeping poorly anyhow. Despite these things, I'm happy to say that in just a few days I have noticed a difference, not only in the scale, but in my eating habits. My hunger is very controlled and I'm satisfied more easily than the bingeing I've been doing lately!   
Overweight	buttercup, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/8/2008 1:29:04 AM	I have been on 37.5 for about a year and lost 30 pounds. Side effects for me at the start was edgy, hyper, mean &amp; headaches. This was on the generic, when I changed to Name Brand, things were a lot different. After 3 months, I went back to generic and now I ask the pharmacist to make sure new, fresh pills are in the bottle. The older ones, sitting on shelf for a while tend to be ineffective and cause headaches. Also I had to get on a Blood Pressure med to regulate that issue, well, it was either that or divorce...lol, anyway, very hard decision! lol, okay, well good luck to all and my cardiologist says with 30 pounds lost in a year, to keep going until the next 30 is off and then stop after reaching goal.

I've been off a month. Have lost no more weight, but I haven't gained any either. I'm in my 50's and lost libido w/menopause at 48. I read where someone said it's &quot;legalized speed.&quot; Well, wish some doctor would figure out how to make it into a women's viagra, LOL. It really worked, now I'm back to blah, but at least I haven't gained any back yet. I am very careful of what I eat, portions esp. that's how I lost it w/Phen b/c I ate maybe 1/4 of what I used to.
Overweight	corona, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	7/7/2008 8:19:36 AM	I just started this on July 4th. I have read in here for Adipex and the generic phentermine. If you go to pill.com you can see the differnt types and strengths. Also there is a list of all drugs that it is known to interact with. I too, have dry mouth and a nagging headache. I was told to take half a pill at breakfast and half at lunch. I see here it says to take whole pill 1 hour before or two hours later. Just makes me wonder. I have noticed I do not munch or need to munch all the time. I am doing 1200 cal a day with this. Not sure if it is the pill or my will power but it hasn't been hard to stick toit so far. Any ideas about the dosage, please reply.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/3/2008 10:41:20 PM	I started takeing the medication on 6/7/2008 and I have lost 10 pounds so far. I finally found something that works for me. I don't feel jittery like other weight loss pills, i feel energized. I am 20 pounds from my goal and I know that I will make it there. I have dry mouth, but water solves that. I would recommend this med to anyone who is struggling to lose weight.
Overweight	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/30/2008 10:33:51 PM	I have been over weight most of my life. I gained about 30lbs. after my son pass away 06/06. Then 02/08 I found out I have fibromyalgia. I was put on Lyrica. Gained 10lbs. the first week then another 10 over the next few weels. My PCP gave me the Phentermine 37.5 in mid March and it has helped so much. I haven't lost any weight but the Lyrica made me want to eat everything in site. It was crazy the amount of food I wanted. The Lyrica also made me sleepy. The Phentermine balances out the side affects of the Lyrica. With out Lyrica I wouldn't be working or anything. So 2 thumbs up for Phentermine. Hopefully I will lose some weight.
Overweight	CadTechLV, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	6/29/2008 1:56:31 PM	Im a 41yr old male 62 327 lbs. I started taking this med 37.5 mg on April 16, I have dropped 46 pounds and feel wonderful. I have lost weight in the past, but found it much more difficult. This med takes the edge and cravings out in the late afternoon and also gives me just a bit extra energy. Im doing light exercise along with my normal active work schedule. Its necessary for me to remind myself to eat and snack to keep my metabolism efficient. It has increased my blood pressure a few points, so we had to up the dosage on BP med. Worth it though, being 100 lbs. overweight is the main cause of the slightly elevated BP anyway. Weight loss was dramatic at first, now Im dropping about 2-3 pounds a week, which is still quick. Only side effect was food tasted a little different and the dry mouth. But, that encouraged me to drink more water, which I needed to do anyway, so its kind of a good thing. Dr put me on Topamax also, that made be very forgetful and unable to focus, which already having ADD made things worse. I stopped taking the Topamax after 2 weeks, but was &amp; still am losing weight. Overall very satisfied with this med. Good luck to you, hope you have as great of results as Im experiencing.

I was always a chubby kid and had bad eating habits. Then when I was 19 my weight had hit 226 lbs. I was mortified, then my doctor prescribed phentermine to me everything got so much easier. I had energy and I wasn't craving food all the time.I'm 22 now and weigh 132 lbs. Thanks to the drug, I got the weight down and learned how to keep a healthy life style. I couldn't be happier!!! 
Overweight	hayn73, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	3	Male	25-34	6/19/2008 5:50:57 AM	In short this pill works wonders but I would like to know if anyone has experienced side effects such as nausea, headaches, fatigue, mood swings that include going from anger to depression and lack of motivation and energy.  I have only been taking this medication for 2 weeks but would like to know if anyone out there has experienced any of these side effects?  If so, did symptoms get better over time or did you have to quit taking medication?  I think this medication is amazing but having a hard time adjusting to constant headaches as well as severe mood swings.  Also, some days focus seems to be super human and other days I can't seem to focus on anything.  Some days I have high energy and can accomplish multiple tasks and projects and other days I feel tired and can't motivate myself to get anything done.  Also, since this medication keeps my appetite in check I was hoping my weight loss would be dramatic considering my workout regiment.  Once again, I feel energized on some days at the gym while other days I feel very weak and lack motivation.  I have been trying to track my nutrition, diet and workout plan.  Currently I have made minor adjustments in my diet (eating smaller meals 6-8 times a day) and nutrition (trying not to mix high energy supplements like ultimate orange with medication).  If anyone can offer some advice or share their experiences it would be much appreciated.  Thanks.

I started 3/12/08 - 5 days on, 2 days off ( 2nd day off is the hardest to control eating - I try snacking on fresh fruit, drink water, crystal light or weak tea with sweetener.) I also have the dry mouth. Two weeks later I lost 10 lbs. I moved to my mother's house (5 hours away) spent the next 4 1/2 weeks taking care of her before she passed away. It was more of a challenge losing weight - she wanted to eat restaurant meals instead of nursing home food (they have delicious homebaked cookies, brownies and muffins 3 times a day &amp; there was fresh fruit, juices, &amp; lots of iced tea too).  But I did manage to lose another 5 pounds while there. I also take a thyroid pill upon waking, an hour later phentermine capsule, &amp; eat 1 to 2 hrs later. I never was much on eating after waking, so I don't feel hungry in the mornings, &amp; I have to remind myself to eat.I try my hardest to do without breads, potatoes, sweets. Breakfast is a glass of juice &amp; a Special K breakfast bar. Lunch &amp; snacks are Yoplait Whips or hard boiled egg, fresh fruit, veggies. I fix a glass of chocolate flavor slim fast for lunch or dinner (for husband &amp; me it was baked or crockpot chicken or ground turkey meat as hamburgers without bun or fish and veggies)...sometimes 1 cup each 1% milk and cheerios and 1/2 cup strawberries half hour before bedtime. (My system seems to lose weight more if I have milk &amp; cheerios before bedtime.)Yesterday was my birthday - I am proud to say I have maintained a 20 lb weight loss (4 inches off my midriff area, 2 inches off hips - only lost 1 inch around my waist - guess that's where I need to do more exercises.) I like weighing every morning &amp; night to see gain or loss - then I am able to control eating &amp; exercising the next day. I've only taken 40 capsules in 3 months. A good kickstart for my hypothroidism weight loss - challenge is keeping it off, losing 40 more, and maintaining. Good luck everyone.

Having only lost 8 pounds, I'm kind of sad that it hasn't produced better results. I'm up to running almost 2 miles a day and eatting healthy so the problem is somewhere in my head.  My Dr. and I are going to try combining it with Topomax now though, and hopefully that will get us the results we're aiming for.  I gave it 3 stars for east of use because having to take it a half hour before breakfast is hard sometimes because I want to get up and have breakfast right away, which you really can't do with this.  Good luck to everyone!

It is somewhat my fault not more since I was off it for about 3 months between here and then. Also Phentermine does come in different colors and sizes depending on who you purchase it thru it is typically a capsule form. Each pharmacy has a different provider that creates this generic drug. So color/size, lettering ect may vary. If in doubt check out pill.com if you can give it color size and lettering and numbers on side of pill they can identify it for you.

I lost weight.  Had zero appetite and mega energy. I convienced my dr to give me another perscription so i can get some of my excess weight off. I have an inactive thyroid and take high doses of medication to increase that but still my metabolism is very low.I take phentermine every other day because of the side effects I experience: inability to sleep at night and/or interrupted sleep, irratiabilitynauseavomiting.  The vomiting &amp; nausea had been so severve at one point that i needed an IV to replenish fluids!  Be careful with this drug,  There is no such thing as an easy way to loose weight.  It all begins and ends with excercise and portion control!!!

Has anyone heard of this?  The first time I got it filled I got a long oval pill with dark blue specs and the second time I got a fat oval pill that has light blue specs.

Overweight		5	5	5			5/26/2008 7:25:53 PM	I've been taking this since october '07. I've lost 45 pounds so far with no exercise. I have 2 kids and i teach 4 year olds, so that prob counts as exercise. It has drastically reduced my appetite. I take the 37.5 mg tabs once a day. I only get mine refilled every month and a half bc i dont take it every day. Dont want to become dependent on it. I usually take it wed - sat, weigh sun morn, and watch my portions sun-tues. Has been working really well for me. I'm happy, husband's happy, and dr.'s happy, so as long as it keeps working and he keeps refilling it, i'm taking it. I like it bc weight comes off very gradually instead of all at once. The longer it takes to lose it, the longer you can keep it off. No jitters, insomnia, or any other wierd side effects. Little bit of dizziness first couple weeks after that, nothing. I would def recommend giving it a try.

When I first started taking it, my appetite was really small. And within 6months, I had lost 60lbs. But after taking it for so long, it no longer decreases your appetite. And just eventullay stops working. And when you stop, the weight stays off for a few weeks and then starts to come back. So I guess, when it is time for you to get off of this drug, start taking the Alli, which keeps your body from digesting fat. Look it up. That, there is no time frame that you have to be off of it by. Phentermine is great, but results don't last, so plan for hard exercise and a major change in activity and what you eat. I am starting over, but I am using Alli. My dr would not let me have anymore, and yours probably won't either, so don't get too used to it. And if your Doc let's you go over 6 months, you don't have a very good doctor and they are not concerned about your healt. My dr made me sign a paper stating I would be dismissed from her practice if I asked for more. That's how bad it is for you to be on longer than recommended. My recommendation is, use it for your boost to drop mega lbs, then switch to Alli, so it doesn't come back. Or start taking Alli now and keep taking after stopping the phentermine. Good luck!!

I have been taking it for 2 weeks and lost 10 pounds.  The doctor had me on 15mg twice a day and because after several days I was starving, he now gives me 30mg in the am and 15mg at night. I don't want my body to get used to it so soon, so I only take the 30mg by 12pm. I still a burst of energy. I have been working out 5 to 6 days and week. I have a month supply so I hope this works for me. I have been struggling for 2 years with my extra 50 pounds.

I went from a size 5 to a 20 (135 to 275lbs)! Well I went from 275 to 235lbs on my own but stopped And no matter how much I exercised, if i ate anything (even healthy foods)I wouldn't lose weight... The doc said I just needed a jump start and in 16 days I have lost 20lbs and I am eating! I stuck to his suggestion of no simple carbs, TONS of veggies, avoid dairy, no caffaine or soda, lean meat and no sugar.. Its been easy because I haven't been craving sweets and when I do actually get hungry (i have to force myself to eat meals) I snack on veggie sticks and a smidge of light ranch... A friend of mine recommended it to me cause she dropped 60lbs in 3 months and has kept it off... BUT I am also getting an amino acid injection (Lipo-B) once a week to keep from building a tolerance to phentermine... Here's a good article on phentermine...http://phenterminereport.com/
Overweight	Jerzey, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/13/2008 6:09:47 PM	This is my 3rd or 4th time being on adipex since 2002. Each time I took it it worked for me. The first time I took it in 2002, I lost 40 ponds in 3 months. At that time I was on a 1300/day calorie diet and I excersized regularly. Then I got pregnant! Go figure,LOL, So the following year I used it again but it was much more sporadic and I didn't excersize as often and I still lost about 10 pounds in a 3 month period. Last year I got married, and I wanted to lose some weight I had gained before the wedding so I tried it again and I was able to lose 20 pounds just with taking the pill and minimum-moderate excersize. So it does work. It's an appetite suppresent and a metobolic booster. Definitly take it as early in the day as possible because I found if I take it late, it keeps me up. If you are just starting  would also take it every other day for the first week, so your body slowly builds up to tolerating it. If you have the tabs, I would also consider cutting the tabs in half to start out. Great drug, but it does not work alone, You have to try and work with it, Minimum you should be drinking a ton of water daily and try and at least do  some sort of excersize, wether it's daily walks or a treadmill 3x per week. Oh sidenote...whenever I was on this pill and tried to eat junkfood &quot;Mcdonalds&quot; I got instantly sick. (diarhea) I would stay away from fast food. Hope this review helps! Good Luck!

I pay $105 for 2 weeks. I do loose the weight but gain it back.

If so, when do you take the phentermine? I've begun taking my HCTZ at least 1hour before the phentermine. Have you lost any weight on the phentermine while taking your B/P meds?
Overweight	Marti, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	5/7/2008 9:52:36 AM	I do high blood pressure; also being monitored. What I'm experiencing is a bright red flush on my face after exercising in the morning. I walk approximately 40 minutes each day with a pretty good pace.  This morning my pressure was taken and it was 128/92 with a pulse rate of 91. (That was taken 30 minutes after my walk.)  I am on meds for the pressure and well as HTZ for a diuretic.  Is the red flush on my face normal?  I am concerned about my pressure and don't want to risk my heart health with a pill in order to lose a few pounds.  Can someone just give me some advice, please?  Thanks!

I am hypertensive, but well controlled and monitored by my MD. I am aware of the hypertensive effects of this drug. I'm curious if it is because of this effect that i'm not getting the results that many of you are getting here. Is anyone else out there hypertensive (on meds)and not seeing results? When do you take your blood pressure med and when do you take the phentermine? Please help!

I think this medicine is great.. I definatly have alot more to lose, around 30-40 more.. I won't stop until I reach my goal!! I just wish I would of found this med. sooner.. :) and I hope to keep it off when I'm done taking it. And for timmysmom congrats on your weight loss and also, I had a friend who went to a weight loss clinic about 10years ago, when she came to a stand still one of the docs suggested eating 1 apple every 2 hours and no more than 8 in one day.... nothing else.. your only suppose to do this for 1 day.. and it is suppose to kick start your body into losing weight again...of course u can have water to.. I have not tried this yet but I guess its worth trying... GOOD LUCK TO ALL!!!!!

Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/6/2008 12:27:30 AM	I am 21 years old.  I started this medication on April 17th.  As of this morning, I have lost a total of 22 lbs in 18 days.  I have cut back tremendously on the foods I eat.  I eat 1 package of oatmeal for breakfast, a low fat low cal lunch, and Yoplait yogurt for supper.  I have not ate after 5 pm.  I drink 80 ozs of water daily.  No sugar, tea, cola, ect.  Water and skim milk only.  I walk 30-45 minutes a day.  This medication has proven effective for me.  I caution you however, do not take Suddafed or Imitrex with this medicine.  I passed out cold from my heart rate being too high.  Also, I take 37.5 mg daily 1 hr. before breakfast.  I will only take this for 3 months.

Overweight	khall, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/3/2008 12:23:23 AM	I have lost 25 lbs. in 4 months.  That is not as much as some people, but I rather lose it slowly and keep it off.  If you get off for a couple days, make sure you watch what you eat.  My doctor put me on a 1200 calorie diet,(300 cal 4 times a day).  It helps alot. And write down everything you eat and drink.  If you get a craving, eat a couple bites of it, and that's it. 
Overweight	Thick Chick, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	5/2/2008 11:49:54 PM	I started this medication back in 2005 i lost like 18 lbs. I think went back to old habits. So i believe you can keep the weight off with hard work. I just restarted it this week. So far I haven't even thought about food. I actually could go all day with just water. I do have a hard time sleeping and staying a sleep. I also have dry mouth but I drink more water. I'm definatly going workout to increase my weight loss and hopefully make a life change this time.

I do have thyroid problems so that was some of the weight gain reason as well. there are days still even with taking the midication that I get hungry.. but I do have self control. i was starvin last night but I had a yougart smoothie with protein powder so I didnt pig out
Overweight	25-34 Female 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/30/2008 9:59:55 PM	My Doc. put me on this about 3 months before my wedding. I have been on and off hormone medication so my weight has been going nuts! I was on this drug for 4 months and lost 35 pounds, I went form a size 12 to a size 6-7. I felt great and looked great on my wedding day. Overall the medication worked wonders for me, but watch out when you stop taking it. Have a game plan in place to help keep the weight off. My appitite came back stronger than ever when I came off of it. You will be able to keep the weight off if you are prepared when coming off the drug. Good luck to everyone!

In the first 2 weeks I lost 8 lbs and so far I have lost 18 pounds. I have experienced the dry mouth and at the begining I could not sleep at night...I did adjust the times I was taking it so sleep is no longer an issue. I have not been exercising as much as I should be but I have changed my eating habits. The only problem I have is remembering to take it.

I have had no side effects but a little dry mouth. I have been reading some of these reviews and everyone is talking about how it gives them so much energy and I have not experience that. I have no trouble sleeping at night or during the day. It does suppress my appetite though and it does seem to be working. Only 75 lbs to go.

I was originally prescribed 15mg, and after 3.5 weeks my Doctor increased it to 30mg.  It is working for me, I have lost about 15+lbs. I need to lose about 60 more.  It is frustrating since I know my Doctor will only let me take it for 3months.  I am hoping that I will not be dependent on it to control my appetite and the behavior changes I am making will continue.

I started at 315lbs, and down to 295lbs. The dry mouth starting to wear off. I have changed my diet, and starting to walk more. I will be starting a exercise tape in the mornings at least 3 times a week to help tone in the process. I did treat my self to double cheeseburger, when i was finished I felt so sick. I guess I will trat my self to a fruit salad next time.LOl... I am going to continue with the 37.5mg. and do my best to shed down to at least 215. I am 5'10' female. I have never been skinny so I believ I will see how I look and make sure that I still look healthy.

Started on 15 mgs but was recently changed to 30 mgs. Of course I increased exercise and watched what I ate and HOW MUCH I ate.  I lost 40 lbs. My only concern is that it can affect the production of insulin and I just found out I am pre-diabetic. I may stop using it as I believe my behavior has now changed.

Perhaps I already am used to drinking tons of water.  For me, it is like food doesn't exist now, and it has gotten me into a different mind frame... food is now energy and not a pleasure.  A bowl of soup and a glass of water makes me terribly full.  I am hoping my mind gets locked into this way of thinking.  Hopefully, no constipation for me... I am using the bathroom plenty as of right now.  I am pleased so far and I am on a pretty regular sleep schedule, as well.

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	4/16/2008 10:45:23 PM	I have been taking this nearly 3 months now.  It worked great the first week at 37.5 mg; now taking 75 mg daily and I have only lost 5-8 lbs at best.  Side effects; dry mouth, extreme moodiness and at first insomnia.  I would agree with the person who thought it wasn't strong enough.  I can go straight to sleep on this.  Kind of depressing when it works so well for everyone else.  Needed to lose 40lbs since I quit smoking.  Will probably quit since I am just blowing money.  Good luck to everyone.

I went from 164lbs to 128. I stopped taking it, stopped exercising for 6 months and gained 23 lbs back. It does work on it's own, no exercise is necessary (though you should) but once you stop taking it, you're appetitie returns &amp; the lbs return. This is the best diet aid available and more and more people are learning that it is awesome. It can make you a little edgy &amp; irritable but your body adjusts with time. I have started taking it again on 04/15 and will keep it off this time!
Overweight	On My Way, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/16/2008 4:15:37 PM	I started taking this drug 3 weeks ago when I was out of control and weighed in at 298. My doctor put me on the 30 mg and in these 3 weeks I have lost 20 pounds. I really don't have any side effects except for the dry mouth but it is making me drink more water.I did join the gym and try to make it 3 times a week. I am very happy that I started this I don't feel hungry anymore and can drive right by McDonalds with out feeling the urge to pull in! My doctor will only give me the prescription 1 month at a time to make sure everything is going ok. So whenI went to see him today he was more than pleased. Thank goodness I found something like this, Iam making better choices in food and my portions are cut in half, like many of you sometimes I have to remember to eat. I am enjoying this so far.
Overweight	A SOL, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/16/2008 3:26:26 PM	I started with this medication on 03/17/08 so far I had lost 9 pounds to date but I gain 1 pound. the first week in half I lost 7 pounds since then its been a little harder. About the 3rd week I became constipated and was retaining water. My dr. has provided meds for these side effects I just started them today so hopefully they will get me back on track. I am walking and eating healthier now. keep in mind the results vary. My sister took this medication as well and lost 20 pounds in one month. I was hoping for the same fast results but every body is different. Although my results are not as fast as my sisters this is the first time in over 3 yrs I've been able to lose more than 5lbs. My sister did not get any side effects other than dry mouth which seems normal. My body fat was 28.8% in the high levels, my sisters was only 23%. the true challenge will be keeping it off once I'm done. Good Luck everyone, and yes I would recommend this treatment of course under your doctors supervision.  
Overweight	timmysmom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/15/2008 7:51:31 PM	For me and my frame My Dr knew I needed to lose weight and he knew how hard I was trying on my own, I have never weighed 156 and Im small frame and 5'4, I was on xenical several times and the side effects are horrible there are other drugs but I have epilepsy and he didnt want to prescribed me some of the others, I actually read about this one on a news website.. and I told him I wasnt leaving his office until he helped me, weight gain is depressing for me.. Like Im sure it is with most of the people here
Overweight	garner1118, 25-34 Female 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	4/15/2008 3:51:31 PM	I am on my 3rd day of taking this medicine. My first couple days, I had the energy and an incredibly decreased appetite. I do have to remember to eat.  I do experience the cotton mouth, but like so many others, I enjoy drinking the water.  Today is my 3rd day and I do feel like my heart rate is up and like I have weird feeling in my upper chest.  Has anyone else experienced this?  I am keeping an eye on it.  I do like what  it has done for me so far and would like to continue on it (I am on the 37.5 dosage, I think).
Overweight	SuspiciousOne, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	4/15/2008 1:36:04 PM	I'm reading these comments and some of you are great at admitting how much you started out weighing and how much you weigh now.  I thought this drug was for people like me who have at least 80 lbs to lose???  I can't find anyone to prescribe it for me, but those of you who weight far less than me are getting prescriptions for it???  How is that?  
Overweight	timmysmom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/15/2008 7:48:41 AM	I weighed myself this morning I was 135.8 with my pjs and a hoodie, when my Dr prescribed it I was 154 on his scales and pretty close to that on mine, it has almost been a month since I have been on the meds, I will tell some of the new users the dry mouth does go away, and I began after about 2 weeks to gain my appitite back, but I know how to eat and I dont eat junk food or high calorie dinners, I do portion control and I realized for me anyhow its ok to have a slice or 2 of pizza now and then, I work out 3-5 days a week on the treadmill and I lift light weights, jumping jacks, crunches...Good Luck all

Overweight	timmysmom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/12/2008 8:04:28 AM	Also I have a question for the women users, have any of you experienced missed periods while on this medication? mine have always been irregular but then they started coming normally, but the last one I had was in Febuary, and no chance of pregnancy... I know I dont have them when Im stressed but I have been trying to minimize that so I dont belive thats the issue
Overweight	timmysmom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/12/2008 7:37:45 AM	I also received a 4 month supply of this medication, Im not worried about gaining the weight back, I have learned what is good to eat and what isnt and portion control.. no more hot dogs from home depot when Im shopping lol, no more lunch meat or junk food, maybe once a week if I get the craving but not all the time like before. and working out is key as well
Overweight	LOVE IT!, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/11/2008 10:13:07 PM	I am beginning my 4th month.  I have lost 27 lbs.  It was tough in the beginning -- all the symptoms mentioned here.  But now, all of that is leveling out and I feel great.  I do take Colace to help with constipation.  Even with taking it, I still have bloody stool.  My energy level is great and I could go all day with just eating one meal.  Today my doc said he's willing to let me stay on the med if he continues to see results in me taking it.  When I stop losing, he says I'll need to come off of it.  I'm also very afraid of getting off the med and gaining the weight back.  Right now I'm enjoying finding &quot;new&quot; clothes in my closet that I haven't been able to wear in a long time.  WONDERFUL!

I have the occassional dry mouth and trouble sleeping.  I am on the 37.5 mg daily. It does curve my appetite for the most part. I have been cutting back on what I eat. Has anyone ever experienced any rectal bleeding from this medicine?

I haven't stepped on a scale since i went to the doctor on Tuesday, but i will get on the scale next wednesday and see how much i can loose in a week.  My doctor advised me to drink a protein shake in the morning for breakfast/lunch and eat a good healthy dinner for the first 2 weeks to cut back on my calorie intake.  I feel more energetic and eat less.  So far so good.

I had to have my pregnancy terminated due to other factors and not to taking this medication.I am now back on it ( i take 37.5 ) and have only been taking it for 3 days. I have the whole dry mouth thing, as well as the claminess and strange dreams. However i have more energy and i have lost 16 pounds so far. I do eat but only if i am hungry and it is smaller portions too. I drink more water and count EVERY CALORIE that goes into my mouth. Timmysmom. . Hang in there. It is hard at first but with family and friends who support you you will get through this. My thoughts and prayers are with you.

I have lost 30 lbs total, but it has stopped working for me.  While I was on the drug, I was irritable and cranky to everyone around me.  I would feel rage for no reason.  I had rapid heartbeat on occasion that I still get even though it has been a couple weeks off the drug.  I did lose the weight, but I'm not sure it was worth it.  The cost was great.  But I still have 70 lbs to lose that I am unable to do on my own since I have PCOS so I guess I will be put on something else.

I am trying to loose weight only for me, I wasnt happy, my husband always told me he couldnt tell the difference, but he does tell when I have been working out my legs are firmer and of course the butt.. I wasnt happy at that weight, but when I was 125-130 I felt good about myself.. But Im not aiming to be any smaller then 125, in my younger years yes I was tiny but as Im older I need some meat on my bones lol

When I quit taking the medicine after 4 months I put weight back on.My Dr. states he is using it to help shrink my stomach so I am back on it and will take it for approximately 1 year. It is working again I have lost 10 pounds in one month.

It has worked great for me. I have a 2 year old and it has given me more energy. It seems like I can get alot accomplished in one day. The only sympton for me is the cotton mouth. And you really need to pay attention and eat. I weigh myself once a week, every saturday. I am too concerned about going off these pills. They are great energy,no hunger and loose weight. I did start out on the 15mg and moved up to the 37mg.

It is like it is not strong enough.  I have gone from the 15 mg to the 30 mg.  I am worried about goine off of it.  After being on the 15mg for 2 weeks I forgot to take my pill one morning.  I felt very sick all day.  Withdrawels after only 14 days?

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/1/2008 4:53:36 AM	Helped me lose 40 lbs in my first 8 months, not much since.  Started working, so I don't exercise as regularly.  BUT the meds keep me from overeating, which is the reason I could never lose weight before.  I've kept the weight off for 6 months by using the meds sporadically, try to skip a day or two between doses. Goal is to lose 15 more lbs and try to slowly get off the meds.  I'm VERY SCARED about gaining the weight back, I hear it happens. Hence, trying to change my lifestyle and eating/exercise patterns. But I'm even more scared about the side effects of long term use. Hopefully, 1 more year for me. Good luck everyone! And make the decision to live a healthier lifestyle!

My Dr gave me a 3 month supply, Im looking to lose about 25 pounds so hopefully I can.

I think that a lot of the headaches and stomach cramps that are being felt are from the fact that you need to remember to eat during the day.  I have been on this medication for 1 1/2 months, eat six times a day (yes I have to make myself) drink tons of fluids and have lost 49 lbs.  I also exercise 3x a week, for 45 minutes to a video.  Remember to eat!  Most important.  The headaches that most of you report feeling is probably from dehydration and not having enough vitamins.  This pill is not to help your body starve!  Make yourself eat 6x a day.  3 meals 3 snacks. very easy. You will eat less, but more often, you need calories to function.  This pill will be very effective for you if you remember to follow a healthy diet. Also if this pill stops working, (drowsy after a couple of hours of taking) I found that if I stopped for a couple of days, and then started again the effectivness was recharged.  Good Luck to all of you and remember, EAT AND DRINK FLUIDS!!!

Other	Phen4me, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/27/2008 3:10:20 PM	Phentermine has been a life saver. After my 2nd child I found it difficult to loose any weight (I'm 150lbs). However, the mood swings, being spaced out, and the drymouth are really bad side effects. So far I have lost 12lbs and my goal, with diet, is 25lbs. 
Overweight		5	4	5			3/26/2008 11:04:39 PM	My doc only prescribed me 2 months, said that was all I needed. I lost 15 lbs in 2 weeks but then it stalled. Definitely, I was able to control cravings. Dry mouth was there, being jittery, cranky but I had more depression when I was overweight than now. I feel a lot healthier now. Warning though - you really have to fight to keep the weight off. Make sure you start an exercise routine right away. Don't depend on the medicine to change your life.

Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/25/2008 3:30:38 PM	When I was in high school I was put on this medication and lost 100 lbs in 3 1/2 months.  Unfortunately, I didn't make portion control and working out a part of my routine, and I gained all the weight back plus some.  Now that I'm a little older, I decided to give it another try.  I've been taking the medication for almost 1 month and have lost 31 lbs.  The only side effect I have noticed from both instances on the medication is dry mouth.  It's important, while on the medication, to start an exercise program that you enjoy and will be able to continue after you stop using the medicine.  Phentermine is very useful in reducing your appetite and a great dieting tool, but to make any weight loss permanent, one must make a life change.

Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/25/2008 7:28:12 AM	I just started taking the medication on Saturday.  I haven't been sleeping well at all, tossing and turning all night.  I have a lot of energy, but I am very irritable and quiet compared with usually bubbly self.  My mouth has been dry so I have been drinking tons of water.  The only other unusual thing I've noticed is my craving for cigarettes.  I quit some time ago, but everyday, morning until night, I want to smoke.  Besides these side effects, my appetite is nearly nonexistant so it is not difficult to watch what I'm eating.  Especially since I had been on a 1200 calorie diet for about 3 months solid before starting the program.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	3/24/2008 4:51:52 PM	In total I took this drug for 2 months.  The first week I had terrible nausea and insomonia.  After that, I was able to sleep and had a little bit more energy.  I also had terrible dry mouth for the first month.  After the two month period, my dr. removed me from this medicine because I did not lose any weight.  Even with a strict diet and exercise 5-6 times per week, I gained two pounds.

Overweight	Dawn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	3/22/2008 10:45:30 AM	I started this med about 4 weeks ago, and have lost about 20 lbs.  I weighed 280 and am now at 259.  It stopped my gravings immediatly, I didn't get that omg I need chips, etc. feeling at all.  I did have a hard time adjusting to sleep I almost stopped because of the lack of sleep but after about 5 days it did get better, now I'm falling asleep easier.  I still have dry mouth but I keep sugarfree gum, or water with me.  My energy level did rise, also my heart rate, however that has subsided a bit.  I am watching what I eat. I don't know how this pill works but it is amazing.  Any other diet that I was on I graved, thought about carbs all the time, now I don't even think about it, sometimes have to tell myself I need to eat. I will be going to the doctor next week to see how I'm doing and to see if I should continue this med.

On the first day...I felt like I was floating..so high and happy. But that changed day 2! I currently weigh 150 with a heigh of 5'8&quot;. I am experiencing forgetfulness, slurred speech, intermittent loss of thoughts in a conversation, bad insominia. I noticed forgetfullness, I get trimmers and at times fealings of weakness. I am not hungry but I try to have 3-4 Pretzils when I feel hungry. I want to go back to my old weight of 130 LBS. At my current weight with a small frame, I get out of breath after walking 3-4 blocks. I do have a pre existing hearth condition where I feel my heart beating fast. I am on coumadin 10mg 1 x day. Any advice on staying on it eventhough I have a list of side effects? I would love to get the weight off. Please email me at Rblackville@yahoo.com   (Roy)Good Luck to all of you who have dropped the weight :)

Not only that I attempted suicide and just got out of the hospital yesterday and think this drug altered my mind enough to make me do it.  I feel fine since I have been off of it.  Please this is legalized speed, not for everyone. It made me moody, emotional, and anxious.  I lost some weight but my life is more important than the weight.  Please be careful taking this drug!!!!  Please!!!
Overweight	thebear, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/17/2008 10:15:19 PM	I started phentermine exactly 7 days ago. i experienced dry mouth but dealt with that by drinking lots of water and chewing gum and had a headache develop each day for about three days, i also had a feeling like i had had too much caffine but that went away after two days....i decided not to weigh myself more than once a week. I have gone from monday being 203- friday being 196...7 POUNDS!!! i was pretty happy!!! i also have been to the gym four times and have been able to continously workout with out stopping for a break, i do 45min of cardio everytime and two days a week work on some weights as a bonus. i also have been just generally trying to be more active, by playing basketball and cleaning more often. as for my appetite its nice that i don't feel the need to snack all the time but i have been eating healthy and regularly. and with the results im getting that gives me even more drive to keep up my efforts. this drug helps but unless you change your diet and exercise as well don't expect great results, it takes alot more than just a pill to change your overall health. But if you put all the pieces together sooner or later it will all begin to fit together.
Overweight	Cindy Dennis, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/15/2008 11:34:32 PM	In 1997 I weighed 185lbs I went my aunt and sister in law to this weight loss clinic  and I lost over 50 lbs and was very satisfied but gained it back. ( due to the fact that I quit qorking out and not working) After the birth of my second son  11 years later I weigh 222.5 as of yestereday I went back on phentermine and so far this is the 2nd day and I have lots of energy and by nite time I slow down! My Dr. put me on B-12 liquid and pill form and a multiple vitamin and two others. I can tell a difference I have to force my self to eat. I want to loose 87.5 and I know I can do it with this med. The only thing that I can tell with the side effects are the dry mouth( don't remember that from before) and I started have breakthru bleeding no where close to my time of the month. But have learned this will go away. I have a four bedroom house and I cleaned the whole thing in about 3 hours all total but I nearly throwed up tonight after dinner. I am on a 1000 - 1200 calorie diet and I couldn't eat hardly tonight. But I know this med works and I am very excited about getting to try it again. I want to make my goal weight by my Birthday in August which is my anniversary as well. If any one lives in Baytown, texas and wants a work out partner email me at dcindy68@yahoo.comGood luck to allCindy

Overweight	Meredith, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/14/2008 10:15:39 AM	I started on the 37.5mg 6 days ago and have lost 7lbs so far.  I rarely have an appetite, and have to force myself to eat.  The only real side effect I have had is that I get a little spacey sometimes.  Also, I don't know if this is purely psychological or what but foods that I used to crave make me nauseous to even look at.  I went to the grocery store yesterday and loking at all that food made my stomach turn.  I guess that is good in some ways.  But, overall I have had a great success.

Other	KAT, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	35-44	3/14/2008 9:21:44 AM	Over the past 2 years I've been working out and watching what I ate. I lost 96LBS doing this but was getting upset due to the 3 month stand still I was at. When I was put on this pill I lost 17lBS in the first 3 weeks! The next two have been slower 1-2 LBS and now it is at a stand still again. I think my body is just used to this drug because nothing else has changed. I will check with Doctor to either up the dose or change drug. I'm a 36 female and start weight was 245.Also about the ? of a period. Mine was delayed the first month about 2 1/2 weeks and I knew it wasn't due to anything else LOL
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/13/2008 4:37:38 PM	I started out at 300lbs.  After 4 months I lost 25lbs, but the last three weeks I have not lost at all.  I am never hungry.  I use to get energy from the pill, but that hasn't happened lately.  From what I understand, your body gets used to the medication and it stops working as well, so I guess that is where I'm at.  Side effects were: Heart racing, irritability, feeling hot (not sure if that's a blood pressure issue or not), and generally being unpleasant to be around.  I guess it's worth it to lose weight, but the crankiness is unbearable sometimes.  I've also slipped into a minor depression after being unable to lose any more these past few weeks.  Overall the drug is wonderful, but I worry about what it will do to my body if I continue to take it without results.  I would definitely recommend it to others who are looking for serious weight loss.  I lost 6 lbs my first week without doing anything different.

I have never been so excited to get on the scale before!!!  I feel great!
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/8/2008 3:01:01 PM	For the first 2-3 days, I was bursting with energy that I've never had before! And a cleaner house than before! LOL! However, with that came the inability to sleep well. Thankfully, that subsided as my body adjusted. Within the first 4 months, I lost 43 lbs with no exercise (although I NEED to exercise!) as well as following a modified low-carb plan. I find that I'm never hungry, I tend to forget to eat, however, that means that I'm not grabbing the first thing I see. I'm making much better food choices. In fact, sometimes I have to FORCE myself to eat because I know I need to. That in turn, makes me pick smaller portions. Starving yourself only causes your body to STOP losing weight. If I want something sweet, then I allow it because I know I'm not going to over-eat anymore! The only side effects I've noticed is severe dry mouth. I was never a fan of H20 before, but I am NOW! It is mandatory that you drink lots of water because you can become dehydrated if you're not paying attention. The only other thing I've noticed is that I tend to want to smoke more-I think this may be my subconscious replacement for food though...so I pay attention to that as well. I've always had low blood pressure and have been in good health so those have not been an issue for me. Occasionally, I will feel my heart beat elevate, but normally that's because I haven't eaten yet. I can lose approx 4-5 lbs per week, depending on my water intake and time of the month. After reading some of these reviews, I think I will try skipping a day or two once a week...to jump-start again. I have 55 lbs to go and I'm confident that I will reach my goal!

Overweight	Brandy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/7/2008 1:41:34 PM	I have been taking phentermine for almost two weeks along with doing the Flex Plan from weight watchers and I have lost 17 pounds. The first couple of days I was really dizzy and was kind of shaky. I called my doctor and he told me to increae my water intake until it went away and it worked. I drink at least 96 oz of water a day and all of the side effects have disappeared and I feel GREAT!! I have about 70 lbs to loose total and I am already a quarter of the way there. My doctor gave me this prescription for 4 months, I guess I will update this posting after the 4 months is up. I would recommend this pill (along with a change in diet and exercise) to anyone.

Overweight	pammel, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	3/4/2008 12:35:22 PM	I have been taking Phentermine 37.5 twice a day for about 2 months now. I have about 50 lbs to lose. Even though it does give me energy, which I love, I cannot honestly say that it has been very helpful in lessening my desire to eat or have cravings. Every time I have taken this drug, I develop white canker sores (I think that's what they are!) on the inside of my mouth, on the inside of my lip, and on my tongue. They are very painful and the only thing I have found that will help the pain is to gargle with a salt solution of 1 tsp. of salt dissolved in 1 cup of warm water. I cannnot eat anything spicy because another side effect for me is that salty or spicy foods make my tongue burn like heck. Has anyone else that is taking this med experienced any of these side effects? I am anxious to hear back from anybody that wants to respond. Thanks.

My energy is way up and my appetite is down. I am rarely hungry and when I do eat, I make sure to make good choices as I hardly eat anything. I had a very fast heart rate the first time I took the drug but that was the only time that happened. My heart rate and blood pressure has actually come down. I am hopeful this drug's effectiveness will continue. I am very happy with the results so far.

I have lost 26 pounds. I exercise about 3 hours a day, 5 times a week. It makes me feel jittery, unable to calm down, and worst of all makes me aggressive/angry for no reason at all.  It gave me the kick I needed to get back into the gym but can't handle the side effects any longer.  I'm going off of it.  I'd rather be overweight and happy with my husband than lose him because of some stupid pill.

Lost over fifty pounds!! Doc started me on 37.5 mg at first. had problems with this dosage, it gave me stomach aches so I went 2 the 30 mg. after that the aches went away. gives me energy and i dont want 2 eat anything. So when I do eat I try to eat healthier foods since I'm not eating a whole lot. I've had arthritis since i was 3 and losing the weight has really helped my joints. My Rheumatologist says for every 10 pds u loose, it feels like 100 lbs 2 ur knees! He is right. I would suggest phen as a weight loss alternative. There are some of us that just cant diet and excerise and loose weight; we need help. Having a joint disease made it impossible 4 me 2 exercise. I am 5 ft and used 2 weigh 175 lbs. Now i weigh 121 lbs. I'm going 2 get the last few pds off before spring. the main reason i'm writing this review is that some of my side effects have me puzzled. In the last month or so I have been having anxiety attacks. Very irritated about stuff that normally would not bother me. I stopped taking phen for 4 days because of a bad cold. When I started back on it the attacks came back. I am convinced it is the phen. Maybe it is because i've been on it 4 a long time. However i have decided 2 stop taking it. Permanently!!!! The stress and anxious feelings r bothering me 2 much. I do recommend phen just talk 2 ur doc and pay attention 2 your moods and especially if u become over anxious about small stuff. on a lighter note since losing the weight, i have met someone. He is a great guy! Good luck losing weight!! If u  have had some of the same exp. on phen u may contact me at pennymoore6969@yahoo.com.

I know you are not supposed ot be on it for two long. What would you say a good time frame would be? I know some people take it like 2 weeks then take a break and start again. Has anyone used this regimen?
Overweight	jodi m, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/21/2008 11:55:48 AM	I tried this medication once before for 1 day and my blood pressure went up so I stopped. I wanted to try again so I started on this drug 5 weks ago, I take 1-2 hrs after breakfast. I have lost 22 lbs. in 5 weeks.My blood pressure is ok now. I really felt I needed a kick start and this really works.I am not hungry and some days I think I don't eat enough. At first I had great energy but have had some loose stools on 2 occasions that made me fatigued. I also get really dry mouth at night and a slight headache on some days.I am pleased with the results and would definitely recommend it for anyone who has a problem overeating as I did. The results definitely make me feel there is hope. Hang in there and give it a try.
Overweight	nana, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	2/20/2008 3:06:17 PM	Have been on for almost two weeks, I have lost about 10 pounds, my start weight was 306. You can look and tell I have lost some weight.The weekend is the most difficult part for me because of the energy that you get from it and of course the dry mouth.  It does make me drink more water which is a good thing. I'm going to start to include some form of exercise with it.  It does curb your need for food,which has called me to eat healthier. I will advise you not to drink any soft drinks late in the evening.Overall I am very pleased with the results so far. I would like to lose at least 75 pounds.
Overweight	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/20/2008 12:45:41 AM	I have been taking this medication for 10 months.  I have lost 117 lbs and check in with my Dr. every month to check weight and blood pressure.  Both are getting lower each month.  She said she normally don't keep a patient on this medication for a long period, but since it is working for me so well she will continue to prescribe it until she see's it isn't working.Along with taking this medication I am cutting back on the carbs.  I no longer eat bread, pasta, potatoes, rice or anything with large amounts of carbs.  Plus I am exercising everyday but doing the treadmil for at least a mile a day and using the weights to help tighten up.I am very pleased with my results and so is my Dr.  My Chlosterol has gone down 20 pts.

I exercise about five days a week by doing Zumba (latin Dancing). I would highly recomend this medicine.  I just had my second child in July of 07 and never rally lost the weight from my first child.  I am  27 years old and wanted to look and feel better about myself.  The first day I was a little jittery and had lots of energy but after that I just have less of an appetite and more energy.
Overweight	KiKi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/19/2008 2:21:13 PM	I am on 37.5mg and I take a pill and a half everyday. My doctor also put me on a water pill to help get rid of excess fluid. I dont have alot of energy but I also dont have an appetite either. My mouth is constantly dry and if I start talking about something and I have a lot to say I feel my words start getting harder to pronounce because I have no saliva whatsoever. Drink lots of water! I am working out and to date I have lost 19lbs. I am looking forward to losing more weight in the coming month. I was not a heavy child or teen but having my son and not being able to breastfeed and being on bedrest for 6 weeks after his birth due to an infection was traumatic for my body. I had a low self image and for awhile tried to accept me for me and then I would come in contact with the mirror and I would have hate surge through me because of how I looked. This medicine has helped with that. People I work with have really noticed the difference and I get compliments more and more. This medicine has really helped me with views on my body image. Its a great thing!

I have been jittery today and very dry mouth.  And I feel very warm and I haven't been moving around today so I don't know if that's because I'm taking the pills or what.  I weigh 174 right now so we'll see how I weigh when I'm done with my 30 day supply.

After the first 6 months of use, I started getting REALLY bad headaches and mood swings (according to my family) I didn't notice, but they did. I stopped taking this medicine on my own, over a year later, but when I did, the weight starting coming right back on even though I kept to the diet and to be honest, I NEVER exercised when I was on it or off. Was it worth it, YES. I'm planning to go back on it next week, just be careful of those warnings.

She said I could only be on this for 3 months and that it could do all sorts of things to my heart and stuff. Scares me really. I have been on this for 3 days and I have lost 5 pounds. I do feel it has curbed my appetite some. But I still be hungry. I don't have the energy that I have read from everybody else. I find myself waking up every morning between 2 and 3. That part sucks. I also.. SMOKE SO MUCH MORE. I am going to try and skip taking it this day. Prob. start back taking it tomm. I have asthma and since I have been up it has been bothering me today. I am not sure if it is the increased smoking or if it is from this pill. I will keep posting and let you know. Amy, Sc.

Overweight	Chrissy2, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	45-54	1/31/2008 4:43:51 PM	As to the rapid heart beat and sleeplessness, Dr. Paul Rivas in his book &quot;Turn Off The Hunger Switch&quot; recommends taking the beta blocker 'Pindolol' with Phentermine to ally the above conditions. I have an appointment today to get started on the Phentermine and intend to ask for the Pindolol also. Will let you all know how that goes. I need to lose at least 100 pounds. I took a weight loss medication similar to Phentermine back in the 1970's and lost 65 pounds with it. Kept it off for many years. After letting myself get heavier and heavier though working out through 20 years of marriage and four children I have finally faced the fact that I can't do this alone. I have tried everything. Look for future postings on the Pindolol. (I already take an ace inhibitor and HCTZ for hypertension--high blood pressure. Dr. Rivas says HCTZ is the most notorious weight gaining medication! And I have been on it for 5 years, steadily gaining. Drats!)
Overweight	kwalk03, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	19-24	1/31/2008 1:47:05 PM	I have taken 37.5mg for almost 2 weeks now. I take it for 2 days then skip a day per my doctor. I am waiting to weigh til I go back to doc in 2 weeks. I feel like I really am eating less and thinking about what it is that I'm putting in my body. I have experience an extremely dry mouth, fast pounding heartbeat, and a few headaches. I am in a wedding in May and want my dress to be as comfortable as possible. So, for now, the side effects don't outweigh (no pun intended) the possible outcome. Good luck to everyone else who is trying this.

I never thought that I could go hours without wanting to eat something. When I did eat, I noticed that I really did not want to finish eating all my food. I have not weighted myself, but I do feel a change in my clothes. Since it has only been two days I will wait five more days before I weight myself. I will come back and let you know how well I did. Good luck to everyone else. I can do all things in Christ who strengthen me. Phil 4:13 AMEN

Overweight	paramedic, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	1/24/2008 6:17:47 PM	I gained about 50 pounds in 9 months due to a back injury at work and wasn't able to workout. My doc prescribed the medication to see how it worked. I started taking the medication at the start of jan.  I have lost 25 pounds so far as of today, along with exercise and dieting. I didn't have any of the side effects described by other posters. My doc bumped me up to 30 mg about a week ago so it will be interesting to see how much more will come off. It does help with hunger control, but you have to dedicate yourself to losing weight by doing exercise and dieting. Good luck to all of you in your weight loss goals.

Overweight	Steffany, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	1/22/2008 1:45:57 AM	I have used this drug to lose weight for an extended period of time over the last 3 1/2 yrs. I initially, along with diet and daily exercise lost 85 pounds in 9 mos. I have kept off 65 of those pounds and return to them if I start to lose self-control again. I experienced 'THE worst headache of my life' that lasted 9 days when I stopped taking them cold turkey.(The blue capsules)I was initially told there were no side effects or addictions associated with this drug from a weight loss center.     It has also been my experience that most regular doctors will not prescribe it for me and I'm forced to pay huge price for the medication from weight loss centers.

Overweight	Rhonda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/19/2008 12:16:41 PM	I have taken phentermine 37.5 mg 1/day for two and a half months now. I've also joined Weight Watchers Online for assistance in eating healthy. I've lost 29 pounds so far. During the first couple of weeks, my blood pressure was elevated and I was a little shaky. That resided and now my blood pressure is a perfect 120/75. I have much of energy throughout the day and feel more alert as well. And the energy is a natural feeling of energy and not a nervous feeling of energy. I generally do not have an appetite. When I actually do crave junk food such as sweets or fried foods, I can only eat a few bites because it seems so rich. I just don't want anymore of it after a few bites. I tend to eat healthier now because I don't crave the bad food nearly as much. I figure that I might as well eat something healthy because I do need to eat something after all. In addition, my sister has taken this drug for 4 months and has lost 55 lbs. My niece has taken it for 3 months and has lost 20 lbs. So far, I have no complaints and I think it works great.

I am kind of disappointed since in the 1st month I lost 16 pounds. I'll keep everyone posted. Good luck to all. =)

Dr. gave me 3 months prescription last year and I only lost 13 lbs. total, and I didn't gain any back. That's why he prescribed it again. I'm on my 4th month and have totally gone from 174 on a 5'4&quot; frame to 156. I want to lose another 10-15 lbs. I'm in my mid 50's and never had a weight problem til menopause. He will continue to prescribe until I get to my goal. I think he feels fat in middle age is worse than taking a diet aid. I'm rarely hungry and don't think about food like I used to. I eat alot of fiber to combat constipation and feel great!

I only had one shot because of the weight I put on. I have been battleing with my weight for sometime now, and a friend has recommended this drug. I have now been on it for 10 days and have lost 7 pounds! Occasionally I have dry mouth, but I cure that with water, and I stay very energized.  At first that was a problem because I felt like I never slept! But now everything is good! I cant wait to go to my next appointment and weigh in!

I'd like to try to lose about 15 more lbs but I am worried that this drug may not be for me. My BMI seems to be right at 30. Also, I noticed that when I came off of the drug I began to have anxiety attacks which my doctor seemed to beleive was somehow related to this product. Is anyone else taking this at my similar BMI? 30. Thanks.

It gives me tons of energy but I am a zombie right now.  I am hoping that goes away and I will be able to sleep again.  I am going to try to take it earlier.  Dry mouth.  Sweating.  But hey, I did this to myself.  I am not having cravings, have to remember to eat, and I do exercise....so I have high hopes that the sleeplessness will go away with the pounds and I can live again.

Being active is the quickest way to take off weight. However, if you take the pill 1st thing in A.M., eat something small like an apple or bananna to prevent stomach ache.

I started with the 15 mgs for 2 months and then went to 30 mgs for two months and now I am on the 37.5 mg for two months and then I will decrease down to 30 and 15 after that and go off of it.

There is no magic drug on the market, but, with this medication, proper diet, minimal exercise program and the WANT and DESIRE to loose weight, you can! When you feel you have no energy, get up and start moving anyway! You cannot sit on the couch and expect this medication to shed pounds, YOU HAVE TO motivate yourself and set a goal. I am a 48 year old male, 6'1 and 226#'s..I loved my pizza and beer and had no motivation. I stopped and took a good look at my 40 waist and did not like what I saw. I am now 197 with a waist at 35 inches and still loosing fat. Please get up and motivate yourself! Don't give up........

I too have to make my self eat, and have extreme dry mouth.  I keep sugar free gum with me at all times and it seems to be helping. Before this I had a really hard time losing weight. At one point this year I was working out 2hrs a day eating about 1800 calories and still nothing.  I would highly recommend this to anyone that's healthy enough to take it.  It works.

Now after being on the 37.5mg for 5wks, I still get around 6hrs of sleep. My appetite has dropped dramatically, usually only eating one meal daily. The constant dry mouth is difficult, but sugar-free gum has helped, as well as lots of water. I seem to have lots of energy/motivation.  My first days off work while on the pill, I cleaned and rearranged my entire house, as well as disassembled/reassembled my dryer. After 30 days, I've lost 15lbs, still quite a bit to go. So far things are going well, hopefully it will continue. The hardest part for me has been trying to meet my daily water intake requirements.

It has really worked and I am almost at my goal weight lose of 30 pounds. Definitely read the instructions because at first use you will fill really hyper, but it will wear off. It limites the amount of food that I want to eat and the quickness of how full I get. It is definitely something to take if you are healthy enough and really ready to make a life style change. You have to work on the weight lose with it, don't just relie on the medication. I wathched my food, went to the gym atleast 3 to 5 times a week and just mentally prepared myself for the change. I'm glad I have taken it and hope to only lose more and continue to work on my wealth and overall outlook in life!!

I was in denial that I ate more than I burned.  This pill helped me realize that.  It was also easy to eat right because I didn't have a craving for any type of food.  You do get major dry mouth in the begining.  After having four babies and eating too much I'm happy to finally be seeing some results.  I recommend this pill.  Just make sure you exercise hard if you want the right results. Eat mainly fruits and veggies and protein.  No white flour products. (breads)In 9 weeks I am at 20 pound weight loss. From 189 to 169.
Overweight	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/30/2007 12:08:13 AM	The only thing I had to be careful of was making myself eat because this medication blocked my appetite.  And then after taking it for 6 months and losing about 40 pounds I gained about 30 back in 3 months.
Overweight	anna, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	11/28/2007 11:13:24 AM	Dosages: Started on capsules 30.5mg, increased to 37.5mg pills, then went to 2x 30.5mg capsules daily. Results: 20 pound weight loss in 2 months.Most Severe Side effects: irritability, dry mouth, insomnia, no appetiteGeneral: I knew phen was not a magic pill, just an appetite suppressant. That definitely worked. I had to force myself to eat most days, coming in under a normal calorie range (causing my body to shut down and hang on to the weight!) Not taking in enough calories was messing me up, and that, coupled with cost, led me to stop taking the pills. (Rx was $32 for 1 month, but Dr wanted  monthly visits not covered by my insurance. It was cheaper for me to go to a &quot;Phentermine clinic&quot;. There, I paid $80 month for 'consult, 1 month Rx, and nutrition guidance') The side effects for me were major.  The first week, I had 'spotting'- a weird blood discharge no where close to menstruation time. The dry mouth symptoms never went away(worse on 37.5mg dose). I was EXTREMELY irritable (not my usual nature) on the 37.5 mg dosage.. to the point where coworkers and friends made comments. The insomnia was worse for me on the 30.5mg dose.. to the point of no sleep for four days at a time, or 2-3 hours per night maximum.Overall, I do believe that it was VERY effective in suppressing my appetite. I would use as a crutch again.. however, hope to go from 161 lb to 145 lb (highest weight to be in normal BMI for my height) on my own.  Would recommend to others when they reason they need the pill is appetite suppressant. Still encourage healthy diet (lower fats, watching calories) and EXERCISE. Anyone/any plans that doesn't insist on physical activity is a SCAM.

I have upped my dosage to the 37.5mg pill and am confident that I will continue to lose.  I still have 50 to lose to be confident in myself.  but I am very satisfied with this medication.
Overweight	Sandy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	35-44	11/19/2007 10:18:07 PM	The first time I took Phentermine, it worked wonders.  I lost about 30 lbs in two months, and felt great.  I actually had to force myself to eat.  After taking it for 3 months or so, the effectiveness wore off, but having lost 35 lbs or so by then, it was the motivation to keep going on my own with diet and exercise.  I went from a size 24 to a 14, about 60 lbs.  I am going to a Dr. next week to get back on it.  I did buy it online, and they &quot;provided&quot; the prescription, but this time am going to a Dr./Weight Loss clinic to get it.  I took it again after having my son, but it did not work very well.  I did maintain the weight loss with the exception of 35 lbs.  I am hoping it helps me lose even 20 lbs to get me back motivated, and back to the gym.  I think anyone taking it for the first time had great results for the first 2-3 months, then it is like the body becomes immune to it, no matter how long (even years) you go off before trying again.  Wish me luck!

I eat much healthier and I eat smaller portions. I also started working out doing cardio 3 times a week for 1-2 hours each time and I also started weight training 2 times a week. I have been using it for 6 months, and every few weeks I stop taking it for 2-3 weeks. To date I have lost over 50lbs, and I feel great!

It has been great, yet at this point I think there has been a build up of some sort. I have noticed I am increasingly anxious. Maybe that is just due to the idea of stopping the drug and gain weight back.

But now it doesn't seem to work as well for me. I'm taking the highest miligram. I exercise and watch what I eat. Maybe I will get off it for a while and start over in a few weeks. That might make it kick in a little. My Dr. will not prescribe it to his patients. So I got if from an on line pharmacy. It is the actual medication. But it did cost way more than getting it from my Dr. Good luck everyone!

I first took it when my oldest child was 2 1/2.  I had tried all sorts of diets to get the baby weight off with no results before.  My doctor recommended combining the drug with a low carb diet and I lost 50 pounds in about 2 months.  I went from 190 to 140.  I did not exercise at all, but was very strict about my diet.  I even noticed that the month after I stopped taking the drug I continued to lose about another 10 pounds.  It really changes your lifestyle.  The weight stayed off until I became pregnant again, and I also did not gain as much weight with this last pregnancy.    My 2nd child is 7 weeks old now and since I have finished breastfeeding I have returned to this drug without wasting valuable time on anything else.  I weigh 167 and my goal is to lose 40 pounds in the next two months.  It feels so good to know I can do this!  If you are having a hard time obtaining this drug and can come to Nashville, Tn; look up The Doctor's Diet Program.  6 of us in my family have seen them with these significant results, and they have turned away only 1 friend of mine due to health concerns.

I highly recommend it. Getting a doctor to prescribe it for you if you are not obese, or grotesquely over weight is a real problem though. I have trouble sometimes getting rid of a few added pounds, no more than 10 usually, and doctors would rather not risk the side effects this drug may cause. I  know my body better than anyone and if I feel that a drug is causing problems for me I wouldn't continue to take it. I am on the hunt for a doctor that will prescribe it to me so I may take it PRN, as it is a lot easier to lose a few pounds that are put on due to holidays, or a busy schedule than it is to take off an exuberant amount of weight.

One week on Phentermine, I lost 7 pounds.  One month on Phentermine, I lost over 15.  I will find a way to take Phentermine every day for the rest of my life.  I will never be overweight again.

The pill alone didn't do it, I work out 3-5 times a week, and changed my diet to eliminate sugary foods, and fill up on vegetables, fruits, and protein. It has really helped to take away my sweet tooth. Lately I have been noticing some depression, complete lack of sex drive, and severe irritability. Not sure if prolong use of this drug may cause this?

According to the BMI scale I am considered obese at 5'5&quot; and 201 pounds, down to 189 pounds now.  My  goal is to get to 125 pounds and stay there.  I was diagnosed with disc degenerative disease which had caused me to fracture a vertebrea along with an accident at work.  I had back surgery and have not been able to exercise like I normally would have to help lose the weight so I was put on this wonderful drug.  It has surpressed my appetite so much that there are times I forget that I haven't eaten all day until maybe 9 or 10 at night and even then I can eat something like celery and peanut butter and it fills me up.  I can't wait to see the results once I start to exercise again.  The only side effects I have had are dry mouth and I have recently noticed if I forget to take it one day and take it the next day I sometimes end up with diarrhea, but other than that I haven't had any major side effects.

I KNOW this medication PREVENTS my migraines from occurring.  I feel as if noone listens, even though patients are supposed to be proactive in their health. I am suffering right now from a migraine that has lasted for 11 days. I have been prescribed Midrin, Inderol, and MAXalt.  These are not working.  Please, if anyone has the same experience as myself--let me or someone know.  Thank you--Ann Maria Boyce    annboyce2@hotmail.com
Overweight	lovethatdress, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/11/2007 12:36:34 PM	I'm not severly overweight but am only 5' tall. so a few lbs. show up quick on me. Plus I am a severe asthmatic. I took it in the fall and went from 132 to 128 in 30 days. because I did not have as much to lose my numbers are smaller but very significant in my clothing size! I started to work out, i could only make it 5 min. into a work out at first because of my asthma condition but I pressed on and came to do a 45 min workout in medium impact mode. I lost 8 more lbs. I also was determined to make my calories count, make good choices and reduce amount. And if I over do it; say out to eat... I eat only a bite or two of meat or other food high in protien to take me through the night so offset the amt. calories eaten per/day. It seems each fall I have a bout of asthma and I gain some back. but I work through it and am so happy with myself now! if you have an intent on changing how much you eat and cutting back on the goodies (sugar) you can loose it and keep it off. I think if you start eating in a way that is not normal for what you usually eat (unless it is fast food) then stick to what you usually eat but much less of it and try to eat nothing past 7 p.m. The drug just gives you a jump start. Create an intent that is a doable goal for a eating lifestyle change. I too took about 2 to 3 days to become accustomed to the affects of the drug. It creates more of a feeling of jitters. just eat healthy, vegetables (fresh, especially the green ones) and such and you should be fine.

When I started, I was 227 and now I'm 189. I have losted 38lbs. This is definitely a mircle pill! The only side effects i have was constipation and thirsts. So I start eating more fibers and drink more water. This change helped me eat even better than I was before I had the side effects.

Only major symptoms I have had from this medicine has been frequent constipation and as a result hemorrhoids. To date I have lost 42 pounds using the medicine in conjunction with major diet changes (I became a vegetarian) and exercise. As time goes on I find that the medicine is less affective at curbing the hunger pangs, but you can supplement with low or no calorie foods (IE Celery). I would recommend talking to your DR about doing this in conjunction with vitamin B shots or tablets to help ward off feelings of fatigue.

I am not sure how many lbs I have lost, but it does help stop the cravings.  Aside from the dry mouth-has anyone else had this side effect? I take the phentermine at 7:30 every AM. Around 12:30-1:00 my face gets really flushed for about an hour or so.  The skin feels  tight between my eyes-around the top of my nose...it's kind of weird. I experienced a similar side effect with a pain reliever I was prescribed last year after I had surgery...but when I stopped the pain reliever, the flushing stopped also.  I began taking Phentermine in September and noticed this side effect about a week into taking this med.

Overweight	freedfromprison, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/23/2007 8:27:00 PM	I went to the doctor because I was at the end of my rope. I felt like I was in prison. I haven't been able to lose weight since the birth of my child 8 yrs. ago. I had my gall bladder removed 1 1/2 yrs ago. Having that removed caused more complications, not being able to eat a normal portion of food without it causing massive stomach pains and the runs.. So! for over a year, not eating alot with excerise, you would think I would start losing. Ha! Like I started saying . Went to the doctor and he did blood work and everything check out fine. I now think I'll be fat for the rest of my life! Instead, he put me on this wonderful, helpful, energizing key to get out of my prison. I have been taking it for 2 1/2 months now. I have gone from a size 20 to a 12. I don't have a clue how many pounds I've lost because I don't really care. That scale is always the death of me. I can be in a good mood and step on it and it will literally ruin my whole day. Forget it! not doing it this time. All I know is that I can cross my legs now. Jump out of bed. Keep up with my 8 year old and have enough energy to make it to bed. Side effects...I agree with the others. Dry mouth at times is awful. Keep something to drink around at all times. Along with a box of Tic Tacs!I feel like I've been given a second chance to be healthy!!! Thank you Lord!

I wasn't severely overweight but I needed to lose my baby weight. It makes me generally happy, my energy levels have risen and it makes excercise much more enjoyable. The only side effect that I really experience is cotton mouth. The only thing that bothers me is the fact that I don't ever want to eat. I have to force myself to eat and when I do, I get so sick I want to throw up. So I went almost a month without eating an actual meal. This month has started out better however.

Being 40+ I knew my metabolism had slowed down so I talked to my doctor and she prescribed this drug.  It has been a God-send and I have lost 15 pounds in 8 weeks. I do not take it on the weekends so it doesn't lose it's effectiveness. Seems to help. I do not have insomnia since I take it right after brushing my teeth when I get out of bed.

I've lost a total of 39 pounds and am more than happy with the results. When I first started I was very jittery and my mouth was extremely dry all the time. These effects wore off fairly quickly. I also had an extreme loss of appetite. That too went away after about a month. Now I eat only when I'm hungry. I would (and have)recommend this drug to other women struggling with weight loss.

After I had both my kids I still could not get it off. I have tried everythingand in June my Dr. told me about phentermine. I have lost 25lbs and have more energy now than ever. I have about 60lbs more to go. I am on the med for 3 months and off for 1 month. It seems to be working. Love the energy I have to play with my toddlers now.
