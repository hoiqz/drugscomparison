Small incisions closed by Mastisol/Steristrips. NEVER allergic to adhesives before. Hive like itching/Swelling/Redness around Every Aplication point, especially the first where the vial was broken and excess adhesive ran down the side of my stomach(where no steristrips were) After 2 wks, steristrips naturally fell away but Itching/swelling/readness Remained. Benadryl cream has NO effect.
Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	5/2/2012 10:57:10 PM	I also had issues with this product. I've now had 6 knee surgeries and never had any skin issues until the latest one. Just like other reviews, I had what looked like an outbreak of poison ivy surrounding both incisions and yellow liquid oozing.  The swelling from the skin irriation/infection was worse than the swelling from the knee surgery!! Three weeks later, today, I still have pink skin from where it had spread. Not a good product at all!
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/26/2012 9:48:25 PM	Had my pacemaker replaced--steri strips were used with mastisol--I do have a sensitivity to adhesives and they were aware of that--the site was bandaged and covered with an op site covering--by the next day I was having severe itching and noticed some redness around the edges of the op site--The dressing was not to be removed for 5 days so I endured this itching--when I removed the dressing there was bright red welts-they soon began oozing a yellowish drainage--I will never have that product used on me again.
Other	ladyryder, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/14/2012 2:47:17 PM	First detected a severe allergy to mastisol after knee surgery. Had it noted in my charts but dermotology surgeon applied it anyway. Eleven hours later I was ripping the bandage off and ripping mad. It took four weeks to clear this site. Now find that waterproof bandages (clear type) are loaded with the same or similar agent. Steer clear of these.
Other	Dragonfly757, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	2/2/2012 12:42:23 AM	On Jan.27,2012 I had laparoscopic hernia repair surgery and the hospital used mastisol adhesive over the steri-strips. Three days later I was in pain from the itching, had blisters, BRIGHT red swollen areas 4x3inches at EACH incision site. Horrible itching and blisters. I filed a complaint with the operating room director and the FDA. This product was worse than the surgery! I'm taking a steroid dose pack, benadryl, using benadryl cream and ice packs and still  very uncomfortable. Beware of this product!
Other	JamieRN, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	1/29/2012 11:14:58 AM	As an operative nurse we use Mastisol to help Steri-strips adhere to the wound site &amp; they work very well.  However, there is a small population that are allergic (myself included).  The rash, itching were incredibly intense.  Treatment included removing the steri-strips immediately (should be done by physician! your wound may re-open), cleansing the site with soap &amp; water, Benadryl 50mg every 4 hours, Fuocinolone Acetonide cream 0.025% applied every 8 hours, Methylprednisolone 4mg Dose pack, ice-packs as needed for itching &amp; pain.  This allergy is not very common but a nasty one.  Most doctors have never seen it.  Be persistent in seeking help!  The first time my skin sloughed off (healed very nicely later).  The second time I didn't wait (incision for Thryoidectomy)!!!

Other	rphoumy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/26/2011 6:51:56 PM	I recently had bunion surgery(Lapidus Bunionectomy)on my right foot in July of 2011. Upon removing my cast (wore for 6 weeks) my Podiatrist noticed a small area of my incision were not sealed so he put Mastisol to adhere with the Steri-Strips which two days later caused a bad allergic reaction to my foot. It was blistery, swollen, dark and with a lot of yellowish puss.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product!  My Primary Doctor prescribed Prednisone pills which cured my bad reaction in three days! STAY AWAY FROM MASTISOL!!!
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	8/31/2011 2:34:46 PM	I recently had abdominal surgery, at my 10 day post op appt. the staples were removed and the nurse applied mastisol and steri strips to the 13 inch incision. That night the site started itching. At first i thought this was part of the normal healing process. By the next day the burning itching pain was unbearable. I was tearing at my incision in my sleep. Nothing helped to relieve tge pain. I tried cortisone, oral benedryl and cold compress. I bought sun burn treatment that had lidocaine to numb the area. I spoke to my surgeon and he blew me off and said use some cortisone even after i stated it didnt work. The area became thickened, red and covered in blisters. It looks like a chemical burn and essentially it is. 7 days later and i am still suffering. I have had previous surgeries and never had any reactions but this was the first time mastisol was used. During my research of this product i have discovered a lot of people have had severe reactions and unfortunately the company does not appear to care.

My doctor told me I must be allergic to the adhesive. The last surgery was a week ago. I went to have my stitches removed and I was told it was in my chart about the reaction, but the nurse accidentally put it on my incsison! Within 24 hours the hives spread from the site down my side. the wound was oozing this nasty yellow stuff and the itching is unbearable!!! I put benedryl all over the site and my doctor put me on a steroid pack. The benedrayl helps but does not get rid of the blisters or oozing. The steroids eventually help. but the burning and hives and oozing lasts longer than a week.  This adhesive should be removed from the market or people need to be warned about the dangers and reactions.
Other	lori, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	6/1/2011 12:06:05 AM	I had knee surgery two weeks ago and was told on day 10 to remove my three sets of steri-strips. As soon as I removed the first one I felt intense burning and itching. Within minutes the spot where the strips had been was swelling, bright red, hot and itching. I looked like I had been burned with hot coins. By the next day it was draining and simply disgusting. I called my doctor's office who told me it was the Mastisol. I've had many surgeries and NEVER had a reaction. This is a horrible adhesive. I tried to call Ferndale Labs today, left a voicemail message with their customer service person, who never called back. Bet she never will. This adhesive claims to be &quot;non-irritating&quot; on the website. My knee is disfigured now. Disgusting!

I've used it for a total of 6 weeks , but the last 10 days have been horrible. Red, itchy, swollen areas and painful to the touch have developed. I'm not recommending this product.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	4/28/2011 8:07:27 PM	I had mastisol applied after my csection last friday and within 24 hours broke out in red rash. The doctor had steri strips removed from incision but rash continues. It is swollen, blistering, itches, and looks like 2nd or 3rd degree burns. I have no other known allergies, but this is miserable. Doc said to apply hydrocortisone cream 3 X a day but now 3 days later not showing improvement. I agree it should be discontinued or at least required that patients have an allergy test given before using this product. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/25/2011 8:57:02 PM	I received Mastisol on my c-section incision site.  By that evening, I couldn't sleep because of the intense itching.  Over the next 48 hours, the site became swollen like a horrible poison ivy infection.  (4 inches around and 1/2 inch thick) I was seeping fluid continuously.  My dermatologist put me on a strong topical steroid due to nursing.  This took care of drying up the site and reducing the blisters and seeping.  However, 5 days post delivery I started breaking out in a rash.  It began on my chest and went both up and down my torso.  Then, my entire body broke out in hives.  The hives traveled from my face to limbs etc.  I went to my general doctor and received a steroid shot two weeks in a row because after one week, the hives came back.  Now, I am 8 MONTHS post partum and I still have skin sensitivity as well as red bumps that travel throughout my body.  I definitely think the mastisol caused a systemic reaction that is linked to these problems.  I would highly recommend refusal of this drug!

Itching and redness are now much improved, swelling is decreasing and can sleep at nite. Still can't stand for anything to touch the area. Will always list this as an allergy.

Now 6 weeks post op, Total Knee Replacement: ( FYI )Severe chemical burns with huge blisters erupted 4 days post op, total knee replacement.  Intense burning and now the entire Mastisol treated area is numb on the surface, with deep pain, nerve damage and loss of skin pigmentation.On 1200 MG Gabapentin q/d and Lortabs for persistent pain deep into the tissues.In retrospect, the burning pain I experienced immediately immediately post op was thought to be incisional and normal, but after evaluation by the Orthopedic Surgeon, PT, dermatologist, it was Mastisol.I would strongly advise skin testing before use on anyone.I'm not certain what the long term effects regarding my situation will be, but I would hope no one would have this experience.  I wish there was a way to attach photos, but if you can imagine yellow vascular laced huge grape shaped blisters, filled with yellow fluid, possibly you can use your imagination as to what these looked like. As noted above this pain is another story.

I rarely have had any skin issues or allergies. Product was used to adhere steri strips during a post op doc visit. After 3 days, skin around my incision was red, extremely itchy, blistered, and flaky. Looked like a deep second degree burn. Had to use hydrocortozone cream to put out the burning sensation. Symptoms were persistent for a week before slowly subsiding. Will now have to use other options for wound treatment in the future. I never want to experience that again.

Blistering and necrosis of skin.  This was three years ago.  I spoke with the maker of the drug Ferndale labs and was informed by letter that it knew of the reactions.  I tried to comment with them but they won't return the call.  I need a complete revision of the scar as it is binding from the reaction and still is sensitive.  I am very disappointed.
Other	momto3boys, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	5/18/2010 5:21:47 PM	Had breast augmentation and mini tummy tuck a week ago. Went to the doctor for check up yesterday (he already had been informed of my allergy to adhesives). My incisions looked good so he removed steri strips and then I felt him &quot;brush&quot; on something and apply tape to my tummy tuck incision. I looked up and saw the bottle of Mastisol.  I said &quot;Oh My god! I hope I don't have a reaction to that.&quot; Well, last night it started itching and has progressively gotten worse.  I suspect Mastisol was used on me previously when I had a c-section. My rash spread 4 inches around the incision site. It was raised up and dripping fluid. My entire body started itching and reacting to the allergy. I had red streaks radiating from the site and felt like I had bugs crawling through my skin. It took MONTHS to completely take care of the rash, skin disorders associated with it and now I still am having issues with itching skin and lips for now reason. I can only hope that I caught it early enought that it won't happen this time, but I agree that it should be taken off the market without a doubt!

The itching and burning has been intolerable despite benadryl, hydrocortisone and other treatments. I have never been allergic to anything in my entire life and i seriously believe that MASTISOL should be banned!
Other	scotgirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	4/21/2010 11:41:23 AM	I have never had any adhesive (or skin) allergies prior to use of this product. It was applied to hold steri-strips in place following shoulder surgery.  I developed large red, round circles around my incisions where it had been placed, and it has spread further down my shoulder.  The constant itching and burning is intolerable as well as weeping blisters similar to 2nd degree burns.  I have kept 1% hydrocortisone cream on it since day one of the reaction, and my doctor prescribed a steroid dose pack which I have finished, but he now suspects infection as red streaks are radiating from the site.  I am now on Augmentin (strong antibiotics) for this, and it has been 2 weeks since my surgery.  Some of the redness has improved on two if the three sites, but the itching and burning continues and some of the skin is now flaking.  This product should be banned, as it seems that so many people have experienced similar reactions.  I would be curious to know how many and/or if a study has been done. 
Other	ondossagonchick, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/21/2010 11:37:28 AM	I had a very bad allergic reaction to this product during my vein removal.  I had 30 incisions most all closed with this and steri strips.  On the third day following surgery I blistered badly around each incision site which was over most of my leg.  My surgeon had never experieced this reaction before.  The physician (s) I saw gave me a number of treatments to try.  Nothing worked better than peroxide and alcohol (rubbing). This dried up the blisters, but I after most dried, I broke out in a body rash, and then canker sore.   I had surgery 3/31/10 and today is 4/21/10 and still dealing with a terrible rash inbetween the sites.  Terrible itching as well.  On 4/20/10 I was put on Predisone 40 mg. once a day.  Yet no relief.  This has been a very long journey.

Two days later, my skin was extremely itchy.  Was told to take Benedryl.  Didn't help severe itching, went to surgeon who removed bandages and stated my reaction was the worst he'd ever seen.  Skin had white bumps all over.  Told to take steriods and frequent showers to get it off my skin.  That night, I woke up with blisters and my skin was fire red.  It has been 6 weeks after surgery and my skin is still not healed although it is much better than it was.  
Other	In Pain from Mastisol, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	2/26/2010 8:36:24 PM	After having hand surgery I noticed what looked like third degree burns around my incision site. It itched so badly so my doctor recommended Benedryl. It worked for two days and then it stopped working. I was then given a steroid and it still itches and seems to be getting worse. Hot showers make it worse and it has started to spread all over my back, legs and chest. Mastisol should be banned completely. I am not allergic to anything and this chemical creates giant blisters with puss that burns. This is a very dangerous and painful chemical. Always ask if they are using it before the surgery and stay away! Dateline should do a segment on the dangers of it.

I would HIGHLY encourage persons to have a small patch tested before a surgery requiring this medication.  I recently had another out-patient procedure and the nurse (not aware of my allergy) put a 1/2 inch strip of Mastisol on the area where I had stitches.  I caught her as she was putting it on and we immediately cleaned the site, but within hours I was fully broken out and spent nearly 3 weeks on steroids.  This medication has serious side-effects for those with an allergy to it.

Other	sadusseau, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	8/6/2009 2:17:46 PM	This adhesive was used, without my prior knowledge, to adhere the steri-strips &amp; tegaderm after a minor surgery on my thigh w/a 1-2 wk recovery cycle. What happened afterwards has turned into a MAJOR ordeal &amp; has me still limping 2 1/2 wks after surgery with a prognosis of another 4-6 wks recovery. Like others, I developed a very red, angry looking rash everywhere that Mastisol was applied, even though I cleaned all adhesives off with alcohol within 1-2 days of surgery. 16 days later and it's  still spreading and is now covering an area of about 12 inches circumference around my little 2-inch incision. Every day, the new bumps turn into hives and then a solid red patch by the end of the day. I look like I have some terrible disease but can't wear pants because of the swelling, stiffness, and itchiness. To add insult to injury, I developed an infection at the incision site within a few days of the surgery and had to have IV antibiotics. Since then, I have read on Mastisol's website that the product carries &quot;no guarantee&quot; of sterility. How in the world can someone sell this stuff in good faith AND how can doctors continue to use it on surgical sites with this kind of common reaction??

This is the second severe allergic reaction I have had to this drug, hives, oozing, itching and severe discomfort for days! I used it a second time because my doctor didnt believe me that I was allergic to Mastisol when I told him about my previous experience.
