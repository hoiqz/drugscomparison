Acne	ASmith, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	5		19-24	11/13/2011 7:39:52 AM	I've had acne since puberty. It started to really become a problem at 19. Tried many things and nothing worked. The doctor told me to wash with a benzoyl peroxide 10% face wash and prescribed retin a cream (.05%). The first month or so was had, and my face was dry, itchy and peeled, BUT trust me it is worth it. Stick with it. You will be thankful. My skin now has an even tone and looks soft. Retin a even made any scares on my face from acne go away. I only had minor ones, but still. Do make sure you listen to your doctor when he/she says only use a small amount and then build up. In the beginning I used too much one night and my face was really red for a week. Overall, I still use retin a and will continue to use it for a long time. My acne cleared up and my skin looks awesome. One last thing, make sure you wear a moisturizer with at least SPF 15 in it. I could never even use a moisturizer until this product or my face would break out, but wear one because this product will make your face sensitize to sun and will make your skin dry especially in the beginning. 
Acne	Lizzy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/16/2010 3:09:47 PM	  I've used this drug off and on as needed for over 15 years, and my skin is gorgeous. I don't have little wrinkles either. There are trade offs; I use a fat moisturizer because retinoids are drying. And when I need a course of it there is flushing, or a period of redness and worse acne. This is just chasing out the future zits forming and is worth waiting out- getting a bit worse before getting much better. I also use sunscreen and stay out of the sun when I can. Tough for an outdoorsy athletic type but with non greasy high spf suncreens I've kept it under control. And hats!   This drug can cause thinning of the skin which is why I rotate off of it when I'm doing well and taking good care of my skin makes the effects last for years! It's truly a miracle drug; I had horrible diseased looking skin until my twenties when I was put on this. It's been a true blessing.

Acne	kiysha, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/18/2010 9:09:49 PM	a small sample was given to me from a friend. I searched for 4 years trying to find what it was that she had given me ( she had moved a way and i had no contact info). I finally found her and got the name. I am confident again finally! i am in love with tnis product. Not only does it get rid of acne, it also helps with fading the scars, and fast!!
Acne	LoveMyGT, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/22/2010 12:29:24 PM	I've struggled with acne for about 5 years now, was using Proactiv off and on, which didn't work for me at all, Proactiv was a complete waste of money for me.  Scheduled an appointment with my dermotologist, he put me Minocyclin for 2 months in combination with Retin-A once a day at bedtime and Cleocin T pads twice daily.  My skin has improved greatly, been clear now for 3 months, still using Retin-A and will most likely continue using Retin-A to continue having clear skin, skin sensitivity is the only side effect I've had, and I think that's a small price to pay to have clear skin.  Overall I'm very happy with Retin-A.

Other	Angelbird, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	1/6/2010 7:50:52 PM	I started using it for acne; however, I also have malasma, and this is the first thing that I have used that is actually clearing it up. Several of my friends has noticed and I have not said a word to them about using it at all.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/24/2009 9:27:27 PM	I suffered from acne for many years.  Retin-A Micro is the best drug I have found to clear my acne.  I have used it for the past three years and have clear skin.  I used every OTC product out there (including proactiv) and none of them cleared my skin the way Retin-A did.  Excellent product.

In the beginning it Takes several weeks for your skin to adjust but once it does the results are unbelievable.  No adult acne and NO wrinkles..wish I had used it on my neck from the beginning !!!!!!
Other	CPS, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/9/2008 10:56:49 AM	I started using this medication for acanthosis nigricans (causes black patches of skin around neck.) It cleared it up wonderfully. I also started using it on my face for acne and acne scars. It worked wonders. Yes, at first it did make my face scaly, red, and at times burn, but it lasted maybe 2 weeks, and the end result is worth it. All the scars are gone, and my face has never looked better!

This product (purchased in Nogales, Mexico $8.00)has not only cleared up my acne, but has nearly erased my upper lip and &quot;smile&quot; wrinkles. What a great bonus!  I've been told I've taken 10 years off my face. Yes, the first few weeks, I was scaley.  I used a &quot;peel-off&quot; mask to get rid of the flakes with good results. Now I'm working on my sun damaged chest.  Looks good so far.
