Multiple Myeloma	CLIFFKU4GW, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	10/1/2011 10:31:32 AM	I have been on a 25 mg dose of this drug for 21 days per month for 6 months now and it has effectively dropped my m-spike protein level from 1.1 to 0.10 during this time period with little noticeable side effects. The only prevalent side effect I have experienced after 6 months use is a general feeling of being drained (very low energy levels).

Sores break out on roof, base, and side of tongue in clusters. After being on it for 6 months, it is finally under control. It is an effective but expansive drug. However, it does help to control pain &amp; re-occurance  of the outbreaks. End of my mysery! Finally I have a life to speak, eat, and drink water!

Multiple Myeloma	Captain Bob, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	55-64	10/22/2007 9:26:36 AM	After 7 months of use (increasing the dosage on a weekly basis from 25 mg to 100 mg), and also with the help of steroids,  my M protein levels were reduced to the point where I could have my stem cell procedure.  Through my own fault, I acquired neuropathy in both feet which might or might not be permanent.  I failed to tell my doctor of tingling sensations I had in my feet while increasing the dosages. Also, a blood clot formed in my right calf.  I was taken off coumidin and put on Lovenox (a self-administered shot twice a day, but with no side affects),  I preferred the Lovenox over the coumidin.
