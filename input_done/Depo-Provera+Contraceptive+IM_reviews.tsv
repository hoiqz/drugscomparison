Birth Control	D11, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	9/3/2012 10:16:21 PM	I am on my second shot, and it will most definitely be my last. I have bled the entire time that I have been on the shot, with just a couple of days free of bleeding. I have headaches every single day. Lately I started having body aches and stomach pains. Please seriously consider all other options before taking this shot. 
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	8/30/2012 11:41:42 PM	I have had severe bleeding for several years during my peri-menopausal time. My MD suggested this med. I have had two shots. My side effects: headaches, fatigue, bleeding for 2 months of the 3, weight gain, bone pain, hair loss, and acne. Acne at 40? Please don't take this medication. From a Labor and Delivery Nurse, don't take it!!

I have been on my period every single day for the last 8 months!!! DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG. very awful side effects. still waiting for my period to stop... it is absolutely miserable. 
Birth Control	tobeme, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	8/23/2012 1:38:30 PM	I used to get the depo shot when I was 15. I got 4 injections. I had no side effects. The only thing was I wouldnt have a period for 2 months, then for the entire last month i would have a period. The bleeding wouldnt stop until the day I got my shot.Now 21 I decided to get one depo injection to be protected until I got an Iud. I got the shot on my period, had a regular period. A month later got my period again and have been on it for over a month. Its very light, but still very annoying. Ive also gained 3 pounds. 
Birth Control	Lola Lola , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	19-24	8/16/2012 12:21:48 AM	I am a 21 year old female. I took the shot September of 2011 and I never took it again. ACNE AND LAZINESS WAS WHAT I GOT FROM USING THIS. And I have not had a regular period since....it is now August 2012. I may spot for a week and experience cramping but no regular periods. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS.
Birth Control	HeyyJessie22, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	8/13/2012 10:48:18 PM	I got the shot 4 times. After the 4th shot I decided to get off of the shot because I gained about 5 lbs. with every shot. With the first 3 shots I got my period about 2 weeks before I was supposed to get the shot again. It's now been a month since I was supposed to get the 5th shot and I still haven't had my period.  I also realized after the fourth shot that I was having headaches every day that I did not have when I was on the pill. I would not recommend to anyone to go on depo. the weight gain, headaches, bone loss, and uncertainty that go along with it aren't worth not having to take a pill every day.

Birth Control	HeatherHugz, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	5	1	Female	13-18	5/11/2012 10:07:04 AM	DO NOT GET THIS SHOT!I got my first depo in march of 2012. And i just turned 18 and i am a certified nurse assistant. Before the shot i was 130, 5'2&quot; . I am now 115, and still loosing. Which that part im happy about BUT.Ever since i have had increased anxiety and depression, hormonal, and the bleeding still has not stopped. I feel weak all the time and i don't feel like getting out of bed. If i fall or something i feel old because it hurts to get up and my body seems to take it way harder than it use to. I have lots of chest pains and i overall just dont feel good. This drug has a black box warning...I wish i would have done my research.Im due for my second shot in july. I'm not getting it, ever ever again.
Birth Control	Chelsea, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	2	5	2	Female	19-24	5/8/2012 2:40:13 PM	I started the shot when I was 15 and continued till I was almost 19 and I loved it! Never had any side effects (weight gain, acne, break through bleeding) but then I went off birth control entirely and then experimented with a few different kinds only to come back to Depo Provera last May. It's awful this go around! I bleed and spot for two months at a time and have absolutely no sex drive.. I finally switched to the patch four days ago and my month long period seems to be subsiding.. I wouldn't recommend the shot, but some people do have a good experience with it. Overall, not satisfied. Although I didn't get pregnant so that's good!
Birth Control	leahbean, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/30/2012 6:08:17 PM	I Have been on Depo for 7 years as my birth control. i haven't had any trouble with it at all its very effective and i only have to get my shot every 3 months... easiest birth control out there in my opinion.v
Birth Control	Greatb.c., 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/20/2012 11:30:23 PM	I have been on the depo since I was 17, I am now 24. I did experience MINOR spotting at the beginning which slowly decreased TO ABSOLUTELY NONE after short period of time. This usually was close to the time I was due for my shot. I choose this birth control for the ease of not having to remember to take a pill...Rest assure I was in a relationship for 6 years living together...so needless to say IT WORKS...I was concerned of the fact that they say not to be on this for a long period of time due to bone loss..but as a precautionary i asked my doctor to issue me a bone density test...which was perfectly normal about 2 years ago...I hear from alot of people that they got so fat on this ...personally i gained weight not from a drug...from eating at mcdonalds being comfortable in a relationship ...after gaining this weight i have recently in the past lost 54 lbs and kept it off for almost 2 years...so ladies don't blame the drug ...blame your eating habits! Definitely recommend this for everyone...I understand everyone is different and some people spot longer than most but it will stop in time...The fact that i hear all my friends complaining about periods ..just makes me smile and everytime i say &quot;I am so thankful i dont have to deal with that!&quot;

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/28/2012 12:14:58 AM	Depo has been great.  I haven't had a period, and likewise no cramps, for several years.  My cramps were so bad, I would have to take a day off from work every month.  I stopped getting the Depo shot only because the price charged by the providers went up by 150%!  I was due on 02/02/12, but didn't get it.  I'm curious to know what other women have experienced since quitting Depo.  My breasts, especially my nipples, have been very sensitive and painful since I didn't get my shot as due on 02/02/12.  Is this a normal withdrawal effect? 
Birth Control	JGreenstone, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	2/24/2012 9:27:01 AM	I received the depo-provera shot 1 month after giving birth to my 4th child and have not stopped bleeding in 4 months. The most frustrating is that I am a smoker over 35 so the dr keeps telling me to buck it up.  The extreme bleeding, mood instability and severe headaches have taken it's toll on my relationship.  I would NEVER suggest someone take a shot that lasts 3 months ever again and would not have taken it if the dr wouldn't have told me I didn't have a choice. When deciding whether or not to get this shot, DEFINITELY talk to your dr about side affects and what percentage of risk you are taking. Now that I am 4 1/2 months postpartum, the dr wants to run all kinds of tests and see what is really going on. This has been the most horrible experience I have ever had with medication.
Birth Control	Jessica, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	13-18	2/16/2012 4:31:59 PM	I started taking Depo-Provera because there was a possibility my boyfriend and I would become sexually active. I knew I would forget to take a pill everyday, and when I talked to my gynecologist, getting a shot once every three months sounded easy and convenient. I was told it would take a month or so for the drug to fully get into my system, and so for the first few weeks everything was normal. But after a month, I started having a period that has lasted for the past 2 months. My once clear face is now covered with acne, I have frequent migraines, and my doctor says there's a chance I may be anemic due to so much blood loss. If there's anything helpful I can say to you, it's simply to not use Depo-Provera. I know there are people who have used it and had a positive experience, but if ahead of time I would've known the possibility of these horrible side effects, I never would have risked using it. All the negative reviews on this website and others are not bored people making something up, they are people just like you who are trying to prevent their negative experience with this drug from happening to others. All I'm saying is know what you may be getting yourself into ahead of time, because once Depo-Provera is in your system, you're gonna have to wait a while before it's out.
Birth Control	Mt-mom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/1/2012 1:55:10 PM	It was suggestedby my dr that I try depo as a form of bc as my endometriosis has gotten worse after the birth of my two kiddos.  I love it! No weght gain, no bad side effects except some mild discomfort at the injection site for a few hours after the shot.  No period and I'm able to function normally as opposed to the severe bleeding and anemia I was experiencing while on  the pill alone.  Our family is complete so the issue of pregnancy after getting off depo is not a factor for me.  My husband would get a vascetomy, but that wouldn't help my severe bleeding issues.  I will continue to get my bone denisty tested.  I take calcium and d3 and lift weights on a 6 day split. So far, so good.  I am also a bodybuilding (figure) competitor and this has been fantastic as I've had no cravings so sticking to my cutting diet for competition is super easy. Overall, this has been a fantastic option for myself and family planning.
Birth Control	Rummyk, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	1/31/2012 8:26:03 AM	I started taking the shot because I had a hard time remembering to take the pill. WORST DECISION EVER! The first couple of weeks were fine, and then for the next 2 months I've been on my period! I have migranes EVERY DAY! Unless it's medically necessary, I would choose something else!
Birth Control	Melissa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	35-44	1/28/2012 9:32:48 PM	I started taking depo provera over 6 years ago (back before they had the warning label on it) I spotted a bit here and there for the first two months then it went away.  I kept taking the depo because my daily migraines were gone, no periods. no pregnancy.....what more could a woman want right? Wrong!!! My doctors were checking me for bone density. At first I had no bone loss (was taking calcium and magnesium supplements too) after the 5th year I went for my bone density test and docs suggested I do not take depo anymore cause I suffered a fair amount of my bone density (I am 39 now) I quit getting the depo shot.  I started to have alot of aches and pains in my body.  I am now on fibromyalgia medication.  Depo did more harm than it did good.  Please consider the negatives before the positives.  I wish I did :(
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	1/23/2012 5:53:42 PM	I am 25 years old and my husband and I just had our first child. We both agreed that we want to put some time beteween our children. So I chose this method, because I always forget to take the pill. I was excited to read that I may NOT have a period at all while on the Depo. A dream come true, so I thought. Unfortunately I have had my period for 2 months and 17 days, with NO break. Seriously consider if you are willing to go 3 months... I'm not, it was my first injection, and it will be my last! I didn't read any reviews until after getting the Depo Injection, I'm regretting that decision now! 
Endometriosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/11/2012 5:07:20 PM	I started on depo almost 8 years ago after a few months of treatment with Lupron.  The depo has completely taken care of the Endometriosis problem (I had two surgeries in 4 years - none since I started the depo).I loved not having a period.  I can't say I had any mood swings like others reported, and no real hair loss either.  I did gain about 40 pounds, but as that occurred during the same time I was switching from an active college lifestyle to my sedentary desk job, I'm not willing to completely blame the depo for that.I finally got off the depo because I'm thinking about getting pregnant in the near future.  I'm now on Seasonique and I hate, hate, hate the spotting, which I never had with the depo.
Endometriosis	tag, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	12/11/2011 7:09:02 AM	I was on the shot for ten years due to debilitating cramps and excessive bleeding associated with my menstrual cycle. I loved this drug because I got my life back. I started it while on my first combat tour to Afghanistan because I could not do my job with the excessive bleeding and cramps. The shot essentially shut down my reproductive system - no cramps, no bleeding, no horrible mood swings. I had no major negative side effects from the drug until probably the seventh year into the shots. I noticed that I had no real emotions and was sort of numb. I did not cry more than once a year and did not experience real happiness. That is the main reason I went off the drug. I did not note any weight gain nor did any of my friends, but this is probably because as members of the military  we were accustomed to having discipline in our exercise and eating habits. I could see a woman easily gain weight while on the drug because it does seem to increase your appetite. Thus, you need to have a lot of discipline when you are on this drug. Otherwise you will be unhappy with it in the long-term. I chose to stop the drug when I came into the window for my next shot on October 14, 2011 (two months ago). I bled for approximately ten days and that was the end of the major withdrawal effect other than my breast increasing a full cup size thanks to the estrogen. I noticed my moods return to normal very quickly (probably two weeks after the bleeding stopped) so I would cry again and otherwise have a positive outlook on life. I ovulated a month after being off the shot and have had what is probably normal period (albeit light with no major cramps) two weeks later. I should mention that I had the Mirena IUD inserted in early November, which may be part of the reason the period was light. In essence, I returned to normal very quickly and the IUD probably staved off a return to painful periods. I should note that I run approx 10 miles a day, which probably helped to quickly metabolize it.
Birth Control	Bee, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	12/10/2011 2:23:37 AM	No pregnancy for a shot every three months seemed like a good deal, but the array of side effects had me switching b/c methods after nine months. I was moody, suffering from light bleeding for weeks-to-months at a time. Sex drive depleted and difficulty producing vaginal fluids, so sex was uncomfortable regardless. Was hungry frequently too. Overall I am glad I made the switch off. My advice:If it isn't working for you, switch sooner than later.
Birth Control	Luna, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	12/7/2011 11:06:18 PM	I used this for birth control and had been getting it for 3 years. I ended up bleeding &amp; spotting for the whole time (except the first two months) and now the lining of my uterus is paper thin. Also the side effects were killing me: NO sex drive At All,Extreme anxiety/depression,iron deficiency,diarrhea,nausea,weight gain (30pds)-lost too much weight because of the nausea recently and am very sickly. And the fact that my hair (which was long) fell out the entire time was not a plus either! I know that people want to take this to not have a period/seems &quot;simple/easy&quot;-- but beware, mostly it doesn't work like that and you're better off taking something else. I was so close to being put into a psych hospital it's not even funny! Now my doctor put me on a low estrogen bc: Jolivette...well see how That works out. Ah...the joys of being a woman.:) Good Luck

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/13/2011 9:05:54 PM	I was on this shot after i had my daughter in may of 07. I received my last shot in sept of 08. I weighed about 150 lbs(which is healthy weight for me) while on this shot however the longer i was on it the more the weight would creep up. I had also had a few very close friends gain enormous amounts of weight. I weigh an average of 200 after done with the shot. I eat the same and exercise the same as i did before the shot. My friends literally gained about 50 lbs while on this for a year!!! Nothing we have tried has helped us gained weight. I have tried dieting and working out everyday and still cant seem to get the weight back off!! I also read a study one time that said if you were on the shot for 2 years and gained weight it would be 10 times harder to lose weight after you quit the shot. I also had very bad mood swings and once i stopped the shot it took me about 9 months to get a period and over 2 years to get pregnant again and I was trying to get pregnant with my boyfriend! Overall i will never again use this form of birth control. I had a boy back in aug of 11 and my dr demanded i get my tubes tied or get the shot. So i had no choice but to get the shot again. I will not be getting any more EVER!! Id rather use condoms. 
Birth Control	Moody girl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	10/26/2011 4:31:34 PM	I got the shot a little over three months ago. I reacted very poorly to it. I was either on my period or had heavy spotting throughout the majority of the cycle. Normally I have a high sex drive, that decreased immensely. When I would have sex it was near impossible to orgasm when prior to getting the shot was never an issue. I was emotional...always crying or freaking out. Unlike others didn't have problems with weight gain or acne, but the side effects are enough for me to stop and try something different. Everyone reacts differently but I reacted terribly to the Depo shot.
Birth Control	xtrasweet52, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	3	3	1	Female	19-24	10/25/2011 7:31:18 PM	I am 20 years old and I was on this birth control for the past 7 months. Yeah it kept me from getting pregnant... but i experienced some of the worst side effects from it. I had excessive periods... like 3 weeks out of every month i was bleeding. Because of that i rarely could engage in sexual activity. My mood had changed dramatically the whole time i was on this birth control. I was constantly snapping on people for little things, things that most people would not normally stress about, and i began to show little interest in stuff i ususlly like to do.  My moodiness, anxiety, and stress was way out of whack, and i actually came to a point where i was beginning to think i was not a normal person. My sex drive became significantly low... i barely wanted to be touched. I was also experiencing hair loss, and mild acne on my face. Im glad to be off of it now! Now that im off the depo all those side effects are disappearing. I now feel great and 100 percent normal physically, mentally, and emotionally. I do not, and will not recommend depo to anyone after what has happened to me and what ive experienced with it... but as for those of you who are having a wonderful time while on the depo ill give you kudos and i hope what happened to me will not happen to you.
Birth Control	Apryl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	10/23/2011 9:30:51 PM	I had been on the depo shot for 6 years. I have been off of it for 3 months now. My periods stopped right away and I did not ''spot'' at all. In 6 years I gained 10 pounds. It's very hard to control wieght on the depo. My side effects were hair loss (always shedding... hair EVERYWHERE!), complexion worsened, depression, needed A LOT of sleep, anxiety, and mood swings. I am 25 years old and had perfect health prior to getting the depo. I am now trying to get pregnant and know it could be a long wait. It's been 3 months since my last dose and still no period. I was instantly able to drop weight and did not change my eating patterns or exercise regimen. Clearly, the depo was effecting that. My skin is now clear as well. Still feeling like it's working it's way out of my system. Mood has went back to normal. I would not recommend this drug to a family member or friend. My doctor did not tell me the risks of being on it for long periods of time (not recommended for longer than 2 years.)Also, my Doctor mentioned to take calcium but didn't stress how important this is. I'm sure I will have osteoporosis later in life. I will never go back on the depo shot again.

Got on it to help my sex life but so far has ruined it. If I would've known this was going to happen I probably wouldn't have done it. Hoping this stops soon. Very irritating. Cramps too.

I find it to be 100% effective and easy to remember. Every 3 months I go to my gyn's office and the nurse there gives me my shot. I have experienced some mild breakout on my face but it goes away a week after I get the shot. Overall it is worth it:)

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	19-24	8/30/2011 5:04:06 PM	I was on depo for 2 years total... It caused me to gain ALOT of weight... i'm 5'10 and when i first got on it i was 125 lbs... too tiny i know but still. I got up to 170 lbs... when my ex and i broke up, I got off of it, figured i wasn't active no point in payin for it. I dropped weight so fast down to 135 my dads girlfriend thought i had stopped eating (Which was not the case)... I got on it again and am now 182 lbs... I got off of it because weight gain is HORRIBLE. Just got the Paragard IUD yesterday, we'll see how this works out. No hormones for me... too much weight gain which causes depression and everything else because it caused me to not be comfortable with myself. It's convenient and great if you don't have the weight gain side effect... but watch out for bone loss after being on it too long... had to check mine after only two years.

But 15 years later, I have suffered from extreme weight gain and excessive bleeding until I had a procedure to stop it.  I don't advise anyone to take this medicine.  It has adversely affected my life. 
Birth Control	l_thompson, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/27/2011 3:04:57 PM	This was recommended to me by my bosses wife years ago. I have been taking it since 1997 &amp; love it. No periods, &amp; I only think about BC every 3 months - it's wonderful for my active lifestyle. I have started to show some bone density loss &amp; have started an osteopenia drug, extra calcium &amp; vitamin D to counter the loss. (Not sure if it's the Depo or the use of steroids to treat my MS attacks that is the culprit of the density loss.) I may have to switch BC if it continues, but I sure hope not. Right now the doc is content to let me stick with what is working so well for me. This RX is great to me &amp; I really don't want to change unless the replacement is comparable to Depo! In reading up on 'new' BC options - nothing else seems to come close!

I went on Depo instead. I like that you get the shot every 3 months, easy to remember. I am glad I started using Depo. I have been on Depo for 10 months. My periods have completely stopped the first shot. I do not have my painful/extreme fatigue/breast soreness periods I used to have anymore where I would have to call off work or go to the hospital for treatment of pain and bleeding. I'm grateful for that to have ended being on Depo. My fatigue has decreased a lot since using Depo thankfully. I do not experience decreased sex drive others have on Depo. Overall I feel great no negative issues that others are experiencing on Depo. I feel bad for those that don't have a good experience on this shot. I've actually been able to lose 30 lbs over the last 6 months and my bone density is still perfect. I suppose I got lucky. I will keep an eye out when the 1 yr mark comes on the Depo if anything changes to a negative using it I will get off of it then. 
Birth Control	 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female		6/11/2011 12:30:58 AM	I havent gotten pregnant so i guess it is doing its job but i wasnt told about the side effects and i have basically all of them. yeah its nice to not have to take a pill but its not worth all of the side effects
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/1/2011 11:08:40 PM	I was on Depo for 9 years. I never had any side effects, other than not having my period for the past 9 years. After much consideration, I have taken myself off of this and I am now on Ortho-Tricyclen. Depo has warnings of bone loss. I also feel that it isn't safe for a womans body to not have a period for this long. My GYN said this is not true, but I don't believe her.
Other	L8 Bloomer, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	5/6/2011 6:42:10 PM	I was prescribed this medication to treat my severe cramps during my menstrual cycles ever since I had to start taking blood thinners for CLOTS.  The Dr. told me I was not at risk because the progesterone is not as dangerous as estrogen, and besides, I'm already on anticoagulants.  I was administered the shot 3 weeks ago.  The first week was okay.  But since the second week, I've had my period (not spotting as was explained) constantly, in addition to cramps (albeit less severe than before), bloating, and about 5 lbs. weight gain.  Both my OB/GYN and my PCP recommend me getting another one to see if my body &quot;adjusts.&quot;  They must be getting wined and dined by the pharmaceutical reps.  My body says &quot;NO WAY!!&quot;  Plus, I explained to my Dr. that my Mom has extremely advanced osteoporosis.  Why would she prescribe a drug with known side effects of bone loss?  Unfortunately, I didn't read about all of this until I got home after having been administered the shot.  I hope it gets out of my body soon!!
Birth Control	Sassyeclipse03, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/28/2011 2:07:16 PM	This is my third time using Depo as a form of birth control. The first time I used it I did have minor hair loss. I didnt gain anything and didnt notice any mood swings but I did have some serious cravings as if I were pregnant. I just had to be aware and keep them in check. I was off of it for 2-3 months before I became pregnant with my 3rd child. After having my 3rd I went back on the shot and didnt experience any hair loss or weight gain but still had the cravings. I missed my shot for about a month before I got a &quot;period.&quot; The period lasted 9 days. It was the most bleeding I had ever done even taking into consideration the bleeding that happens after having a baby. I know everyone is different and some people experience the side effects differently. When I am on the shot I do not have a period and every couple of months I will lightly spot. For myself I love it. My only issue is keeping the cravings in check so I dont gain any weight. My sister was on the shot and experienced the hair loss, cravings and weight gain. So, like I said its different for everyone, but for myself its a good choice. I am considering the IUD though so I can have even more freedom with my birthcontrol.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/14/2011 9:58:40 PM	I have been on Depo for 12 years and have never had any side effects that seem abnormal. I think I'm kinda a moody drama queen any way...physically, it's been great. I've never had a period, never spotted, never had any pain or weight gain. I took a bone scan about five years ago and everything was fine...the doctor said my active lifestyle (jogging/tennis) promoted strong bones. I'm going off now only because &quot;we&quot; want to have a baby in the next 2-3 years and I'm unsure how long it will take to begin to ovulate after 12 years...anyway...if I wasn't considering pregnancy I would stay on it my whole life...was the best thing ever...
Birth Control	Timbre, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	4/12/2011 4:55:48 PM	I had been on Depo for 3.5 years and now being off of it, i have had cramps 24/7 that are so painful im throwing up. i have NEVER had that problem in my life.  My good friend was on depo for only 3 years, shes been off for 2 years, still has no period AND it has no prevented her from ever having kids. a couple other friends who were on it for less time had their reproductive system really messed up by it too. THIS IS A HORRIBLE DRUG! DO NOT TAKE!  If i had known these side affects i NEVER would have taken it before. EVER!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	4/8/2011 2:17:01 AM	I wouldn't wish this medication on my worst enemy.  If I could go back I would have never gone one it. DO.NOT. try it. I've come across too many horrible side affects to list them all
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	4/2/2011 5:46:58 PM	This medication stopped my periods thus stopping my painful cramps and iron anaemia. It was also the only protection I used for four years and kept me from pregnancy. However, upon stopping the medication I am experiencing severe depression. Talk with your physician and consider the withdrawal symptoms before beginning depo.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	3/9/2011 9:30:48 PM	After I had my third child my doctors suggested that I take the shot. The beginning of October in 2010 I received my first shot but it was after the second shot I started experiencing serious problems. I began feeling very depressed and having pains in my abdomin. I was bleeding off and on for the whole three months with only a few days in the week that i was not. I was getting up in the middle of the night eating and gained ten pounds and feel very bloated in my stomach. I have a complete loss of sexual intrest. I am due for my next shot in one week and can not wait until I am free of this contraceptive and may never take one again. This has effected my family and my relationships with other people. I am tired of feeling this way and hope that anyone considering using the shot to not receive the injection. It works but ruins you in so many ways.. 
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	13-18	3/6/2011 5:51:32 PM	I started Depo almost two weeks ago. I chose this option because my doctor told me that the pill would increase my risk of stroke due to my migrane history. The actual vaccination itself was so painful. Probably the worst I've ever had. The first few days I got really severe mood swings and was generally in a terribe mood. It felt like everyone was against me. Now, most of that has subsided.I have yet to have my period. 
Birth Control	Victoria, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	3/5/2011 12:50:33 PM	My first period after getting my first injection of this was 3 weeks long. The bleeding was extremely light, but annoyingly long. I was much moodier before my periods, after not having PMS at all before. I was also having a lot of leg/joint pain near my knees while walking but I'm not sure if it was due to this.

They do not warn you at the time of taking this injection, you only get happy that you will be relieved from the monthly periods. If you are thinking of ever having a baby in your life, STAY AWAY AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM DEPO
Endometriosis	mona, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	2/20/2011 10:30:03 PM	I originally started Depo when I was in high school after a recommendation from a nurse to help with severe cramps and a very heavy period. My periods became lighter and after 6 months, they were gone altogether. Depo works well for heavy/painful periods and later I used it for birth control as well, BUT I gained 10 pounds within a week of my first shot. I eventually gained more. I could only lose the weight after getting off Depo years later. While on Depo, my sex drive was nonexistent and I was mostly depressed and moody. It led to my then-boyfriend leaving me. After I was off Depo, I felt emotionally stable again. 
Birth Control	Renee, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	3	Female	19-24	2/15/2011 11:56:02 PM	I got my first shot at my 6 week checkup. My first two weeks were wonderful, until i got my first period. Today makes day 16. And my cycle ts still own......this sucks. Easy to remember, just hard to stop bleeding.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	2/6/2011 3:04:38 AM	I would NOT recommend this. At first i loved it, didn't get a period for the first six months.  but now I've been bleeding for almost 5 months..straight. I'm tired all the time, get horrible shooting pains all over my body and cry all the time over nothing. Worrying about taking a pill everyday sounds way better then staying on this for another three months
Birth Control	Marathon1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	2/3/2011 6:08:33 PM	A few years ago I was switched from the pill to Depo because my blood pressure was rising for no reason.  (I had no problem taking the pill every day). I just started reading about what others have gone through with Depo and I had NO idea about the side effects. I'm so glad to know I'm not crazy!! I was on it for 4 years and stopped 2 months ago. I work out almost every day, sometimes twice if I can, was a fitness instructor for many years, run marathons and tri's. Some blame the weight gain on age(44).  I gained 20 lbs. This is really devastating to me. The depression and mood swings that I read about with everyone else totally match my symptons. I would not recommend this drug.  I'm happy that I've found some answers and sad to learn that more information was not presented to us on the negative side effects. 
Birth Control	Mandy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	1	Female	19-24	1/29/2011 2:47:15 PM	This drug almost ruined my life. It wasn't until I stopped the injections that I noticed how serious the side effects were. I bled constantly for the 6 months on depo and 3 months afterward. I full 9 months of bleeding, it made my life hell. My sex drive was non-existent, I sunk into a deep depression, and the strain on my relationship with my fiance was excruciating. Between the mood swings, lack of sex drive, and depression, our relationship was failing. I stopped the injections, continued to bleed for 3 months, and now (more than 8 months after my last injection) my period is just returning to a normal 28 day cycle. We have been trying to get pregnant for 4 months, to no avail. If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have even considered letting that poison be injected into my system.

I was told that i'm in the perimenuposal stage.  my gyn dr. told me that he's going to stop giving me the injections.  at the time i was 49, i was due for a shot in july 2010, which he refused to give me.  it's been 7 months, no period, but breast are tender and i have cramps, i hope i get my period back.  yes, i do have body aches, especially in the back and knees.  no wonder my endo dr. keeps telling me that i need to take more vitamin D.  how long must i wait to have my period again?
Birth Control	SG1,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female		1/14/2011 12:12:09 AM	I have been on depo for about nine months and love it.  I was on the pill before, but my dr. had me stop taking it because I was having severe migraines constantly.  She said because of the migraines with the birth control pill I was at an increased risk for a stroke.  Since being on the shot, I have not had any migraines.  I know a lot of women also worry about gaining weight on the shot.  I do feel more hungry then I did before, but I just watch my calories and hit the gym a couple times a week.  I have not gained any weight.  Also, I take calcium and vitamin D because of the risk of bone loss.  Overall, I think it is great and it works for me, but everybody is different.  
Birth Control	need to sue, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	1/6/2011 1:02:01 AM	In 1994 I received two injections of this drug, did not realize the later in life(almost 12 years later) that by taking this drug back then would cause me to have PCOS(Poly-Cystic Ovary Syndrome), diabetes, heart palpitations, and uterine fibroids, now(17 years later) at a young 36 years old, I can no longer have any children. DO NOT USE DEPO....
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	12/27/2010 11:22:56 AM	I used to recommend this med to my friends when I first started.  That was a year and half ago.  Now, I regret ever starting this med and DO NOT recommend it to anyone.  At first it was great.  I tried this because I was sick of remembering the pill everyday, it was convient (1 shot every 3 months and no periods (stopped immediately).  However, a year and half later, I now realize a lot of my health issues during this time are all attributed to Depo.  In the last 5 months, I have gained OVER 20lbs.  I went from having a fast metabolism to one that is NONEXISTANT!  I have even tried dieting and working out more just to MAINTAIN my weight and it doesn't work.  I keep gaining and CAN'T lose the weight.  I went from being thin to looking like I'm 5 months pregnant.  I get super food craving and my appetite has increased A LOT.  I'm super tired all the time.  I could sleep over 10 hours and STILL be tired.  I get migranes but Depo has made them 10 times worse and more frequent.  I have increased anxiety since starting.  In the last 6 months, I have lost my sex drive entirely!  I have absolutely NO desire to have sex.  And then there's the bone loss and the BLACK BOX WARNING!  I overlooked this.  Shortly after starting this med, I started getting joint pain.  I went to a doctor thinking it might be arthritis, was tested and it came back normal.  I now realize that this is because of Depo.  I sometimes wake up with HORRIBLE hip pain, so bad I can barely walk.  I get pain in my wrists and knees.  I even get bad jaw pain and it now has started to hurt when I talk, chew and I even get lock jaw (which has never happened before Depo).  I've had blood tests, including thyroid, to make sure it wasn't something else.  All my labs are normal.  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION!  IT DOES HUGE DAMAGE TO YOUR BODY!  IT SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET!!!  I hope this helps someone from taking this medication so you don't regret it like I do!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	12/24/2010 3:45:22 AM	i started on birth control when i was 18yrs old and i stayed on it for 2 years and recently stopped receiving injection.  i thought it would be perfect not having to take a pill every day. the birth control did its job and easy to use. i had no periods after the 3rd injection. i did not gain any weight, if anything my weight stayed constant even though i ate more than usual and didn't exercise after high school. i did not know what the side effects were, i only took it because i did not have to deal with pills. but now that i have been 8 months off of depo i have realized that i went through terrible mood swings, decreased sex drive, decreased vaginal secretions, muscle aces and bone aches. i knew about the bone density loss but didnt think that it would affect me that much. now that i am off of it, i have gained 10 lbs which it weird... and i have the urge to want to have sex like normal, i am able to cum when having an orgasm and i just feel happier than the past 2 years. i did not read the side affects of this drug until recently because of my happier moods and sex life, and it was all because i was on depo. people are different and will have different reactions, but personally i would not recommend this birth control due to all the side affects.

He assured me it would ease my pain and had few side effects.  Within 10 days I had heart palpitations, chest pain, and my blood pressure went sky high.  I ended up on blood pressure lowering medication.  My sleep was disrupted and I started to feel unhappy.  I was advised by another doctor to take an antidepressant or sleeping pills.  No, thank you, I declined.  Enough medicine already!!  I ended up after only one shot very sick for over 2 months, fatigue that never ended, laying around all day so tired I could barely function.  Now I have to eat gluten free since I developed food sensitivities.  Getting the shot was one of the worst decisions of my life.  DON'T get it!!!!  There are natural alternatives for pelvic pain.  At least eating gluten free is helping me immensely and I realize that most of my symptoms would have been helped by this diet anyway.  If I get pain back, I will talk to my new holistic doctor about natural progesterone cream.  A much safer alternative.

I've been on it for 14 years and I haven't gained weight nor do I have any periods.  I do get headaches but nothing that's untolerable.

After having my baby back in February, I was told from my doctor that since I was breastfeeding that this form of birth control was the only one that I could get on. (really wanted to get on the patch) So I said ok and went on to my first shot. Worst decision Ive made. The first 3 months were cool. I had one period that lasted about 3 days and after that no more periods. But after my second shot I noticed that I would have headaches every day, then on top of that I started bleeding for a whole month straight. So on my 3rd shot visit I told my doctor about everything that was going on. She told me that the bleeding would stop. That the only reason why I was bleeding for so long was because I was nearing my next shot. Its been 2 months since my 3rd shot and I'm still bleeding. I will not be getting a 4th shot!!! DO NOT TAKE!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	11/17/2010 1:28:00 AM	i used depo for 2 years starting wen i was 18 . in the time i was on it i had horrible depression and anxiety. i lashed out over things that are not worth the arguement i put towards them.i almost ruined my relationship and i had no clue it was even happening until i decided to just get  off. the horemon levels in the depo are just wayy to high and should be off the RX chart, seriouslyyy i couldnt beleive how much better i felt wen i finallly got off . i was soo much more tolerable and didnt freak out over the smallest things, im now going to be starting loestrin which is a low horemon daily pill. say no to depo . although i never gained or lost weight and loved that i stopped my period but still the trouble it caused me wasnt at all worth it.

Please don't! I got Depo in the beginning of September. It is now November 11th. I have only had two weeks NOT bleeding. That means I have been bleeding and in severe pain for almost 3 consecutive months! It has been insane. Most days I can hardly get out of bed, because the cramping is so intense. Sometimes I just spot, and then all the sudden I will just gush for a few hours out of no where. very inconvenient and it leaves me nauseas and weak. More than that; I am in tears half the time over what to do. I am in so much pain, and so tired from lack of sleep that I cannot work most of the time. I'm telling you' this shot has really wreaked havoc in my life. I have no sleep, no energy; only pain...and no sex drive. My husband has been patient but I feel so bad.The doctors are urging me to get another shot in a week; that it will get better. No way! Everyone I talk to says it will only get worse. I wish I would have known. This is worse than my endometriosis  pain ever was! Don't get this shot...please!

I am a 25yrd female with NO health problems and on 10/18 I had a stroke with no warnings I was layed up in the hospital for 9 days. All due to this horrible drug per Doctors. IT has almost ruined my life I have 2 beautiful children whom I am unbale to care for. Great job I am unable to return to. If anything I want to save someone else from going throught the same thing I have had to endure. Please look into your family history, educate yourself about the drug take the side effects seriously because they will and can change your life forever. 
Birth Control	Angie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	10/29/2010 12:58:38 AM	At first this was the best BC I ever used. The first injection I received, I had no problems. No periods, no side effects, etc. After my second injection, I began bleeding during the second month and kept bleeding/spotting for 2 months straight (everyday)!!! I mean I know its suppose to prevent pregnancy, but its pretty hard to get pregnant if you can barely have sex because you are always on your period! Plus I had cramps more than usual, I felt sleepy all the time, and had zero desire for sex. Anyways, so I spoke with my doctor about these symptoms, she said it takes time for my body to get use to it, so I should try one more injection. After my 3rd injection, same thing: a 2-month long period, cramps all the time, and very low sex drive. And I don't want to blame the pill, but I gained 30lbs while taking the shot. At first, I blamed it on my inactivity, but after working out 5x/week for 5 months and changing my diet, I still couldn't get my extra weight off. So after my 3rd injection, I've had it. I just started the Nuvaring today. I hope it will be better because I suck at taking the pill. Every woman's body is different, so therefore we all respond to these drugs. Hope this helps someone going through the same thing.
Birth Control	jeepgirl183, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/26/2010 12:32:49 PM	I went on Depo after being on the pill (Apri) for 6 months.  I was a wreck on the pill - depression, mood swings, loss of energy &amp; libido.  Depo has been amazing - I've had 3 periods, each only one day, in the 7 years I've been on Depo.  I've not gained any weight (I do hit the treadmill about 30 minutes 3x/week, but this was through all of undergrad and graduate studies.)  I have some symptoms of a menstrual cycle - once a month I get very thirsty (used to be my most pronounced PMS symptom) and my skin breaks out a bit (from completely clear to a pimple or two.)  I find my libido is actually increased, sometimes to a point of being distracting, not just right after I receive a shot but monthly in line with the shots (if I get the shot on the Jan 1, my libido is increased Feb 1 &amp; March 1, etc.) - something my boyfriend certainly doesn't mind!  I recently had a bone density test and I'm right on target for my age (27), not bad considering both my grandmothers &amp; mom have been treated for osteoporosis.  I'm completely satisfied with this option.
Birth Control	M. M., 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/9/2010 5:54:58 PM	I started taking Depo in 2007 after having a miscarrage.  I spotted very little in the first 6 months. I have gained about 20 pounds. My quit taking my shots on October 7 and am now wondering about what my body is fixing to do now that i am off of the drug. I loved! depo it was soo easy and i never worried about anything. The only downside is i lost all sex drive which has been a constant battle with myself and my other half. Hope this helps somebody somehow out there researching.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/4/2010 1:43:36 AM	I've been on Depo for over two years now, if anything I've lost weight between now and when I started taking it, granted I have a ridiculous metabolism but I thought it would help me gain weight which hasn't happened. I only had to deal with spotting for the first couple months and since then not a single period. Mine were particularly bad so its been wonderful. No more mood swings or sitting on the toilet for hours crying. I would suggest it to anyone who isn't already struggling with weight issues. Its a great alternative to trying to remember to take the pill at the same time every day and while some people may not have had positive experiences with it I absolutely have. 
Birth Control	Kaitlyn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/14/2010 4:51:17 PM	I have been on Depo since June 1997 and it is a Godsend to me no more periods to worry about no more did I remember to take the pill this morning can wear white anytime of the month it is just great I have had none of the side effects others here have spoke about all except the last week of the month when i would normally get my period I do have a bad headache for about 3 days that is all I wouldnt stop taking this for anything as far as weight gain I may have gained 5 lbs which isnt really a problem bottom line is I love love love it!!!!!! NO PERIOD FOR 12+ YEARS NOW YIPEE!!!
Other	Rendy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/4/2010 5:29:50 PM	For 4 years, had horrible menstruals. Large clots, cramps and bleeding so bad that it kept me from leaving the house when I had my period. It lasted 10 or more days twice a month. I may have 5-8 days of not bleeding. The pain was so bad, I was doubled over most of the time. I had constant bowel problems whenever I had cramps. I was spending sometimes days in the bathroom. I took one Depo shot, by 7 that night my period was very light. By 5 the next day, it was stopped. I'm in my 30's and don't want kids, so this is all good for me. What works great for one may harm another, just like any other medication. I have yet to gain weight. But I had horrible migraines before, now they're less actually.Good luck on your choice. Do not let all the bad reviews scare you. Half of the people that this medication helps, don't post. But people that want to complain, will post. So you'll see mostly the angry people. Do your research. Not just based on reviews.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	9/1/2010 9:42:53 PM	I started taking the pill when i was 18 and i never had a problem with it. My mother suggedted depo and i did research it a little and i was extremely cautious about getting it, i had just lost 80 pounds and was doing great! and then i started the shot, ive been on it for a year now and it has been horrible! I have since gained all my wieght back and then some, i am so moddy that my fiance doesnt want to be near me and i have random crying spells. I would not recommend this to any one!! my best friend stoped hers about 2 months ago and has already lost 20 pounds that it caused her to gain! I never changed my eating or excersise habits and now i have ballooned to this giant 21 year old about to get married and i cant even lose weight because of this shot! as for my sex drive... its kinda gone too, everyonce in a while ill want to have sex but for the most part i dont. DO YOURE RESEARCH!!! THE PILL MAY BE HARDER TO KEEP TRACK OF BUT IF I COULD GO BACK I NEVER WOULD HAVE STARTED THIS SHOT!! NOT IN A MILLION YEARS!!! 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	8/19/2010 5:32:03 PM	I've been on the shot for nearly 2 yrs. (I'm getting my final shot in Sept,which will conclude the 2 yrs.)It has worked extremely well,as both my fiance AND I are very fertile,&amp;I have not had any &quot;scares&quot;-depo is VERY reliable.But after 1 yr,an arthritic-type pain swept over every single bone in my body-from my toes to my neck.Blood was drawn-no arthritic factor WHATSOEVER,but my Vit.D level was DANGEROUSLY low;no matter how much Vit.D supplements I take,my body won't absorb it&amp;my bones ACHE and THROB worse&amp;worse EVERY DAY.I've been in tears multiple times,&amp;I can HANDLE pain!! I also developed IBS-complications digesting food;it's as though my metabolism was practically haulted,as I've gained nearly 40 lbs.(More than what I gained when I was pregnant w/my daughter.)My bowels&amp;digestive system are so messed up, &amp;shortly after I get the shot I have bowel movements that smells like pure metal-gross I know, but it's the chemicals, the TOXINS that your body clashes with.I get dizzy quite easily,depressed&amp;emotional at the drop of a hat, &amp;began having anxiety attacks BAD about 6 mos ago. Also, when the bone issues began approximately a year in,that's when my fingers and toes began tingling&amp;going completely numb,as well as the left side of my face.Most recently,I've begun to have SHARP stabbing pain in my uterus-scariest of ALL.I have experienced so many dangerous side effects--I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that if you DO use this,DON'T STAY ON IT MORE THAN A YEAR!It eats bone density-I can tell you that from personal experience.I have to go to physical therapy AND the chiropractor constantly&amp;it only keeps the pain at bay for a couple hours.I'm 21-yrs-old,taking opioids for pain,walkin around slow&amp;stiff 24-7.I'm so overweight I cannot keep up with my 2-yr-old. I'm getting off of this shot SOON, getting in shape&amp;NEVER using this med again.I agree with a previous comment that the FDA should NOT approve this drug the way it is,or doctors should only allow TEMPORARY (less than a yr)use

Had 2 shots almost 2 years ago and it has ruined my life!!  I bled the entire time i was on this drug.  I became moody and a complete hypochondriac.  Also suffered panic attacks and terrible anxiety.  Wish I could go back in time and never get it!  Wouldn't recommend this to anyone
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	8/16/2010 4:16:16 PM	I started the Depo shot about six months ago (2 shots). There are both positive and negative things about the depo shot.  The negative things are that I gained 10-15 pounds within these six months, and I became very emotional and depressed.  I hated it so I recently switched to the pill. The depo shot takes a long time to get out of your system, and I haven't had a period for about 5 months now. I can't wait till it's completely out of my body! The only positive thing is that you don't have to take it daily and there's a very low risk of becoming pregnant. But I definitely DO NOT recommend the depo shot to anyone, there are so many more birth control options that are better.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	8/6/2010 11:01:31 PM	Since i stopped taking the depo shots i have developed ovarian cyst and i have bleed for two months now i am anemic and have to be on the pill for the estrogen because my body has none, i have to go to the gyno every 2weeks for blood test to make sure that im ok...im in pain every day and now rely on pain killers everyday because it is unbearably. i regret taking depo and would never recommend it EVER.
Birth Control	MiracleShot, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	13-18	8/5/2010 12:35:12 AM	Depo has been awesome for me. I've been on it for almost two years. I havent gained any weight, im completely healthy, no period, no babies. I decided to take this version of birth control because its the easiest and one of the most effective in my opinion. One shot every three months, done. 
Birth Control	19-24 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	4	4	1		19-24	8/4/2010 6:18:58 PM	I have been on the Depo shot for a little over a year now and I cannot wait for this to be rid of my body! I have gained so much weight, bloat, and have painful side effects. One scary side effect included SEVERE abdominal pain so bad I almost fainted, complete numbness of my left arm and beading sweat (all at once). I DO NOT RECOMMEND this birth control. Sex drive has been completely killed (I'm 23 c'mon now), uncontrollable mood swings, depression, and total loss of control of my emotions. I feel dominated by this drug and question why the FDA ever put it out on the market. Yea, not getting your period is pretty cool but definitely not worth all these terrible side effects. Many women have also become sterile from this shot. DO NOT DO IT.

But now, I'm dealing with SEVERE BACK PAIN. It sucks because now I can't deal with ADL(activites of daily living! Nothing works for the pain, and I cant do anything without it hurting. Also in the beginning I had severe mirgarines, so I also had to get on a drug for that, because they didnt go away. Overall I used to weight 152 lbs before Depo and now I weight atleast 205 withing the 3 1/2 years being on this. My last shot was is March 2010.....and I DO NOT RECOMMEND this to NO ONE!!!
Birth Control	2ambivalent, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	7/28/2010 10:31:49 AM	I absolutely hate what this drug has done to me.  I've been on the Depo shot since March 2010, no period since April. Gained 3-5 lbs. so far, have epsiodes of abdominal and back pain, headaches, extreme mood swings, cry at anything/nothing, bad depression, no sex drive, no orgasms, no feelings really other than sadness. I hate the person I've become. My partner is angry that I don't initiate sex anymore and that my body is not responsive to anything. He'd rather jerk off alone for two minutes than spend an hour with me and get nowhere. I don't know how to make him understand it's not him or me, but the medication. Making love has become making war. I feel like an 80 year old housekeeper and babysitter. I want this crap out of my system but just found out it could take between 7 and 18 months for that to happen. I will NOT be getting the next shot. If you're trying to decide on a method, skip this one, please.

One shot, several months ago. weight gain as a side effect. Very disappointed! I've maintained my weight for several years. this sudden gain has put me in a depression. Not a huge downer, but none the less, upsetting! A woman in her 40's struggles as it is!

This has been the worst medical experience of my life. My 1st shot was in December of 2008, and I haven't had a period since. I had my 2nd and last shot in March of 2009. In the next six months I gained 30 pounds. I have weighed the smae weight my entire adult life and I gained 30 pounds. These shots have basically ruined my life. I have had unexplained bleeding, cervical polyups that had to be cut off, and still no period. My hormone levels are completely screwed up and it has also affected my thyroid level. I would advise no one to get these shots. I wish I would have read all of these reviews before getting them. My libido is gone. Im depressed and exhausted all the time.

The only side effects I experienced were spotting for a few months, migranes for a few months, decrease in sexual desire after about 5 years and a large weight gain. I just stopped taking the depo this month due to risk of bone loss (according to MD). I have taken the depo shot for 7 years. 
Birth Control	fire_angel_andi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/31/2010 1:45:05 PM	I have been on the depo shot now on and off for almost 14yrs I think it is wonderful! I have no period and I have stopped taking it twice to get pregnant and had no problems getting pregnant it took 4-6m for me to get pregnant upon stopping. Now saying that and the fact that I used to be a nurse I realize every person is different what works for some will not always work for others. choosing the depo-shot is a personal choice while it is great for me and I have only gotten a few side affects weight gain, hairloss and a few headaches here and there does not mean it would work as great on my sister or my daughters. we are all different and we all experience things differently. if you chose this method of birth control do your homework first be smart and make the best decision for you and if for some reason you have bad side effects don't blame the shot it's just how things are some women can use this method of birth control and others can't that's just life.   
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/30/2010 7:11:50 PM	I was on the shot for exactly 3 years, with the last day of effectiveness being in May of 2005, almost 5 years ago. At the time, it was very convenient- I stopped getting my period altogether, which was fantastic, since I used to get terribly painful cramps. I am now 27 years old, and have constant joint pain, a crooked back, vision problems, receded gum lines, and constant dull abdominal pain, despite normal check-ups. I also had gained 15 pounds, which it has taken about all of these 5 years to take back off, with regular workouts and a reasonable diet. Obviously not any or all of this can be proven as having a connection with the depo, but my physical health has coincidentally deteriorated to a point where it affects me every day, since the days before I ever started taking the shot. I would recommend anything else as an alternative if at all possible!
Birth Control	Heather, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/24/2010 2:49:27 PM	I took the depo shot for about two years about ten years ago. My doctor warned me about possible weight gain, however I experienced the oppposite. I completely lost my appetite, about 30 pounds and most of my hair and a few teeth. I have also been off birth control for 5 years and am yet to get pregnant. My hair never grew back and I'm afraid I may have also permanently lost my ability to have a baby. Please do your research first. Ten years from now you may want a child.
Birth Control	KatyDee31, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	35-44	3/12/2010 5:57:43 AM	DEPO-PROVERA RUINED MY LIFE!!I had a high &amp; active sex drive with my partner until I was on this for 2 years. In addition to the commonly reported mood swings &amp; sudden &amp; intermittent periods for 12 months (which ruined a brand new mattress), I experienced total loss of desire &amp; felt permanently vaginally sore &amp; dry. I have been medically checked &amp; have no infections, hormone imbalances or suffered any trauma. 9 years on I have never regained my sexual desire or enjoyment of sex.The problems I experienced are some of the side-effects listed in the product literature but at no time was this shown or discussed during the 2 1/2 years receiving it, only the few main side effects were advised.I know closely of 3 other women receiving this contraceptive for a similar time period. All experienced a variety of problems from severe depression, manic mood swings, loss of sex drive &amp; 9 years on, ovarian cyst &amp; excessive facial hair.None of us have ever returned to how we were before the injections. Doctors have all denied these problems are the result of the contraceptive but as men, they clearly do not know or have experienced it for themselves. Realistically thinking, how can it not damage the careful balance of the body &amp; hormones, receiving massive doses of hormone injections which override &amp; suppress nature?!It's too late for me, after only a couple of years. So if you're thinking of receiving it, despite assurances of medical staff, DO NOT!! It's a huge dose of known problems &amp; the unknown. How will it permanently damage you? All of the people I know who have received it have continued to be affected by it in some negative way.Value your health &amp; do not blindly trust the people who are supposed to know. There's lots of other contraceptive methods out there, please take the time to research other options; Depo-Provero will cost you more than a mattress &amp; you won't know at what personal cost to your health &amp; life until it's too late!!
Birth Control	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	3/3/2010 2:23:33 PM	Depo Provera has been great for me with minimal side effects for almost seven years. I have been getting a Depo shot every three months for nearly 5 years straight.  Prior to this I was off birth control for two years and using depo provera shots for the two years before that.  My only side effect (and only in the past 3 years) has been a thinning of the vaginal walls making intercourse painful.  This has been delightfully relieved by using Estrace hormone cream.  Since I am in my late 40s, this side effect is mainly due to long term use and my age.  I have not had any issues with bone loss, in fact my last test shows I have GREAT bone density...however I regularly do weight bearing exercise and take well over 1000 mg of calcium daily.  I never had a period nor any spotting while on Depo.  However I had already lost my period while on regular BC pills.  I never noticed any weight gain while on the depo and I definitely didn't see any weight loss when I was on NO birth control for the two years inbetween.  I went through many stressful periods (moving, job change, divorce, etc) during the entire time and didn't notice any extraordinary mood swings or depression.  The only reason I gave it a 4 for Ease of Use is having to get to the doctor's office to get the shot.  Next month I will be switching to the Implanon implant on my doctor's advice due to my age to minimize future side effects of bone loss and estrogen depletion.  Everyone reacts to hormones differently which is why there are so many options in birth control.  I recommend depo provera.
Birth Control	molly, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	5	1	Female	19-24	2/22/2010 11:43:07 PM	I really wished I had read these other posts before I agreed to take the Depo shot. I am so glad to hear that others had the same difficulties that I had, for awhile there I thought I was crazy. I absolutely hated the Depo shot. I was switched over from the regular pill because I was having a reaction to the hormone mix and my doctor thought that the Depo shot would help. One week after I got the shot I started bleeding, and not just spotting, it was like my full period, however it lasted 2 months non-stop!  During my time on Depo I have been gaining weight. I have been eating the same that I did before, but I tried to increase my workouts as I had read a side effect was additional weight gain. I cannot get the extra 15 pounds off that I have gained in the short time since I started using it. In addition, I have been so depressed. I thought that this was just me going through my last semester of college and all the other life stuff you deal with but this is so much more than that. I dont feel like doing anything, I am grumpy, not happy about anything, tired, sad, miserable and just not myself. Not only this I have absolutely no sex drive! Whats the point of taking a birth control if you dont feel like using it ever. The last couple of months have been terrible, I will not get any further shots and I hope that no one else has to deal with this terrible product.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	2/20/2010 6:32:14 PM	i would never use this type of birth control ever again. hair loss has been a big problem, even months after i stopped. it has also very much messed up my menstral cycle.

I was on the pill for 4yrs and switched to Depo shot due to the pill being expensive $50+ for a month,compared to $60 Depo injection for 3 months. I enjoyed not have a monthly period, no major side effects except an increase in facial hair, and weight gain.(Didn't find out weight gain side effect until earlier this month from my new OB Dr, I gained 40+lbs during the 4yrs I was on Depo and couldn't figure out why I was gaining weight, I even got my thyroid level check to see if it was the cause and it was normal.) I was due to get my injection this month, but now that I'm off,I hope than I can start losing the weight I've gain and hopefully don't experience any withdrawal side effects like some other women have. But overall I enjoyed the ease, protection of the Depo shot, and hope in the future I wont experience any pregnancy difficulities.
Birth Control	mykesmom, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	2/12/2010 8:08:39 PM	I got my first deop shot about 2 1/2 weeks ago, and within 2-3 days I broke out in a rash on my foreams, shins, calfes, and sides.  Now 2 weeks later the rash is on my whole body and about 20 times worse. I feel like its eating away at my skin.  I try to put on a hypoallergenic lotion to relive the itching and it just makes my skin burn. So now my worry is if my body is having an allergic reaction to the medication, how effective is it going to be?

However, the side effects were dissapointing. Over the course of three years I have gained 40 pounds! I have had problems with my joints (especially my knees)which is caused by the bone loss :/ i have been off of depo provera because my husband and I want to get pregnant... no pregnacy. ANd my periods have yet to return :(

We finished our treatments in early '06 because of many complications and violent mood swings and decided that it cant be natural not having a period for 2 years. Now almost 4 years later I cant get pregnant, I have a lot of bone loss, my friend has ostioperosis, and I have recurring abnormal paps which I never had before depo and I have undergone biopsys and a lot of time consuming doctor visits and constant pain.  By the way, it took almost 2 years after stopping the depo to even get my period again.  And my current doc said that the hormones from the shot are still in my cells and that is why I cannot get pregnant and there is no way of knowing when it will clear my system.  Absolutely the worst mistake I have ever made.  I wish I accidentally had gotten pregnant at an early age instead of ruining my chances of ever being a mom.
Endometriosis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	1/22/2010 10:05:32 PM	I have severe endometriosis, and I had been on the pill for three years (no placebos, just continuous pills).  I had a spike in blood pressure, so I got off the pill and tried the depo shot.  That was in Oct. 09 and I did not get my second shot, which would have been at the end of Dec 09.  I have had a lot of symptoms, including fainting and chest pain.  I'm worried that the shot may have damaged my heart (getting tests), hoping that there is no permanent damage.  The blood pressure spike was actually from mega-doses of ibuprofen, which I have discontinued, so I may eventually go back on the pill, if I ever feel I can handle drugs again.  Many people have no problem with depo; I'm not one of them.  
Birth Control	Lucky, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	19-24	1/14/2010 11:25:29 PM	I got this shot to have something that would be convenient rather than taking a pill everyday, about 3 months ago. However, after getting this shot I experienced hair loss, nervousness, and anxiety. I decided not to get the second shot due to the agonizing affects. Shortly after the time period I was due for my second shot, severe depression and crying spells started to occur. Since getting this shot, I've now had to be put on the generic form of Paxil. There is no history of depression in my family and yet here I am taking pills for it. I wish I would have never the synthesized hormone put in my body. A hard lesson to learn and a large price to pay for convenience. Now I have to take an anti-depressant to get my life back and I now have to deal with weening myself off of it later. There are so many other options out there. I would do your research first. I unfortunately didn't. 
Birth Control	lesli12,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female		1/14/2010 1:09:51 PM	I have taken two shots of depo. Following each injection I have gained 10 lbs, totaling 20 lbs. I have not changed eating or exercising habits since being on the drug. I workout regularly and have increased my workouts to compensate for the weight gain. It WILL NOT come off. Along with the severe weight gain I have have outbreaks of acne all over my body. It had been a nightmare. Pre-depo my periods would last 3-4 days. Now I have periods or spotting from 2-3 weeks at a time. I have been also having stomach issues being very bloated all the time and some food sensitivities. I do not recommend anyone to take this shot, there risks aren't worth it. Everytime I tried the pill I would feel a little depressed being on it but the shot has made me severely depressed also.
Birth Control	ashleymielke, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	13-18	1/11/2010 9:06:47 PM	im 18 and have been using depo for 5 years. the first 3 years were great. no more horrible cramps or heavy periods, constantly in the bathroom, missing school and work. my horrid side effects started 2 1/2 yrs ago. i had severe pain in my pelvic area, especially after urinating. they never found a uti and dismissed the pain for nothing i guess. i was diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder 2 yrs ago. i 100% blame it on this poison. i am always down and lost interest in everything. i quit my job and now lay on the couch everyday. i have gained 40 lbs in the last 6 months and can't lose it though ive tried. as if the mood disorders weren't enough, i lost all sexual desire and ability, vaginal elasticity and natural lubrication. i want to thank every person for commenting. i accidently missed my injection 5 days ago and i was going to reschedule but after reading these i have realized that all my problems are linked to this shot. i couldnt believe how many of the stories were very similar to mine. i was engaged and after i lost my sexual ability, he started living a double life and cheated on me and eventually left. now we are trying to work things out. maybe it will get better since i won't be on the shot anymore. its so devastating and hard. i want kids and im so young and scared i will never be able to have them. to think i couldve prevented all this by reading a couple of comments. DO NOT TAKE THIS SHOT FOR ANYTHING.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	1/11/2010 9:53:00 AM	The first shot I took wasnt very bad but I noticed that i bagan getting bad cramps and pain in my abdoman. After that I went back for second shot and thing got progressively worse unti I was in constant pain and bleeding all the time. Dr. advise was to take the shot for 1 full year and and my bodty would get used to it. After the full year of bleeding (clots as big as my hand) and spotting not to mention tha pain I said no more. Went off the shot and thought I was going to bleed to death. Dr. told me this was normal. Finally stopped bleeding after I had been off the shot for about a month. Bad pain was still there. Went to a different Dr. and was diagnosed with a 1 inch fibroid tumor. I still think the shot caused the fibroid to form as I was not in pain before I took that shot. I wouldnt advise anyone to take it.
Birth Control	 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5			1/10/2010 10:00:55 AM	I was happy with this product. I didn't have any of the side effects, just stop using so  I can have another child and I am pregnant again just stop using about 5 months ago.  
Other	danielle261, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	1/5/2010 10:26:11 PM	My doctor put me on the shot to control my periods, they were very abnormal and heavy.... I am due for my 3rd shot next week..i will NOT be taking it.Since taking the shot, i have been spotting/bleeding, literally been bleeding/spotting for 6 months.  No interest in sex what so ever, VERY moody, depressed all the time (and i have happy life with two wonderful children). My husband thought at one point maybe i needed to see somebody for help,also i have gained 4 pounds in 6 months. I hope this helps someone. I did NO research on this when i started it, i wish i did, not much good out there about it. I have NEVER experienced any of this before, (so its not a whether or not its the depo question.) My doctor who prescribed it is a family doctor, i called my OBGYN about my side affects and he told me to get off of the shot that its not right for me, and for most people. i just want my life back!
Other	Ladyattila, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	1/4/2010 4:46:53 PM	I started taking the depo shot when I was 19 around August 2007. At first I thought the shot was a god send. There were no periods and none of the usual pain that I had felt every month. For the first month or so there was spotting but it all stopped. However less than a year later (June 2008) I stopped taking the depo shot due to a 30 lb weight gain that I have still not been able to lose and it has been over a year since I stopped. While the depo shot does prevent periods and can be a miracle for those who experience a lot of pain during their periods I will tell you to expect weight gain about 20 lbs or more due to the usual feedback I have personally heard and seen in response to this drug. The weight is difficult to lose and your periods will take several months to return to normal.
Birth Control	SPEEDY, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	12/31/2009 1:18:02 PM	Do NOT take this product or use it. It sounds great no periods for 3 months well how does the chance of never being able to have kids sound it happens to some not me but it has made it where I spot so much that I might as well prefer a real period over this as mine are only 4 days in length anyhow. I get cold chills hot flashes I get more migranes and it makes me a bitchy person this is not normal this is way heightened moodiness. I feel horrible i hate it weight gain is horrible as i had used this prior to my first child then with her i gained 150 pounds which i cant get off by re using this i have gained even more weight. I forgot what it was like to be on it now that I remember I will NOT be using it anymore.  This drug does worse than my period to me I plan on going totally off of birth control to clean my system out.   
Birth Control	Valese, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	12/26/2009 10:41:14 PM	I've read so many negative reviews, at first I was scared to take it. But I am overall happy that I did. The only side effects I have had are spotting, an increase in hunger, mild acne, and slight breast pain. I have taken 1 shot before and will take one more, because I am not comfortable with the risk of bone loss later on. If it wasn't for that, I would continue on with the medication. Please don't be put off by so many negative reviews, it has not made my life miserable at all, the effects are slight and liveable. Just give it a try, and if you don't like it, there is no need to go back for a second shot.

Birth Control	courtney, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/10/2009 4:08:11 PM	Most of my friends didn't like being on the shot at all but I loved it. I was on it for about 2 years and never had any problems.  I stopped using it in about July and didn't get a period for about a month or two.  Now, I have been spotting since..it's December! I don't have health ins but I should probably go to the doctor.  Has anyone else had this side effect??
Birth Control	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	25-34	12/5/2009 8:12:41 PM	First of all, I am a guy who has been hurt by this medication.  After about a year of being together my girlfriend decided that we we ready to take our wonderful relationship to the next level.  She has blood clots/heart problems in her family so the doctors said that she couldn't take the pill.  She started taking the Depo shot and every thing was pretty good.  Things progressively got very bad.  She was moodier than normal, she lost interest in sex, she started having seizure like episodes that she never had before.  Towards the end of our relationship she ended up at the emergency room because the seizures and bleeding would just happen out of nowhere to the point that it was almost fatal.  I wanted to take her place because of all of the suffering she was in.  I worried so much and took care of her very well.  The worst part was that she seemed to be emotionally hurt by everything I said and did, even if I said something that was very positive.  It was almost like dealing with someone with bipolar disorder.  After 4 and a half years of a mostly great relationship she one day just told me that she didn't love me anymore, and said it with very little emotion.  I feel like I should have been a better partner and researched what was causing all this unnecessary drama.  I still love her and miss her 4 years later because I know she is a great person.  I blame the Depo shot for taking that great person away from me.  It hurts me everyday.

I only took it once because I was going to get the Essure tubal ligation procedure. It changed my life! I became an emotional wreck! Cried all the time! Gain about 25lbs. my periods were always regular now i never know when it's coming. I got the shot in May 09 and my body is still not back to normal. Taking Paxil because of the crazy emotional side effects. Have not found ONE person that I've talked to that hasn't had problems with this drug.
Endometriosis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	12/3/2009 3:19:23 PM	My dr prescribed this to relieve symptoms of endometriosis.  I have had one shot and that is all I will ever get.  I immediately started having headaches, moodiness, fatigue, and weight gain.  After about a month I started to spot, then bleed more heavily.  TWELVE WEEKS later and I am STILL BLEEDING!!!  I am still waiting for this poison to get out of my system.  I believe this drug to be very dangerous and I think it should be removed from the market.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	12/2/2009 3:08:41 AM	Three months ago I decided to get on birth control and thought Depo would be the best choice. Less than two weeks into it, my breast became very sore, I started losing &quot;interest&quot; (which caused some problems with my relationship with my boyfriend), and lost sensitivity in my nether regions. Then halfway through the three months I started spotting, which rturned into a full-blown period. I had never bled or hurt that much in my entire life. (It also lasted 10 days, opposed to my normal 5.) I am supposed to go for my next shot today, but I will refuse it. All I can say is take it at your own risk.

I am now 44 years old and have suffered a fractured rib and a fractured hip from this drug.  I was never told that this literally takes the calcium out of your bones and was never told to have bone density testing.  At 43 I had my hip replaced, then did research to find out why my bones have such low density and realized this was the cause.  I eat right, exercise and am the proper weight and no longer smoke.
Birth Control	19-24 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	5	1		19-24	11/29/2009 4:33:19 PM	I consider this drug POISON!! It has done nothing but make my life miserable. I started taking this med when I was 18. Was on it for 3 years and decided to switch to the Nuva Ring because of the way it made me feel (depressed, achy, exhausted, uninterested, lack of concentration/focus, sleeplessness, 70 lb. weight gain, etc.). (I was going to a prestigious 4 year University with a 4.0 and dropped out because I couldn't focus or I just couldn't force myself to do school work.) I ended up getting pregnant on Nuva Ring and miscarried. Unfortunately I was FORCED, by my parents to the point of disownment, to go back on Depo because of it's effectiveness. Since being back on Depo for 10 months, all my symptoms are back and worse. I've gained 50 more lbs. and have no interest in anything. It makes me cry all the time and I feel helpless. And I have severe panic attacks. My gyno has attributed all these symptoms to Depo and told me to not get another shot. I will never take another shot of Depo if my life depends on it. Please do research on this contraceptive before using. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	11/21/2009 3:46:47 AM	I only took it one time- I suffered severe depression from the shot. I do not recomment anyone to take Depo-Provera unless medically necessary, not because of my experience but because the long-term effects can be damaging. There are other forms of birth control out there that offer less harm, the pill (which you have to remember) or an IUD.  They are even giving teenagers an IUD if they are responsible enough. I am a nurse and just saying check out all options before you make a decision such as Depo-Provera.

THANK GOD I didn't read these all 4 yrs ago when I started Depo. LOVE IT!!! All I have to do is get a shot every 12-13 weeks - thats it!Wish I could blame any weight gain on the shot, but nope, once I started eating correctly, the weight came off again. Its been great! Take a calcium supplement and give it a try!!!!

Birth Control	onebabymom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	11/8/2009 5:48:33 PM	In 2003, just 2 days after I had my baby my doctor convinced me to have the shot and few months later a 2nd. shot. Well as a result I had every single side effect described + I was bleeding non stop for 11 months! It is almost 6 years now since I stopped but unfortunately this medicine has long term side effects that will follow me for the rest of my life. I wish I was told that before I had my first shot :( Depo Proveta was my worst nightmare!
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	35-44	10/27/2009 11:14:03 PM	In 2000 in my early 30s, I was switching from Depo Provera to Ortho Tricyclen under the care of a very experienced ob/gyn team after having my two children when I was stricken with DVT that I shouldn't have survived except for the care of my internist and a vascular surgeon who simply would not give up on me despite all the initial bad decisions of the emergency care team. On the Depo, I had weight gain and was having to drive monthly to another town to have my heart checked as a recommended precaution while on the Depo, though I had no prior history. All users of either of these meds should proceed with extreme caution. I belive the medical field needs to begin more rigorous routine testing for blood clotting factors in BC takers. That incident created lots of long term complications, a lifetime on blood thinners, and I was no longer able to have children in the prime of my life. I had always hoped for one, maybe two more.

I stopped taking this drug ten years ago.  Not only did the pain never go away, it recently started to get worse.  It is now as severe as it was when I first took the shot.  No doctor will believe your pain was caused by a birth control so I can only say good luck.  I was only on this drug for 9 months (3 shots), the pain started the day following and even then the doctors didn't believe it was the Depo.
Birth Control	Beau, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	2	Female	25-34	10/6/2009 5:41:06 PM	Unfortunately I had a severe allergic/mild anaphylactic reaction to Depo-provera and had to be hospitalised. It didn't help that such a severe reaction is so rare that neither GPs, hospital doctors or pharmacists really know anything about it (and I've never had an allergic reaction to anything before). Once the reaction settled down (over the course of 4 days after medical treatment was given) the injection did it's job and I had no periods while it was in my system. I can't be given it again, however, and the lack of knowledge regarding such severe reactions to is has led to much problems working out what other contraception (that contains progesterone) it is safe for me to take. The Mirena coil has now been fitter (with steriods on stand-by) and no reaction has occurred.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	10/1/2009 8:50:23 PM	I had been on the shot for most of the last 18 years.  It had entirely stopped my menustration.  I also had no libido.  It seemed to lessen my mood swings, maybe too much.  I did have weight gain, but I cannot say it was the shot.  My rock bottom point hit when I went to my OB/GYN doctor crying my eyes out.  I thought for sure I needed an antidepressant.  My husband and coworkers even commented on my lack of motivation.  My doctor was concerned about my long term use of depo and ordered a dexascan.  At age 36 I was diagnosed with osteopenia of my lower spine.  I am a very small fraction away from being osteoperotic!  I quit the depo and went to an oral birth control for one year before I had a tubal ligation.  My moods have greatly improved and I do not feel like a slug anymore.  I will be taking Fosamax probably for the rest of my life to treat the osteopenia.  Please consider other forms of birth control other than this one.  The long term side effects are not worth it!
Birth Control		5	5	3			9/30/2009 7:51:19 AM	I was on depo for over 10 years and at first it was awesome, but over the years, I changed. My periods got out of control. somedays I was light others it was heavy. Plus, my appitite was more than usual and my weight gain was more than I expected. I gained over 40 lbs. I havent been able to take it off and I excercise 3 times a week. it was so fustrating. I have now stopped and so far the only thing that is going on is irregular bleeding. I do feel much better, you dont realize how much this effects your body, until you stop.

I had some light spotting and mild cramps for the first 3 months and some nausea, but not enough for me to stop it.  Since then I've had no side effects that I could notice. My endocrinologist needs me to get off of it so they can do some testing and I have to say I'm sorry I have to stop it.  Living without periods or cramps or vaginal yeast infections for 11 years was wonderful1

When I first took the shot my period was like a leaky faucet and I had to wear adult diapers. I have had emotional incidents where everything said to me felt hurtful.I got a fracture on my right big toe while playing soccer with some kids from bone loss.And worst of all I have been extremely aroused sexually. I went as far as to have multiple sex partners.I get this tingling in my vagina and excessive vaginal wetness. And have to use a vibrator. It seems to cause genital arousal disoder. I will be talking to my doctor about switching to another method.

I was on this drug for 5 years it was fantastic at first no periods, nothing.After the first 6 months the weight gain started and didn't stop along with the mood swings. when i started this i was never warned about all the side effects and the ones i read about weren't that bad. I am now 90 lbs. heavier.Thats horrifying for someone who is only 5'2&quot;.I now am off the shot and have been off it for a year my periods are still not regular and i want to have a baby but I'm not sure thats even possible or ever will be.

I have &quot;gone off&quot; the shot for a month or two here and there. This shot has been great for me! I never get my period. And that's great because when I do get my period I get very painful cramping. So I don't miss it a bit. I notice my face breaking out only slightly during the week when I have to get the shot. So one week out of every three months, and it's nothing bad enough to complain about. No weight gain, no hair loss, no side effects whatsoever!! I heard many different people say they were not happy with the depo shot. Because they either gained weight or had their period all the time. But I don't think it or any medication will effect two people exactly the same. I was going to switch to the pill. But after a month of taking the pill, or should I say &quot;forgetting to take the pill&quot; I am going back to the depo. I am not good at remember to take a pill at the same time every day. 
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	9/17/2009 10:09:31 AM	I took this medication when going to college in 97 because I was under alot of stress and started bleeding irratically.  After taking myself off of it due to severe weight gain.  Years later I have never been able to lose the weight gained (60 pounds over 3 years).  I have had my thyroid evaluated and was told I am within minimums.  I have changes my diet to healthy eating habits and even had my diet evaluated by a dietician who said they could not recommend dieting because my calorie intake was lower then what they recommended.  Several people I have spoke to over the years who also took this shot had the same similar weight issue and can not take off the weight.  I have been off of this for 12 years now and it has never changed.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	9/15/2009 1:39:17 PM	I experienced bleeding for about 2 months. Then, I did not bleed for almost a month. I do have hair loss but the nurse told me to take a hair vitamin. I gained six pounds in a little under three months. I do have a lack of energy and mood swings but I am only 99% sure that it is caused by this drug. (Take that how you want.) Abdominal pain comes and goes. I experience it at least once a week. I might continue this birth control only because it is good for three months and I have not decided whether I want an IUD, Implanon, or a tubal ligation. Also, with any birth control you should give it time.Also, take a calcium supplement because there can be bone loss.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	9/6/2009 11:12:27 AM	I am 19 years old. I began taking this shot a little over a year ago and I won't lie the first whole year was pretty great. I no longer had my period at all and I didn't notice any side effects. The beginning of the summer I went to the doctor and I was told I gained 20 pounds in just one year. That's when more and more side effects started showing. I immediately started to diet and I was just not losing weight, I was almost anorexic before I started losing weight and that only lasted a week. I then got blood work done because thyroid problems run in my family and they tied my symptoms to that. Nothing came up there either. I decided to do research of my own and when I read the side effects of this shot I was amazed. I've gained 20 pounds in one year, my hair falls out like I'm getting radiation treatments (thank god I have thick hair) and lately I've been getting at least a 24+ hour migraine once a week sometimes twice. I don't even want to know how much bone loss I have from this but I also have noticed that I do have joint pain. My last shot was just in the beginning of August so I have to wait another 3 months, but I WILL NOT be doing this again even though I do dread getting my period again this just is not worth it. Just advice to others I didn't notice anything until I was on this for a year, and my first year on it I thought it was the best thing ever. It was just in the past two weeks that I completely changed my mind.
Birth Control	amylee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	9/2/2009 3:24:47 PM	I was on Depo about 8 years ago for about 2 years. I never had any problems at all. Never had a period, no weight gain. It was great. I have been off of the shot for many years. Now i'm 28, and decided to go back on it. Nothing but problems!! I have only had one shot, and I DO NOT plan to get another one. I have been cramping, have been spotting the whole time, and now have had a regular period for over two weeks. I have noticed more pain in my back. It is a very easy birth control method, but I DO NOT recommend it to anyone.

I have not had a period since my 1st shot 2 years ago and I have never had breakthough bleeding, spotting, or anything irregular. I have not gained weight (in fact, I have LOST weight!) and make sure to take a multivitamin regularly to prevent accelerated bone loss. I recommend Depo!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	8/27/2009 8:33:21 PM	I was on Depo for about 6 months when I had to undergo IV antibiotics. Two months later, I got pregnant, courtesy of the antibiotics. I miscarried at around 5 weeks. I was on it for another year and had no issues with &quot;accidents&quot; anymore, but I had serious side-effects.1. I have depression and it worsened to the point of suicide attempts.2. Sex was flat-out painful. I lost all vaginal lubrication and elasticity.3. I developed anxiety problems and became quite irritable with everyone around me.4. Right before I was due for my next shot, I would always have severe menstrual-type cramps which left me in bed for days.5. Weight gain of 25 lbs that is still hard to keep off.6. Hot flashes at age 18.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	8/19/2009 8:04:43 PM	When I was about 16 or 17 I went on birth control so I did, even though I've always been agaisnt anything that disrupts the female cycle. I only got 2 shots and decided to stop, the side effects were absoloutly horrendous!!! I turned into super b*tch! My boyfriend wanted to kill me because of how mean I was to him all the time and over nothing, I lost all interrest in the daily activities I've always loved doing, all in all it was a HUGE mistake! I am now 19yrs old and still have yet to get my period back (no I'm not pregnant). I still have horrifing mood swings and still have a huge loss of interrest in things I'd always loved. Depo Provera also messed up my hormones and some brain chemicals. It was effective in preventing pregnancy but I would NEVER recomend this to birth control to anyone!
Birth Control	harpersmama, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	8/3/2009 3:35:24 PM	So far, so good for me. I got my first shot about a month ago and just had some breakthrough bleeding today... some slight cramping but NOTHING like when I was on the pill. I have had no other problems so far, some small breakouts but those haven't stopped since I had my baby in March but they have not gotten worse. No weight gain so far, I actually had some bloating the first week, but since then, I have felt fine and actually have lost 2 pounds. Those of you that have had problems for sooooo long, i have no sympathy for, you should have said something to your doctor at the first sign of a problem!
Birth Control	angelbaby, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	8/3/2009 2:42:04 PM	I have only had one dose of this shot and I am not going back for the second dose. The first two weeks was nice but after that I felt like crap. I'm always tired and drained. I always feel like I have to throw up. It almost makes me feel like I am pregnant. I have gained 10 pds off the first shot. Maybe it will get better after awhile but I am not going to stick around and see. Its your call if you want to use this method. It is not for me.
Birth Control	bubbles, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/31/2009 8:20:04 PM	I have been taking Depo for 15 years and I love it. While I realize that it affects everyone differently, I would recommend it. I have never had a period or any spotting since the day I started taking it. No mood swings, no weight gain, no acne. I did get my first bone density test after taking Depo for 12 years and I did show a little bone loss. After a year of taking calcium and doing weight bearing excerices I went back and the test results show an improvement. I am now 35 and plan to continue this birth control until menopause.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	7/24/2009 3:46:39 PM	I took this when I was younger and loved it.  Six months ago I chose to go back on the depo because I liked not having my period.  It has been awful.  I have been super moody (some might even say crazy).  My skin is awful and has been broken out since a week after the first shot and my hair is starting to fall out.  Will def not being getting a third shot.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	7/9/2009 8:17:07 PM	watch out for side effects. 
Birth Control	Cali Girl , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	7/9/2009 3:31:10 AM	DO NOT take this drug. The first three months were great - I just had some minor irregular bleeding.  About two weeks after I got my second shot, my hair started falling out like crazy.  I'm terrified that I'm going to start having bald spots soon. I was never warned about the hair loss, only about the irregular bleeding and bone loss.  My doctor has told me that there is nothing that I can do but wait until the drug has passed through my system. My shot isn't due to wear off for another two months, and I'm praying that I will still have hair by then! 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/29/2009 8:15:36 PM	I'm 24 years old and have been on Depo for 6 years. The only reason I'm thinking about stopping is because of the possibility of bone loss, other than that I love it! I have not had any side effects and have not had to deal with a period since shortly after I started it.
Birth Control	JerbysMom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	6/26/2009 10:20:48 PM	I originally went on the Depo shot 4 1/2 years ago because I have no plans for more children but didn't want to take the drastic step of sterilization (not that a doctor would have sterilized a 23 year old) and I knew I wouldn't remember to take a pill. As far as effectiveness it's perfect! I haven't had a period since the first shot and of course havn't gotten pregnant. The side effects are a different story entirely. My sex drive has vanished completely, causing major friction in my marriage. My hair is falling out, though it's not as noticeable since I cut it all off. I'm SUPER moody, mostly on the anxious side. I have severe pain in my knees, ankles, hips, neck, &amp; wrists I believe is related to the bone loss this medicine is reported to cause. I'm scheduling an appointment with my doctor before the next dose to discuss other options.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/21/2009 5:21:19 PM	I went on DP because the Pill was giving me high blood pressure, intense PMS and moodiness during my periods, cramps so bad i would pass out, and migraines for a week before and during my period. My doctor suggested the shot and it was a miracle! No period=noPMS=no moodiness=no cramps, it was great.  I was on it for about 3 years and only went off it because I no longer had insurance.  I have been off it for 6 months and still have not had a period.  I did not have any negative side effects from DP at all.  I would reccomend it to anyone.  I am sad because I am probably not going to be able to go back on it because I have a history of osteoporosis in my family and I was already on it for 3 years, though my doctor did have me take 1500mg of Calcium a day while I was on it.  We'll see. 
Other	jgp, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	6/11/2009 4:29:37 PM	I had to take one injection in order to have the Essure procedure for tubal ligation. I have been bleeding for more than 2 months every day.  I have been very moody and headaches daily for about 1 month now.  I'm very concerned that it will take longer than three months for this drug to clear my system. I cannot try birth control to try to regulate, because I have high blood pressure and I REFUSE to try more depo to try to regulate.  Will I ever lead a regular life again....
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	6/9/2009 5:00:05 AM	I will not use this form of birth control again. I've had just 1 shot total.  I've completely lost my sex drive, I'm extremely moody and experiencing some depression. I've had 2 periods in 3 months, both lasting 15 days, I've experienced an exreme case of acne, gained 10 lbs and have been very tired all the time.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/9/2009 3:51:38 AM	I am a 23 year old overweight mulatto and I loved being on Depo-Provera. I've heard a lot of horror stories about Depo BUT I would recommend it to anyone. I was on it for years and the only reason I stopped using depo  because of the risk of bone thinning. I had irregular periods for the first few months on Depo-Provers, then spotting for the next few. From then on I only had spotting when it was time for my next shot (every three months.) My periods returned after 5 months after I stopped using Depo-Provera. Along with the periods I have acne and dry hair. 
Birth Control	julie b, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	6/8/2009 9:42:29 AM	First,this was &quot;necessary&quot; as told by my MD prior to sterilization .I am a 43 year old smoker.My &quot;Dr&quot; assured me that it was safe.Not true according to the user literature which I wasn't given prior to injection.Just read other posts and found symptoms that I wouldn't have associated with this like bruising easily.I no longer use this as the sterilization was successful but still had to get 2 injections.Have had constant spotting,anxiety and nervousness,and extreme weight gain.I have experience with the Nuva ring as a matter of fact I was part of the investigational study in the early 90's.I highly recommend that over depo.The side effects were nil and you only have to rememberto insert once a month.You don't feel it at all-even during sex.I would NEVER use depo again.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	19-24	6/8/2009 7:01:59 AM	ive had no real side effects from the shot other than random very light bleeding. ive also noticed some mild acne. however from reading the reviews i am quite worried about having children once im off the shot. it seems like everyones different however so we'll c wat happens...
Birth Control	Dariansmith, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	13-18	6/4/2009 6:14:09 PM	I'm 16, I've been on Depo twice, once then I missed my next shot, and now and I've been on it for four months now. I'm not losing hair, spotting, gaining weight, or any of the other scary side effects I've heard of so far... But all the reviews I've read are scaring me, until I see side effects such as those, I'm sure I'll keep taking this medication and just risk it...
Birth Control	ShooflyShannon, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/29/2009 9:52:03 PM	I took the shot for 2 years with no complaints, other than some weight gain. I took a break and switched to the pill again due to the concern of bone loss. I've gone back to the shot for the simple ease of use. 1 shot every 13 weeks and I don't have to worry about forgetting a pill or planning my life around a period. I do suffer from some weight gain, but can be managed. I do notice that I have more problems with boils on my face and night sweats while on the shot. Again, these are manageable. Every birth control has side effects..I've tried them all, pill, patch, shot. This requires the least maintenance. I alternate the shots from arm to arm, hip to hip. Ice and heating pad to alleviate the injection site for a couple of days and mark your calendar for the next shot.

It's easy, and not to mention I don't get my period!!! And I can still get pregnant just as easy!! I have proof, she's 4 and he's 2!!! This is the best birth control out there, trust me I know I've tried them all!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	5/18/2009 10:46:46 AM	MY OVERALL EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN WONDERFUL SPEAKING AS A MOTHER OF FIVE. I'VE BEEN ON DEPO FOR A YEAR, AND THE ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE BREAKTHROUGH BLEEDING. IT'S UNPREDICTABLE AND THE FLOW VARIES. ONCE I HAD LIKE THE END OF A PERIOD FOR 8 DAYS THEN IT WAS HEAVY LIKE THE BEGINNING FOR ANOTHER 4 DAYS(12 DAYS TOTAL).THAT OCCURED THE MONTH AFTER MY 3RD SHOT AND I THOUGHT THAT AMMENORIA WOULD OCCUR WITH PROLONGED USE. BUT EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT IN THEIR RESPONSE TO MEDICATIONS.
Birth Control	Josephine, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	5/12/2009 1:15:47 PM	Depo is effective and easier for me personally because I wouldn't remember to take the pill everyday, but I hated it. I only experienced a couple side effects but they were enough to make me stop using Depo after only 3 shots. I had slight weight gain and constant spotting. I got my last shot in November '08 and am still spotting. I can't remember the last time I was able to go without a pantyliner or tampon. Don't use it and avoid the aggravation.
Birth Control	dacuteone09, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	13-18	5/4/2009 1:06:36 AM	i have been off and on with this treatment for three and a half years. i have recently stop using this drug because of severe hair loss, depression, and weight gain. although i had the worse of side effects, the shot was very effective. i had only four periods a year, no bad cramps, i did have some dizziness from time to time after a new dose. but for the most part it was easier for me to use because i had tendency to forget to take the pill. oh. i had terrible breast tenderness too.
Birth Control	tor0382, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	4/29/2009 2:20:44 PM	Not recomended.  I just started my second cycle and I am still bleeding.  I have lost my sex drive, I've become consistently anxious and emotional, I'm losing my hair (taking iron and vitamin d does not help), I'm breaking out, I started bruising easily.  It's been a nightmare.  Although the CONSTANT bleeding has been inconvenient, the worst side effect is the emotional imbalance.  I started the second cycle because the doctor assured me the side effects would lessen, but they've only gotten worse.  After my first shot, my period immediately became lighter and I thought it was wonderful.  In the preceeding months I would get a very light period for 2 weeks and I thought it was an ok trade-off to my usual heavy flows.  Now, I have been bleeding consistently for a month and I think I might lose my mind.  Beware, it's hell.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/25/2009 7:50:41 PM	I've been on this shot for three years. I did get a test back saying i had lost some bone density. The area of the shot gets a little sore but not bad. When i first started the shot i bled alot for about two months and then did not have another period since. I really like this shot its convienent and works great.

DONT TAKE IT.........
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	4/18/2009 11:40:54 PM	I hjave been on this shot for about a year and a half and from the beginning i have not really had my period but about every 3 to 4 months i get spotting and really bad cramps. I also experience still producing milk (after having my daughter 1 1/2 years ago) and drastic hair lose and quite a bit of weight gain. I am extremely forgetful and am afraid to go on the pill. but if you are going to go on this BC be careful and watch ur side effects, im switching to something else, just dont know what yet. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	4/14/2009 6:08:41 PM	DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!! My Dr started me on the Depo because I was experiencing heavy periods. I had my first shot in Dec 08 and the month of January I was fine (no period). On Feb 2 I started bleeding and haven't stopped...it's April 15th!!! My Dr percribed Provera for 10 days to try and stop the bleeding, it slowed for about 2 days, then the bleeding came back. I have experienced some hair loss, mood swings and have gained about 5 lbs. I am now anemic so I take iron and a whole slew of other vitamins each day because I am losing so much blood. Bottom line, I will not be getting the next shot scheduled for May, I am getting off of this drug ASAP...I want my life back, I don't even care about getting heavy periods each month, it's better than what I am going through right now! 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	4/10/2009 9:16:46 PM	I went on this briefly when I was 18, and started it back again just over a year ago. I love not getting my period. I can't use a pill cause I'd forget to take it right, and this is very convent. However, I have gained some weight, and my bones are sore a lot. I've noticed that right after I get the shot my body hurts for a few days and I feel sick. I've got a lower sex drive, and have developed some acne. So far the benefits outweigh the risks, but I'll decide within the nest six months or so if I want to continue with this. 
Birth Control	Angela5211, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	19-24	4/10/2009 1:31:07 PM	I have experienced very big break outs of acne, and a lower sex drive while on this birth control.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	4/6/2009 8:34:58 PM	I started Depo because of severe bleeding due to fibroids (bleeding thru a superplus tampon and saturating the backup overnite pad I also wore, within 2 hours). The first 2 shots were GREAT. Within a day, the severe bleeding totally stopped, and I haven't had it since I started the shots. Just minor spotting here &amp; there. Only drawback was acne. After the 3rd shot, I started experiencing occasional dizziness (I could be laying on the couch watching TV, or standing at the counter...didnt matter what I was doing when the dizziness hit) and minor hair loss. About a week after the 4th shot, I had an episode at work that I broke into a full body sweat, started shaking badly and thought I was going to pass out. I've started having bone pain on top of all the other side effects. Bone pain in the long bones of my legs, knees, hips and forearms. The pain is enough to wake me up from a sound sleep, and frankly THAT scares me. Im done with Depo. It seems the more I take it, the worse my symptoms/side effects get. The only positive to it is, Im no longer bleeding. Im done having kids (heck... my tubes are even tied... Im just using this to stop the bleeding)so I guess the next step is considering a hysterectomy. 
Birth Control	MeganMalia, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	19-24	4/5/2009 12:39:55 AM	I would strongly discourage you from taking this product!! I was on this for about two years. Everything was fine for about the first six months, and I wasn't getting my period which was great. Then, without warning, I was always on my period and soon began to lose a lot of weight. My doctor kept me on it to see if it would clear up on its own and it didn't. Finally, when I dropped to 105 lbs (I am 5'9&quot; and am currently healthy at 160 lbs), my doctor took me off of it, but of course it was in my system for three more months, and it took me about five months to recover fully from it. Apparently, this can happen to women on this, a side effect no one bothered to tell me about. 
Birth Control	nshaw, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	4/4/2009 7:43:21 PM	I have been on the shot for about a year and went in to get my perscription for it refilled. The Dr I saw said that I should switch birth control if I could because Depo will make me fat!  I am a super skinny girl but she said it can and will make anyone gain alot of weight.  I saw it happen to my friend as well.  It is easy to use and very effective but you have to risk the weight gain.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	3/20/2009 6:25:25 PM	I've been on the shot for a yr. My next one is due Apr 10th and i won't be getting it. I had no problems with the first 3...the usual bleeding or spotting, but nothing major. I started bleeding 5 weeks ago and haven't stopped. It hasn't been spotting either, bleeding with numerous clots. I finally went to the Dr. this week and she put me on estrogen to kinda counteract with it. It was driving me crazy and i think i broke up with me wonderful boyfriend twice...he of course ignored me. Anyway just letting everyone know of my experience. I'm gonna be trying something new next month. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/15/2009 11:38:14 PM	I was on Depo-Provera for three years and never had a problem.  I never gained weight (however most people seem to) and my periods (the few times I had one) were very light.  I only switched today because I did experience some unwanted facial hair, an a decrease in my sex drive. Overall it is a very good contraceptive.

Other	allies mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	3/8/2009 10:00:58 PM	Well I was on it before I had my daughter and it worked really well. After I had her they put me on it again because my periods were so bad. First shot had little bleeding second shot bled for three months. Now im off and have no sex drive still, tired all the time and moods swings still have them. I wouldnt recommend this for anyone I have been depressed because I gained weight. Even after being off it I still dont feel myself.
Birth Control	kelly, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/8/2009 5:23:34 PM	I decided to try depo after a horrible experience with the pill.  The first shot was great until about 3 weeks into it, and I bled nearly everyday for over a month..it was very light blood, not like a regular period, and it was pretty unpredictable.  I gained 2.5 pounds during the first three months.  I just got my second shot about 2 and a half weeks ago and have not bled yet, but have already gained another 2.5 pounds!!  I LOVE the ease of this and the effectiveness, but I'm worried about what the next 2 and a half months will do to my weight.  I'm already overweight and cannot afford to gain more.  Hopefully I dont because other than bleeding during the first shot and a little weight gain, I LOVE IT.

Within weeks the depression set in.  Pain beyond belief for no reason, to the point of attempted suicide.  It was horrible.  I didn't take a second shot, and now i'm still not myself, I haven't had my period since... I'm wondering if i'll ever be able to get pregnant.  I've been getting severe cramps and keep hoping it will mean a period but it ends up not.

I have decided not to get my next shot. I want my life back.
Birth Control	love handles, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	55-64	2/24/2009 3:39:43 AM	I am 31 and am on my second round of depo.  I initially took it after having my daugher, and I was nursing.  It stopped my period, and although I did gain a little wait, I was very satisifed.  When we decided to have more children, I quit taking the shot.  It took me a year to get pregnant, then I had a miscarriage.  It took several more months to get pregnant again.  We have decided not to have any more children, after our son was born, and I am back on the shot.  However, I have already gained 16 pounds with the first shot, and am having second thoughts about getting more.
Birth Control	Ethan_Lee, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	2/21/2009 10:45:16 AM	The first 6 months were the most confusing. I was warned of irregular periods and was expecting the first 9 to 12 months to be a constant guessing game. But they were very light the whole time. Even though I never knew when I would start bleeding again, I never once needed a tampon while on this birth control. All I had to do was use the bathroom a little more often. After 6 months, I no longer had a period. I was on Depo for 2 and a half years and was sad to go off from it, (2 years is the recomendation). It's been 2 years since then, and I am planning on going back on it. My only complaint would be that my sex drive was diminished, but it was DEFINATELY still there, it just wasn't as strong. To anybody that is considering Depo, my only advice would be this: don't stop after the first or second shot, at least make it through your fourth before making the decition to stop, and ALWAYS make sure you have tampons or pads with you at all times in the first 9 months, just in case!

I didn't have to worrie about tampos or maxi pads it was great and when i would have break through bleeding i would call up the dr and he'd give me another shot. But here I am 9 years later and still No PERIOD. I've been off the drug for almost 6 years now and i'm haveing a hard time getting a period back. I'd recommend this drug to anyone who doesn't want to have kids but if you want kids don't use this drug.

Birth Control	Kelly, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/19/2009 6:08:08 AM	I used this medication for about 4 years.  I was unable to use any other type of birth control.  In using this contraceptive I did not have a period at all.  I did not gain any weight and had no problems.  I have discontinued the drug at this time because I am trying to get pregnant.

I'm coming 2 the end of my 3rd &amp; LAST month with this &amp; wouldn't recommend it 2 anyone!!! I have never been so depressed &amp; so angry all the time!! It's badly affected my work,I've always been a very happy person but in the 3mths that i've used it, it's like i've been a different person! I've never felt so bad about myself, have often come close 2 bursting into tears!!For the 1st 2wks I had no bleeding at all but since then i've bled every day,which in itself is depressing! My body seems 2b aching more aswell. So please, if ur not sure about whether 2 go ahead, take my advice &amp; DON'T!!! I just wish i'd seen this site b4 I had the injection. :(
Birth Control	MyBonesHurt, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	1/24/2009 9:15:06 PM	I received my first injection last month. It has been nothing but TROUBLE for me physically. I have had the worst pain through out my body. The best way to describe it is as MY BONES ARE KILLING ME! I have been waking up in the middle of the night needing to use the bathroom or get a midnight snack and I can not get up right away because of my pain. I have been also waking up with my arms or legs being asleep, very tingly and numb. I DO NOT recommend this as an option of birth control. The only upside of this birth control is that no antibiotic can prevent it from working. Most birth controls are ineffective when you are on antibiotic. Thats not the case with this. But even with that said, its still not worth it and I also found out it decreases bone density and will cause future Osteoporosis. I am so off of this Birth Control and hope anyone who reads this will think of a different method of Contreceptive.

Once in a while had a spotty period, did not gain weight, some breast tenderness, but mostly fine.  Whenever it came time to get my shot again, within a few weeks I started to PMS, almost as if I was addicted to the shot.  i could tell as it came out of my system.  I always got the shot on my backside and alternated sides, now I have dents and lumps around the area I usually got the injection.  I have not had a period since coming off the shot. My last one was Jan 2008.  I feel like hell. My breasts are swollen and I have gained weight.  Feels like alot of fluid retention.  I always feel like I am PMSing. Also had some issues with cavities.  Six in six months, never had a problem before. Lack of calcium?  Everytime i ask my doctor, she just tells me I am lucky I haven't had a period.  I feel like something is not right:(  It's convienent to not have a period but at this point don't know if it was worth it.

Now having that said, within months of this shot (probably about 2 weeks after my second shot) i gained 21 pounds. On my tiny frame of a normal 97lbs, thats horrifying! I cant look in the mirror without gaging. If it was healthy weight that would be one thing, but its not! Its fat! I'd be fine with fit, lean weight but i have outgrown all of my clothing, and i feel disgusting! My mood is in the toilet i snap at people, and I'm already bipolar, so i have my issues but i used to be a nice-sweet bi-polar girl, now i hate everyone! My 4th shot is due in 3 days. I canceled it.

Birth Control	faith08, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	1/3/2009 7:27:09 PM	I got the depo shot for over 5 years and loved it at 1st. This drug caused vaginal imbalance for me and mood swings. Not to mention the weight gain. I gained over 40 pounds. I was constantly contacting my PCP due to the vaginal imbalance. I was prescribed lots of different creams and gels but nothing seemed to work, until I decided to not take anymore shots. Couple months after I stopped taking the shot, all was back to normal and I felt comfortable during intercourse. Just had a not so fresh feeling of not having a menstrual cycle each month to restore balance to vagina.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	12/16/2008 2:28:21 PM	I have only had one injection and that was about a month and a half ago.  So far I am pretty happy.  My period stopped altogether which is fabulous...I am enjoying not having to plan around it.  I may have gained a pound or two, but that isn't a big deal.  The only negative side effect I am having is some regular acne on my face...I used to get a few pimples now and then, but now it seems like I have them all of the time.  For now, I am just watching my weight to see what it is doing and using benzoyl peroxide on my face for the acne.  I think I am going to go for my second shot in February...the benefits seem to outway the side effects.
Birth Control	sp, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	12/1/2008 10:25:15 AM	I took the depo for over 10 years. I didn't realize that I was having the side-effects until I read all the reviews. Nonetheless, I really don't have many complaints about the BC. I am now going off of it since I have been on it for more than 10 years and don't want to risk the osteo. I did take the scan and everything is fine.  My question is did anyone have serious pain in the area that you were getting the injections once you came off of it?  I always got my shot in the left arm and now I am experiencing pain in that same area.  It hurts to take my shirts off.  I was wondering if it had anything to do with coming of the shot....??? 
Birth Control	Jessica, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/29/2008 11:41:46 PM	I love Depo. I did not have very bad periods prior to using it, and have not have a period since using it. I haven't experienced any weight gain, or any other side effects, except tender breasts every now and then. 
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/29/2008 11:41:25 PM	I used this for more than 10years, not initially for birth control but for not having monthly suffering and mood swings.  It worked! I felt relaxed, and enjoyed no hassles.  I did have minimal weight gain, but could maintain increased physical activity all month.  I reciently stopped upon doctors advise to await menopause.  I did also have Dexa Scans with no bone loss.  
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/28/2008 3:16:27 PM	I had a surgery on my fallopian tubes and ovaries for severe cysts when I was 11yrs. old and was told I would always have to be on hormones. When I had my son 3yrs ago and my period returned I had severe bleeding (daily for almost 20 days at a time). I went to the GYN and he suggested the shot because it couldnt make the bleeding worse and it would give me the hormones I needed. It has been almost 2 years and I no longer have periods (they stopped almost immediately), I don't cramp, or have any PMS symptoms. Its given me the ability to be active and not curled up helpless....I would recommend this to any girl who needs relief. Oh and it has kept my fiance and I from getting pregnant, so it's a good birth control too. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	11/25/2008 5:02:50 PM	I started receiving the shot 3 years and 3 months ago. For the first nine months I bled practically every day. However, after those nine months I have not had a period even once. I actually lost weight after beggining the treatment. I take depo because I suffer from ovarian cysts which rupture on occassion. Depo has stopped the rupturing, but when I would normally have my cycle, I still have some slight cramping and bloating. The mood swings were severe for the first few months, but I am now myself again. The only reason I am looking to switch methods is because of the effect this drug has on one's bone density. I have started to expreience joint pain from taking Depo for such a long time. I would recommend the shot, but only for those who are patient enough to wait for the side effects to fade away or lessen.

I did not want the Depo shot due to it having to stay in your system for 3 months regardless. I only opted for it as a last resort before surgery &amp; my sister had been on it for 7 years with no problems what-so-ever. I have had 3 injections and will NOT be getting my 4th. The first 2 injections, I was fine. Only once had break through bleeding. The last injection a little over a month ago has wreaked havock on my body! I am 32 and have had a severe, consistent breakouts on my face, neck and upper body. I am not a vain person but I am a professional and it is not attractive to look like a 15 year old girl. I have started loosing my hair by the hand fulls and within the last week, I have started having break through bleeding with severe cramping.  Not to mention the 30 pounds I have gained in one month! I will not be going back for the 4th time!  I would gladly go back to alternating pills every 3 months if my hair would stay on my head, my face looked like me and my body would stop blowing up!  I am now alternating pain medication to keep the cramping under control at the advice of my doctor and it is now staring to affect everyday life including work. This is not normal and I would not recommend this form of birth control to any woman regardless of the extent of her problems.

When I first started my period at 11 I had severe problems with way too much bleeding, cramping, nausea...it just never seemed to quit. I just recently got married a few months ago and decided to try the Depo Shot for other obvious reasons. My first shot, I experienced a little bleeding and spotting, nothing major and I LOVED it. However, towards the ending of my second and beginning of my third shot, I started spotting discolored blood and discharge irreguarly and heavly. I also started feeling nausous, dizzy, experiencing horrible headaches, weakness, frequent urination, and being exhausted. When I first started, I also experienced weight loss. However a friend of mine, has experienced no side affects at all and she has been on the shot for about a year and a half....it's just a risk you take....
Birth Control	ladybug623, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/6/2008 9:52:39 PM	I only had two injections however that was enough. After the first inj I had constant breakthrough bleeding through the entire three months. After the second inj the breakthrough bleeding stopped, I gained 40 lbs. But the worse part was after not receiving a third inj due to cost I did not get my period back for 7 months (after the three months) I finally did get my period four months ago, and have had it for four months straight. It has now been over a year since my last shot and my mood swings in this year have been utter he@# for me and my family. Not to mention the worst migraines ever as well as cramps bloating nausea and vomiting. I would never dream of recommending this to anyone, It is not worth it!!!!!

I dont get my period! I dont have any children and i only have to go get it every three months, i do have to say thought that the first 3 to 6 months were horrible, i had mood swings, some spotting and cried a lot for no reason, but after my body got use to it, its been great. Like with every drug that we take, its not going to be perfect for everyone, but this i would recomend to everyone that doesnt want to get pregnate

I started it when I was 15 and stopped when I got married at 18 within about 1 year I was pregnant with my son. After I had him I went back on depo. I took it for two years and then when my husband and I decided to have another child i stopped taking it again. It took almost 2 1/2 years for me to get pregnant with my daughter. I was very disappointed that it took so long for it to wear off. After I had my daughter I went back on depo and that was four years ago. I recently stopped taking it because in the last 4 years i have gained almost 80 pounds, which is disappointing since i am only five feet tall. I found this drug to be very effective but the side effect of the weight gain is a little much. I also found that while I was on it I did not have one period. That was one thing I loved about this for some reason I did not have any type of menstrual cycle while i was on it. But I am glad to be off of it now I have been taking the pill and have already lost 10 lbs in two months. so let's say that while the product was effective, the weight gain is a serious side effect.
Birth Control	songbird, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	10/23/2008 8:10:53 PM	As a form of birth control this is very convenient and affective. However, within weeks of my first injection I started to experience very aggressive mood swings over the most trivial of things. This has been a very unstable, scary drug interaction to have. I would blank out and find myself yelling at my 2 and 4 year old over the stupidest things. I would take a simple disagreement with my husband and turn it into a confrontational battle that would last for hours. This personality is something that I've never had to feel or deal with. I've always been an easy going, compassionate person. I get these mood swings and all I can do is fall down and apologize, and cry. I'm too young for my doctor to approve a hysterectomy or getting my tubes tied. And my husband and I know we aren't having more children. So all i can really do is be aware, identify, and try my own preventative steps to decrease this reaction. PLEASE if the other medications can work for you use this shot as your last choice. If my husband and I wouldn't have seen the connection between my sudden attitude change and the time period that I started these injections, this drug interaction could have cost me my children and my marriage.

I've had irregular bleeding(1 day on 1 day off). I never knew when I was actually going to bleed. I've had horrible cramps. Thats not even the part I can't deal with, the moodswings are driving me and everyone else around me crazy. I feel like I've had the worse case of PMS for the last 2 months. I can't wait the shot to be out of my body. I hate it.

Birth Control	ENM, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	10/17/2008 10:34:45 AM	I took my first (and only) shot in Feb 2008. I started bleeding 2 weeks after the shot and it lasted for 4 weeks. Apparently this was all normal and the doctors said not to worry. I stopped bleeding for 2 weeks in March, but it started right back up again. It is now October 2008 and I am still bleeding and cramping. My doctor put me on the nuva ring to stop the bleeding and it did for a month, but it came back and didnt quit. I am 25 years old and want to start having kids. I have been to the doctor 4 times and they havent done anything to help me. DO NOT TAKE THIS SHOT! There is no way of knowing how your body will take it. Try other options!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	10/16/2008 8:08:36 PM	Do not take this drug! I felt fine for the first month after my first injection and then everything went downhill.  I was extremely fatigued, weak, had headaches, dizziness and anxiety.  I also had unpredictable, irregular bleeding and generalized cramps daily.  It is now 6 months later and I am continuing to experience these side effects. Had I read these reviews before getting the shot, I would never have done it.  Needless to say, I didn't get a second dose.

Never in my life will I ever be on this again.  I have had mood swings, depression, weight gain, and just been overall in a bad mood since I have been on this.  I have been off for 6 mo. and my periods are still eratic and I have menstral cramps every day.  I cannot wait till this wears completely off.  It is a terrible thing to be depressed all the time, especiallu with two young children around.  No one should have to live like that.

I HATE THIS! No pms whooo hooo, no sex dry, much dryness, mood swings, the crying the madness, it's killing me. I have heard about the periods, not getting pregent after, I want another child, so I'm coming off this month, periods, and pain have got to be better then all of the above! My husband hates it, and he hates what it has done to me, he still loves me and has stuck by me though all this madness, but..if you think you might take this drug....DON'T!!!!!! Its good at first, but in the long run, you will need some kind of pill. It will cause the sexless nights, hair lost, mood swings, dryness, panic nights, bad dreams, headaches, and it will drive you CRAZY!

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	10/8/2008 8:41:44 PM	I have been on depo for over 5 years, with no problems except weight gain. I've gained about 30 pounds in the 5 years, but that has been my only issue. I had bad migranes right before I needed another shot, but getting the shot a few days earlier eliminated that problem.

At first i was really moody and became so dizzy i would have to leave work. But now everything is really good,I dont experience any side effects.The only thing i don't like about the shot is water retention but i found out taking bloating pills-i use 'beat the bloat'- helps out A LOT and since I started using the bloating pills i have been able to keep my weight under control. I love depo and I will continue to use it.
Birth Control	Not for everyone, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	10/2/2008 4:32:45 PM	I was somewhat satisfied with my experience on Depo. I immediately stopped having a period and only spotted a handful of times the entire time I was on it. The problem is when I stopped taking it. It was only after I started to question the side effects such as loss of sex drive (which I attributed to other things) and being on the drug for an extended amount of time (8 years) that my doctor suggested a bone density test. Needless to say, my bones were damaged and now I am in my mid 30's, taking calcium supplements and osteoporosis medication. I have also been treated for mastitis, which occurs in breast feeding women and can occur in women going through menopause, neither of which I qualify for. I don't know if this is a direct result of using the drug but it is the only thing that makes sense to me. I would suggest anyone looking into using this drug to do your homework and ask your doctor lots of questions. I made the mistake of thinking this method of BC was too convenient and because I was not having major issues there was no concern by me or my doctor to discontinue use. Only because of my bone density test am I now off this medication. Not having a period was very convenient but I would have chosen another path for the sake of being healthy.

I dont think my body likes hormones so i would always suggest getting in depth infor before starting birth control.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	9/23/2008 3:45:28 PM	After taking the shot for 6 months, I am going off of it. I read other's feedback and am starting to believe this drug affected me negatively. I enjoyed not having PMS or a period for 6 months. However, my hair is beginning to fall out in clumps and I am only 26! I did not remember this was a side effect until I read what others wrote. Also in the 6 months I went on it, I have been having panic attacks and extreme anxiety. I thought it was due to my new job but after reading everyone else's side effects, I am beginning to rethink the reason for my anxiety may be this the depo. I even began taking xanax because of the anxiety. Now I am thinking I don't need any of these drugs at all! I would rather have a baby. I couldnt remember to take my pills on time so I chose depo.  I am going off birth control all together now. Also on the webmd site it says this drug shouldnt be taken if you are a heavy drinker. Noone asked me when I started taking it if I drink. I wouldnt consider myself a heavy drinker but as a single 26 year old woman I go out quite often and drink and have never thought this should be a concern involved with this drug. I would recommend this to a woman with absolutely unbearable periods but not to anyone who has the slightest bit of depression or anxiety. Also it caused a lack of sex drive and dryness. My forehead broke out in MAJOR ACNE I NEVER HAD within a week of getting my first shot. It is going away now that I am in the final stages of this shots cycle. I am done with depo forever!

Gained 65 lbs in 3months, continual spotting for 42 weeks, became anemic,got Bell's Palsy because of it, still have no sex drive, lost part of my hair, Suffer w severe mood swings. DON'T TAKE IT. My husband said the reason why it was so effective while I had the one injection was because you couldn't very easily do &quot;anything&quot;, or feel like doing &quot;it&quot;.

The first was great! No period, no weight gain, no cramps... near the end I got a bit of PMS but that was it. The second shot brought some weight loss, clearer skin and still no period. Near the end I started having hot flashes, spotting, dizziness, severe mood swings,insomnia, fatigue, major back cramps, leg swelling and minor hair loss. (hair loss was worse after the birth of my son two years ago) I called the Dr begging for the shot early hoping to resolve the issues. I have since had the shot and most issues have been resolved. I am still having hot flashes, bleeding, leg swelling and insomnia. However now I am having panic attacks on top of it all. My Dr is taking me off the shot and putting me on the pill, but I have to wait till November.

At first, it was originally used for contraception, but after i split with my ex, it was used to stop my periods, as they were extremely heavy (was using up to 4-8 pads a day, the really thick, fat, long pads) and extremely sore cramping and migraines. That all stopped with the first 2 and a half years on it. When i was 19 and a half, i decided to stop, to loose weight, i have put on 4 stone with this damned injection and cant seem to loose the weight. I started back on it around May 2008 (i was 20 yrs and 4 months - im now 20 yrs and 7 months) and since being back on this injection, has been hell. I do not recommend it. I am cramping, my &quot;period&quot; seems to come and go when it feels like, the migraines are hell, i have very bad joint pain and cracking, stiffness of joints aswell (my body feels like a 50 year old woman now!) i am now experiencing this weird like dark brown/red discharge, which isnt normal, which i will now have to go back to the doctors again about. Please make sure you have done your homework before going and getting this injection. I now regret this injection so much!
Other	shadow, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	8/21/2008 1:36:13 AM	I started taking this shot on May 28,2008. The first 3 months i didn't have a period. I got my second shot on July 29,2008 and have had a spoting/medium peiod ever since, it's been 4 weeks now and i'm not happy. I go back to get my third shot in october, i  am not going to be getting another one. I don't like how long you get your periods, plus i'm starting to clot.I am not taking this for a birth control, i'm taking this so i dont have periods, I just had twins last july and dont need anymore kids right now. I am not happy with this drug.
Birth Control	MollysMamma, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/13/2008 4:50:41 PM	I just got my second shot a few weeks ago and I love it. I spotted lightly for the first six weeks but have not had an actual period since my first shot. This is a great method of birth control. I've gone through several different types of pills and even tried the patch all of which caused very noticable side effects for me. I even had an alergic reaction to the patch and it blistered my skin. With the shot I've had no problems. The worst part is actually getting the shot and the site was sore just like if you got a tetnus shot but that's nothing for three months of freedom from bleeding, cramping, and the hell that was my period. As far as moodiness and tiredness I had worse mood swings and tiredness on the pill. I have actually lost 15 pounds with the shot. I feel great. I plan on using this as long as they will let me. My doctor recommended a multivitamin to supplement calcium to prevent bone loss and even out any side effects. Pretty common when it comes to bc methods I feel. To all of the people complaining about not being told about the bone density loss. Where have you been? People talk about it all the time. If you read the pamphlet that comes with your prescription it lists the side effects in it. The internet has a wealth of information if you are that concerned about it now why didn't you bother to ask about the side effects or research it yourself to begin with. 
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	13-18	8/13/2008 2:01:31 AM	I'm 18 and chose depo without having been on birth control in the past. Everything was perfect for the first month until I had my period. Instead of lasting 4 or 5 days like normal, it just never stopped. I'm on day 15 already. I've also experienced weird mood swings and periodic decreased sex drive. I talked to my doctor and she said it isn't uncommon for women to experience periods that last six months on depo. I guess it's too bad none of the information I read or the doctors I talked to before getting the shot made it clear that this was a side effect or that it was fairly common. I will not be getting my next injection.
Birth Control	jgrant110, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/7/2008 1:18:47 PM	I have been on the depo shot for about 6 months now.  I was on the pill for 5 years and got pregnant on it.  I was on the patch for 3 years and got pregnant using that too.  So far the shot has worked for me.  I haven't gained any weight, actually lose about 3-4 pounds everytime I go in for the next shot and haven't had one period since being on it.  The only problem I've had was that I had to have my gall bladder removed 2 months ago and thought it was normal until I actually stopped and read side effects of the depo shot and noticed that gall bladder blockage, while rare, is still severe.  Other than that the shot has done perfectly for me.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	13-18	7/25/2008 2:05:30 AM	I'm 18 and never had birth control previously. I got the depo shot because it's very convient. The first 2 months were fine a little bit of anxiety but nothing major. I am now approaching my need for a 2nd shot (in about a week) and the last 2 weeks have been the worst ones ever. I had 3 panic attacks, am suffering from depression, spotting everyday, tired, weak, and have no desire to do my regular activities. I lost weight on this shot partially because the nausea has stopped my desire to eat anything. I will not do this again and do not recommend it. I just wish I would have read these reviews before my choice to take it.

After being on the pill for about 19 years, Needed a different form of BC, was reccommended that I use something without estrogen. NOT many options, so I went with depo. It has been 6 mo., still spotting every day, moderate depression and at times feel just wierd and not myself.  I have since decided to stop the depo and look at other options! It is very convieniant (sp, but I did not like the side effects. I have even had to start taking Wellbutrin XL for the depression/anxiety!  What a mess! So, for now I will go back on a low estrogen pill and hope for the best.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	7/22/2008 11:14:52 AM	I have been on  depo for 15 years. I didn't research the drug when I started and blamed the side effects (immense weight-gain depression, moodiness, and tiredness) on events in my life not the drug. over the last 2 years have come to realize that it is the depo. My last injection was in May and I have decided against getting my next injection and will discontinue permanently. It works great but the side-effects have gotten to be too much to bear anymore. I will post any side effects I feel upon discontinuing the drug.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	7/21/2008 5:30:45 PM	I used this drug as a form of birth control for a little over 3 years. I now have major bone loss. I was not made aware of this side effect as I &quot;took&quot; the drug in the early 90's. I now cannot take any birth control due to the effects of the drug. I have also lost all sex drive due to the drug and now my fear of getting pregnant unexpectedly. I love the drug while I used it. No bleeding, no major side effects while using it, and about 10 pound weight gain. Wish that I could use it again!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	2	1	Female	25-34	7/17/2008 4:01:22 PM	Constant periods, complete loss of sexual desire (you can imagine the problems that has caused me and my husband.) And I have still not recovered any sexual desire after almost 12 years of being off the Depo shot.  The risks may outweigh the benefit. DON'T USE THIS BC!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/16/2008 1:54:55 PM	I was on the Depo shot for 2 years before I had my last daughter and had no problems, no periods, no side effects at all.  The only problem I saw was when I got off the shot it took 2 years for my body to get back to normal, to have a period and to get pregnant.  I'm getting back on the shot this week.

Birth Control	newby05, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	6/30/2008 12:21:57 PM	I was on the depo shot for 3+ years.  I have now been off of it for 2 months and the last 2 weeks have been awful, by breasts are super tender, it hurts to have my shirt rub aginst them.  Also I have had mild to severe cramping, but no menstral cycle yet.  I also gained 15-20 lbs in the the that time, the weight did not start to show until I was about 1 1/2 years into the shot, I went up 2 sizes.  As for the bone loss I was only told of it after I have been on the shot for 3 years, I have the bone density test done and all was fine.  It is great birth control if you dont want children, but it suks after you stop taking it.......painful!

It took me about 9 months of being on it to realize that it was causing me to be depressed and really emotional and moody.  Also I have had a steady period for about 4 months now.  Since I have been on it for 9 months, I didnt understand why all of the sudden I had a period that still has not gone away.  I cant wait till this crap wears off and I will NEVER do this again.  It just messed my system up really bad.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	6/26/2008 1:47:06 PM	I am on this drug for birth control and to control my menstrual cycle. It works great as birth control, but I was told my periods were supposed to completely stop, also getting rid of cramps which are very severe for me. I've been on it for about a year now and for the first 2 months of each shot everything is great up until the last month. For the whole month i have a light period and constant cramping.  I've gained some weight, but have managed to keep it under control with diet and excercise. I have also been very moody and depressed.  When I first started the shot I would get so sick and dizzy I would have to leave work. Thinking about stopping this method once my month is over, will probably never try it again. Only upside is only having to get a shot once every 3 months

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	6/19/2008 1:39:04 PM	I was on the depo provera for four years. When i decieded to stop to try to concieve I found that this drug can take 2 years to leave your system. I haven't had a cycle since getting off the drug (It has been 9  months) I would never recommend this drug for anyone who wanted to concieve at any time in the future. Just use the pill. I also had substantial weight gain. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/19/2008 9:16:13 AM	I have been on the shot for a little over 2 years and I love it. I can't take the pill because I have migraines and would never go back to the pill again. The only side effects I have is for about a week after I get my injection, but other than that life is great.

The first 2 years no problems... but now I have huge issues with this drug. Headaches, tiredness, depression, hairloss, no sex drive what so ever... i mean to the point where my husband think i dont want him any more. I have extreme moodiness, leg pain, and im not as happy personality wise as i used to be. At first like i said no side effects but after a while i seemed to feel worse and worse each day to the point where i thugh I had a thyrod problem... and instead of my doctor telling me it was a result of this medication... he did 1000 dollars worth of blood work and 2 office visits... out of my pocket. I wouldnt recomend this to anyone... im 25 only 25... to young to be worried over a medication... no having a period is not worth the riskc or the overall life changing side effects this drug will eventually cause.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/21/2008 11:36:30 AM	I have been on this on and off for the last 5 years, the pill does not work for my family, my mother had all 3 of us while on the pill, same with my aunt and her 4 children.  So for me the shot has been a god send.  Yes I do have to take calcium every day but I figure it is worth the piece of mind.  I have been off it long enough for my periods to start back on a normal cycle and for me it takes being off of the shot for 6 months, but then again my family is the one of the SUPER fertile women so I guess that is no surprise.  I love it no periods, no spotting, no weigh gain, bones are fine.

Birth Control	Leah, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	5/9/2008 1:15:36 AM	I have been on Depo Provera for almost 9 years and I really like the easy of only getting the injection every 3 months and I have no menstrual cramps or periods. The downside effect is I have a significantly increased amount of body hair growth all over and I have decreased libido and my sexual arousal has almost diminished. I also have osteoporosis forming in my spine and I am only 24 years old. I was not informed about these possible side effects when I started receiving the contraceptive. Overall, it is very convenient and works well since I have never had a pregnancy, but the side effects are definately worth reconsidering this birth control method.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	19-24	4/30/2008 4:17:31 PM	I was on the shot for over 2 years. I love the fact that I didn't have to worry about pregnancy and after a few months my periods stopped completely. I was very depressed, gained about 15 lbs, and was very moody.... I just got off the shot a month ago, and lets say the withdraws suck! I had hot and cold flashes literally every 5 seconds. I am much happier now, feel a lot less tired, and have lost the weight that I gained while on the shot. now I am looking for some other form of BC, so if you have any ideas please feel free to send them my way!

Ive lost weight, and now know why I have been kind of depressed, loss of sex drive, and less pleasurable...dryness ...probably due to constant spotting.  Im going back on the pill.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/17/2008 7:18:09 AM	I have been on this for over a year and I love it. I always had trouble remembering my pills and this is a wonderful alternative. For about the first 9 months I was spotting but it beat the heavy heavy 10 day periods I had while on the pill. My doctor and NP have even tried recommending the Nuva-ring and other methods to me due to the fact that many patients gain weight and can experience bone density loss. I haven't gained a single pound since I was on this.  I don't feel like I've experienced any side-effects either. Moodiness maybe, but I would experience that not matter what. Hair loss is getting me to think, my hairdresser says I have really weak hair and I'm wondering if that is why...The shot is so easy.After reading some of the reviews, however, I noticed that many people say their doctor never warned them about the side effects...Its not the doctor's responsibility, its the drug company's. So either ask your doctor about the side effects when you are given the prescription or read that little pamphlet that comes in EVERY prescription you receive from the pharmacist!!!!!

The only issue, if you really want to complain is right before I am due for my shot, I have the signs of PMS. Hell, I take that once every 3 months over every month. No periods either, so yes I recomond that you at least give it a shot. Get it...

No period, but have had the acne, weight gain, depression, etc., but I'd still recommend it. Every 3mths, it's a breeze.

After starting my family I am now back on the shot again. Lately I am overtired, somewhat depressed and I am religiously working out for the first time in my life and am struggling to lose any weight. I am living and eating healthier than I ever had and I've never felt worse. After reading all the reviews about depo, I don't believe I'll be going back for my second shot!

A light period just before the next shot is due, thats it. My Doctor told me about the possible bone loss before we decided that this would be the best method for me. The only thing I would complain about is injection site pain, but it's no worse than getting a Tetnus shot.
Birth Control	tater.babe, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	5	5	3	Female	25-34	3/10/2008 5:43:33 PM	I was on depo shots for 9 years.  I loved not having a period. But alas now that I'm off(8 months) and trying to start a family I'm having major problems.  I've been put on many hormone treatments but nothing is starting a cycle for me. I can't help but feel like the struggle is 100% the depo.  I hope I can have children. 
Birth Control	arthur, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/10/2008 3:32:40 PM	I have been on the shot for 14 years. I love it, had a bone density test 2 years ago, and I am fine. No periods. Plan on staying on till menopause. I'm 39!  
Birth Control	KLisle, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	3/10/2008 11:18:31 AM	DO NOT GET THE SHOT!!! I got it a week ago and not even 7 hrs later I began experiencing stiffness and pain in the joints of my hands and arms. About 1:30 in the morning I woke my husband up crying because I litterally could not move! The weight of the sheets on my upper body was causing extreme pain! I couldn't lift my head off the pillow or roll over on to my side. It took us close to 20 minutes to go 50ft from the bedroom to the livingroom. Needless to say I went (by ambulance) to the ER. I was in so much pain that when they put my ID band on I was screaming in agony! The doctors had never seen anything like it! I am currently on a muscle relaxer, anti inflammatory and and antibiotic (b/c I have been running a temp of 101.2). And the worst part besides the pain...is that I can't even hold my 10wk old baby! All I can do is look at him! I would never reccomend the Depo shot to ANYONE!!!! It's definitely not worth the physical and emotional pain it puts you through!

Birth Control	liverma, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	2/28/2008 7:25:11 AM	what is the medical answer for this question.  How frequent should you have a bone density test while on the depo.  My only bone scan was done 8 years ago.  I am now 45.  I fired my gyno because I felt betrayed by not having an additional bone density scan.  I have a liver disease. I stopped the depo. I'm looking for the legal answer to my question.

I get a bad headache 2 weeks after the shot and 2 weeks before I'm due. The last &quot;period&quot; I had was 4 years ago and it only lasted a day and it was very light. I love not having a monthly cycle and I get it at my local health department. I think that the staff there has been 150% honest about the side effects and what could and couldn't happen. I haven't had one scare yet and I plan on staying with this method for years to come. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/16/2008 2:21:02 PM	I have been on the shot for 12 years and have loved it. I have had no negative side effects. I recently discontinued the shot and am wondering if anyone else has had any problems/side effects when they have stopped taking it?
Birth Control	princesssbsmom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	2/16/2008 3:16:02 AM	I first went on depo at 27 yrs old, and I had a wonderful time with it.  I lost a little weight, my periods slowed down to almost nothing, (I would spot every third month, as if my body were reminding me to get my next injection), and best of all it was a very convenient and effective birth control for me, especially being in a monogamous relationship.  I went off of it at 33, and got pregnant withing the year, (despite using ryhthym method and spermicide, the most wonderful suprise of my life!!!)HOWEVER...After I was successfully breastfeeding my daughter, I went back on Depo, expecting the same results.  Instead, I am getting headaches, suprise attack bleeding at any given time, and I have put on weight that I had lost after pregancy even though I am very strict on my diet. This, compounded by having a Bone Density Test done, and having my RNP reccommend that I quit the depo, I am investigating Mirena...the &quot;bad&quot; reviews of it seem to mirror the &quot;bad&quot; reviews of Depo, so I am going to talk to her to see if maybe the similar progesterone type method would have the same side effects on me.My overall opinion, if you are young and forgetful about your pills, this is a GREAT method.   
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	2/15/2008 8:56:12 PM	Experience on this drug was ok overall - no periods from point of first shot forward. Loved not having to remember a pill each day. No issues experienced by others except significant weight gain. I've been on the drug for about 1 year - have gained 15 pounds in that time - Diet &amp; exercise have not changed so the drug is having an effect - I'll need to switch to something else to get it under control.
Birth Control	KOS, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/3/2008 3:32:53 PM	I have been on depo provera for 3 years now. I lost a total of 40 pounds using this birth control method. I also want to state that it has been very easy for me to use and very effective.
Birth Control	MandieInIndy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/7/2008 9:22:33 AM	I've had a great experience using this shot. No weight gain, no moodiness, no periods. I noticed that when I stopped taking it for a short time, I gained weight and showed some symptoms of hypothyroidism. Has anyone heard of anything concerning how it affects the thyroid? I just recently got the shot again and I hope that it will put help me lose the weight I've put on.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/30/2008 3:01:05 PM	I have been on Depo for 3 years now and it's been a agreat experience. I started it because I had out of control pain during periods to the point it was interefering with my job and over-all life. I have had no side-effects and my periods stopped as soon as I had the first shot with no spotting or break through bleeding. Reading other reviews it sounds like I'm very lucky. There is a few hours right after I get the shot that I'm a little nauseous and depressed but it goes away quickly. I will continue to use this product for as long as my doctor lets me
Birth Control		4	5	1			1/28/2008 8:05:02 PM	I got my first depo shot a month after the birth of my daughter.  Two days later I started bleeding and kept on for two weeks.  I gained five pounds in three months.  My hair was falling out.  My daughter is now seven month old.  I have only had one light period since then. Since getting the shot, I have generally not felt too good and wouldn't recommend it to others.

Weight gain, hair loss, mood swings and I feel like Im 9 months pregnant. I have had tons of tests and no one can figure out why. After my last shot I noticed my symptoms have worsened so I started researching the drug. If I knew about any of these problems I would have stopped a long time ago. I am through with depo and I no longer trust doctors. I specifically asked my dr about bone loss because I broke my ankle in an accident and it took 18 months to heal. She told me depo didnt have anything to do with my bones! I will research any drug that is prescribed to me from now on. Be very carefull with this drug. Not having a period is not worth the risk, and I have endometriosis and can say that. I am going to find another form of treatment. I have had so much anxiety over trying to find out whats wrong, not to mention the $ i have spent on Drs. Reading these remarks was an eye opener! Thank you.

Endometriosis	brandie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/13/2008 4:06:09 PM	I have been on the depo for about 4 years and it is great not having a period.  I have no bone loss, but I am changing to a oral pill because my weight gain is out of control, and I have had several people tell me that it is due to the shot.
Birth Control	Magdalena, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/11/2008 2:46:54 AM	I have been on Depo now for 5+ yrs now and I have had a few spotting incidents but besides that no scares no babies Im just scared that when me and my bf of 3yrs plan on having a child we will not be able too. besides that I love it  
Birth Control	Buttapecan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/7/2008 9:31:59 AM	I have been using the depo for a little over 4 yeara now, and I love it. But reading the ratings that other women have wrote, I am a little disturbed about the bone loss and other complaints. I also had no idea that it could possibly take up to 2 years to get pregnant after discontinuing the depo. I just got my shot last week. I am seriously considering discontinuing the depo. The depo is very easy to use, but I dont know if it is worth the long term hassle.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	13-18	1/7/2008 8:00:20 AM	i was on depo for a lil over 2 years and just go off it and i get awful periods and really bad mood swings and can its horrible i would NEVER get on it again
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/6/2008 1:48:53 PM	I have been taking depo for 5+ years and I think that it's great. I did spot rather continuously for the first year, but not having periods since has been absolutely wonderful. I wish there were a way I could continue taking depo and simulatneously conceive later on down the line :) . The only other side effect I have had is loss of interest in sex, although sex is stil as enjoyable as without depo, it takes more effort to become stimulated.
Birth Control	jennleepres, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	1/6/2008 11:57:23 AM	I've had terrible mood swings(almost everyday), no interest in sex, I've been on a lite period for 3months straight with no end in site, acne breakouts. My side effects are too severe to continue the contraceptive. I'm sure my husband thinks I've turned into a monster. 
Endometriosis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	2	Female	35-44	1/2/2008 2:38:06 PM	I had my first shot and experienced a 6 lb. weight gain in the 1st month and very moody. I was talked into this by my doctor. I have extremely painful periods and leg pain and she thinks I have endometriosis. The alternative is a hysterectomy.
Birth Control	Wrong Choice, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	12/30/2007 10:01:10 PM	The so call less severe side effects got me right away. Scalp hair loss, depression, abnormal sleeping, and others. It was great not have a period, but hair loss is not worth it for me. I didn'd go back for that second shot. Doctors done volunter any info any more you got to do the research yourself. unfortunatly I was to late.
Birth Control	Jem, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	12/30/2007 1:58:18 PM	I have been taking Depo for about 5 years. Overall, I have been very satisfied with the medication. I have experienced minimal side effects while on the drug. I have only gained a couple pounds over the last 5 years, and do experience some moodiness that seems extreme time to time. I do not have any periods, except spotting for 2-3 days around the time I am due for my next shot. I did have one bad time period where I was very emotional at the time I received on of my scheduled shots, and I spotted for practically the whole 2-3 months until my next shot. That was very frusterating, but only happened once. Other than that, I am very pleased with the Depo shot.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	1	Female	25-34	12/26/2007 12:36:54 PM	It seem great at first - no periods, and its so easy to use - but after being on it for a while it started to mess with my moods, I was sad and depressed and crabby all the time. I also had mild hair loss, terrible acne and gained 10lbs. Not worth it in the long run.
Other	Diane0001, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/26/2007 8:21:09 AM	Just so people know it has only been recently discovered that some people will have bone desity problems that take depo. I have been on depo for 15 years and I to was just told to go get a dexa scan and I was ok no problems if ostoprosis runs in your family it is advised to be careful taking depo. I have had no real side-effects to speak of I take depo due to a ovarian cyst that causes pain and bleeding. I have to say not having a period is a great side effect!
Birth Control	alexiss, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	12/21/2007 4:40:55 AM	the depo has 2 many sideeffects that can be  life altering.and potentioley dangerious

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/28/2007 6:42:39 PM	I have been on the Depo shot for 6yrs now.  Though I have experienced depression with taking it, that is no where near the depression I would have had had I ever gotten pregnant again..lol. I was on the Pill when I got pregnant with my daughter at 18yrs old.   I have found that taking my vitamins on a regular basis does ease alot of the symptoms that may occur with the Depo shot, for me atleast.  I have had the Bone Density test and it came back great.  That's not to say it will next time, I do realize that.  I think that this shot is wonderful...virtually no worries, in and out of the doctors office..it's great!!!

No periods, no pills, just a quick Dr. visit.  The down side has to be the bone loss.  After 5 years, I developed osteopenia and was advised to stop the depo.  Please, please have regular Dexascans if you plan to start or are on long term Depo use.

But now at age 46 I have osteoporosis. No one warned me about bone loss. I broke my leg doing normal everyday activities. I have warned my Depo-using friends, whose doctors never told them either. I'm told I can't use any hormonal form of birth control.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/8/2007 12:31:23 AM	So far, this is working out great for me. I am in a long-term relationship, and we haven't had so much as a pregnancy scare yet. My only objection is that for a few days after recieving the injection, it causes some pain at the site of the shot and on my lower back (I get it in my hip). Other then that, kudos!
Birth Control	tisharanes, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/7/2007 3:21:48 PM	I love this shot! I tried the pill and the nuva ring after I had my son. None of them worked out for me. The only problem I have is now I have to remember to take calcium, as you can guess that is not going well. Not having a period is a HUGE bonus. They didn't tell me I might not have them when I started getting the shot. The main thing you need to know is that you have to ask your doctor about all the effects. I was on it for three years before they told me about the bone loss.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	10/28/2007 5:09:28 PM	I was never informed of the risk of bone loss by my doctor or nurse. I am going to discontinue taking this form of birth control.

Birth Control		5	5	5			9/30/2007 11:18:55 PM	I didnt have any periods. This was so much easier to use when I dont wake up the same time every day to take the pill. It would take only 10 minutes at the doctors office and then I would be set for 3 months.
