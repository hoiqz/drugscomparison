In 2000, at 17yrs old I was diagnosed. Since taking this medicine my hair has become so much prettier and thicker. I don't have brittle nails and I don't suffer from being cold as much as I used(example: being outside at 17yrs old it's about 95 degrees and I'm walking about in jeans and sweatshirt but I'm comfortable while everyone else is in tanks and shorts sweating from the heat.) My depression I battle with is nothing like it was before my TSH levels became normal with taking Synthroid. Before taking Synthroid I did have a large weight gain and once my levels reached the 'normal' correct levels for my body I lost the extra weight with very little exercise(walking 2-4 miles 3 days a week) So my overall experience with Synthroid has been good although I am young to have this issue and will have to continue to take Synthroid for the rest of my days to help maintain my health. I'll admit getting my blood work done on a regular basis isn't always the greatest, but a requirement when treating Thyroid Disease.
Underactive Thyroid	JWMeds,  Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		8/16/2010 4:42:37 PM	I have been taking a very low dose for the past few years. Have also skipped this medication and have not had any adverse side affects. I would like to discontinue medication and try a natural remedy of some kind.
Underactive Thyroid	Sherwood, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	7/12/2010 2:36:08 PM	Overall I think I have more energy.  I have only been on it for 3 months and I went from 25 to 50mcg.  I do still have days where I have no energy and I wake up almost everyday feeling like I'm swollen. Especially my hands and face.  That stinks being I had already gained 15 pounds before I realized I was not just &quot;being lazy&quot; and something was really wrong with me. Hard for a person that is very motivated and responsible. I will continue to take it and see how it goes.

I have never been told by a doctor or pharmacist that I should not use these things,which I don't understand, but the medication works much better without them.

Forest bought the rights and it is used in place of the original Levothroid.  It is not the same as the original.

At first it was fabulous. Energy went up, nails grew, skin wasn't dried out, but after about 6 months, my nails have all broken, my skin is super dry again...but thankfully my energy is still good. I am also starting to experience excessive sweating (when working out) and my balance is way off. Sometimes I feel like I'm being taped for AFV. After my initial diagnosis 10 years ago, I still have found a thyroid med that helps shed pounds, but Boot Camp is starting to help and I love it. Just had some labs done and it looks like I'm slightly overdosed now, so I'm sure the Dr. will adjust at the next appt.  Overall, so far, I'm very pleased. I even take it at night with my other meds and seem to have no problems.

Can't take any diet products or supplements so I think levothroid pretty much sucks!
Underactive Thyroid	LindaGreff, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	6/15/2009 2:55:05 PM	I'm on the brandname - Synthroid, and the lowest dose possible. The only thing this medicine has done is change my T4 level -- no effect on lethargy, bradycardia (low heart rate), nails, hair, or dry skin.  Also, I gained seven pounds when I started the med; doctor and pharmacist claimed water weight, but I can't lose it.  But since my numbers are good, the doctor says it is working, won't change the dose. HA.  I think that's a false positive result, only changing the T4 with no other discernible results.

Underactive Thyroid	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	3/16/2009 7:16:18 PM	Levothroid can be a bit difficult. My doc cant seem to find the right dose- when he gave me too much I was full of energy, kinda shaky, and losing my hair. Now that my dose has been lowered I am more tired. However, it hs definitely helped me lose weight, which is a good thing. 
Underactive Thyroid	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	3/5/2009 5:32:37 AM	I have always been thin, but starting two years ago I started to slowly put on weight. I thought it was because I was getting older, but then the other symptoms starte. My Dr. checked my Thyroid all the time and I guessed it never showed, but the syptoms were so bad he thought it was MS. I had the worst headake that lasted for two mo to begin with, I was walking into walls, falling down, lossing movment in my limbs, forgetting things (like who I was, what I was doing, what I was going to say, how to talk/ spell), I couldnt get out of bed somedays, I was in the hospitial everyother week, my brain would just shut down on me, I would get tremors, twiches, and a few other mental things. Bottom line its a pain to wake up early to take and the fact you cant take your other meds tell 4 hours later is hard, but its worth it! This is the first time in 2 years I have felt normal and no more talks about MS, thank you GOD!!

So far...no luck! But it did get rid of my goiter and give me a little more energy. I'm hoping we'll adjust to a higher dose after my next round of testing. I also wish my doctor would have found the problem 15 years ago when I first started to gain weight for no reason.

My body was placed out of whack when I had my daughter. We started with the lowest to the highest for 6 month each and none of them seems to help.  I still have fatigue, always cold, water retention, headaches.  Then of course I also get insomina so that just adds more to my daily fatiuge, I have had to take sleeping pills to get me thru the night, but then I wake up with headaches in the morning that lad on till about noon. My next doctors visit is next month so we'll see what is next.

Underactive Thyroid	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	1/29/2008 6:37:30 PM	I have still continued being fatigued, cold, and many mood swings.  My blood pressure has been high since using this medication and was just advised by my doctor to discontinue using this medication.  I have only been on it for one and a half months and already seeing problems.  My days very from being on a 'high' to being very 'low.' my high days go from three am when I wake up til nine at night when I go to sleep.  My low days i have to encourage myself to get out of bed to go to work, and then they drag on til three pm at the latest.  At that time I am so exhausted and wore out i dont even have the ambition to even shower before retiring to my bed.  I also have Restless Leg Syndome and on my low days I have a lot of problems with my restless leg.  This medication was very hard to work into my busy schedule also.  I was taking it in the very morning when i woke up and could not eat until six am on my first break.  Cutting dairy out of my morning breakfast was a big issue for me. Overall I am pretty unsatisfied with this drug and hope to start using a new one within the next month or so.
