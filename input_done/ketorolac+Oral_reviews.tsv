Severe Pain	the cure, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	7/29/2012 9:54:18 PM	I was given this medication over the counter in Mexico when I had a horrible migrane that was persisting for several days.  The pharmacist reccomended 10 mg tablets, as needed.  It is the only thing that I have found that works so well on such horrible migranes.  I have not experienced any side effects.

Got Toradol Injection and 10mg Ketorolac to follow-up 4x day.  The injection released the pain/inflammation within 15 mins and the tablets maintained.  You cannot take tabs for more than 4 days

I have tried many meds for migraines, but this was the worst.  It did absolutely nothing for my pain, and caused severe stomach upset.  I followed all directions, and ate before taking.  I will never take this medicine orally again.

Severe Pain	truthfully2u, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	10/23/2010 3:37:34 PM	My Dr. had prescribed Ketorolac to me for tooth pain,until I could get to the Oral Surgeon to remove it. I took it,and it gave me a HORRIBLE migraine. I couldn't take anything else to help it because you are not supposed to mix with any other NSAID's. I was really slowed and didn't want to even move...like I was really doped up,not thr happy kind either.It actually made me in a REALLY bad/angry/irritable mood.After taking it the pain was WORSE. It was a horrible feeling. Not sure what they put in this drug,they said I could only take it for 3 days, but it did not work for me. I am just dealing with the horrible pain until surgery. 
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	35-44	9/26/2010 4:57:37 PM	I get migraines here and there maybe once or twice a month. They get so severe on my right side of my head that I cannot function. Last year I had Imitrix and it was an awesome medication. Too expensive. then my doctor put me on Ketorolac and it doesnt do well at all. I have to keep taking it and it just dulls the pain and it comes right back several hours later. The good thing abou it, its cheap but they wont give me anymore. Frustrated as hell...tired of migraines.

I took Torodol oral along with phenergan for my extreme migraines. The Torodol helps with the pain to an extent. The phenergan helps with the assossiated nausea and helps me sleep without waking up every other 10 minutes from the pain. I have had better results for my migraine pain with other meds, but if I feel the onset of a migraine coming, first thing I reach for is my Torodol.
Severe Pain	Jeri,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female		7/2/2010 12:14:25 PM	I have been suffering with lower back pain and sciatica for 2 years now.  I had gone to the emergency room and the physician attending prescribed Ketorolac 10 mg, until I could see a specialist.  I have rarely taken it, but when I do, it seems to be very effective for me.  I can feel my lower back tightening and I take one to help &quot;unlock&quot; it.  I use this sparingly.  It's a nice &quot;ace up my sleeve&quot; when I get into trouble with my back.  I have to be careful with pain drugs.  My body doesn't like them that well. I have stomach problems also.  This drug works for &quot;short-term&quot; help. I try to do things on my own.

When I was able to get up I had tingling in my hands and feet (felt like they had gone to sleep and felt very fat or swollen). From my arm pits down to the tips of my fingers it looked like I got sunburned and also from my abdomen down to my toes was the same way. It only lasted for about 15 minutes and it was over but I will never take again because of my bodies reaction and it was only 10mg

I previously found relief only with Hydrocodone which I found to block and or stiffen the colon and bowel which resulted in added complications. Toradol (Ketorolac) did such a great job of managing my associated kidney stone pain without the side effects of, and complications from Hydrocodone pain medication. Toradol did exactly what it was intended for the initial kidney stone pain and as stones pass completely through the system. I did not have any side affects; however I do highly recommend reading the online side affects, because they can be severe.

Worse was the non-productive cough,constant aching which was not relieved by 600Mg of IBU,fever with lack of sleep.  Diagnosed with influenza.  Dehydrated.  Treatment included IV with  Toradol &amp; steroids.  What a relief!  I dozed off as the pain was relieved for the first time.  I was also given an RX for Toradol which I may take at bedtime or for returning pain every 8 hours. Note: I did have a flu shot.

I previously found relief only with Hydrocodone which I did not like taking. Toradol(Ketorolac) has done such a good job of managing my pain without the side effects of the narcodic pain medication. The Toradol does, however, make me feel somewhat &quot;zoned-out&quot; or like my energy level is extremely low.
