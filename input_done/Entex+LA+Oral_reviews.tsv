At this time there is no subs, go figure find a product that works and someone's going to find a illegal use for medication, just like suda.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	4/2/2008 1:36:12 PM	I'm currently 42 years old.  I took Entex LA in my mid-20's for about 2-3 years to help me with my asthma which I developed at 21 from sharing an office with chain smokers. I was prescribed to take 1 pill every 12 hours.  If I missed one doze I would get sore throat, if I missed more than one doze I would get a cold which I couldnt get rid of for weeks.  Other than that, it kept me breathing freely but did NOT reduce my asthmatic attacks so I stopped taking it.  Since smoking was banned in public places my asthma started getting better and I have not had an attack in about 4 years.

Cold Symptoms	TrishS, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	9/22/2007 10:35:15 PM	Basically this med works to break up the mucous so I can get rid of it and breath better.  Don't you just hate it when you can't breath through your nose?  Or can breath only through one nostril?  What a bummer!  Well, Entex helps to reduce those symptoms and others as well!
