Cold Symptoms	Love it, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/21/2011 2:16:56 AM	My doctor gave it to me 12/2011. Had to get at the hospital drugstore. They compounded it since it's no longer on the market. Works great.  Ask your doctor send you to compounding shop they will make it per the doctor's prescription.

Cold Symptoms	ChuckV,  Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male		2/16/2008 1:16:43 AM	Within half an hour of taking this medication I had a severe allergic reaction. I had to be rushed to the ER because i broke out in hives all over my body, had breathing trouble, dizzyness, swollen tounge, tingling lips, and swelling of my face. I would never take this medicine again. I am now on Prednisone and this medicine is horrible, but it is making me feel better.

It helps calm the cough, scratchy throat,and all the rest of the allergy symptoms so that I can get some rest. If I take half a teaspoon during the day it doesn't make me sleepy and it still helps control cough and all.

It has helped me not to cough so bad and I am susposed to take one or two spoons every four to six hours I take one in day time and two at night.  I think it has helped me to sleep without coughing so bad at night.  I have only been on this medicine one night and one day but so far it is helping me.  I have high blood pressure but I don't think it has effected me with my blood pressure that I can tell.  My doctor knows I have highblood pressure so I think she knows how to treat my condition.  So far I am satisfied with the medication.
