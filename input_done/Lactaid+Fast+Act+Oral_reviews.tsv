Inability of Body to Handle Lactose or Milk Sugar	scart41, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	9/19/2012 8:17:59 PM	My Gastrointestinal doctor thinks I'm lactose intolerant, and recommend I try lactaid, before going lactose free in my diet.The 1st time I took Lactaid Fast acting, I was sick for an entire day with violent vomitting, diahhrea, and muscle fatigue and chills. The doctor told me I had a stomach virus, but I knew that was wrong because I had only become ill on the tuesday and thursday I took the lactaid, not on the wednesday in between. So now, a month later, I have taken the lactaid again with an early a.m. snack of cheese and crackers. Like before, I am violently ill about 1 or 2 hours after taking the pill. I have now proven that the lactaid is the problem. Interesting to see so many are getting sick, yet the box lists no warnings and never indicates this to be a common side effect. Alarming.

I'm glad I didn't read these comments before I tried this product - they would have terrified me. But I have never had any problems - with the brand name or with the Kirklands (Costco) brand. This allows me to eat normally - ice cream, cheese, italian food -basically anything. I'm assuming what the other people are experiencing is an allergic reaction.

I usually drink more than a gallon/wk. A side effect for me is constipation and feel the tablets may not be the best daily.

Inability of Body to Handle Lactose or Milk Sugar	ChrisGill, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	4	1	Female	45-54	6/15/2012 11:11:07 AM	After becoming intolerant to milk and yogurt, I thought this Lactaid Fast Act pill was a Godsend. I first noticed I became mildly nauseous. I took it before dinner once, and vomited the whole meal on the car ride home. I thought it was something bad I ate. The pill was working and I could eat dairy just fine, as I thought. This last time, I wanted ice cream, took the pill and violently vomited again about two hours after. I know it is the Lactaid Fast Act pill now. It knocks me out the following day too with chills and sweats. I think I will go back to my soy milk. Ice cream is not really good for you anyway. 
Inability of Body to Handle Lactose or Milk Sugar	 on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	3	1			5/5/2012 3:13:56 PM	This medication made me very sick! Each time I took it, with in an hour, I was violently vomiting, had severe abdominal cramps and diarrhea, had the chills, etc. After a few times of this happening I was able to figure out what was causing it, I haven't thrown up in years and this was a pretty big shock. I don't know if it was a reaction to the lactase or the ingredients that bind it, but I won't be taking this medication again.

Can't take the pills anymore. Lactaid milk still is ok-for now. I think our bodies may develop some allergy to it somehow over time.
Inability of Body to Handle Lactose or Milk Sugar	Nikki,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female		1/21/2012 3:48:44 PM	Twice I have taken this medication with the same results: fast onset of severe abdominal cramps, nausea, chills, dizziness. The second time I vomited. I also didn't make the connection between the pill and the symptoms until the second time. There is quite a lot of evidence online that these are possible side effects to this medication; however only in forums like this, not in the official list of side effects. Also, according to this site, the medication has not been reviewed by the FDA. How exactly does that work?

I must say, the first 7 times I took the Fast Act Lactaid, I did not experience any problems, but the last two times I became violently sick about 15 min. after taking. ( I thought the first time that maybe I had caught a virus...though I hadn't felt ill before taking the pill.) Did I possibly develope an allergy to it? Going to search for answers.

Last two times he has taken began vomiting at school and was sent home sick.  Both within a weeks time.  In between, he was normal until he took another dose.  After second time, we knew it was the stuff he took and began reseaching to see if others had the same problems!!!!
Inability of Body to Handle Lactose or Milk Sugar	kp, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	6/20/2010 1:40:09 AM	What a nightmare. My doctor told me to try this because I became lactose intolerant after I got a parasite in Mexico. Within 2 minutes of swallowing this pill, I turned completely red, was so hot, I asked my husband for ice.  Then I got the shakes. Then I was in excruciating pain and dry heaving over the toilet for the next three hours. I finally threw up. I was sick for the next 48 hours but not as violently as I was for the first 6 hours.  I almost went to the emergency room because my lungs started to get tight. I took a benadryl which solved that problem but I was still miserable. What a horrid product.

I am extremely lactose intolerant, but am able to regularly include dairy products in my diet as long as I take the medication. You may need to take two with especially rich creams, milkshakes, etc.

Inability of Body to Handle Lactose or Milk Sugar	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/3/2010 4:08:30 PM	I have become a tad lactose intolerant, so I took Lactaid chewables with good results. But the Fast Act pills (which I bought by mistake) left me feeling like I wanted to die: stomach cramping and violent vomiting. Within 10 minutes of taking a pill, my stomach starts churning and gurgling, then the pain starts. Taking nothing and drinking 8 ounces of milk would never leave me feeling THIS bad. It took me a while to figure out the source. Now I plan to throw the Fast Act away, get the chewables and hopefully get over my new fear of eating anything!
Inability of Body to Handle Lactose or Milk Sugar	martha, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1		45-54	1/27/2010 12:02:45 PM	I started using the Lactaid pills about a 2 weeks ago, whenever I wanted to eat yogurt, ice cream, pizza, etc. The last two times I used the pill, I had a severe reactions after about an hour of taking them. Nausea, vomiting and some bowl movement. I had eaten yogurt the firt time and thought it was due to maybe it being old or something, but the second time (about 2 days later), I had just eaten pizza... I will not take Lactaid pills again! I literally had not thrown up any of my food since about 8 years ago, and that was due to an antibiotic side effect.

I had a double-scoop ice cream cone and for the first time, I didn't get diarrhea! The Fast Act is taken with your first bite of dairy, and boy, does it work. I have been lactose-intolerant for years and suffering when I ate dairy.  I will use this product from now on.

Elimination diet determined a problem with ANY type of dairy product. Have been religously taking before each meal and have had NO bouts with bowel explosions.
