Other	LIKE LABOR PAINS, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	3/23/2009 8:50:12 AM	I took this stuff and had and still have Severe Abdomonial pain.  I thought the pain was from my period, but after my period went away the pain is still there and I didn't start having the abdominal pains until after I took the medication.  I would not take this again because the pain is not worth it.  I would have to use another alternative.  The cramps fill like I am in the beginning stages of labor all over again.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Fl Gal, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	1/30/2009 7:27:06 PM	I used this twice in the last two years, the first time it worked great, cleared up quickly and actually brought almost immediate relief. Most recently, it took longer to cure the BV, about 4 days, and I had worse irritation for a few days after using. I also developed a yeast infection, which did not happen the first time I used the product. I think the effectiveness of the medicine depends on how serious your infection is and what else is going on with your body, hormones etc. It will work, give it time. If you do not feel better in a few days call your doctor and they will recommend something else.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	1/20/2009 4:56:58 PM	I used this drug with no symptoms until a week later. I developed itching which was listed as a possible side effect. The next day it intensified and nothing seemed to relieve it.  Was a weekend also so waited until my doctors office opened on Monday and was prescribed Diflucan.  By then the itching had increased and I had intense burning and discharge and swelling.  Took the Diflucan and after second day am feeling relief.  My doctor says I have yeast now but not relating to a side effect of the Clindesse because that would have been right away. I think otherwise. I would never use Clindesse again. The side effects a week after use were way worse than any yeast infection I ever had.

A lot of reviews on here say that it is very expensive.  The clindesse website has a $15 rebate form to fill out (you need to take it the pharmacy with you to get a label).  So that may help with the cost.

You all need to actually talk to your gyn/health care provider before jumping all over the medication and blaming it. Some general information:1. BV almost always returns at some point, regardless of what it is treated with. Consider yourself lucky if it was a one time problem for you! Metronidazole gel or pills are really the only other prescription option. This drug also has nasty side effects (the gel causes the same kinds of discharge, clumping, etc, and the pills give most people horrible stomach aches/cramps.)2. Your period will often cause an onset of BV due to drastically changing the pH level of your vaginal area. If the infection returns you will have to be retreated. 3. Because medications for BV cause a lot of bacteria to die, it is not AT ALL uncommon to get a yeast infection after treatment for BV. Ask your doctor to prescribe Diflucan at the same time they proscribe something for BV if you are prone to yeast infections. Unfortunately, the yeast infection or the diflucan can cause an onset of BV again. Welcome to the vicious cycle.Anyway, in my experience Clindesse is just as effective as any other medication for BV - which is, sadly, not terribly effective as a long term solution. At least it is less hassle to use, as opposed to Metro-gel inserted for 5 days, or metronidazxole pills for a week or two. Try asking your doctor about a combination of treatments if you are still having trouble.For those of you on the pill: you may want to consider taking a three month pill like Seasonique. This has helped by causing me to only have my period once every 3 months, and thus greatly reducing the frequency of BV problems caused by the blood/pH problem with my period.Conclusion: I like Clindesse better than the alternatives. Don't expect anything to be a miracle cure for this problem.

I was given Clindesse thinking it would be so easy and side effect free, but I was incredibly wrong. I have had severe cramping and abdominal pain from the first day. I would never take this drug again!!!

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	11/25/2008 8:19:16 PM	I have had what seems to be a yeast infection for almost two month.. My obgyn prescribed me Diflucan (two single pills to help with this problem) and cream.. I waited 5 days until I felt like the infection had past to had intercourse. By the next morning, the infection was back and EXTREMELY irritating and painful. I immediately went back to her and she prescribed me Clindesse. This is totally ineffective and I took it on a Monday.. Waiting til that Friday to call my doctor and tell her that this medication was not working.. She said wait until Monday and call back. I had to go 3 horribly uncomfortable days because of her decision. Now I am taking Metronidazole Im on the second day... I still have thick white discharge.. slight itchiness. I have tried so many things. My boyfriend and I just decided not to have intercourse for a long time. 
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	11/24/2008 4:48:13 PM	I was diagnosed with BV approximately 2 months ago.  After administering Clindesse), waiting 5 days to have intercourse and eating yogurt everyday (as my Doctor instructed) the  infection went away.  Nevertheless, about 2 weeks later (after my period) the infection returned.  My Doctor told me that sometimes your period can trigger the infection to come back on.  To me, this is absurd.  My doctor prescribed Clindesse to me again, which I administed three days ago.  So, we will see if it goes away and stays away this time.  The disappointing aspect of this situation is the thought of having to live with this for the rest of my life, because no one knows what causes BV.  This has been extremely frustrating.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Stylistgal, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	11/23/2008 7:42:00 PM	Last week my Dr. gave me this medicine to try after I explained to her some weird symptoms that i've been having lately.  As soon as I got home I administered the cream.  My boyfriend and I waited to have intercourse again for the 4days like my dr said.  The first time, there was alot of watery discharge and clumps of cream that came out with penetration.  So we waited a few more days and the discharge was back to normal but there were still thick white clumps that came out.  Also a very &quot;medicinal&quot; taste during oral sex.  Its almost like the cream is still inside.  The positive : there is NO smell finally!!The negative: not knowing how long i should have really waited before intercourse, AND it kinda kills the mood and made me feel bad.  I'm definately going to contact my dr in the morning.  Especially after reading all the reviews of this product and seeing that it can cause yeast and fungal infections.  Hope this helps.**Luckily I have an amazing boyfriend that is willing to wait and work with me until this all gets cleared up.  He also thinks that the weird &quot;clumpy&quot; stuff is the medicine.***

Clindesse is a waste of my time. I didnt get any relief from it. I took it on a tuesday night and by friday i had a yeast infection. IF your doctor gives you this as for something for yeast infections if you happen to get one after your finish this Rx.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Starr, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4		35-44	11/11/2008 9:10:53 PM	I don't know how long this infection lingers, but it seems when I take the weekly dosage, it resumes at the end of the week.  Does this go away in three to four weeks, because it hasn't in the last two.Lots of medicine comes out during urination.  Does that help me heal?  Please answer my questions.  Concerned
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/21/2008 3:04:56 PM	I was very satisfied that this product worked and cleared that nasty odor!!!  The only problem that I had was about 3 to 4 days later I had intense itching and burning that made me feel as thought I had a yeast infection and after reading the side effects from the sheet the pharmacy gave me put my mind at ease.  I would recomend this medicine to anyone suffering from BV it works! as far as all of you that want to know how long you have to obstain from intercoure thats a question you would need to ask your Dr. as im sure all Dr's. will have a different answers I will tell you what my Dr. said,  he told me 24 hrs is long enough to obstain. I asked that question cause as with my Husband alot of Boy Friends and Husbands out there don't like to wait...I hope this was helpful to someone that may or may not have experianced the same side effects as me.  Althoguh I had this rough patch with this medicine I would still highly recomend it... 
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	10/9/2008 10:41:20 PM	The meds worked great.  Used before I went to bed and had relief by morning.  The only downfall is that no where can I find any information about the after time.  How long should you have discharge?  When ti worry?  HOw long before you can resume your sex life etc.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	10/7/2008 8:41:40 AM	When using this medication I had discharge for about a week.  Afterwards I still had discharge but it was different from before. Contacted my doctor b/c I thought it didn't work on my BV and as it turned out it caused a yeast infection and I had to take Diflucan to get rid of it.  I wish my Dr would have warned by that a yeast infection was possible.  
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria		4	5	1			10/6/2008 11:39:59 AM	I agree with some of the other reviews, this medicine was very expensive even with insurance and it gave me a very nasty yeast infection immediately after.

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	9/20/2008 7:02:08 AM	The bacterial infection was gone within a day.  I was dissappointed a few days after administering the medication, because it led to extreme vaginal dryness and symptoms which lead me to believe is a yeast infection.  I am very dissappointed that neither my dr nor the product package had enough information as to the side effects.

If you get an unusual, and voluminous, discharge a few days after using clindesse you might want to read about the symptoms associated with a fungal infection and then treat it with OTC meds (Monistat) if it's warranted. It would be great if the doc or pharmacist warned us about this potential, and yucky, side effect. Just like taking antiobiotics sometimes does, using Clindesse (an antiobiotic) can affect our vaginal flora. Maybe the med is new, and feedback limited. 
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria		5	5	5			8/10/2008 8:28:29 PM	I am one of those women who is constantly discharging (lightly) for no particular reason- no STD, no yeast spotted nor bacteria.  This time around, I knew it was something major, and come to find out it was BV.  I used Clindesse in the evening right before going to bed, and the following day I was without discharge, itch, and odor.  I've had BV before and had to use some 7 day cream that really ruined my active life for over a week, so I'm very happy with Clindesse and it's effectiveness in only one day.  Highly recommended!
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria		5	5	4			7/24/2008 3:51:00 PM	Thank heaven! Ive never had BV before so I had no idea what was going on when I had the symptoms.  Having BV is so embarrassing and you just feel dirty and ugly! Use Clindesse at night so you arent walking around and have leakage.  Worked overnight.  Only had slight stomach cramps and diahrrea about 3 hours after administered.    
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/16/2008 12:37:38 AM	Like others have mentioned, there is little advice on when to resume sexual activity. Great results quickly! My only complaint was the discharge approx 3-5 days later in a seemingly heavy volume and it seems to continue to &quot;leak&quot; for several more days in a very light volume.  Directions seem to just leave you hanging on follow up care!

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Eileen, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	7/8/2008 5:41:15 PM	I used this cream four nights ago as recommended. I know have a white discharge that looks unlike yeast &amp; not at all associated to the discharge of BV. Although the smell is gone, what is this new plentiful discharge? I am a bit disappointed that there is very little literature on the web about what happens physiologically to the vagina for those five days post treatment that we are not to have sex. Are we to expect a bit of a discharge? Does this antibiotic throw off the pH of the vagina to the point where you would suggest an OTC yeast infection cream? Are yeast infections common post treatment with this medication?Definitely not enough post treatment advice on what to expect!
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	7/4/2008 12:05:48 AM	It would be nice to know how long you should wait to begin sexual activity. Husbands really want to know.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	 on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	4	4			6/17/2008 3:49:59 PM	Symptoms were gone overnight! Waiting to have sex again is the only dissapointing thing ;). Only downpoint I've had is a lot of leakage soon after treatment... guess everyone reacts a bit differently-- but even with the leakage, my symptoms are gone and I am so much happier! (and so is my husband)
