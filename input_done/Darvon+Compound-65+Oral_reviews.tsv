Pain	effiemyers, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/14/2010 11:22:00 PM	I took this medication for years for severe headaches until it was removed from the market.  I wish there was some way to have returned.  It was the only medicine the Dr's found that worked almost immediately for my headaches.  Now we go on trial and error and ending in the hospital for 4-7 days to get the pain under control w/ IV meds.  I am allergic to hydrocodone which means no vicodan, etc and codein has no effect on me.

Pain	shelcou, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	11/27/2009 2:34:17 PM	 I have a long term nerve,muscular disease, constant pain. Been treated with about everything except Fentanyl(sp?). Since i have to have something on a daily basis this was the only thing that didn't knock me out and I could function normally. it's not as strong as others but it has no tylenol in it, which i cant have due to liver problems. nor can i have ibuprofen because of ulcers. Soo I'm limited by these boundries,and Darvon(not Darvocet, it has 650mg tylenol)cuts the pain enough so i can at least have a better quality of life.

Pain	Andy, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	65-74	2/6/2009 7:33:37 AM	Iam totally allergic to nsaids- mouth ulcers, boils in mu nose, on my tongue and inside   my cheek.  While Darvon does not completely eliminate pain I do not get any side effects.  Since I teach hundreds of university students the muffling of the pain makes me more tolerent of the pain during performance.  AlsoI must drive 100 miles per day and had a double spinal fusion (gone bad) 30 years ago. It is the best I can do.  I don't find it very addicting and only use it when it affects my work or driving.  Marvin Anderson

Pain	D, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male	35-44	6/5/2008 1:07:27 PM	I took one and it knocked me out about 1/2 hour afterwards. I'm very groggy and feel like I'm on valium. I hear certain frequency of noises like I am in a vaccum of some sorts. I'm sure this would be good when it comes to sleep disorders, but pain, I wouldn't recommend it. I just took a nap and woke up for 10 minutes and am ready to go back and lay down for another nap.

Other	RJD, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		9/25/2007 8:19:45 PM	 For me, Darvon is  very effective in aleviating  chronic fatigue syndrome. It literally provides energy. Two 65 mg. pills are good for  hours. There is no &quot;druggy&quot; affect, just a feeling of normal physical and mental energy. Two doctors I know are puzzled by this reaction. I don't like taking Darvon, but other meds don't work. One doctor prescribed amphetine pills which didn't help. The 2nd recommended Ultram which made me drowsy. Constipation is a real problem.I would greatly appreciate any comments, and, in particular info on the igredients of Darvon which may help fatigue that could be taken in some other form.
