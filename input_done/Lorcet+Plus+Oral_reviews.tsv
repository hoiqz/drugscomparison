Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/23/2012 1:32:26 PM	Used for wisdom tooth surgery. Some blurred hearing and vision from taking this drug but it eased the pain. Sometimes it took longer for the pill to kick in on an empty stomach, not sure why but it happened occasionally. Normally took with some ice cream, yogurt, or soft noodles and it digested without issue. I would say it took my jaw/mouth pain from a 10 down to a 3/4 - a manageable level.

Pain	fiannakyn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	7/6/2009 5:10:35 PM	I have a infected wisdom tooth.  I was taking some Tramadol and Darvcet that I had left over from back pain, and they didnt work all that well.  Tdoay I made it into the dentist and she gave me Lorcet to take for the next few days while the antibiotic work long enough for the tooth to come out.  I was not planning on going back to work today  because the pain was so bad, but less than 1/2 hour after taking the first dose, I was doing well enough to go back for the rest of the day.
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	3/4/2009 4:08:32 PM	I had 2 wisdom teeth and one molar all on the same side cut out, and this gave me no releif, no sleep and I had to call the dentist to get something stronger (demerol). This works much better and faster.

Pain	Jewels, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/27/2008 11:29:46 PM	I have 4 broken ribs and collar bone and shoulder blade, and this medicine has allowe d me to sleep , at first only a few minutes to 1 hour at a time, and now after 3 days,  3 or 4 hours at a time. the pain was so bad, that i would shake, and very glad to have the meds. Going to be careful, over the next few weeks, in taking them, and working, and be careful, when I get off of them, read all the information, and see that they can be addictive, and don't want that. Some constipation, and getting something for that, other tahn that, no other bad side effects. glad to have something, while I heal at home, and to manage me while returning back to work. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	2/10/2008 11:02:28 PM	I was first prescribed this drug in 2002 for migraine headaches and told that I could use it daily.  Now I need more and more to control daily tension headaches.  I'm sure I'm in a rebound cycle, but I have so much to do each day - I just take it and keep going.  I may be addicted, however, I think I am just really dependent.  I think that overall, lorcet has lowered my threshold for pain in general.
