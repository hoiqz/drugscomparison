Head Pain	BookyBiz, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/1/2012 12:27:24 PM	I tried BC Powder in the 80's when nothing else would touch my pain. In minutes my headache was gone. After back surgery for a ruptured disk and the years of pain afterwards I turned to BC Powder. It works. I don't know why it's better than aspirin or Tylenol, but it's a miracle drug. NOTHING gets rid of my pain (even mild migraines) better than BC Powder. After awhile you get used to the bitter powder delivery system, or you can mix it in water and drink it, but those fleeting seconds are SO worth the pain relief it gives. I keep a box in the car and at home and in my purse. It's just amazing stuff. And NO, I have no affiliation with the company. I'm a retired journalist and I tell you, BC Powders kept me going more times than I can count. LOVE this stuff!
Head Pain	Carey, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/25/2012 5:53:20 PM	I just had to get used to putting it all in one spot on my tongue &amp; swallowing it without touching the lid of my mouth.  This is the only over-the-counter med that works for my migraines, if I treat it at the right moment.

It always stops the pain in most cases in 15 minutes. But I see from reading about them that they aren't good for me or anyone else.
Pain		5	3	5			7/8/2008 7:23:42 PM	BC is the most amazing pain/headache reliever i have ever tried. it works in 10 minutes or less. i would recommend keeping some in your purse/wallet or car or office at all times.
