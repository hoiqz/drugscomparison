Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Anonymous, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	19-24	7/8/2012 7:56:54 PM	I have been battling a resistant yeast infection for the past 2 months.  I have been given fluconazole pills every few days, but since that wasn't working, I was given something stronger. My doctor wanted me to try terconazole 7 day treatment. It is strong, a lot stronger than fluconazole and the side effects are like nothing I've ever experienced  before.  Extreme abdomen bloating and pain, body aches, chills, and headaches. I never knew a medicine could have these side effects. This medicine was awful to use, but I think it worked pretty well. Tonight is the last night, and I hope I do not have to take this again.  It has been a rough 7 days.

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	2/25/2012 3:37:45 PM	I experienced intense body pain, fever, chills, and a slight headache after one day on this medicine. I quit using it after symptoms persisted on the second day and I realized that the conditions were a consequence of the medication. 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Andy (Patient) 	1	5	1			1/13/2012 9:31:42 AM	1st time using this drug. Did not help to reduce the itch. And gave me flu like symptoms. My entire body ached. Also caused hives, swelling of the lips, acid reflux and stomach bloating. Stopped taking it after the second treatment.

However with that said it helped my yeast infection slightly the first night and second but by third night yeast infection was back to normal, never actually got rid of it only covered the symptoms temporarily.

This time though, I developed major body pain after the second night.  It didn't occur to me that it was an adverse reaction until I read the paper that comes with the medication.  I was releived to atleast know what was causing my pain...and after the last night of treatment and alternating tylenol and advil...thankfully I am back to feeling better....yeast infection going away by the hour.  Will definitly be hesitant to use it again tough because of the body pain...I felt like I was steamrolled.  Yet it worked on the severe yeast infection I had.

No awful side effects, and it got rid of the yeast infection. Very pleased. I only used the 3 day treatment.

It caused itching and burning that was FAR worse than the yeast infection. I will NEVER use this product again. Apple cider vinegar diluted with water seemed to soothe the burning.

Within minutes of inserting this cream, I experienced horrendous burning and pain, WAY worse than the symptoms of the yeast infection itself.  It lasted for five hours, and kept me up all night. Not satisfied.

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	irritated, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	5/12/2009 1:35:34 AM	I am due to deliver my baby next week.  I developed the third yeast infection of my life (I'm 29) last week - had to wait three days to see my OBGYN and was prescribed this topical cream.  I was anxious to be rid of the itching sensation, applied it according to the directions and spent the last hour in pure agony from burning and itching beyond ANY infection imaginable.  My whole body itches.   I am miserable and can't sleep.  I want to scream at my OBGYN right now, I washed as much as I could off and it's still burning!  This is terrible.  Why would a medication prescribed for vaginal itching and irritation have a side effect of BURNING AND ITCHING???  This is one scrip I will never get filled again!

I had to stop taking it and go back to the doctor.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	1/5/2009 11:54:51 PM	I was prescribed this medication to treat my recurring yeast infection. I'd developed my infection after using antibiotics to cure an earlier upper respiratory infection.I immediately had an adverse reaction upon application. Burning of at the site, as bad as the infection itself. After about 20 minutes, my skin began itching all over. This product is also very messy because it leaks.  If you can use it, you will need padding of some type to catch the leak. 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	12/17/2008 12:34:50 AM	My yeast infection went away while using this drug but my only symptom was a discharge.  I didn't have any itching or burning prior to use.  This drug is messy and you have to wear a sanitary napkin while using it due to it running and being messy.  While using it I experienced massive cramping which is a side effect.  I tried OTC to relieve the cramping to no avail.  Between the messy usage, cost(insurance only covered a small portion) and cramping I will try another drug next time.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	ceekay7, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	11/25/2008 3:56:40 AM	I was prescribed this when Monistat failed to cure my vaginal yeast infection. It's easy to use - the same as any other ovule-type anti-yeast medication. Unfortunately, I developed side effects requiring me to stop treatment - burning, itching, and inflammation that was worse than the original infections. It is therefore easy to see why it failed to be effective and why I'm not satisfied with it.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Kate, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	5/18/2008 10:45:06 PM	A day and a half after I started this medication in conjunction with oral fluconazole as prescribed, I had a severe, life-threatening reaction, with adverse effects lasting for months, including SEVERE muscle and joint pain to the point I could not stand. I finally recovered. These drugs did nothing for my yeast infection. I stopped the drugs immediately after the reaction occurred. These drugs can destroy muscle, by the way. Be careful. Anti-fungal drugs are risky. When I couldn't use these -- I had a severe yeast infection for months, my first ever, after massive doses of antibiotics in a hospital for another problem -- my doctor said try a vinegar-and-water douche for 3 days. I mixed my own with apple cider vinegar using the ratio given in The Doctors' Book of Home Remedies. Don't put it very far up. I could use it only 2 days, because it caused some irritation, but this immediately turned the tide, along with plain yogurt and buttermilk, topically and internally, separately, the buttermilk being especially helpful. The yeast infection left.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	2/17/2008 12:55:45 PM	I have developed a yeast infection during my pregnancy and was prescribed terconazaole to treat it. I've only been using it for 3 nights now and I am very satisfied with it. Yes it is messy, and YES it drips all day and night and Yes sex is out of the question for 7 nights but so far all the ichtiness, and irritation has completely stopped. I only wish i was precribed this medication sooner.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	2/10/2008 6:48:34 PM	I have been prescribed a 7-day treatment, and after only 3 days, I am tired of it.  It is very messy - it drips all night and day, and the applicator needs to be washed and dried after each use.  I do have relief from my symptoms, though I am not sure if the infection will clear up entirely because I am not finished with the treatment.  Intercourse is out of the question for seven days, which adds to the frustration of this treatment.  And finally, I found out that my insurance doesn't cover this prescription/drug because drugs very similar  to this one can be bought over the counter.  I recommend buying a one-day treatment for $15 instead of this 7-day prescription for $42.99 at my local pharmacy.
