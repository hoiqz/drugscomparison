Anemia from Inadequate Iron	lsw515, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	7/7/2012 1:52:44 PM	I have had 2 iv Infed treatments so far. I am doing weekly treatments of 200ml each. I had gastric bipass surgery in 2009 and now cannot tolerate or absorb oral iron. I have had extreme exhaustion, headaches and feelings of shakiness. Before each treatment I am given benedryl and steroids. I do get the flushing feeling and restless leg feeling achiness all over.

Between low Iron, Ferritin and B-12, it is ridiculous. Infed is not something I find so easy to take. I have infusions about 3 to 4 times a year. I get severe back pain, nausea, headache, very low blood pressure and am sick for about a week with these symptoms. Once it kicks in however, I am at least able to function on a daily basis. However, I would not suggest to anyone who is able to take an oral supplement for this problem. Infed will knock you on your butt!

Have experienced some side effects mentioned in other posts. I have a question for other iron dextran patients. Have you noticed extreme drying of skin especially on face?

I then had a hysterectomy wher I lost more blood.  My iron level was 13.  I took the IV iron treatment yesterday and I felt like they gave me lead.  I've never been so tired in my life.  I'm looking forwards to some benefits over the next few days.  This is heavy duty stuff.

I would reccommend pushing as much fluid as possible during treatment.  The first time I had severe muscle pain &amp; cramping in my back for about 8 days, but the pharmacist reccommended slowing the infusion rate and drinking as much fluid as possible (park yourself near a bathroom...) and it worked!  The results are definitely worth the treatment.  I still feel a little derained after infusions, but when the iron levels peak a week later, I remember why I go through this every year. It is definitely worth it.

My treatment was prefaced with bags of steroids, benedryl, and one for nausea like prilosec or something. Then I did a test bag, waited an hour (no reaction) and then got what amounts to a GRAM of iron dosage. All went well and I lived through it!

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	TEA, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	35-44	10/1/2009 2:13:16 PM	The test dose and first treatment were problem free. The second dose caused back pain. I had a very severe allergic reaction on my third treatment. It occured about 30 minutes after the injection. I broke out in welts and uncontrollable itching. I had to be given steriods and Benedryl to reverse the reaction.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	65-74	2/1/2008 7:47:25 PM	I have received Infed via IV periodically, 2-3 times per year, for almost 5 years.  Low iron due to removal of portion of small intestine in surgery in 2002.  No adverse reactions known, however I do suffer from arthritis or hip and shoulder joint pain about constantly.  This condition has been worse in the last few months.  Could this be related?
