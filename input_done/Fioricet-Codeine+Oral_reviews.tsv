This is safe &amp; no bad side effects for 30 years! Yet he has been told to switch everyone to NSAIDS- Ibuprofen 600-800mg and a DAILY prescription for a &quot;preventative&quot; type drug that all have bad side effects or worse side effects than the benefits! I looked up every drug &amp; they all have mostly negative patient reviews- very few positives. Yet THIS drug that has ALL positive reviews by patients &amp; ZERO negative reviews is being phased out due to new prescribing protocols! Shows they don't LISTEN to what's really working for the patients!-Not looking foward to being bedridden a few weeks a month!
Tension Headache	Smiley, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/26/2012 12:12:13 PM	I have horrible sinus/tension headaches and this medication works fast and usually relieves most my pain. I've had surgery for sinus problems, tried many prescribed medications and natural(herbal) ways to find relief. When you can't open your eyes because the light is so unbearable.  Your stomach turning circles and the thought of moving just is not an option.  I found it easier to breath and my headaches ,(most days),are under control thanks to Fiorenol w/ codeine.

Tension Headache	Marley, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	5/24/2011 3:52:50 PM	It only works for me for 2 hours as well and then doesn't completely get rid of the headache, it just dulls it.  I can only take every 4 hours so by the time I can take another dose the headache has gotten bad enough again that it doesn't do much.  It just dulls it for another 2 hours.
Tension Headache	miagrrl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/13/2011 7:40:02 PM	I have had a three day long migraine/extreme tension headache. My doctor prescribed this, and within an hour I had tremendous relief. After a few more doses/24 hours later, headache completely gone with no rebound headache effects. I did not feel impaired in any way, even though it had codeine in it. I felt great, and was able to return to my normal activities. I highly recommend people with intense headaches try this medication!
Other	muffy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	2/12/2011 5:02:03 AM	I have been on this treatment  for 30 years, Originally because of a car accident! Broken head and bad neck and back. Was in a Coma. As I have gotten older my neck, head and back have gotten worse! I also must take neupigen shots because I have idiopathic neutropinia The medication helps with bone pain! It is the only medication than makes my neck,head   and nerves that were damaged bearable.  I only wish after all these years Ins.would allow more than 6 a day,or brand would go down in price so I could afford it.It seems know one seems to know of anything that will work as well, or if there is a higher strength so I could take less. I hope my experiences will help someone get help and be able to live life again!

Tension Headache	Lesley, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	3	Female	35-44	12/6/2010 3:37:06 AM	Fioricet is a good medication for my tension headaches, but only if I can catch it before it springs into action. If I wait too long it does me no good because I can only take two(2) in a 24 hour period.

Tension Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/17/2010 6:25:39 PM	I was involved in a very bad auto accident about 8 months ago this is when my headaches began on a regular basis, my Dr ordered Fioricet at this time and it has been the only medication that has truly given me a good amount of relief! I only take this when I have a migraine that is sever due to the fact this medication can be addicting but when taken as the Dr has ordered it this is a effective medication. Good luck to all of you who suffer from headaches/migraines and I hope this helps you I know it helped me!   
Tension Headache	roserunner1221, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/29/2010 2:45:42 PM	I have been having migraines and headaches for a very long time. Throughout the past 6 years they have progressed into a constint everyday headaches which eventually turn into migraines or just really horrible headaches. There is only one other medicine that works for me...more of the holistic aproach. I quit that. Doctor just prescribed me this medicine in the past week. I have not felt this great in a while. I am very worried about becoming dependant on it though. I use it at least 4 times a week, only one though. It feels good to be myself again with no pain. 
Tension Headache	rayemo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/21/2010 2:09:34 AM	This drug combo is amazing.  Due to several auto accidents and chroic mixed migraines /tension headaches that I suffered with for years, I can finally get the relief I need to continue to function. Most Doctors refuse to consider prescribing it and I've had a difficult time getting drug coverage. Not many insurance companies or doctors have a clue what life-altering relief is felt by all of us terminal sufferers of this type of headache. The caps are easy to swallow and I have noticed slight constipation if I have to take a max dose for more than two days in a row without a stool softner. Hope they never stop making Fiorinal available. I can't imagine going back to living in a  darkened room again with a trash can next to the bed in case the nausea got too severe.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	3/17/2010 6:54:52 AM	Ive had severe migraines since I was 13 (now 43) and as usual, have tried everything.  I have to switch between this medication and Stadol Nasal Spray.  Fioricet works wonders unless the migraine is causing me to vomit.  I would like to see this medication in another form if possible so that it stays in your system when vomiting is an issue.  I also have anxiety issues and this medication helps with that also.
Tension Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/12/2010 10:06:25 PM	I have been on Fioricet w/ codiene for 3 years now. I have very frequent tension headaches and Migraines.Im 23 and have had horrible headaches since i was 13 around that time of the month as did all the females on my mothers side. I have tried lortabs, demoral, topomax, imitrex, treximet, and hundreds more and NOT ONE of them has helped my headaches, only the Fioricets. My mother takes this same medication and she agrees that they kill the pain of headaches and makes you able to carry out the rest of your day and not have to fight a migraine for 2 or 3 days. The only downfall of this medication is how easily you may become dependant on them. If your body is used to taking them and you slow down taking them, you can get an adverse reaction and cause yourself to have a headache or migraine. So if you decide to use this medicine, make sure you only take it when needed. I havent been to the hospital with a migraine in almost 2 years...THANK GOD!!!

This is a life saver for me. I don't use it very often (3 or 4 times a month) but it helps sooo much when I need it!

My headaches come on fast and cannot be touched by any other medicine. The only complaint that I have is that I )gain weight very quickly if I take it for more than two days in a row. Not sure why, but only when I take this medication do I have this issue.

Every since I got hurt I'v been gitting vary bad tension headaches.  I'v tryed quite a few diffrent pain killers most all of the have been vary strong, such as Dilaudid, Methadone, and Oxycodopne.  I'v found that the Fioricet w/Codeine works better for me then any fo the stronger medications I was on before, and also It's far less addictive and far safer

Use with care because it can be a dependent drug but if you have any type of severe headaches but with physician direction it is worth the relief.

But it does scare me having to take it knowing that I am dependant on it.

I was first given regular fioricet which did not help at all.  Fiorcet w/ codeine completly takes away all the pain when i get a migraine.  But makes me sleep like a baby which everyone needs.
Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/29/2008 3:23:35 PM	I started taking Fioricet/Codeine when I was in my mid 20's for severe headaches/head pain (migraines?).  After suffering for years, the drug was a God-send for me and my family! Unfortunately, after 8 years of gradually increasing usage and my doctor prescribing the medication like candy, I became addicted to it - an experience I would not wish upon anyone!  Afterwards I tried a succession of different medications and treatment approaches.  After 3 or 4 years with no luck, I went back on the Fioricet/Codeine.  I am now in my mid-40's and continue to take the Fioricet/Codeine.  I continue to explore other treatment options, but that is often very discouraging and tiring.  For me, Fioricet/Codeine is the only medication that has worked well to treat the headaches.  Just be very careful to monitor and keep usage in check.  (Note:  Most doctors and pharmacists will tell you that Fioricet and Fiorinal are basically the same - one has tylenol, the other asprin.  For me, Fiorinal is ineffective compared with Fioricet!)
