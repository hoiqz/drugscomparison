I had a severe reaction to it in the form of Vertigo and vomiting and inability to walk.  I had used more than the prescribed amount for persistent itching eyes.  My reaction was very frightening and resulted in $1,777 ambulance ride to ER.  No bill yet for med. treatment.  I have since read online the severeside effects this drug and cause.

It cost me $50 with my insurance - was so not worth it. Feel like I wasted my money.

After 48 hours, the crusty flakes occurred throughout the day.  72 hours after using the eye drops, I had a sudden severe sore throat that eventually subsided.  After 4 days of using the drug, I had a sudden coughing attack that was similiar to an asthma attack.  I read the side effects and immediately stopped taking the drug.  I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone.  It should be removed from the market.

It is NOT for instant relief. It is an antihistamine, it takes several doses before it is effective and one must stay on it. ONE drop in each eye daily.'-aday' get it? I occasionally get allergies bad enough to swell my eyes shut. As long as I start it before the allergy season and maintain I am golden. If you just have mild itchy eyes I don't believe this product is worth it. I've had my eyes itch so much from allergies that I have woke up with bruising from rubbing them in my sleep, so the cost is well worth it to me. If it works but seems to cause some irritation try Patanol. It's less concentrated so you have to take it TWICE a day but your eyes don't get the full blast at once.

Not sure if I used 2 drops on 2 of the days (had also used a sample bottle).  The bottle is white, so you don't know if you're getting the right amount.  Rx is 2.5 ml. and sample is .5 ml, so again, how do you know how much you got?  It cost $143.99; what a racket!  Have contacted the FDA about this issue.  $143.99 and they can't afford a bottle that lets you see what you're getting???????

In fact, once I switched to nasal steroid spray, my eye symptoms got better as well and only use the eye steroid drops during the worst parts of the season (risk of glaucoma).Hope this helps.

First of all, I have used this whenever Allergy season begins and it works like a gem.  A few days in it goes away and I am fine.  As far as expense, it shouldn't cost a dime.  You should ask your eye doctor for a sample tiny bottle.  I have never paid for one and they last a long time.  One bottle, very small, contains a lot of liquid which last me at least six months, entire allergy season at no cost.  Don't get ripped off by any Doctors or your Insurance Medical Hospital.  Go to an optometrist.

I also have periodic iritis episodes normally treated with steroid drops. While pataday was not prescribed for the iritis, I have found that often if I use pataday immediately upon sensing possible iritis symptoms, that problem doesn't develop.  Perhaps this is coincidence but have wondered for years if there was not an allergic component to iritis.  Pataday works immediately for the itchy eyes. I have experienced no negative side effects.  My satisfaction, however, is effected by the extremely high price of this medication.  Unlike some other reviewers,I do only have to pay a copay, $25, but according to the pharmacy the size bottle this is sold in is supposed to be a 7 day supply.  Fortunately I do not use this daily and can go for months without needing it, depending on allergens in the air.

Then I noticed how tired I was becoming, I just can't get enough sleep. The worst part is the depression. It started about a week after beginning the drops and I've spent days in tears and I can't even blame PMS. And on top of it, the price was enough to put me into cardiac arrest $170!! I won't be refilling this prescription!

LUCKILY FOR ALL OF US, we do not have to use this at all. Loratadine or Zyrtec is enough.  If your insurance does not pay for Zyrtec, ask your doc  for the generic drug for Zyrtec -- CETIRIZINE HCL, 10 mg tablets, paid for by most insurers. It is also available over the counter at Rite-Aid for $23.00 (30 tabs).Many people would never think of taking pills for horribly itchy eyes or eczema, BUT these pills are the SECRET SOLUTION TO OUR ALLERGY PROBLEMS -- Claritin has also eye drops for itchy eyes, aside from their Loratadine. My ophthalmologist did not tell me right away about this -- I suffered 3 weeks before I found out from friends/health pros this is what is going on now.
