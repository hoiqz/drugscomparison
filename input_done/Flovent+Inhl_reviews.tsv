Asthma	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	9/28/2011 6:54:31 AM	My chest and throat were burning so bad from flovent. It also made my breathing worse.  I told my dr he insisted that I keep taking it.   I took it for over a month then discontinued it on my own.   Don't always listen to DRs listen to your body.   Once I stopped taking this medication the burning went away and my breathing got better

Asthma	0-2 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	3	1	Male	0-2	6/16/2011 4:14:44 PM	My 2 yr old son started on this medication and within a few weeks he was hoarse and coughing more. He was seen by another specialist who said that the medication was causing polyps on his throat and vocal cords. He either needed to quit taking the medication or have surgery. After I had him off the Flovent for 1 month his voice returned normal and the polyps were almost completed gone.

Asthma	Jasmine north Carolina , 3-6 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	3-6	4/16/2011 8:37:22 AM	My 3 yr old was on flovent inhaler for a week.  She became very thirsty by the 3rd day and started wetting her pants every day after being fully potty trained for months.  She also developed a severe cough that required daily albuterol.  Overall this medicine was not for us.  We switched back to pulmicort nebs which work much better without these side effects.

Have COPD and emphysema. Have not noticed any improvement. Has anyone taken this drug for something other than asthma?
Asthma	mamamay, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	12/10/2010 2:52:54 PM	My son has been on this for the past few weeks.  He is clingy, cries over the slightest thing, is getting in trouble at school now, etc.  I was curious about whether the medication had something to do with it since the timing fits.  I looked on this website and see that he is not the only one.  I will be seeing if there is a non-steroid he can take to manage his asthma.  Thanks for all who posted, at least now we can make a better plan for the little guy!!
Asthma	Hypo, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	35-44	10/27/2010 6:21:43 PM	I have Asthma MY ENTIRE LIFE! Been on Flovent for many years. I have noticed that the drug has increased my metabolism over time on the drug. I now have to EAT every 2.5 hours otherwise I have low blood sugar readings on the glucose monitor (below 60). IF YOUR KIDS ARE ANGRY ON THE MED just feed them every 3 hours. You will notice a big change. This drug is good for Asthma symptoms but bad for the body. The doctors never want to discuss the long term effect of this drug on the body BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO IDEA what it does! Get a blood glucose monitor and check your kids blood sugar reading at onset of their angry spell,etc. I would guess there blood glucose is dropping to levels which display symptoms of hypoglycemia. Just trying to help all the little ones who cannot express themselves except get angry.Peace
Asthma	Laural, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	10/1/2010 8:57:29 PM	This is for my daughter, and I don't understand some of the side effects she had. She is 4 and got depressed, and wouldn't play with other kids, stopped eating, and of course lost weight. I would make her favorite foods and she would take a few bites and quit. since she has been off this she is back to her normal self. Playing with other kids and most important of all eating again. if there is an alternative to flovent I would love to know what that is. I don't know my own child when she is on this medicine.
Asthma Prevention	0-2 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	4	3	Male	0-2	4/12/2010 4:45:25 PM	My 21 month old son seems to be doing better on it,but I have seen a change in his disposition and sleeping habits.  He has gone from being an easy going, happy little boy to being irritable at times.  He use to be a great sleeper at night; however, we are going on three weeks of him waking up and being unable to fall back asleep for hours.

Other	Guitarmiller, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	13-18	2/1/2010 3:35:11 PM	Hi, I take Flovent, however, I do not take it for Asthma as one would normally. My doctor put me on this as an experimental drug for my Chronic Eosinophilic Esophogitis, fancy word for my throat cells are allergic. In addition, instead of inhaling, I swallow the puffs. As it turns out, I am the test subject for the study of this problem, and it has worked tremondously, such that I am much better and being taken off, after almost a year of being on it. I started to be weaned off of it 2 days ago, and since after lowering my dosage, I have had trouble sleeping, drowsiness, thoughts of suocide, and bags appeared under my eyes. I think the drug might have a certain dependancy towards those who take it like I do, but I'm not sure.

Asthma Prevention	Mommy17, 35-44 Female  (Caregiver) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	10/21/2009 11:14:39 AM	My 16 month old son has been diagnosed with cold induced asthma.   He is breathing well but he has had a persistent cold for 6 weeks and counting.   I hate this drug!  My son is a very sweet, mild mannered boy who has always slept well.   Since he started taking Flovent, he has had these horrific night terrors on a nightly basis and is more irritable than usual.  My Dr. expressed this is not a side effect so I continued the drug.   It has been so bad that I finally googled 'flovent and night terrors' and read a lot of similiar experiences.   We are not sure what the Dr will recommend for his asthma but my poor baby has not slept in two months because of this medication!

Asthma Prevention	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	2/28/2009 11:13:31 PM	I took this drug about 8 years ago. I have never had a problem with any of the asthma medications, except for this one. I have had asthma for over 30 years. This drug literally made me crazy. I had such terrible anxiety that I could not sleep. My heart would just race all the time. I went on like this for months. Then I stopped taking the medication. I was better within a few days. I will never take this medication again or allow my children to take it.
Asthma	Flovent User, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/8/2009 2:30:03 PM	I love this product.  When I use it in the winter I never have to use Albuterol.  If I stop using this product (due to financial reasons) I get real bad and have to start again.  This has made such a difference in my life.  Thank you for Flovent!!!!
Other	JamieHdrs, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/26/2008 8:11:08 AM	I have had a chronic cough for six months. I have no allergies and no reason to suspect asthma. After many tests and many medications (including albuterol inhaler) I was put on flovent. Within a day my coughing started reducing until by two weeks I am cough free. This medicine has changed my life, it gave it back to me. If you have a cough of unknown origin it is definitely worth a try.
Asthma	mityme, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	12/10/2008 10:11:55 AM	Has helped my breathing alot but even with rinsing my head is always stuffy, my nose always runs, &amp; I am very horse all the time
Asthma Prevention	Broken Mom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	11/10/2008 9:06:43 AM	My 16 year old daughter was changed to Flovent in January of this year... and in February she had a fatal asthma attack.  Her emergency albuterol inhaler did nothing to save her life.  She was lying on the couch relaxing when it happened... not even doing anything strenuous.  It did NOT work to prevent her astham attack.  I hate Flovent.
Asthma Prevention	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	11/3/2008 8:11:37 PM	I have only been using Flovent for a little over 2 weeks.  I am able to exercise now, but I still need my Albuterol as well before exercising.  I am noticing that my appetite is increasing alot.  My throat is a little sore, not sure if it will get worse the more I use the Flovent.

Asthma Prevention	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	19-24	3/3/2008 8:42:48 PM	flovent seems to help in relieving the cronic cough connected to my asthma. But as mentioned by others it does increase appitite a lot. It can also cause a soar throat but I really have not had that experience. I fell as though it is effective and can help in relieving bothersom symptoms. I still have trouble with exercise and it can be difficult to breath after running or strenous physical activity.
