Had to stop treatment due to the cost of the medication.

My hands were in the worst condition. Unable to move or even open hands up was very painful. After starting this med my condition cleared within a month, am able to use my hands again.

The effectiveness of this med has certainly made a huge difference in my quality of life. I was told it may take some time to notice any changes but I felt remarkably better within 4 hours of first injection. I have been very pleased with my results. Side effects have been minimal for me. Limited mainly to injection site reactions.
