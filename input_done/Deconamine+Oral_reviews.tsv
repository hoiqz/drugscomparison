Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	6/14/2010 11:55:07 AM	I took deconamine or the generic for nearly 16 years. I have severe allergies and was miserable year round. Finally, at age 16, the doctor put me on this. It was great. For the first time in my life I could breath, sleep and function normally.About a year ago, it was discontinued (at least in my area) and the doctor, put me on alegra. It is not nearly as good as the deconamine was.

Stuffy Nose	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	35-44	9/16/2009 1:27:35 PM	My congestion drug of choice.  I have used for several years and only need to take once in the morning for any day I need the relief from nasal congestion.  I tried taking at night and didnt sleep well, so I would warn against PM dosing.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	puff the magic dragon, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	5/4/2009 1:28:56 PM	I was on the medication for a sinus infection and respitory infection.  I had a severe allergic reation to the medicine.  My symptoms got worst.  My face swelled up and was puffy and sore.  I stopped the medicine.  I called my doctor and she told me to take benedryl.  I looked up the medicine online and found out that the medicine has crystal meth in it.  And that they were taking it off the market.  Would not advise Deconamine
Cold Symptoms	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	5	Male	25-34	11/10/2008 7:19:33 AM	Ive given this medication to soldiers for the past couple of years and have always found it very effective in combating cold symptoms as well as congestion. I tend to also give it in conjunction with wither Tylenol or Motrin for headaches and fever that accompany sinusitus. I have never had a complaint

The only drawback is that it gave me dizzying dreams(?), otherwise, amazing!
Seasonal Runny Nose		5	5	5			3/13/2008 6:04:06 AM	I suffer from seasonal allergies (itching and watering eyes and nose, heachache and congestion) and have taken this drug for many years.  I've tried others when this was unavailable but nothing else seemed to work as quickly or effectively.  I found it also helps ward off a cold.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	3/10/2008 3:50:02 PM	This did not work for me and I experienced side effects.  I was restless and hardly got any sleep when I took it in the evening and the next day I became dizzy and fainted.  I have since added this to my DO NOT PRESCRIBE list with my Doctor.  It is definitely not for everyone.
