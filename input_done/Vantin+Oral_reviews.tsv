Pneumonia caused by Bacteria	GAB, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male		4/12/2011 4:59:01 PM	I developed a bright red rash on my feet and ankles (after completing the prescribed dose of tablets) which over a four-day period spread up to my thighs and abodomen and back. Then my skin peeled as though from a bad sunburn, even to the palms of my hands A dermatologist prescribed a keratin salve. It took over a month and numerous visits to the dermatologist before all the skin peeled and my body gradually returned to normal. A terrible experience for a man over 90. Keep cephalosporins away from me!
