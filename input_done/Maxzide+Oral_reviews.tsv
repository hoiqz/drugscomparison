It was prescribed for high blood pressure but it has been wonderful drug in controlling my ankles and feet swelling. BUT the drug store has been trying to get it back in stock, it is on back order for the last 4 weeks. Something to do with the manufacturer. W/O having access to Maxzide my legs swell terribly from the knees down. Dr. put me on Bumex and it is awful!!! I've never been so dizzy in my life. Sure hope the drug store and get the Maxzide back in. PS: I had NO side effects using the Maxzide.

I was really sick for a week. I finally figured out that I had to either start eating breakfast or take after I ate lunch. I was not overweight before, but I lost 15 lbs from fluids &amp; changing my diet (very low sodium). I have been taking for 3 years and I usually stay within 5-8 pounds of my weight. No side effects at all since I eat before taking now.

I do ocassionally get headaches, especially if taken on empty stomach and I agree you do have to urinate often. I also stopped for about 2 weeks and also gained about 3 pounds and swelled right back up immediately. Lost the the 3 lbs though right after I starting taking again. I also discovered while on vacation that I had nausea,headache and extreme sweating while in the sun for very long, cano be sure it was from the Maxzide though as I also take Thyroid medicine.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	45-54	10/29/2010 12:43:04 AM	this drug has been effective in helping lower my blood pressure but have several years I have developed gout. There is no history of gout in my family and this is the only thing I have been able to trace it back to.  The doctor didn't have a clue about this drug causing secondary gout or even causing someone with gout to have worse attacks....after reading about this drug i'd reccomend be very closely monitered with blood test to watch for potential damage to your body.
High Blood Pressure	none, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	9/15/2010 6:51:00 PM	I took this med for many years, initially taking one 25/37.5 tablet daily. About two months ago, my feet started swelling again and my Dr. suggested I try taking two tables daily, which I did without any noticeable side effects.I stopped taking Maxzide recently when my insurance ran out. Over the succeeding two weeks or so I gained 30+ pounds, presumably all water because my feet and legs swelled horribly and I did not change my eating habits.I restarted today, buying the med myself, without insurance (and discovering that the med cost less than the copay my previous insurance required that I pay!) I'm urinating a lot, which I expected, but I hope that the swelling in my feet and legs will not be so bad tonight, and will continue to improve over the next few days.

High Blood Pressure	Motown69, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	35-44	7/29/2010 7:38:07 AM	I Back in the first week of June my wife and I visited a weightloss clinic to lose weight and lower my blood pressure. With the combination of weightloss medication and strict diet for the first 10 days, maxzide lowered my pressure from 182/143 to 143/100 in just 15 days. Recently, it lowered even more to 133/98. this drug really works. However, your intake of water must be consistant throughout the useage of this drug even though it is a diuretic.
Visible Water Retention	writerscramp	1	2	1			7/25/2010 3:59:55 PM	After 2 weeks in the hospital with pancreatitis, the doctors attribute it to this drug. No longer taking it, and still recovering from the attack.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3		45-54	5/22/2010 6:07:38 PM	This medicine worked just great for me for the first 9 1/2 years. Six months ago, I began to delevop red bumps on both sides of my face. I am using sun screen, but i think I might have to stop using this, which is a shame. My blood pressue have been absolutely perfect since I started taking it. I know if I miss a dose, like others, I gain 3 pounds immediately, but I don't want bumps on my face (which, up until 6 months ago, was smooth and flawless, never ever had acne, always had GREAT skin), which could lead to something more severe. Time to see my doc.

Visible Water Retention	sbchristian, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/2/2010 1:17:37 PM	I have swelling of my ankle on the left side only, and after going to several doctors, they gave me lasix and it just did not do anything.  I found a doctor that told me my blood pressure was slightly elevated and he felt the swelling was due to salt intake.  However, after I  stopped using the  salt, it did nothing for my edema in my left foot.  I love this medicine, after a few days of taking it, I am back to normal and feel really good.  I did have some cramping one evening, but I took a low dose of potassium and everything has been wonderful since.  I will be going to a specialist to have a complete blood work up done to see if there are any underlying problems, but if I take this, I feel 30 again.  I am 62.  So, I hope to keep taking it as long as I need it.  My blood pressure was not extremely high to begin with but now it is close to what is considered normal.  I have not had any side affects except for some cramping in my feel the first week of taking, but then it went away.  I highly recommend - it has been a God send to me.

At first I was very weak and had numbness in my body. But then I added a mulit-vitamin, calcium and postassium supplements and I've been feeling great since! It's cut down my dizzy spells which is a relief. I do get my potassium levels checked twice a year. I highly recommend taking vitamins, it really makes a difference.

Finally, put on Maxide and BP returned to normal within 3 weeks. Has been controlled with no perceptible side-effects for 8 years. I recommend this drug over any other. Also controls swelling. PS: It is generic, so some Dr's try to get you to take specific other ones, if you know what I mean.
High Blood Pressure	Karen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	1/29/2009 9:55:32 AM	My doctor prescribed this for me even though I had had an allergic reaction previously to sulfa drugs (one of the warnings).  When I pointed this out to him he said reactions to this drug were rare.  Now after almost 2 years I am suddenly getting a red rash with burning and itching on my neck, arms, and legs (a known side effect) so I am not going to take it any more.  My doctor already had prescribed an additional drug (Cozaar) since this alone was not enough to control my blood pressure anyway.  Make sure your doctor knows if you have ever had any allergic reaction to any sulfa drugs before taking this medication.

It has helped with this problem, however I did have more charlie horse type leg and feet cramps. I see this is a side effect, does anyone know what it means? I had rather have the cramps than the water retention, I also woke up with a bloody nose after a couple days on this medicine, should I be worried about any of this?

I feel so much better.  I am no longer tired and without energy.  I have noticed that since I have been taking this medication my appetite has decreased.  Not to the point that I am concern but have noticed a little decreased.  I highly recommend this prescription to anyone who has high blood pressure.  My doctor had me to go through a series of tests to check my heart out.  Once everything was fine with my heart he prescribed this medication.  Hope this helps.

There seems to be no dimishing of the ol' sex drive - the wife's happy to say (I'm 58 and 1/2 Italian). Overall I'd say this is one of the &quot;as advertised&quot; drugs on the market.

After a really ugly night, I stopped taking it this morning (Sat.) &amp; will contact my Dr. Monday morning. The pharmacy information sheet said the cramps were a possible side effect &amp; to contact your Dr., so that's where I am. Also, I did not see an increase in urine output during the 3 days I was on the med. But maybe it wasn't long enough to see results yet. I just know the cramps were HORRIBLE, and actually scared me because they were so intense and ongoing.
