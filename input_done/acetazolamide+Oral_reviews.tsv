Altitude Sickness	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	35-44	9/4/2012 1:40:56 AM	I had gotten altitude sickness 3 times in 3 backpacking trips above 9000 feet.  It's one of the worst feelings I've ever experienced.  I figured I should try this drug to see if it helps me.  I went from sea level to 10,000 feet in one day and didn't get sick!  Obviously, the drug worked for that.However, the side effects are pronounced.  The diuretic is quite strong, I had tingling in my extremities, and I had a hard time staying focused for the 1st day or so.Overall, as much as I didn't like the side effects, I must say the drug was a success since I was able to make my destination on the first day without altitude sickness!

It is working keeping my pressure at a reasonable level but the long-term effects will cause kidney failure.  Please continue with further research to resolve this matter.  
Water On the Brain with Obstruction of Cerebrospinal Fluid	Jo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	3/12/2012 7:45:46 PM	I've been taking this form of Diamox for about six months due to cerebrovascular issues. It helped at first, but seems to be losing it's effectiveness over time. Has anyone else experienced this?
Pseudotumor Cerebri	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	25-34	3/6/2012 2:59:32 PM	I have been taking this medication for just over a month as of now, i took it before for about two months. the First time i took it, i had horrible side effects. Tingling sensation in my hands and feet, all carbonated beverages tasted like metal, the ringing in my ears would drive me insane sometimes, and i couldn't stay off the toilet. I was afraid to go any where because if i felt the &quot;need to go&quot; i would need to go now and couldn't wait. The second time around i have not had any tingling sensations in my hands and feet, i can drink pop (some of it tastes a little different, but its not bad) and i have no ringing in my ears. since about two weeks after taking this medication i have not had any more headaches. I would take this medication over having the headaches anytime because the headache pain was absolutely horrible.

I would say it &quot;calms&quot; the headaches and thats about it! I feel disoriented alot, my hands, feet and face feel numb or tingly alot, I am starting to hear a lisp when I talk sometimes. I am extremely tired all the time, I just want to lay down. I had to quit my job and withdraw from school because I can't drive my eyesight is so come and go....one minute its fine the next its not. My headache is constantly there, I just get &quot;bursts&quot; of pain every once in a while. I go back to my Neurosurgeon in March to see what the next step is.....if I have to have a shunt put in or what...but these side effects from this medicine are AWFUL! I was a soda drinker!! Not so much any more!! I can only drink water, juice and milk! Which will help with my weight but still I'd like to have a soda once in a while. :( Hope to find some answers soon! HATE feeling this way!

At first, it was horrible.  The tingling was intense, and I hated that I couldn't drink pop.  The taste was just too bad.  Also, it took a while to work.  My papilledema got worse as did the headaches after I started the medicine.  Slowly, though, it started working, and now I rarely have headaches and my eyes, while not completely normal, are much better. I have been much better despite not losing any weight.  If you have PTC, try the medicine.  It takes some adjusting to, but it does help a lot.

I have found that taking potassium and magnesium has helped with the numbness and tingling but only a little bit. I hate taking acetazolamide and I can't wait to get off of it.

Now it's not. It's very difficult to remember to take it 3x per day with my crazy school schedule. However, even when taking it 3x per day like I'm supposed to, I still suffer from some amount of headaches now where I did not before while taking the medication. I have dealt with the side effects of fatigue/exhaustion and tingling in hands, feet, and face. The latter being a side effect my neurologist told me to expect, despite it being listed here as serious and requiring immediate medical attention. 
Pseudotumor Cerebri	tiredmommy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	1	3	Female	25-34	12/1/2011 12:27:48 PM	I have been on this med for 1 year now 1000mg a day. My side effects arent to bad execpt the waking up, being sleepy all day and lack of energy. I cant loose weight do to my other meds. But the plus side is I will see my kids grow up. It has been hard to deal with cause no one care about &quot;your&quot; health problems and at work will try and use them against you. I wish everyone luck and I hope I dont have to take this med for to long. 
High Eye Pressure or Glaucoma that May Worsen without Treatment	Queenie99, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	45-54	6/25/2011 9:33:28 PM	Already had glaucoma and was on the usual drops; Timolol, Lumigan, etc. But had a partial cornea replacement 2 yrs ago.  18 mos. later started rejecting the donor cornea and was treated with PredForte.  This in turn increased the pressure.  The glaucoma drops were killing the cornea trying to recover - that's when I went on this drug and stopped the glaucoma drops.  That was Jan. 2011.  First on 4 tabs/day of 250mg.  Very bad tingling in hands, feet, chest, face. Sometimes wake up at night w/stabbing pains in hands/feet.  Got sores on my gums, like blisters.  But pressure was down to 19 - good.  Told doc I couldn't take the gum blisters and he lowered dose to 3/day.  Tingling has almost completely stopped, but my teeth/jaw/gums ache.  Don't care about soda taste, it's awful but I care more about not losing my vision.  Never vomited, but do have queazy stomach and loose bowels at least once every day.  Again, small price to pay for eyesight.  With this med, my pressure is under control, and the toxic drops stopped so that the donor cornea is healing, slowly.  I am grateful for this med, even with the teeth/jaw/gum pain which can be severe enough to take more meds.

I also was tired and somewhat clumsy the first three days but it went away after those three days. I have taken this medication twice already and it worked like a charm because I have yet to get altitude sickness again which nobody wants to experience believe me! Make sure you drink alot of water and there is a bathroom nearby because you will need it. It is a &quot;water pill&quot;. Overall, this medication is great for altitude sickness!

Tingling in extremeties is a big pain.  I've passed out 3x on the medication.  However, medication lowered my CSF level from 37.5 to 20.25 in approx 6 months.

Pseudotumor Cerebri	mid, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	3/12/2011 12:25:09 AM	The side effects suck. There's no getting past that. I bitter and resentful all the time. My hands and feet and face tingle all the time. My eyes are constantly twitching. The dry mouth is unfortunate, too. However, it has helped decrease the pressure in my eyes :) I think all the of the above is a small price to pay for one's eyesight.

I started on 500mg a aday but now manage on 250mg. I still am a total Coca Cola addict just never had the change in taste!

My life for almost 2 years before diagnosis was constant visits to doctors and Emergency Rooms to figure out what was going on.  I found a awsome nerologist who reviewed my chart and notes from 8 doctors put me on diamox 500 mg 2x daily.  After taking this medication for 3 days I no longer had thumping in my ears, my vision was not blurry,my teeth didn't hurt, my stomach wasn't upset, I was no longer dizzy, and most importantly my head no longer felt like it was going to explode.  The side effects...change in taste, having to urinate alot, tingling feet, dry skin and mouth are a walk in the park.
Other	elfpaladin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/3/2010 2:17:28 PM	I first started having dizzy spells and black out about 5 years ago.  I went through the gambit for 4 of those years of being told it was everything from a mellow case of epilepsy to anxiety attacks.  Let's just say that until my current doctor, no body thought to give me a LP.  I won't term this as PsuedoTumor Cerebi, as my doctor did not formally diagnose me with it yet.  That and from what I've read PTC effects your vision, it doesn't make you black out and thrash wildly like you're having a seizure.  But since the LP and taking this medication I can definitely say that my life is better.  I still can't work because I get dizzy spells and horrible headaches around my menstrual, but I can take care of myself the other 25 days out of the month.  If anyone with Pseudotumor Cerebi knows of any case where the patient had seizure like symptoms, I would like to know, so I can pass on the info to my doc.
Pseudotumor Cerebri	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	10/12/2010 7:22:40 PM	I haven't been to the Neurologist in over a month and only went like a week and a half after my first lumbar puncture/start of this medication so I'm not totally sure yet which has made the difference but my vision has been 100% better. I've had no dizzy side effects but do get the numbness and tingling in my fingers, as well as a twitchy eye lid or lip evrey once in a while which isn't that big of a deal. I have noticed that I get sun burned extreamly quickly since starting this med. And I have a little trouble getting the pills down on the first swallow. Other than that I think it's worked pretty well for me, I've been losing weight too which I know is helping.-I was relieved to see that others had gotten a bit of a facial twitch with this and the numbness too because no one had told me those were the side effects...
Pseudotumor Cerebri	Missie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	10/9/2010 7:02:25 PM	after taking 1000mg of this medication for nearly 2 years my doctor has decided to lower my dosage to 500mg I still have the numbness/tingling in my hands and feet occasionally with tingling in the back of my neck but the wooshing in my ears only comes back occasionally the major proble it brings me is that I have to pair it with Celexa for major mood swings from the way the chemical affects my brain, but I am able to function without the symptoms of PTC cause that really sucked so I say deal with the little side effects of the meds. It's better then what made us all have to take it in the first place!!!!!!!!!!!

In the beginning I had terrible side effects and thought there was no way I could continue with treatment. I pushed through side effects, numbing of extremeties, severe nausea, metal taste from drinking carbonated beverages, loss of appetite. Eventually they subsided after 2 months. My dosage was increased to a 1000 mg a day from 500 mg a day and I thought I would experience the same side effects and nothing major happened. I am a soda lover and now I do not taste metal from drinking it. I also went from 145 lbs. to a 130 lbs. which they told me that weight loss was needed to try and improve my condition. It has made a slight improvement in my condition, headaches are not as frequent or bad and my optic nerve swelling has shown improvement. I still get tingling and numbing sensations but not as often. I am trying to be optimistic about this medication and I am praying that it continues to work because the next step they said is a shunt (which I am not thrilled about).

Loss of appatite = 16 lbs of wight loss in 2 1/2 weeks, soda and anything with carbonation tastes like metal .. that helped with weight loss too! The said if i lose 25 - 30 lbs i can goo w.out the meds and still have no symptoms!  Hand and feet tingle and face twitches another thing but its worth it!!

I do t know if it has anything to do with the medication but I also had a bad problem with bleeding gums. It was hard for me to take this medication, I react strangely to a lot of medications, and I am not trying to scare anyone reading this but it's true. I didn't see a huge change in my headaches before choosing to stop taking the medication but the symptoms presented themselves and became to severe to handle after only a few days. I wish everyone else on this medication luck! I hope it works out better for you than it has for me.

Three months ago my new doctor ordered a CT scan, MRI, and lumbar puncture. My new diagnoses: Pseudotumor cerebri. I have been on this medication since. It has stopped the headaches from being so severe, but I still have them.  My eyes still blur occasionally. As for side effects?  I am either painfully constipated or I live on the toilet. I get naseous, but haven't thrown up. I am drowsy a lot and frequently fall asleep or can't wake up. I hate the side effects, but I can't handle the migraines.

Altitude Sickness	tkim,  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	1	1			8/7/2009 8:51:24 AM	I'll never know if it would have prevented the altitude sickness because I had such a sever reaction 30 min after taking the pill that I went to the Emergency Room instead of on vacation.  The tingling and numbness started in my nose and then to my whole head, followed quickly by a dizzines and fainting.  While I am sensitive to drugs, this was not expected at all.  Next time I'll stick to to cocoa leaves.  My advice:  talk to your doctor first about side effects.  
Other	AVM girl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	7/22/2009 9:49:41 PM	I have a blockage where I had an AVM removed in my brain.  This Rx has helped relieve the pressure and CSF in my brain.  I can drink tea instead of sodas.  Anything with carbonation tastes bad.  But you should also look up this information before you complain.  For  me, I don't have to have another surgery!  I had tingling in hands and feet for about 3 months, then it all went away.  I take 250 mg 2 times a day.  I just feel like it is worth it and I don't have migraines except maybe 1 time a month.  I did have headaches every day, not a migraine but a headache.  Plus, visit Colorado and you won't have altitude sickness.  It is a bonus.
Pseudotumor Cerebri	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	25-34	7/1/2009 10:09:31 AM	I have been taking this med for 2 1/2 months now, and was just taken off of it. I have began to experience random, odd bruising all over my body, as well as a rash looking like sunburn in areas that were not exposed to sun. I have also had numbness &amp; tingling in my extremities. My Dr.'s want to try Lasix coupled with spinal taps next.
Pseudotumor Cerebri	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	5/3/2009 1:29:44 PM	When first started I was on 1500 mg a day, and if I didn't eat with them they made me feel really nauseated.  I am now on only 250 mg a day.  I found the extended release to be helpful when I was still on a high dosage.  I had horrible tingling painful sensations in both my hands and feet, twitching in my hands, and facial ticks.  With a lowered dose, all of those have subsided or greatly reduced.  The biggest problem I have noticed with 4.5 years of treatment is that even on a lowed dose, I still have to urinate all the time and now experience bladder leakage.  I hope I can get off the medication someday because I'm really tired of it.  I have had no relapses of PTC, but I did have a blackout incident partially attributed to the lowering of blood pressure that this medication can cause.  My potassium also fluctuated between too high and too low. The pill tastes absolutely awful, so try not to let it hit your tongue.  Food does taste off after taking it.  I had reduced appetite on the higher dosage, but did not experience any weight change due to this medication.  I also had and still periodically experience dizziness or blurred vision after getting up.  That has also become less frequent with a lowered dosage.Overall while this medication did help greatly to reduce my CSF fluid level and pressure, I can't wait to be taken off it.  I am hoping that there will be other alternatives to use in the future.
Other	Kathy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/19/2009 9:00:09 PM	I am taking this medication for vertigo associated with Meniere's Syndrome. I was taking another diuretic, but the episodes of vertigo were becoming more frequent (every 3-5 days) and more severe. Since starting this medication 2 months ago I have not had one episode of vertigo. I do have tingling in my hands and feet. Fortunately, I am not a big soda drinker, but the first time I had seltzer while on this med it tasted very bitter. Overall, the side-effects have been minimal and the results have greatly improved my quality of life.

Also I used to drink 8 cans of Mt Dew a day and within 2 hours of taking my 1st pill it gave my dew the absolute most disgusting taste imaginable! So it helped me do something long overdue!

Possibly the combination of predforte, and combigan, and other meds with this lessened the effect.  Not sure there was any effect during short term.  Pressure @ the time 63 of prescribing.  5 weeks prior pressure 37.Dizziness, bad taste, headaches consistant with medication.  Headaches were present before starting.
Other	JASOT1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	1/8/2009 10:20:27 AM	I find this medication to be a trade off. I had symptoms related to syringomyelia including headaches, sensory changes, weakness and hearing loss and most serious, a buildup of CSF. I'm now up to 625 MG a day of Diamox and have fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, numbess and brain fog. I'm not sure which symptoms I'd rather have. Since the buildup of CSF is dangerous, I really don't have a choice but to continue on the Diamox. My last alternative is surgery to relieve the pressure in my brain.

When I could afford Diamox Sequels, it was great. Sometimes an hour after taking this, I get extreme pressure behind my eyes. I also have been getting hives for about a year now.

I used this medication along with four different eye drops everyday  3 times a day for 2/months, it brought the pressue down from 70 to 35, however we could not get it to come down any lower, therefore in order to keep from going blind in one eye, I am having the Viscocanalostomy surgery, Hopefully that will go well and bring as well as keep the pressure at the level it should be.
Pseudotumor Cerebri	Amanda, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	10/13/2008 4:31:03 PM	When I was first diagnosed I was given the pills I had to take several times a day.  I could not hold down any food and was very confused and drained.  After a few months when I changed doctors and complained about side effects they switched me to the Diamox Sequals.  I take two pills a day and they release slowly.  I still have some side effects some days, but this has been much easier.
High Eye Pressure or Glaucoma that May Worsen without Treatment	ih8mymeds, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	10/9/2008 11:40:55 PM	I am always nauseated,the heels of my feet go numb and my thumbs, its kind of eased my headached but my eyes always hurt. I only been on for 3 days so i guess time will tell.
Pseudotumor Cerebri	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	9/12/2008 9:17:26 PM	I started out taking 250mg a day, now the doctors have me taking 1,750mg a day. They say my body is compensating for the lower levels of CSF. I think this medication is worse than the disease itself. I have had three emergency doctor visits because of undisclosed side effects. Now I am looking at surgery (the shunt)because the doctors have finally began thinking I have been through enough. Side Effects I experienced: n&amp;v daily, fever, SEVERE CONSTIPATION, dizziness, no energy what so ever, stroke like symptoms, tingling in all fingers, everything but water tastes extremely bad. Now after all of this, I have to start seeing a kidney doctor because the medication has caused me to have insuffient renal function. PLEASE I WOULD HAVE RATHER HAD THE HEADACHES.At a lower dose this medication did not give me all of these side effects just a few bareable ones. But once they started titrating the doses it became a nightmare.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/12/2008 1:27:57 PM	I was prescribed Acetazolamide to treat migrane related vertigo.  This drug is supposed to stabilize the physical issues which cause the vertigo.  As the vertigo I was experiencing was increasing in severity and frequency, and was increasingly debilitating, this drug has been a lifesaver.  I do experience some tingling, and some drowsiness and forgetfullness.  Though I am happy with the effectiveness of this drug, my doctor said I may be able to eventually wean off of it once my vertigo issues have stabilized.
Pseudotumor Cerebri	Shiri, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	7/19/2008 10:35:05 PM	I have been on this medication for 3 years now for the tx of pseudotumor cerebri. It makes me very drowsy, and &quot;out of it&quot; at times, so I take it before bed time. I also experience numbness (like when your foot falls asleep) in my toes/feet/random fingers, even parts of my face sometimes. This medicine has saved my vision though, without it I would probably be blind today. When my Opthamologist tried to ween me off of it a year ago, the headaches, nausea and vomiting came back, unfortunately. I work as a pharmacy technician, and i'd have to say though, it is dispensed very sparingly, mostly for patients with seizures.
