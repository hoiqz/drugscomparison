Pregnancy	LMo, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/27/2009 3:14:09 PM	Well I must be a lucky one, prenate elite comes in a bottle so I don't have to tear open the package...althoug morning sickness was dreadful during my pregnancy, the pill made me less sick than any other prenatal vitamin. My hair and nails grew like crazy...I think they added about 4 inches to my hair. I have had my baby, she is 9 months now, and I still take the pills everyday. Hair is still growing....I take them at night and that has worked for me!! They are great!!!
Pregnancy	Soon to be mommy of 2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/17/2009 9:40:12 PM	I took prenate with my first pregnancy that started in july of 2007. The packaging was a bit of a hassle sometimes when the white paper would tear before you could get to the pill. But to my surprise, I went to pick up a new rx for my current pregnancy and they've done away with the individual wrapping and put them all in a bottle! Most of the complaints here were with the packaging. Overall  I never had problems, and this vitamin was my main choice because of the added iron that helped with my anemia. 
Pregnancy	alannanicole, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	19-24	2/6/2009 7:26:50 PM	The packaging isn't &quot;hard&quot; just extremely annoying, I just got the pharmacy to give me a bottle with a label so I could peel the full supply out of the package and put in the bottle... so it only got annoying when I had to refill. I had extremely bad morning sickness at the beginning of my pregnancy leaving me in bed for days at a time, and these vitamins was the only one that reduced the morning sickness. My biggest complaint however, it took me a long time to figure out timing of taking this medicine because I found that taking it in the morning led to me burping all day... and the burps taste/smell like TAR! It was disgusting, I finally figured out that when I have an GIANT glass of milk with the pill I can take it in the morning and not burp all day. The milk is good for the baby, so win/win!

Pregnancy	me,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female		1/5/2009 12:06:41 AM	I have had terrible cramps and constipation while taking prenate. The package is a hassle, but not impossible. I will be better off taking a vitamin that is easier on my system.
Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	12/26/2008 3:08:03 PM	package is difficult to open. Take with a lot of water or juice. Made my poo turn blackish-green. This was the one vitamin that didn't make me queasy. Overall, I am  satisfied.
Pregnancy	Mama, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	11/25/2008 10:22:35 AM	If you try to open this pill using the precut marks in the foil, it could be a pain.  However, if you peel back the white paper, you can push the pill right through the foil with zero difficulty.  I have been very sick since I got pregnant so I don't think I can offer a reasonable opinion on how Prenate makes me feel.  I just hope it's helping me develop a healthy baby.  There was a question about whether or not Prenate contains Folic Acid.  It does.  It is in it's broken-down form, which makes it far easier to digest, called Folate.  Many people do not reap the benefits of taking Folic Acid because they simply cannot break it down effectively.  Prenate does that for you.  Thanks to everyone sharing their thoughts and opinions, and I hoped I've helped someone by sharing mine.

Pregnancy	aflo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	25-34	9/20/2008 11:27:46 AM	Before pregnancy, I would feel fine when taking the vitamin.  A few weeks after confirming I was pregnent, the vitamin would make me sick, no matter if it was with an empty stomach or with food. Also, it makes going to the bathroom difficult. It's also hard to get out of the package.
Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	8/4/2008 3:39:14 PM	I didn't find the package hard to open. It did cause abdominal cramps and bloating though. 
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	5/7/2008 10:34:42 AM	Didn't have any trouble opening the package. The package says, &quot;peel and push&quot;. I do however want to know if it contains folic acid? It doesn't say on the package.
Pregnancy	hellosunshine, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	4/10/2008 10:33:28 PM	I don't know why everyone is having such a hard time with the packaging, You peel and push the pill out - it's that simple. I feel a lot better with this one, no morning sickness, no hives or pimples, my nails and hair are growing and I feel great. Bowl Movements have become so easy, I'm finally not afraid to go anymore. I do drink a lot of water and tea though. 
Pregnancy	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female		2/13/2008 11:10:10 AM	This vitamin made bowel movements difficult and less frequent.  Both my bowel movements and me pee were very dark.  The package was very difficult to open.  All symptoms went away after switching to a different vitamin.
Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	1/25/2008 5:02:15 PM	After being on the pill for several weeks, I began retaining water and experienced black stool.  I do agree that the package is horrible to get open.  I have to use a knife.

Pregnancy		2	3	1			1/7/2008 1:49:00 AM	I broke out in hives after taking these vitamins.  I couldn't sleep because I was scratching so bad.  My heart skipped beats.  One little scratch would bleed for hours.  My bowel movements were way more difficult than after taking other prenatal vitamins.

Pregnancy	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	35-44	9/23/2007 4:19:16 PM	I took this vitamin for 3 months. I did not experience any of the listed side effects. Though, I did develop blurred vision and an incredibly irritated butt from difficult bowel movements. All symptoms disappeared  completely within three days of taken a different vitamin.
