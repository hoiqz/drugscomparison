Depression	Happy ever after!, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/7/2012 6:23:56 PM	I've been taking this medication for 21 years and it has saved my live, the relationships with my children and my husband. I'm now 58 years old and take 150mg per day. Growing up I was depressed all the time and regular drugs doctors prescribed left me doped up and sluggish all the time. To be successful with this drug, you can't stop it when you start feeling better but continue the plan your doctor places you on. By the way, regular MDs did not know about this drug so it is very important to see a psychiatrist and visit him/her once a year for maintenance.

Depression	Keiyentai, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	25-34	7/15/2012 8:58:46 PM	Started about 2 months ago on 100mg a day 50mg morning and 50mg night. At first it seemed to help then BAM almost all the negitave side effects this med has hit me like a train wreck. So I decided to stop...with out tappering down cause I was unable to get a hold of my Dr and the side effects were making things worse for my personal life. 3 days go by I think I am fine and suddenly just feel ill as all hell and throw up. Next day (today) I woke up around noon after my gf told me she was going to work around 11:30. Got to my computer and just felt ill like if I had the flu or something but I knew it was from the Desipramine so after not being able to take it I took 50mg and with in an hour or so I am now feeling better. I am going to stay at 50mg and try to get a hold of my Dr tomorrow and see if I can taper from 50mg to nothing or if I would need to go from 50mg to 25mg to nothing over a week or so. I can honestly say I hate this med with a passion. I would rather be depressed sometimes then have painful urination/ejaculation and urine retention and constantly feeling like a zombie all day. I stopped SSRI's cause they killed my sex drive, this crap just makes it painful and not in a good way. I would HONESTLY USE THIS AS LAST RESORT. That's just my thoughts.

Neuropathic Pain	dt98, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	45-54	2/21/2011 8:25:44 PM	I was prescribed desipramine for neurological pain related to a resection of my brain for Glioblastoma Fortemore. My body does not work well any of the meds I've been given, and despramine was no different.  I was given the drug because of pain, numbness, and discomfort to anything that moves on my left side of my boday (foot, knee, elbow, shoulder)caused by the brain operation. The drug made me very faigued, with increased confusion in thoughts, moody, and I feel as though I'm carrying around a heavy weight on my back contantsly.  This was with only 10mg which was increased to 20mg with a end goal of 50mg or fix of the problem.  Perhaps I could handle it if I wasn't still working on complex problems in software development.  But I find it difficult to do much of anything, much less something that is complex in nature.  This post is really for people that are in similar situations as myself, and NOT for depression which is what it seems this drug was intended for. I will be talking to my Dr about Nuerotin which may be a better choice for my ailment.  So if you need help for depression, disregard my low star ratings. Those trying to alleviate neurological issues may find Desipramine helpful.  My body just did not handle it well.  
Neuropathic Pain	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	7/19/2010 9:46:32 PM	I was prescribed 25mg per day for IBS treatment.  Within days, my whole family noticed that I started having terrible mood swings and uncontrollable anger.  I stopped taking it and my personality returned to normal.  During this time, I experienced no IBS relief, either.  This was a very scary drug!!

Depression	fr8tdog1, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	2/19/2010 1:08:38 PM	Family history of depression, I had some manic episodes too. This drug literally saved my life! Went from being a poor employee to a successful person in all aspects of my life. Couldn't concentrate on anything for more than a day or two and wondered why I didn't have the energy to get out of bed.
Depression	Nostalgia and I, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	1/19/2010 4:29:00 PM	(If you don't respond well to popular anti-depressants, give this one a try!!!)I've taken almost every SSRI there is (well, it seems that way) and they all have made my depression, anxiety/panic disorder, paranioa, etc, worse. My reactions ranged from hearing things, imagining strange(r) things, enragement, increased depression, increased suicidal thoughts, hallucinations, etc. My doctor, at the time, immediately said I was bi-polar because of this. Now just because SSRI's make my conditions worse, it CAN mean I have bi-polar but I never have been manic in my life. I was told I have bi-polar II. No sky-high high's but the lowest of the lows lasting from 2-6 weeks. Fast forward 2 years and now I've been on every anti-seizure med, mood stabilizer and bi-polar med from Depakote to Lithium to Abilify, Trazadone, Seroquel, etc. I finally switched doctors after years of no improvement. After a look at my file, my new Doc says he wants to try and older anti-depressant; one that works differently than the ones you see on TV these days. We started low just in case my usual reactions began. I'm now on 200mg daily and feeling great. I still feel apathetic and unmotivated to some extent but the depression is almost gone. Yes I still have my &quot;days&quot; but I'm able to go to work everyday. I think I used 400+ hours of sick time the year before last. But with a combination of this, valium and provigil, I seem to be in check. If you react backwards to current anti-depressants or if they worsen your conditions, give this stuff a try. It's stopped suicidal thoughts/ideations, self isolation, feelings of worthlessness, and basically the loss all pleasure in my life. Truly something to try if you're sick of going from med to med.

Depression	marcie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	55-64	8/14/2009 2:21:01 PM	Actually,  this medication worked better for me than any other one I've tried.  However, the side effects became intolerable.   My heart would race with the slightest exertion, putting a stop to swimming.  My hand were ICY cold -- which, as a nurse, my patients did not appreciate.  But what got me to quit it was that it caused vaginal bleeding -- my periods which had always been irregular started coming at shorter and shorter intervals until I was spotting all the time.   I asked the doctor if it could be due to the med, and he said no.  So, I had a biopsy of the uterine lining done -- painful and I had no insurance, so out of pocket expense.  Thankfully, it showed no malignancy.   Taking things into my own hands, I quit taking the medication.   Within a week, the spotting stopped completely.

Does anyone else take it for this reason? Doesn't work well for me at all.I thought it might take a little while to get used to it,but it hasn't made a difference.I have also tried Ambien and it hasn't worked for me either. Maybe I just don't respond well to these drugs and will have to just get used to not sleeping!
Depression	Sojourn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	45-54	6/14/2009 12:40:45 AM	The dose i am currently on is 25mg a day. It helps with the depression to some degree. Goal success dose was at least 100mg a day. I very slowly - half a 25mg increased it each week until reaching 75mg a day. But it dried my mouth out so bad, it was driving me crazy. Dr. suggested Biotene gum to increase saliva - and it did, but would only last for about 20 minutes and I had to chew it constantly, so it was like adding a new expensive med to my treatment plan &amp; don't have insurance. Of course, the dryness also created a bad taste in my mouth, so I was also concerned about bad breath. Dr. said I wasn't close to effective dose, so I backed down to 25mg and he added mood stabilizer - Lamictal, which is another story. In my case, I seem to be especially prone to side effects of many medications at very low doses, so I think that is one reason Desipramine did not work well for me. Oh, and it was very constipating and I have gallbladder disease, which also has that affect - so couldn't tolerate both together. Don't have money for gallbladder surgery, so had two reasons for really cutting down on Desipramine. Have tried everything else on market for depression over 20 years, so the fact that 25mg helps to a degree is why I haven't changed.

Neuropathic Pain	sable, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	2/22/2009 2:38:18 PM	the reason for my &quot;not satisfied&quot; rating is because i'm on it right now, and though it does relieve my pain in my legs, but i've been on it for a few months now, i started at 10mg for a week and now i'm on 25mg a day... this is the only new med i've been put on and now i'm having a rapid heart rate, lightheadedness, headaches, and bizarre blood pressure... i can only think that this pill is the reason for this new reaction...if anyone else is suffering from these side effects, i would talk to your pharmacist or doctor... i called my doctor and i have an appointment to see him in a week... i was told to monitor my blood pressure and pulse until then... if it worsens, then i was told to go to the ER...
