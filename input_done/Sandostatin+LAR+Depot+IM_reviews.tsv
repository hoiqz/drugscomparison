Overall the injection at  30mg have returned me to normal bowel movements and less flushing episodes.
Other	santaana27,  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	1	2	1			12/22/2010 4:02:32 PM	i took this drug a part of combination with other drugs in clinical trials. For those that use this as a tumor inhibitor, as noted in the documents and Sando web site, it is NOT A TUMOR INHIBITIOR, and not indicated as such by the FDA. (they recently pleaded guilty for incorrect indication with the FDA with Sando being one of the drugs! Carcinoid diesase is very variable cancer and may grow for a while, then stop, on it own! That is why ones needs to learn their index rate Ki Index to tell how aggressive their disease is growing.,... slow growing typical may give one 10 to 20 years of OS. This drug works well for syndrome,very well, but it has not demonstrated anti-tumor activity, and comes at a tremendous cost per injection. If it did, Norvatis would have studied this to death and shown the results to the fDA for indication change! For those that day &quot;it worked for me&quot;, well one study showed a &quot;placebo&quot; caused partial response to one participant, while one responder to the sando arm!If you still want to take it, I would wait until later in the disease course, and then make sure you image (CT Oscan) yourself. If your disease progresses, my reco is DO NOT INCREASE the doseage and continue on LAR and think you will stop tumor growth!( as some have done!) Look for other options instead (I understand, there is little to none in this space..hence the use of LAR as chemo!)....Good luck all

My blood work(CgA) is looking much better and my symptoms (painful stomach cramps) are much better. I have noticed my hair is not growing as much. Don't know if this is related. I am happy with this medication.

The first month I didn't see much change, but now my symptoms occur only occasionally. However, within the last 3-4 weeks, I have experienced sore muscles and unexplained weight loss. I have changed diet or exercise, but lost 3# in one week and a total of 5# in the last month. I meet with my oncologist in a couple of weeks and will see what he thinks. Other than that, the drug has helped me lead a more normal life.
Carcinoid Syndrome	cpu_princess, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	1	2	Female	45-54	10/21/2009 8:40:43 AM	I started on Sandostatin LAR 8/2006 30mg.  I had break thru symptoms anywhere between 3-10 each month.  I controlled break thru days giving myself octreotide shots every 6-8 hours. In order to improve my break thru my dose was increased to one 20mg shot and one 30mg every 28 days given at the same time.  That is when I believe all my problems started.  Hair loss, numbness in both hands and feet, cramps in calves of my legs, my body is sore everywhere.  Like the previous review I too hurt when poked! Round red spot rash that comes and goes, sweating, shakiness, severe swelling in legs, feet, face and hands, fast heartbeat,arthritis, enlarged abdomin and depletion of viamins in my body.  I eat very healthy and organic but still have to take perscription vitamin B-12 (I give myself 1ml  shot every 7 days, folic acid, and iron pills.  Also taking 5000 iu of vitamin D.  Last blood test shows very low Vitamin D count and while most people only take 1ml of Vitamin B-12 per month I am on the low side of normal taking it weekly.  I am convinced all this is caused from the Sandostatin.  Is there anything else to try.  I feel like I am fighting a war with my body to stay alive every day and slowly I am loosing the battle.JR

But now my blood suger is high, I need to take metformin for that, my blood pressure is high and I have trouble keeping that in check, and I have muscle tenderness everywhere. If I someone pokes me it really hurts. Ive been told could be a side effect of sando or fibromialga, which I never had before. Very confused.
Other	verannie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/25/2009 9:23:17 PM	I am being treated for multi focal-carcinoid in the lining of my stomach. I have been taking Sandostatin lar for about 7{seven} years. My gastrin level is way down and staying there. I probably wouldn't be here today without it. My starting gastrin level was 3,600, now it is in the 400 range and holding. I worry sometimes about the long-term effect of taking this drug. I don't think anyone really knows for sure.

I'm now getting 30 mg monthly.  It has shrunken my tumor to about half of it's original size, my growth hormone level is normal and IGF is still abnormal.  I guess it's working but I have developed a number of almost disabling side effects.  Joint pain, back pain, lack of energy, fatigue, sleepiness, crushing depression, an abnormal gait and numbness and tingling in my hands and feet.  It is now a struggle for me to get out of a chair.  I don't know what I'll do if I have to continue on this drug after my surgery.  It's been hell.
