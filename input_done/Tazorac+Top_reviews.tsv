Acne	luckylou, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	8/12/2012 4:23:50 AM	Just finished my first week on this stuff and my face is on FIRE. I can't even touch it without pain. I'm also experiencing horrible redness and drying. That being said, my skin is feeling softer and my acne is already clearing up. I have hope that in a few weeks my skin will be used to this stuff and won't burn as bad. Until then I'm going to suffer because I know the results will be worth it.
Excessive Pigmentation of Facial Skin	Tazewell,  Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		7/27/2012 7:47:35 PM	My Dermatologist prescribed for pigmentation problem areas on my face. Previous medical professionals had diagnosed as sun damage and i went through 3 years of laser treatments and at least 10-12 different whitening, retinol, Obagi, products at a cost of several thousand dollars. i saw no improvement with the laser treatments or the products.i have been using this prescription for about 10 days now and i am amazed at the difference and improvement. My damage is 70% gone and I expect within another two weeks maximum my skin will be clear for the first time in 15 years.I highly recommend the product for pigmentation issues. I do not have acne so I have no report on this. I have referred my best friend and my mother to this product and they are using it with great results as well.

Acne	Vain Girl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	3/12/2012 2:53:29 PM	Too strong for me.  If you follow the usage instructions and your skin is tingling and a little itchy that's okay, but if it is burning, red, peeling and tight like a bad sunburn discontinue use.  If you do experience burning, soak a wash cloth in 1 part cold milk and 1 part cold water and use as a compress and only wash with warm water and a mild cleanser, nothing else until you're back to normal.  It's probably going to take a whole week to undue the damage caused by just two nights of application.  
Acne	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	2/19/2012 11:37:54 PM	Had very mild but persistent acne. Used Tazorac for 13 weeks, resulting in severe, cystic acne. Never had cystic acne before, maybe just a coincidence. This was 3 years ago and I still have to be on an antibiotic to keep skin clear. Wished I'd never heard of Tazorac.
Acne	Jasaa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/19/2012 1:46:49 AM	I was prescribed this medication, but my doctor first gave me 4 of the tiny sample tubes to try with the strict instructions that each of the teensy sample tubes should be made to last at least a week. Meaning that it should be applied very sparingly. A regular sized tube lasted me almost 6 months. Maybe some doctors aren't instructing their patients on proper dosage. They wouldn't hand you a bottle of pills with only the instructions 'take some of these', so why they wouldn't take the time to instruct their patients on proper usage is beyond me. That said, I have had absolutely amazing results from this medication. No issues with dryness, and I am able to use a tanning bed with no issues (I do limit facial exposure tho). Before using this medication I'd tried everything I could get OTC because my acne was so painful. I couldn't be happier with my results.

Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	35-44	10/10/2011 10:04:00 AM	After cancer treatment chemo destropyed my skin's equilibrium. My oil glands were enlarged and I was breaking out like a teenager even though I was in my 30's. I was given this drug, and although it takes at least a month to start working (and my skin looked worse at first) it really does work and I am quite pleased with the results.
Acne	Penny, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	9/2/2011 9:33:01 AM	I am 44 year old female, and I have Acne that is associated with hormonal changes that is mostly on the lower part of my face and under my neck.  I had a terrible breakout this summer and this is the only medication that seem to be working.  My skin is no longer rough and the whitehead and cystic acne is getting less after each use, I am also taking minocycline 100mg orally and using prascion cleanser.  I saw results after the first week my skin is much softer and the no more cystic acne, the whiteheads are taking a longer time to go away.  The tazorac cream is better because it does not cause a lot of drying like the gel from what I have read.  I only experienced sensitivity in the first week. I like the results so far.
Fine Wrinkling of the Face	Alex, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/2/2011 6:54:39 PM	I have been using Tazorac for 8 months for purely cosmetic reasons, I have been reading the reviews to see if anyone has the same side effects I do. I finally found one, which is chapped lips and of course I do not apply it there, The other side effect is soreness INSIDE my mouth below the lower lip,with a small groove in the skin. This produet works so beautifully I will not stop using. I know, pathetic,but I would like to know if anyone has had soreness inside the mouth.

After using Tazorac on my nose and upper lip for about 6 weeks my skin is 90% clearer. Also applied some on inner rim of my chicken pox scars and most have shrunk by 60%, some are almost gone completely. I applied Tazorac with a lip brush which I then cut to a fine point.

Acne	farmallgirl, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	2/20/2010 11:55:32 AM	I have been using Tazorac for about 2 years now due to the systic acne that I get on my cheeks. It has worked wonders for my skin. I get compliments on my face on a regular basis. The only side effect that I have experienced is a peeling of my skin on a daily basis. I have to thoroughly wash my face before applying my makeup to get rid of the peeling skin. Also, my doctor refrained from telling me that women using this medication need to stop using it ONE year prior to having children because it can cause some serious birth defects. It will take a year for your body to completely rid itself of all traces of the medication. 
Acne	charcarr, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	1/7/2010 11:46:40 PM	Took a LONG time to do anything, then finally started to work a little, but not much that people could notice any difference. DIDN'T WORK FOR ME!!!!!  :(
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	12/25/2009 7:21:30 PM	I'm an african american light skin adult female.  My dermatologist prescribe this medication because I had white heads under the skin.  He said the medication would cause my skin to exfoliate and that way the white heads would come out.  I had negative results.  It burned my skin to the point where it hurt for water to touch my skin and it was also painful to use a wash cloth to wash my face.  Use with caution.
Acne	Booper, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/8/2009 12:43:23 PM	I was basically using it to control my extremely oily skin and occasional breakouts - it's all the time, all seasons.  I was on Retin-A for almost 2 years before recently switching.  Taz (so far) has been the best.  It's only been a few weeks but I already notice a difference.  Knock on wood, I haven't had the &quot;purging&quot; yet (bad outbreak before it gets better) - but I've also been using the clarisonic for about 5 months so maybe my pores were cleaned out.  Also, I use Benzaclin in the morning, so hopefully any bacteria that is being brought to the surface is being killed by the benzaclin.  Anyway, after washing it off the very first morning, I noticed my skin actually felt softer.  That was nice.  One weird side effect - I've been rubbing it on every night, everywhere EXCEPT my upper lip.  My upper lip is the only spot that's peeling??  That seemed strange to me, otherwise, no side effects.  At night, I wash (using the clarisonic and mario badescu glycolic cleanser), use a moisturizer and let that sink in for like an hour, then I use the tazorac before bed.  In the morning, wash with the clarisonic and cleanser and use benzaclin, then moisturizer and makeup.  Again, no complaints so far.  Hope this helps!

Acne	Cia114, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	19-24	8/18/2009 4:06:54 PM	Well, I just started this medication about 4 days ago, it's still early so of course I see no difference hardly. I'm taking this medication along with another topical medication and also I use a benozyl peroxide wash 2x daily. Tazorac really burns, badly, it feels like a bad bad sunburn, but beauty is painful right? Anyways, I think this will work, so I'm looking forward to the results!!

Acne	happygirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/6/2009 4:33:04 PM	My derm prescribed this for adult acne. The results are amazing! I noticed a huge difference within a few days. The drawback is peeling &amp; itching but if you use a good moisturizer it's fine. Totally worth it!
Acne	Melissa_Pratt, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/27/2009 7:51:10 AM	Tazorac has been very effective for me in reducing my adult/hormonal/cystic acne...it has also radically reduced my fine lines around my mouth,eyes and on my forehead. My skintone is now even...no more blotchyness. The only drawback I experienced was the time my skin took to acclimate to Tazorac, about 6 weeks, before the redness,peeling &amp; hyperactivity of blemishes subsided. This may be because I use the 1.0% Gel formula..which my Dermo prescribed because of my hyper-oily skin. My skin is a thousand times better than when I was using Retin-A Micro...only occasional breakouts that occur when I don't use it for two or three days. I have learned that in order to keep my skin clear &amp; under control I must use Tazorac EVERY night.
Acne	FM001, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	2/2/2009 2:36:06 PM	I have adult acne. Almost immediately the acne was gone, my skin is clearer, softer and looks healthy. Of course, no pain, no gain as the first week or two you feel as though your face is on fire. As you use the product more, the burning dissipates to almost nothing. I would use it even if it did not dissipate as the results are AMAZING and I'm extremely happy.
Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	11/12/2008 4:39:17 PM	I was prescribed for this medication by the Derm for acne and brown spots.I have only been using it for almost two weeks.I can already see some results.The med makes my skin looks like it is dry. I just use a moisturizer.

Psoriasis	btackett, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	11/3/2008 10:59:43 PM	I've been using this 1 1/2 weeks for plaque psoriasis. I started seeing results in 2 days.  The surrounding affected areas have turned bright red but I'm sure this is due to it removing the affected skin.  the affected areas itched very bad after taking a shower &amp; the cream was applied.  It itches less each day.  If the redness doesn't start disappearing in a couple of weeks I will discuss it further with the doctor.  Skin is finally almost smooth and I was finally able to shave my whole leg without tearing off quite a bit of the psoriasis and skin.

I still get cysts here and there, but I wish it would work better because I can't take accutane.  They need to go back to the lab and create a better product, in my opinion.  Until then, I'm stuck like millions of others :(

I am using it again and my doctor said we were gonna come up with a maintenance plan after this course. I guess if you have adult acne- its for life, just need to take care of it.wnfju6

I have cystic acne and have tried everything under the sun- prescription and OTC- and this is the only topical medication that really works for me in reducing and preventing the cystic acne. It comes in a cream and gel formula. I like the cream better because the gel is too drying and made my skin flake-up even though I have oily skin. And one tube lasts a long time, so, for me, it is worth the money.

But overall this has worked better than some other medications i have been on in the past. I guess just give it time and see.

Acne	ctall26, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	10/4/2007 2:18:05 AM	I continued using tazorac on my face for about 4 months, and all it did was make my acne much, much worse.  I started getting acne all over my face in places where I hadn't even had zits before. I've been on all kinds of acne medications, and this one was by far the worst.
