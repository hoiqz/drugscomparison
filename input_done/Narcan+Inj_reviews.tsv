I hate the feeling that I experienced...fearful that I was dying, felt out of control and like I was going crazy.  The hospital staff was in error and I almost died from an overdose given to me by incompetent medical staff.  Always, verify the drugs you are being given.
Other	winnie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/4/2012 11:58:41 AM	I have suffered from severe hypoglycemia for well over a year. I have had several cases of hypoglycemic coma which I came thru with D-50 or oral glucose gel. Unfortunately, my most recent case was severe enough to call an ambulance at my work where I passed out. As a far side note, I also gave suffered from severe migraine h/a since a was a small child. The most rercent migraine was 3 days prior to the hypo coma. The EMT's revived me enough with the glucose to be coherant although somewhat combative, which is completely normal with hypo coma. They still were convinced my problem was an opiod OD and insisted on intravenous Narcan. Needless to say, I almost died AGAIN enroute to the ER. I take one abortive drug when I have a migraine and that is it. That drug is Nucynta which is contraindicated with Narcan!! Train the EMT's prior to use of this drug. Oh and by the way, I work in a medical office, have 25 years or medical training and could have prevented this whole incident had the EMT simply talked to me rationally. NOT A FAN OF NARCAN!!!

My husband and I were in our car, having just left the doc office.  I had been fasting for tests, so nothing to eat and it was 2pm.  We were looking for a place to eat and as he was driving, he said I dropped my purse and went limp.  He could not wake me so he went straight to ER. Being type 2 diabetic, they thought low blood sugar, but it was 97.  They asked my husband what meds I was on.  I have been on morphine sulfate 30mg 3x per day, and hydrocode 10/500 up to 4x per day (most days 3 needed)..in pain management after having had multiple back surgeries and neck fusion after an accident in 2003.  ER doctor quickly decided I had narcotic intoxication and kept asking us if I had taken an extra dose.  We repeatedly said I had not, however, the doc insisted that when we got home we would find a dose missing. (This was NOT the case when we got home.) I keep my pain meds in a daily dosage pill container, so it is easy to see if I have missed a dose or taken a dose.  Nevertheless, the doctor gave me an inj of this Narcan which immediately sent me into orbit.  I was thrashing in the bed and trying to get off the bed to climb the walls! My hips were on fire where I have so much nerve pain...and down the backs of my legs. I repeatedly begged them to make it stop. Being a Christian, I prayed for it to stop. I have never had anything so horribly painful. It eventually subsided, but not completely. It has now been 5 days since this happened and I still feel it down in my hips and legs.  I continue to take my pain meds as scheduled, but they don't seem to control the pain as they did before this happened.  I have another doctor appointment this week to determine what to do next. I also have a large herniated disk and I am trying to avoid another surgery, so the physical thrashing around aggravated that even more. Note: Don't let ER give this to you if you KNOW you did NOT take extra meds!  
Decrease in Rate &amp;amp; Depth of Breathing due to Opioid Drug	Mema, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/28/2011 12:56:10 PM	I woke up, went into the kitchen and told my daughter I was not feeling well.  I told her I took my morning dose of Morphene (for DDD) and then I abruptly passed out.  She called 911 and the ER doctor game me the narcam (which I don't remember getting) and then I heard this loud noise and then I came back into consciousness and began immediately vomiting and again passed out.  I have had 82 surgeries and have been on pain medication for over 40 years.  The ER doctor stated that my opiate level was not elevated and that I was not overdosing, but for some reason my breathing stopped, so they used the Narcam.  I believe in my case, it was necessary to use this medication, but not because of too much medication, but for the reaction my body was having, no matter what I was taking.  I believe this medication saved my life and that the ER doctor used his best judgement in injecting it in me.  I have read some of the other comments and I feel bad for all of those people with bad reactions, but I just wanted others to know that I guess sometimes it does help.  I am stil on the same medications and have never had any other problems.

They were told specifically that he had Adderall, Allegra-D, ephedrine and no heroin or opiods on board.  They gave him the max IM dose 2mg and within 30 seconds he was dead.  They said they gave it to him because he had black under his nails and a burn on his finger.  He is a mechanic who smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  There was no reason to give him this drug.  He might be alive today, had some overzealous EMT not fiven him the wrong drug.

The serquel kicked in while I was in the kitchen and I fell to floor in a deep sleep, my daughter found me on the floor and couldn't wake me up, she called 911 and they couldn't wake me up either, so they gave me a shot of narcan, it woke me up right away, but had my head buzzing like crazy and made me extremely nausea. I told them as soon as I woke up it was the serquel. I was given an IV for the nausea which I needed badly because of the shot.

The surgery center released me two hours later to my young daughter who was horrified I didn't know who she was, she took me right to the ER where they monitored my withdrawal from the medication, I spent another 9 hours of hell, slipping in and out of consciousness.  Doctors obviously need to learn more about this drug before administering to patients on Fentanyl.

My husband had an epileptic seizure that put him in a coma-like sleep. When I got him to the hospital, I informed them of such. They hit him with narcan without regard to what I told them, and without contacting his primary physician. They took it upon themselves to diagnose an overdose. He lay in a full coma for two days. When the tox screen revealed no drugs, the staff physician THEN agreed that it was a seizure.The SECOND time it happened, at a different hospital, the same thing happened. Again, the narcan was given without regard to my telling them he was epileptic. They also ASSUMED it to be an OD. This time, he went into a full coma, and three days later, he died. Again, the tox screen showed no drugs, INCLUDING his epilepsy meds. This alone probably sent him into a coma, as in the first case. First responders are becoming too quick in their diagnoses of drug overdose. They need to take the time to consult with family and primary physicians before administering this dangerous drug. Now, I am without a husband and my son is without a father. HEY, NOT EVERYONE IS A &quot;DRUGGIE&quot;. FIRST, DO NO HARM! My husband was only 48 years old.

What the nurse did not take into account was that I am on opiates due to disc degeneration from a motorcycle accident. I went into convulsions, sweating, uncontrollable shaking my heart was beating through my chest and could not breath very well. But I could hear everything clearly from the nurses desperation to the doctors trying to evalulate the situation.I swear I thought I was going to die without saying goodbye to my wife and daughter. I personally think you need to reiterate to your health care professional if you are on opiates before going under. Thank God it wasn't my time.
Other	dusty28, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	5	Male	25-34	12/13/2009 10:37:42 AM	I recently lost consciousness, and did quite breathing.  I was not on an overdose level of the medication I was prescribed, which was adderall and hydrocodone7.5.  However, the narcan administered at scene of this event (by the way, I was behaving appropriately, oriented times 3, using the phone, etc, and then just past out..I do have a recently estabilished hypertension issue which is being dealt with to some degree.  At the time of this event, my BP had be never less than 140/100, and my heart rate between 110 and 150 plus.  I am 28 years old.  My concern is, or question, is does Narcan ever work when a person is not in an overdose situation, and essentially act as Ippecac syrup would? I do not have regular access to narcotics and thus, was not, even on the tox screen done at hospital, shown to have more of the prescribed medications in my system.  However, the Doctor did state that I was having &quot;odd&quot; reaction to the Narcan, in that it was not &quot;wearing Off&quot; and my vomiting did not stop.  I do have multiple medical issues, to include Ulcers, Colon/intestinal problems, and other genetic diseases I won't go into.  can you please reply to this basic question as to the use of Narcan, it working on a non-overdosed individual.  I Thank You.

I do not have too many memories about the situation but what I do remember is not good.  Get this; I am not even on any narcotics and that's what they give the drug for in the first place!

Everything was going ok,but my pain seemed to persist more than usual,so my Dr. decided to add Dilaudid to my pain meds, along with Vicoden and Percocet.Well, my oxygen level started dropping (down to 30%),ao I was having a lot of trouble breathing,in and out of conciousness, so they decided to use the Narcan on me!!I immediately started to have terrible spasms in my surgical leg. Pain like I have never felt before !!Than came the vomitting and more pain , this went on for hours. My whole body felt as though someone  set me on fire. I kept telling the nurse's , but they didn't really seemed to concerned about it. They just said I would have to let the meds. work themselves thru my body and please drink plenty of fluids !!Well, the spasms finally started to subside, about 6 hours later, but I still today(5 days post op) have cramping in my leg!! I hope to God that no one ever has to go thru what I had to go thru, I was sure I was dying and I couldn't do a thing about it .

Apparently a fifth of whiskey and 2 stamp bags are a bad mix. I don't actually remember the drug being administered due to how far gone I was by the time I was injected. I do remember feeling almost sober when I came to and my buddy asking me how my trip to the other side was. I then slept very poorly for the next 12 hours due to waking up every 20 or so minutes to throw up anything that might have been in my stomach. It was horrible I knew I was dehydrated and kept drinking water but it was almost 18 hours before I could hold anything down. As far as the rating thing there I am alive so I would have to say it was pretty darn effective. I marked the ease of use down one only because the guy injecting me didn't know how much to give me. And while the past 24 hours have been like hell, I would much rather live through hell than die and find myself there. Drugs are bad don't do them.

The nurse called the doctor &amp; gave me something in my IV to decrease the nausea and vomiting. She told me to push the button a couple of times (on the morphine PAC machine) and try &amp; get some sleep. That was at 6am. I was having pretty serious back spasms at the time. I have Hepatitis C which has now developed into cirrhosis of the liver, along with rheumatoid arthritis and now my kidneys are down to only 20% effenciency.I had a horrible nightmare and awoke to hearing, &quot;Uh oh, I may have given that too fast&quot;. I was trying to communicate with the 2 RNs but couldn't seem to make them understand. They kept shouting to take slow deep breaths. One nurse had horrible bad breath, then everything started to smell so badly that I couldn't stand a washcloth on my face. Then the vomiting started. I vomited bile for hours. I kept begging for a clean gown but the nurses refused to come in. The doctor did and yelled at me to listen that it was important. Did I know I had Hepatitis C, he asked. Of course I did. It was all over my chart. He was just too busy ordering meds over the phone. I later counted 5 (five) different meds for vomiting. When he left, the nurse said she wasn't staying around and risk the Hepatitis C with all the vomiting. At one point she asked me if I could keep a pill down if she gave it to me. Right! Then they'd yell and yell about holding still so they could replace the IV they had taken out that they shouldn't. With the Narcan, of course I couldn't stop shaking and quivering. I honestly, as did my family, think I was going to die. My respirations were down to 3 per minute, my pulse 30. It took me three days before I could eat or drink anything without being sick. The experience with Narcan is the worst one I've ever had. Then to find out that if any of the 5 specialists had read my chart to see that with a failing liver &amp; kidneys my body couldn't process the narcotics properly!

Certainly, if someone pumps it into your IV...This drug nearly killed me and at 6 months later, I still come awake in the middle of the night unable to breathe because of its affect on me.  Last July, 2007, I underwent a total hysterectomy for cancer. The first day was fine but on day 2, I started bleeding from the incision. This scared me, I panicked and was experiencing some breathing problems when my nurse came into my room. She noticed I was breathing quite fast and was sweating, so called in one of the doctors on the floor.  When he looked at my chart and realized that I had been on a morphine sulphate (60 mg) for years because of chronic pain(back surgeries), he assumed that I may have had an overdose.  He ordered 3 syringes and they were inserted and injected directly into my arm. I instantly felt the effects of the drug throughout my entire body but before I could catch my breath, the second injection was administered.  The pain was excrutiating and the 3rd injection landed on the floor!!!!  It felt like my blood had turned into lava and was racing through my body trying to find a place to erupt!!!  Although, I am a devote Christian, I thought I was on my way to hell and the sensations I was feeling was only a taste of what was to come. My bloodpressure dropped to 40/32, my liver and kidney functions were shutting down, and I went into acute shock. I kept begging someone to kill me because every second seemed like an eternity! I spent the next 4 days in critical care, 2 more weeks in the hospital, 7 weeks in a skilled care facility, and 8 more weeks with in-home nursing care. I thank God for being with me then, but I have nightmares about being in a hospital again and someone else unwittingly gives me narcan.  I am currently researching this drug and trying to find some way to make sure that this mistake never happens to me again. I would rather die than live through that again and I have 3 wonderful grandchildren that would miss me. Beware!

I was unconscious and not breathing due to a drug overdose and the fire dept. gave me this drug to bring me out of it. It worked in seconds and I felt 100% fine when everything was over with no side effects. This experience changed my life and I have not used drugs since then. I honestly owe my life to this drug and the firemen that gave it to me.
