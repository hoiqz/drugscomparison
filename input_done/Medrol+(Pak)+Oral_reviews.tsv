I had no idea what was happenng to me until I was well into it thanks to savvy clinicians, otherwise it could have been diagnosed as some kind of mental health issue. It was absolutely horrible, and I had to take anti psychoisis drugs and mood stabaizers for quite a while. Freaky.

I've talked to some people whom this medication works wonders for, however for me, it was a nightmare.

The first day taking 6 pills and the night sweats that followed was a bummer. After 3 days on the medicine the metalic taste left in my mouth all day long is almost unbearable. The only positive about the drug is its despensing packet is fool proof. Other than that it has to be some ones idea of a cruel joke.

My doctor decided that I probably had very inflamed sinuses rather than an infection and opted to try this steroid instead of antibiotics. It took less than a day to start getting relief and by the second day my swelling had disappeared.  I would absolutely take this again for any kind of inflammation symptoms.  I was only on this medicine for six days and experienced no major side effects.

For me this medication really helps when my back flairs up.  I have DDD, multiple herniated discs in my lower back, Radiculopathy due to nerve inpingment.  Failed back syndrome and soft tissue and nerve damage in my lower back and legs.  When my pain level goes from a constant 6 or 7 and jump to a 9 or 10 and stays there for several days I have my doc call in a script for it and I take it as directed.  By the third or fourth day the pain has dropped to a more managable level.  The only side affects I get is a bloted feeling and I get a little on edge.  But the benifits far out weigh the harm for me.  The other thing is I will not take this med on a constant basis.  When I am done with this dose I make myself tough it out for at least 6 months even if the doctor reccomends I take it.

Therefore I opted to be put under in order to get this procedure done. The injections do help me, but taking steroids is not what I really opt to do. This is due to a male idiot driver from N.J. that was on his cell phone, now I have to pay the price of 6 Herinated and Bulging disc's, plus go through orthodonture treatment. The only relief is going to pool therapy 3-4 times weekly in warm water and doing pool exercises, and by having the horrible injections in my C- spine as well as my lumber spine.This has been ongoing since December of 2006. I have had many injections previously, and believe me they are no picnic.  I live in pain 24/7

I had a very bad flair-up muscle spasam that none of my pain meds (oxy,percocet,neurontin,etc. would.  My doc gave me a dose pak which I've had in the past and valium 10mg. Well the valium worked really well on stopping the spasams, but the medrol made me feel like I wanted to go out and cause harm to anything/anyone.  I'm a mild mannered christian and that hurt me in my heart!The last day,(6) of using the dose pak,I went outside in my front yard where it was foggy/light misting and tripped over our old water heater and hit my head on the ground and put a deep 1 1/4 long laceration on my shin I didn't know about from the rusty feet of the H2O heater?  This was at 02:30hrs!! My wife, (thank you again God) found me and called Paramedic's.  We live in the mountian's 40 miles from the nearest hospital, and I got 3 staples in the legt,head x-ray and observed untill 11:00am then releasted!  I'll NEVER take Medrol again,PLEASE be careful if your MD RX&quot;s it to you. God Bless and best of health.

Inflammation of the Sac Surrounding the Joint - Bursitis	tootspt, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	10/23/2008 12:41:05 AM	I took a 5 day dose and it worked very well on a sciatic nerve and hip bursitis.  But I did have side effects:  tremors in hands and feet, disconnect between thinking of a word while speaking and being able to ay it.  These side effects have disappeared now that I am 7 days pat the last dose. Butone other problem that appeared while on the dose pak is a vision problem - my left  eye vision is blurry and that eye sees spiderwebs around lights that are the same color as the light (this is not floaters that appear to be spider webs). My PCP had never heard of this and did not thnk it was related to it. My opthalmologist has never heard of this type of spiderweb but says I also hae a bubble on my left cornea that he has never seen on anyone.  He does not know how to treat it.  Has anyone else experienced this vision problem? I think this is strange that it appeared at the ame time I was taking Medral and had the other two side effects.

Blistering Skin Diseases	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	10/13/2008 1:26:59 PM	I took this medication for a severe rash. My PCP said it was from an insect bite. After taking the cream form of this drug with a reaction, the doctor prescribed the oral pack. It was horrible. My face felt like it was hit by a truck. My mouth was swollen too. I was nauseous. It also disrupted my menstrual cycle making me spot days before I was supposed to start. Eat a lot of food before you take this medicine. It will make you feel sick. By the way, they later said I had a reaction to it. Don't take this medicine unless absolutely necessary. 
Contact Dermatitis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	10/6/2008 7:13:16 AM	After develpoing a rash with intense itching resulting in welts all over my body,(I believe to be a reaction to chemicals in a home hair dye kit used 45 minutes prior the beginning of the first itch) I was put on the pak.  By day 4, there still was no relief!  The itching was just as intense and the welts were turning into bruises from the scratching! Benedryll 50mg liquid every 3 hrs didn't even touch the itch!Day 5, my Dr. sent me to my local ER to have and IV of MEDROL. Evidentally, the pills weren't stong enough for the allergen.I was also put on Pepcid (HISTAMINE) and ATARAX for the itch. Well, the itch finally subsided! WHEW!!  But, the next day, the left side of my face and my lips started to swell up.  My lips got numb &amp; tingly.  Then I started to develope a sore throat, and tightening of my chest.  Sore muscles in my jaw.  I can't even open my mouth wide, it feels like I was kicked in the face!Very tired and weak.I went to my ER for fear that I was having an allegic reaction to Medrol. They sent me home telling me I was allergic to something in my house, go see an allergist!So, I will be contacting my PCP today to find out what is going on with me now!!

Other	rired86, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	3/7/2008 11:19:19 PM	I was prescribed a Medrol pack (oral) to take over the course of six days, to prevent inflammation following oral surgery (specifically, a tooth extraction).  It proved to be a complete nightmare. Not only did my entire face swell up like a grotesque balloon (both the side where the tooth was extracted and the opposite side), but I quite literally gained 9 (nine) pounds in three days.  Believe me, I know; I weigh myself at least a dozen times a day, and watched in horror as my weight climbed rapidly.  I also experienced extreme fatigue and bruising (on both my shins) with little, perhaps no, provocation.  Apparently, these symptoms are part of a reaction to Medrol that some people have.  If my oral surgeon had told me that this was a possibility beforehand, I would never have taken this medication.  
Muscle Pain and Stiffness in Shoulder, Neck and Pelvis	amy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	35-44	1/28/2008 5:33:04 AM	pulled muscle under shoulder blade and have muscle spasms.  i've been taking this medication for 3 days along with 3 others and have had some relief of pain but have 3 numb fingers ond right hand and arm, which is bothersome.

Remembering to take all the doses at the right time. Also, if left in mouth to long it leaves a bad after taste. It did work though!! :]
