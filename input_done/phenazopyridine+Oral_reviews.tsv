I have been able to sleep and have not had the horriable constant pain associated with the UTI. Thank God ! I wasnt able to do anything because the pain was so intense. After taking just the first dose it was amazing how quickly it worked. Very satisfied, and would recommend this product for anyone suffering the effects of a UTI.

Tried benadryl and creams but not much relief - just waiting it out.  won't tyake that again.  Worst reaction to medication I have ever had, worse that sulfa antibiotics.

Urinary Tract Irritation	Chris, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/25/2012 1:23:24 AM	It worked the first time I used it. It has given me some lightheadedness, but overall I'm happy because the horrible pain went away. I may stop using it before the Dr said to, only because I believe the antibiotics have kicked in, but if not, I will use the rest.

I've had a bad headache and my head(face) fells tight and hot. My face is flash from it. It is kinda cool to see the bright yellow  tone to my pee. I don't think I'll take this again it's not worth the headaches but my pain is gone. Waiting for the scope to see if the bad is from cancer.

Got to the dr within three hours with worsening symptoms. Almost half an hour after I took it, symptoms subsided almost completely. Now, after three days it's as if it never happened. Taking anti biotics as well. My complaint about this drug is that I've had horrible headaches which prevent me from working out or even walking in the sun, and I am so nauseous it's gross. You're supposed to eat beforehand, but I swear it makes it worse. I also get dizzy, but I already have slight vertigo so who knows on that.

Urinary Tract Irritation	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/21/2010 11:40:00 PM	This medication is a miracle pill for those with UTI's. I've had the unfortunate luck of having way too many to count UTI's since I was in Kindergarten.  Several times I've had to go to the ER because I was peeing almost pure blood.  The pain, the urgency to go, and most of all the uncomfortableness is the absolute worst!  When I was little I didn't have these pills or if they did they never prescribed them.  I'm so happy to have them because they make having a UTI a little easier to live with.

I have experienced the orange urine and I have been taking this medication for a pinched nerve in my lower back causing frequent urination urges. This medication has helped reduce the urination urges, but, wondered if I should contact my doctor about the bright yellow semen? Would like to avoid the embarrassing conversation if it is just another common side effect of the medicine.

I've taken so many antibiotics I've had to use such a 'cure' the equivalent of about 4 to 7 mths of each of those yrs. Finally this last June, I decided no more antibiotics! I had a generous prescription of phenazopyridine  from an understanding dr and zealously began a 'new' regimen. I try to eat a v good diet w lots of true yogurt. I try to bathroom when needed and do a good job of it --emptying the bladder throughly.  Incontinence has made pads a reality of my life but whenever possible I do without pads. I mostly wear white, loose undergarments. Dresses too. I use hypoallergenic baby wipes before bathrooming and as a hygienic wipe afterwards. I drink water hour on and hour off. I carry it w me driving, going out etc. I use cranberry pills --in a sense, therapeutically. Of great importance at the 1st sign of symptoms of an UTI I Use phenazopyridine for 2-3 days (at most). I may --but try not to-- use some creams (medicated) for comfort at night. I regularly use Replens nearly every day. It is now four mths since I finished my last course of antibiotics! Now that this med is no longer available from the pharmacy how do I get it? What is its plain-jane name?

Urinary Tract Irritation	LDK, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/29/2008 2:54:49 AM	I am a registered nurse and just wanted to let everyone know this can be purchased over-the-counter (around 5 bucks).  The only difference between OTC and prescription is the stregnth; 95mg versus 200mg.  Most people can treat the symptoms with this medication and within 48 hours the infection is gone without use of an antibiotic. Lots of fluids meaning water and cranberry juice in the 48 hour window will usually do the trick.  If you still have symptoms after 48 hours, you will need and antibiotic.  THE KEY IS LOTS OF FLUIDS!!!
Difficult or Painful Urination	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	11/28/2008 10:50:38 PM	You MUST take an antibiotic WITH this medicine in order to get rid of the infection.  This is just a very effective pain reliever used to treat the symptons of pain, burningn and spasms you get when you have a bladder or Urinary tract infection.  This medicine does NOT the infection.  You must get an antiobiotic from the doctor for that.  But this medicine will get you out of pain until you can get there, hopefully the same day!

One time I was able to take it and not require antibiotics (more of an inflammation but not an infection &quot;itis&quot;).  Another time I needed the antibiotics as I had a full blown Urinary Tract Infection and therefore just the pain easing of this drug was not enough and I needed my doctor to put me on treatment for UTI.  There seem to be over the counter versions of this in the drug store but I've never tried and it's the kind of pain you want to get treated right away.  One thing though: It totally stained my new torquoise blue bikini bottoms with an orange tinge (I admit it as I had to go in the ocean so I thought who would know... until I got out and yikes!).
