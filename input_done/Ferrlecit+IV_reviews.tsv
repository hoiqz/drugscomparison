Severe back pain, shortness of breath, my heart rate increased and my bp dropped significantly.  I also had hives and ended up in the emergency room.  This was my first time with this medication and definitely my last.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	Nola, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	10/12/2011 4:02:06 PM	I have had severe reactions to all iron infusions so my Doctor tried Ferrlecit. They gave me steroids and a benadryl drip first and after an hour on the infusion I still had a severe reaction. Heart rate dropped, chest pain and I had blisters all over my body. It looked like I had been burned in a fire! 
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	Hopeful, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	65-74	9/9/2011 12:49:55 PM	I took 8 Ferrlecit infusions in 2009 without much difficulty and with good results; however, I started complaining of extreme fatigue within months and my Hematologist only recently decided to repeat the treatment. I had a dual port implanted in my chest because my veins are shot and that makes the admin easier. Even though, after 6 infusions, they're running it in over 3 hours and giving it with Benadryl, Zofran, Pepcid and Morphine (chronic back pain made worse), I still am extremely fatigued, nauseated, experience abdominal pain from stomach acid and am in more pain than ever before. My labs initially improved slightly and then dropped back to below normal. I'm losing about 4-5 lbs. per week. I understand I'll probably have to take these for life and hope I begin to feel like it's worth it like last time. I remember that in 2009 when my labs weren't improving as expected, I got Aranesp with the Ferrlecit and felt better immediately. - However bad the treatment is, being so anemic wasn't much fun either so I'm not quitting.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	PN Mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Caregiver) 	5	3	4	Female	35-44	8/5/2011 10:14:08 PM	We have been giving monthly IV Ferrlecit to our son for 5 years now. He has chronic anemia due to short bowel syndrome and our MD chose Ferrlecit after he reacted to Iron Dextran.  This product has been a life saver.  We can see the difference in appetite and coloring after infusions and we always know when he is due for his next infusion.One warning: this product is prescribed (for us) to run in 100ml of normal saline given over 1 hour via his central line. ***There is no way we can run it that fast without headache and general ill feelings*** Instead we run over 2 hours 40 minutes (at a rate closer to 40 ml/hour) and we have no ill side effects. Recently one of our specialists pointed out this single use vial contains benzyl alcohol and that may be the cause of the headaches/ill feelings.  We contacted the manufacturer and so far the product specialists are not sure of the purpose of this extra ingredient.  If it's supposed to be a preservative even the specialists are puzzled as to why it's in a single dose vial.Other than this open question, we are completely grateful this product exists.The form for submitting questions is athttps://contactus.sanofi-aventis.us/medicalin quiry.aspx
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	7/31/2011 11:37:53 PM	Just finished with an 8 week treatment (infusion once a week) and was albe to feel more enery after week three.  Did have joint pain, sleepiness and intense craving for meat after first treatment.  My fifth treatment was delivered too quickly and I developed intense joint pain (worse than week one), dizziness and fatigue immediately.  Overall, I am happy with the results, but not all of my iron numbers increased as a result of this treatment.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	b, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	35-44	6/30/2011 6:36:32 PM	Although, I feel better now I had a bad reaction to the iron infusion. My infusions were 1x a week for 8 weeks. The reactions got worse each week. It started out with a low fever and progressed to horrible joint pain. On the last treatment my feet burned &amp; swelled, my face turned red &amp; I broke out in a rash all over my body. Luckily I hadn't left the doctor's office yet. They had to give me another IV with steroids &amp; benedryl. I don't think I would be able to handle the iron again, not worth the risk since the reactions got progressively worse. I kept telling the doctor each week about my symptoms but he said they were just a &quot;coincidence&quot; probably not related to the iron. The final week, he had no choice but to admit that I was obviously allergic to the iron.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	4/10/2011 10:18:32 PM	For 2 years I have recieved IV infusions - started with a Feritin level of zero - have bounced up and down but have never been stable. After an initial reaction, the amount was halved, saline added and time of infusion doubled. No reaction for two years until this week. Had to be medicated and I am still ill after 2 infusions - I have 6 more on the books. Recently found out I had Caliac so I am hopeful this may all end but I have been told I may have to br &quot;filled-up&quot; for the rest of my life.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	25-34	2/17/2011 4:28:10 PM	I have found that the only problem I have with Ferrlecit is that recently I have began having a metallic taste at all times.  Overall, I feel much better.  I have celiac disease and do not absorb iron and this is my tx of choice.  
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	45-54	1/25/2011 9:24:51 PM	Does anyone know what to take for the lightheadedness ? Been anemic for 7 yrs.After 3rd infusion major muscle aches in thighs &amp; back for weeks. Took Advil,it helped somewhat.I go once a week for 125mg over 1 hour. After week 5,having lightheadedness for 10 hrs straight so far. No one seems to know what I should take or do for the lightheadedness. Been drinking alot of water all day starting to feel somewhat better. Last infusion is next week. My levels went from 8 to 11 with 3 infusions. Was feeling great till the lightheadedness started.Think my body is not used to having so much iron. Not a good feeling. I do have much more energy &amp; legs don't feel tingly/restless any longer like they did when iron was low.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	dancinggranny, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	1/7/2011 12:18:13 PM	Since the clinic was out of the Infed that I usually get,  they gave me Ferrlicet.  I tolerated the trial dose,so they gave me the full dose by IV. When it was almost finished,my blood pressure plummeted. They stabilized me some and took me to a treatment room. When I tried to walk across the hall, I fainted in the hallway.  I haven't gotten all the details about what happened, but I know I was in trouble.  I would never take this medicine again...ever!!
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	ahoppy1944, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	65-74	12/11/2010 12:27:49 PM	I have received this medication several time, usually about 6 infusions in a 3 week therapy. I have had one reaction to it last year. I had diarhea and vomiting at the same time. Only lasted for about a minute and that was it. I have hsad my second round this time and after 2 I have a stinging in my hands but, nothing like low iron. I do highly reccomend this med. because it has been wonderful for me.I have celiac disease and do not absorb vitamins or iron so this is a lifesaver.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	Candice, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	8/12/2010 12:28:43 AM	I have had ferrlecit IV many times, due to iron deficient anemia.  I am currently on round 6 out of hopefully 10.  I used to get REALLY sick, now here is the trick for me ... IV is run with a bag of saline and over 90 minutes ... not the suggested 60 minutes.  Running ferrlecit diluted over a long period has helped   with nausea (still slight), clammy, light headed feeling.  I hope this helps  ......
Other	Marie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/19/2010 8:15:00 PM	I am an RN who works in a clinic where Ferrlecit is given quite frequently, via IV.  I've read the reviews here and have to disagree w/ some...I always do warn patients they MAY get flu-like, possibly very severe, symptoms after the infusion, maybe for a day or up to 4 days. The acutal infusion is fine, no pain or problems that I have ever seen.  They read or watch TV. No all patients get the aide-effects--I'd say the extreme minority. Some stop the treatment due to the side effect but they're in the VERY extreme minority. Most are very anemic &amp; have tried every form of iron pills w/out luck. As well as being anemic from hemodyalisis, most of our patients have had Gastric Bypass surgery or even the newer Lap Band weight loss surgery,&amp; their bodies don't absorb food/iron as well anymore. Some have had the surgery many years ago &amp; no problems w/ anemia until now. I'd say that if the patient has tried everything else, is still anemic, at least TRY Ferrlecit, don't let the reviews here frighten you from trying it! Extreme anemia can cause weakness, lack of energy, both physical and mental, and your body NEEDS those oxygen cells which the blood cells carry to all your organs, &amp; to your brain! Without the basic minimum of blood cells to help with oxygen, you are not at your best in any way.  (NOTE: I was required to fill in the 3 questions about how the med. worked for me, although I have not ever had to take it.)
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	5/12/2010 4:21:31 PM	I've had 2 treatments(of 8), the first made me so sick I thought about stopping.   I was given Benadryl and the medication, was fine for a while, no side effects at all.  About 2 hours later I started shivering, then it got uncontrollable. I couldn't hold a glass or even the remote. I had a fever of 102 F but that was it, no other side effects.  I took some Advil, and 2 hours after that I was fine again.  For the second treatment the Dr gave me double the Benadryl, which made me sleep for hours, and Advil before the infusion and I had no problems after.  I hope that's the case on Friday when I have the next one!

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	Pisgah, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	55-64	1/15/2010 10:20:28 AM	I have had the infusion 3 times, each time a frontal headache, back pain and nausea for a couple of days afterwards. The day of the infusion I have nausea and take zofran with IV Ativan.  The first time I had the infusion the next day I did feel a lift, since, nothing like that and more symptoms of headache, backache, chills and nausea. Right now this is about 36 hours post and I have a nauseating headache, with some chills, no fever.  As the treatment progresses I will update. I have to have 12 or so...

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	Tasha, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	12/15/2009 2:02:48 PM	I received 8 treatments in 2007, then had 8 treatments in 2008, I have recently began another courser of Ferrlicit- had my 3rd dose yesterday. This time around I am having 4 doses then I will wait a month to finish the course. I usually do one treatment a week for 8 weeks. For some reason I cannot absorb iron through my stomach. It took from the age of 15-27 for a doctor to realize this. I took all kinds of iron pills for many years. It doesn't help that since having periods since I was 12 my flow was always kind of heavy. I don't have any children but my doctor suggested I talk to my gynecologist to find out what the options are for minimizing my cycles. I had the Mirena IUD put in this past July so hopefully this will help. The reason I started the treatments again now is because my hemoglobin was down to an 8 when I had the IUD put in and my iron stores were dropping. Since getting Mirena my cycles have become very light, so hopefully this course of Ferrlecit will last more than a year and 2 mos. (I usually get a course every year and 2 mos, that's how long it takes for my iron to drop too low again. 
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	healthmade, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	11/1/2009 1:21:50 PM	I started with a feeling of light-headiness,next came the nausea and severe cramps from the right side of my body into the back area and onto my left side. I yelled out for help; call 911; I getting ready to pass out! A burning from the IV into my body; from my neck to the bottom of my feet. I yelled out for someone to call 911 again. Then the vomiting and diarrhea, hot sweats, more yelling for 911. Extreme weakness. Someone kept me from falling to the floor while sitting on the portable toilet. I thought I was dying. A nurse bought the oxygen tank and put it on me. Another turned a portable fan on me.  After about 1 hour of this, it finally passes. Leaving me sick and weak; unable to drive myself home. It was a horrible horrible experience. 
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	8/7/2009 12:41:41 AM	I've been receiving treatments for 22 months-every 2 weeks for the first 21 months, and weekly for the last month.  Ferratin count started at 0, and only increased to 25 on by-monthly treatments, dipping back down to 12 and staying between 12-18 most of that time.  Hematacrit/hemaglobin were better, ranging from 11/34 to 13/38.  With weekly treatments, ferratin count is now 53!  I have sustained energy, but my tummy hurts daily now--cramping is significant.  I will sacrifice sustained energy for a more comfortable gut and will discuss decreasing treatments with my doctor.  I know I will have treatments for the rest of my life; but I cannot tolerate the degree of cramping I am now experiencing.  Oral iron was not effective, blood transfusions were not the answer, the first IV iron treatment caused a serious allergic reaction...I receive tylenol, benadryl, and steroids prior to each treatment; but my counts are improving and I can walk around the block without having to stop and rest and catch my breath.  The Ferralecit IV is working for me.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	7/3/2009 2:35:24 AM	At first I had tried oral iron pills...over 10 diffrent ones..then my doctor said we should try this. I was 20 when I had my first treatment, and the side effects were slim. The hardest part was getting the iv since my viens blow offten. But as in  afterwards the side effect I had most common was smelling the smell of iron in my urine. Other then that I had no problems. A good treatment for me. Hope this helps someone...I know I wish I would have read something like this before I started my treatment. And the best part is it lasted 2 years before I had to do it again.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	35-44	10/21/2008 9:25:51 PM	Although receiving weekly IV's for eight week programs once or twice a year for the  rest of my life is difficult, the benefits of feeling well are greater than the difficulty of the treatment.  As my treatments progress, I experience an overall feeling of health.
