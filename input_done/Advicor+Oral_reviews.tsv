It's bad enough of a side effect that I cannot take the meds any longer.

I've been on he drug for approximately  years and the extreme flushing, which occurred during the first few weeks, has disipated and occurs only occassionally. Recently, I've begun to have joint and leg pain but I can't sa it's directly attributagle to this drug as I'm on sveral other medications.

So she lowered back to the normal dose and I felt better, but now after about 6 mos. later I'm staring to have the same same burning sensation again, it's gotten so bad I've had to miss work. Im going in to see the Doctor to see if maybe I just can't take Advicor 500mg. I just wonder if anyone else had experienced this. Thanks for any infomation.

High Cholesterol	ahwuo,  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2			3/13/2009 9:45:19 PM	I have very high cholesterol and was put on advicor 500/20.  I was fine on this, but after my 3 month recheck, my doc raised the dosage to 1000/40.  I had a very bad reaction to the dosage and wound up in the ER.  I made my doc. put me on the 750/20 and I did fine on that.  It still wasn't enough-my doc put me back on the 1000/40 and said that &quot;it's tolerated better with gradual increases.&quot;  True.  i did fine on it the 2nd time around.  Make sure to not to double the dosage or you might get really sick.  Gradual increases is MUCH better!
High Amount of Triglyceride in the Blood	Marie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	3/4/2009 12:32:54 AM	I took only two tablets before I started having severe side effects. My daughter took me to the ER thinking I had a stroke. I couldn't answer questions asked by the triage nurse, and my blood felt cold running through my body. After many tests, I was given something to counteract the effects and told my pancreas was irritated. Otherwise, my health is fine.

Never know when it is going to occur. Somedays there is flushing other days not. It often wakes me up. But the results on numbers has been great.
High Cholesterol	loggerhead6, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	55-64	11/30/2008 11:15:48 AM	In terms of lowering cholesterol, this medication did a great job, my overall going to 150 from 225 and all the other numbers - HDL, LDL, etc. moving in the right directions and within their healthy ranges.So while that was great, the connection I never made was that it impacted my ability to have an erection.  I did not correlate them until I ran out of the medication while traveling.  I had had erectile issues for over a year, and had been given the usual drugs to try in that category.  While they did work, it still did not make sense to me that 1)I almost never felt aroused and 2) even when I could achieve an erection (without the extra meds)it would dissipate during sex and 3)the skin on my scrotum would always remain loose and not tighten up during sex.  So, I inadvertently ran out of Advicor during an extended trip.  All of the &quot;side effects&quot; I had experienced disappeared within a few days.  It was only then that I made the connection as nothing else in my regimen had changed.  I still wasn't absolutely certain until I verified the possibility here on Web MD.  Now I need to work with my doctor to find an alternative, but at this time I'm not going back to any statin drugs.

I will never take this drug again. Also I'm not sure if this caused a significant problem with memory and brain fog, but this too is beginning to return.

High Cholesterol	garlamba, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	45-54	10/30/2007 12:10:17 AM	I developed flushing 1-2 hrs after taking this medication. To prevent the flushing I had to take ibuprofen every day about an hour before taking this medication. I also developed muscle pains all over and once this happened I discontinued the medication. The muscle pains disappeared within 48 hours after discontinuing Advicor.
Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	pgeorge_27, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	10/25/2007 11:40:21 PM	I am not over weight and I do not have high blood pressure, but I have had a stroke and multiple TIA's. This is the first medication to bring my cholesterol under 200, raise my good cholesterol to a healthy level, and it is the most natural cholesterol medication my doctor and I could agree on. I am impressed enough to keep taking it so I can bring my bad cholesterol down to a healthy level. My biggest cholesterol factors are genetics and dairy products, mostly cheese &amp; eggs. I have reduced the amounts of these items I eat, but I can't give them up. The bedtime snack is hard for me so I usually drink a glass of skim milk.
