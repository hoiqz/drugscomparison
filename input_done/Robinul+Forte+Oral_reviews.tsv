It is such a blessing. I have suffered from hyperhydrosis all my life and if you have too you know the effects it not only has on you just when your trying to work, but even worse if your hyperhydrosis is triggered by anziety or stress like me. I hate it. But thank God for Robinal. Also Walgreens for $20 bucks a year has a drug program and the Robinal is only $12.00! I would recommend taking half a pill when you start because for myself if I take the Forte(2mg) It dries me out that I could not eat a cracker because my mouth was so dry, so be careful because you can choke. Just have water or sugar free candy to suck on and its all good. After about an hour or so if you are still sweaty and your mouth is still pretty wet, then try the other half until you get the perfect balance of little ot no sweat and a not so desert dry mouth. I have tried everything under the sun to cure this, except the surgery which I read can be worse. You also can use milk of magnesia on the places you sweat, this will give you some temporary relief and it great for your skin, I would also recommend only if you are healthy, taking 1000 mg of magnesium per day. When you sweat alot you burn off alot of this and this will also cause problems. Since taking the magnesium I have also noticed that my lower back pain is totally gone and so is 70% of my carpol tunnel in my wrists. God bless and I pray you find relief also.

Now that I am older, several pounds heavier, and on medication for anxiety and hbp,  it seems to have gotten worse.  About a month ago I was at my dermatologist getting my 6 month skin exam, and started sweating profusely.  I asked her if she knew of anything that could help me, and she suggested Robinul.  Thank God she did!  I have had the best month of my life, finally seeing what it's like to be sweat free.  I used to be terrified to go out in public for fear of sweating.  People would constantly look at me like I was abnormal and ask if I was ok.  It was horrible.  Since being on Robinul, I have been in many situations where I would have been drenched before.  Now its not even an issue.  Don't get me wrong,  I still sweat when I work out or when doing a heavy cleaning in my house, but no more in social situations.  I can't even express how thankful I am for this drug and for having a wonderful dermatologist who knew how to help me.  It really has changed my life.  I hope it can help others, because I understand the pain associated with hyperhidrosis.

I had no idea what was wrong and went to the ER to get checked out and they put me on this drug for the pain and it is a wonder drug. I also have stomach and bowl troubles and i only take this drug when needed up to 3 times daily (every 8 hours as needed).

(Basically overactive sweat glands) My experience so far is the common symptoms: extreme dizziness, VERY MUCH fatigue, dry mouth and eyes, and loss of appetite. I do highly recommend this for people who suffer from over sweating like in the armpits, or hands and feet. it's very productive, but the side effects make it hard to enjoy some day activties!
Irritable Colon	jmelyn45, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/10/2011 9:56:15 AM	I have suffered from IBS since I was a child.  I am now in my 50's.  About 10 years ago I mentioned to my doctor that I was really suffering.  I couldn't even go out to dinner without having an attack.  And some of these attacks happened BEFORE even eating anything!  He told me to take in more fiber...ugh...that just doesn't help.  Another visit to the doc's office had me seeing his Physician's Assistant.......thank goodness!!  His wife suffered from IBS and he knew exactly what I needed!!  He prescribed this med and it's been like a miracle for me!  I never thought I would be free of the pain, cramping, diarrhea/constipation that I had suffered with for 40 years of my life.  Now I am!!  I recommend this med to anyone who is suffering from IBS......it's worth the try.

After years of suffering with this, trying Drysol, the electric current/water devices, etc...  I asked him about Botox.  He suggested we try this first, as he has had good luck with it.  What a difference it's made in my life.  I've been taking it for a little over a year now, and just take one tablet every other day.  The only side affect I've had is my nails tend to get a little brittle sometimes.

However with flare ups I may take more as prescribed.Robinul decreases my severe abedominal cramping and diarrhea for me. there was also a period where I did not need the medication for nearly one year due to my IBS being under control. I use this medication for flare ups and to get my colon tricked into working again.

I am very satisfied and i do not sweat anymore unless i am working out or i am hot. I started out on 2 mg 2x a day and now i only take it once daily in the am.
Other	sandra, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/30/2008 10:57:36 AM	I have had problems with excessive sweating for years.I was at the point where I wanted to stay home, and never get ready to go anywhere. Each time I would start to dress, and dry my hair, or put on makeup, I couldn't because I would sweat so bad my makeup would run down into my eyes, my dry hair would get soaking wet.I just stayed depressed, and slept most of the time.My neurologist sent me to the Mayo Clinic, and it was there I was prescribed glycopyrrolate 2mg. twice a day. My entire life changed. I can now get ready, put on my makeup, and not worry about the sweating anymore.I was just a miserable person, and didn't know who to turn to, because no one understood. I kept hearing that maybe it was hormones, hot flashes, or nerves.The excessive sweating had taken over my life, and I just didn't know who else to turn to. To me, this is a miracle drug. I had asked several  doctors for help, but none knew what to do. They just didn't understand the extent of my sweating.The trip to the Mayo Clinic was 6 hours &amp; 25 minutes away. The total cost of a 2 day stay in a motel in Jacksonville, plus food, and gas was over $500.00, but was worth every penny spent.I know there are others out there who are going through the same thing as I did, and I hope they read this message.

Side effect that is most bothersome in ocnstipation, but that goes with IBS so I am used to it :)I am so grateful that my Dr. prescribed it. I consider it a lifesave.
