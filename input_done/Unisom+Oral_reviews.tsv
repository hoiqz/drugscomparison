Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Apap1313, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	7/26/2012 2:51:23 AM	Horrible! Didn't even make me tired, and I was tired before I took it! Took one around midnight, still awake at 1am (and I was just lying in bed, eyes closed, dark room, trying my hardest to sleep and was still wide awake) .... Took another at 1:15am, another hour and a half goes by and still NOTHING! At this point I'm extremely frustrated considering I had to get up for work very early. I know I shouldn't have taken another but I was desperate and took a third at 3:30am, don't know exactly what time I actually fell asleep because I refused to look at the clock again, but I think I finally got worn out from crying, not from the pills. The next day at work I was miserable, couldn't pay attention to anything and had swollen puffy tired eyes. So embarrassing and miserable. Doesn't work.

With Unisom I fall asleep quickly and don't wake up but a time or two.

I had to be hospitalized... Symptoms with 1 gel cap + water; Greatly elevated heart rate, dry mouth, nervousness, muscle spasms, anemia... I will never take this pill again or anything with the active ingredients in it. Beware this is dangerous stuff!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	June, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	4/28/2011 9:24:56 AM	After back surgery a year ago and taking pain meds I have been unable to sleep.  I have tried various prescription meds and had side affects.  Also my MD had me coming back monthly to renew the prescription.  I tried Unisom and have been able to fall asleep.  I am a little groggy in the morning but not too much.  
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	bikerchickYZFR1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	4/24/2011 9:16:33 AM	worked GREAT at first... then after 3 weeks of taking it I'm finding that I'm groggy all the time &amp; sleeping through the day.  I have always had intense dreams where I struggle or fight-- but after 2 weeks of unisom I started actually swinging my fists or legs in my sleep (which I a=have never done in my 25 years of life) resulting in punching my husband square in the face &amp; kicking the dresser next to the bed so hard that I almost broke toes.  After the dresser incident I am calling it quits with unisom!  Maybe I will only use it once in a while if I can't sleep but long term use is no good!!!

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	jen107709, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	10/19/2010 1:14:54 AM	used to take ambien for insomnia, this is just a trial thing until i get insurance again. It works ok but sometimes I have to take 2 or 3 pills to even get tired and then it will still take several hours to fall asleep. The only good thing is once I am asleep, I remain asleep and when I do wake up to turn over I dont toss and turn for hours trying to fall back to sleep. I guess it works ok but for my severe case of insomnia I would prefer something a little stronger. Also it has started to give me headaches, worse than ever and I believe that it has started to trigger migraines for me. Something I will be talking to the doctor about soon to find out if the medicince has something to do with it.

It helps me go to sleep and sleep all night. I wake up refreshed and ready for the day. I would say one thing, take it earlier than later. It takes effect within 10-15 minutes after ingestion. I LOVE IT!
Other	destynul, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	7/27/2010 11:46:47 PM	I have trouble sleeping and staying asleep.  I had recently switch from one over the coutner sleep aide to Unisom. As far as me falling asleep and staying asleep, it works well.  However,in the morning I feel extremely tired and spaced out. I am not able to focus and am not &quot;myself&quot; until later on in the day. I have noticed when I first put the pill o my tongue it has a strange &quot;tingle&quot;. Im not sure if its worth worrying about though. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Elvira, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	65-74	4/4/2010 11:56:28 PM	Chronic insomnia, have taken Ambien in the past. 1/2 tab (12.5 mg) Unisom helped me fall asleep after 1 hr., and I slept well, but awakened 8 hrs. later feeling spacey, dizzy, had difficulty focusing vision, no ambition for the day, difficulty with memory and speech. Ambien caused no side effects such as this. Will never take this med again. Benadryl causes similiar side effects. I may just be overly sensitive to antihistamines.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Male		2/25/2010 9:21:39 AM	Side effects included feeling slightly spacey in the following mornigng. Balance and fine motor skills felt as if they were comprimised but weren't. Feelings did not wear off until noontime. I will use only when really sleep deprived in the future.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	karen uses too, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	1/16/2010 10:17:58 PM	I have a problem falling and staying asleep. It works as good if not better than ambian I'm pretty happy with it just wish it would last longer. still only getting about 4-5 hours per night. I need to take it atleast 1 hour before bedtime or It takes even longer to relax and actually fall asleep. I had horrible results with ambian wich is rx only..I don't get vivid dreams or sleepwalk with this. Another good effect with taking this is, I don't need to take my allergy medicine. I'm saving money! I would recommend this medicine!
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	10/16/2009 3:14:28 PM	If I'm stressed, I can't sleep, or I wake up at 2AM and can't fall back to sleep. I take just 1/4 of a pill and I sleep all night. If I drink lots of water when I wake up, I don't get the headache. Love it.

I never realized how important it was until now. I buy the target brand sometimes and the benfits out weigh the negatives.
