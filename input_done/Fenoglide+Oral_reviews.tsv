Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	World Traveler, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	8/19/2012 8:21:59 AM	My doctor asked me to take this drug because he thought it was the best way to lower my triglycerides after diet and exersise weren't enough. I took one pillat 5 pm with food, and an hour and a half later my chest and neck felt flushed. I got cooled down by having a swim. I had just spent 60 dollars on 30 pills and did not want to believe there were side effects . I developed a very bad headache, flu like symptoms, heart felt weak and I felt &quot;wrong&quot; like I had been poisoned. Did not sleep well, kept walking around the house like a trapped animal. Waited for the dr office to open/ biding my time trying not to go to the ER. By the time his office opened I could sense that I was going to make it by letting the drug wear off. Called pharmacist to ask about taking alieve for the headache. It took 24 hours to feel mostly recovered. One more night of normal sleep and I would say I felt 90% recovered. Disapointing as i had believed this drug could help me.

It triggers my acid reflux so bad that within an hour, I am in serious pain. Most evenings I end up vomitting. I will not be continuing this medicine. 
Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	Bob Goode, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/10/2010 8:55:58 PM	I had a bad reaction to a couple of statins (I was feeling muscle weekness after a couple of months and felt like I couldn't remember where I left anything). The Dr took me off them and put me on this- Fenoglide. She said this drug is different than statins and is less drug than other feno drugs due to dosing technology in it. I got my blood results in the mail about a month after starting it with a big smiley from the doc. My cholesterol and triglycerides dropped like a rock and my good cholesterol went up too. My wife loves this drug and so do I!!!! SO far no mucsle cramps and my mind feels clearer.

I am thrilled. Have had no side effects so far.

She switched me to Fenoglide 120mg I think that is to much of a dosage. I can not get any response from doctors office. Can you help answer the question about the dosage?Thank you,mrrussi@yahoo.com

I'm now off it and very concerned that some of the effects may be permanent. My doctor started me out with 120mg, which was much too high!  From everything I have read, she should have started with a much smaller dose. I guess it's time for a new doctor!
