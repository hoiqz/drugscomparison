Other	Nyliepic, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	65-74	10/15/2011 9:08:54 PM	I have peripheral neuropathy; my feet hurt to the point that it was very painful to walk and they burned at night.  I was on METANX, but because of cost, I decided to try FOLAST... thinking it was a genaric for METANX.  It is not the same, my pain returned after being on FOLAST. After about 60 days of pain I went back to METANX.

A podiatrist prescribed Folast and the burning went.away. My sister also had the same problem, so she asked her doctor if she could try it, and she too had good results.

I have been experiencing sharp pains in my feet for the last two years. I also have documented nerve damage in both feet. After taking Folast for 6 months I have had a noticeble reduction in the sharp pains. My neurologist has switched me to Metanx this week stating that Folast is ineffective??? Oh well. I guess it was the placebo effect. Not.
