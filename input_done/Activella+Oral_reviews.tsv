I suffered terrible night sweats, didn't sleep and headaches that went on for weeks, and was always irritable. All these symptoms completely went away after a month. My question is when do I ever go off? My internist said I should go off my GYNO said no problem you can stay on them as long as you're having no problem. Do I stay on these till I die???

I have been diagnosed with breast cancer and the only thing I have to indicate any risk is taking estrogen. There is no history in my family, however there was ovarian cancer. I should have never been prescribed this drug.

For the last few months began not feeling well. Lots of anxiety and some minor hot flashes at night. Went into dr for anxiety and had blood test done showing my body was no longer absorbing the estrogen. My level were as low as without any hormone treatment. Just curious if anyone else has experienced this.

I wasn't certain I still needed it, so I stopped for a while. WRONG!! The hot flashes and night sweats returned with a vengence! Went back on the meds. Then, the insurance co. insisted on the generic instead. OMG! What a difference! Moody, depressed and miserable! Now I have no meds and again experiencing the hot flashes and night sweats! I'm 63. Took various HRTs for 15 yrs. Will this EVER be over?

I relieved all my hot flashes and night sweats but after taking it for 3 weeks, I noticed heartburn and a VERY bad Ingestion. Also, I got a aching pain under my ribcage. I stopped taking this medicine asap. Side efffects were awful.

The last 9 months I have been very moody and irritated.  Quick to anger specifically to my husband.  The last week I have been so calm and loving.  I feel like myself again.  I am in the beginning stages of menopause, maybe 1-2 periods a year at the most.  My doctor decided I needed to be on this at the beginning of the year when I went for my annual check up.I have been wondering why I am so quick to get mad and my emotions have been all over the charts.  Being off this for a week has been an awakening and a gift from God.  I am doing just fine, better than I have all year.  I never even had symptoms of menopause other than missing some periods.I think doctor's just put us on things and we just accept that we need it because they prescribe it.  I'm off this for good and my husband couldn't be happier.  It's remarkable the difference in my personality without this drug in my system.  I honestly couldn't figure out the change in my personality and now I know.  Drugs change you and not always for the better!

Started Activella 5 months ago and hot flashes were better after 2 months-now only minor.  Didn't think had side effects until reading others-but have had bloating.  Now have had light period for the last 2 months-only a few days but..first time in 4 years!  Had a D&amp;C 20 months ago to remove 3 small cysts(before Activella)so not sure if the bleeding is med related or cysts again.  Making doctor appointment Monday.  My insurance company changed me to the generic form in June w/o me realizing it.  Symptoms came back-fast!  When I asked the pharmacy what could be wrong, they told me about the change.  My doctor made the call and I'm back on the original Activella.  It only took 2 weeks on it this time and symptoms were better.  Now if bleeding is NOT related to Activella-I'll keep taking it, but if it is..I lived with the hot flashes for years, hated them, but at least I will live.

I'm 47 and went into hot flashing, so Dr. put me on Activella. Experienced immediate relief, and feel more calm...like my nerves have been coated with oil. NICE.  But have scalp acne now, losing hair, and may be getting headaches again.  Also, losing my grip and dropping things ALOT - dropped a coffee cup just walking down the hallway.  Anyone else having this symptom? I fear going off it due to the irritability, nervousness, and hot flashing symptoms returning, BUT what is this stuff really doing to my BRAIN ??

First thing I noticed was hair loss, lucky I have a thick full head of hair.  Scared me but it subsided after a couple of months. Sleeping didn't really improve and hot flashes are minimal.  Great libido my entire life has virtually disappeared.  Last 3/4 months I have been having a lot of joint pain and have definately gained at least 10/15 lbs.  I've always had an hourglass shape and now I feel thick and bloated thru the middle.  I'm considering going off to see what happens just want to make sure I do it the right way, and if I feel worse can I go back on.  I don't want to yo/yo but I'll have to wait and see. Actually, I felt better and thinner on the low dose pill but those days are over. I may look into herbal remedies if needed.

Symptoms didn't really start till age 43. Dealt with everything for as long as possible, but the last 6 months have been hell. I've always had baby fine hair and have been &quot;shedding&quot; off/on for awhile. This was a major concern that I shared with my dr. She put me on activella. At first I thought it was great, stopped immediately with hit flashes, helped panic attacks. By week 2 had severe sinus infection, have had back pain. By week 6-7 started having severe anger issues, not even a short fuse! By week 8 I'm ticked at the world and losing a ton of hair!! I called my dr. and explained my symptoms but didn't get a call back. I'm also having eye problems and depression. I'm stopping immediately and not trying any form of hrt. These symptoms are no better than menopause. I pray what hair I have left still stays put and what I've lost comes back. I do not recommend, if you couldn't figure it out...

The side effects worsened, increased in number abruptly to the point I had to call an ambulance. I thought I was having a heart attack. I quit taking them and I feel fine. I'm expecting the hot flashes to start and the dryness to be a problem again- but I'll deal with it naturally. Better to be around with menopausal symptoms than not be around at all. HRT's are definately off my list.

Memory is getting better and foggy brain is much better. Vaginal dryness and alot of breast tenderness, painful actually. I feel anxious but not sure that is the med. Libido is down quite a bit but it beats feeling crazy. I don't think I could live without this.

I've been on it 5 weeks now and all of my early-onset menopause symptoms are gone.  It's wonderful to not have hot flashes any longer (25+ at the worst) and to sleep soundly through the night again.  My only complaint is that about a week ago I noticed fairly painful breast tenderness.  However, this is tolerable compared to how I felt prior to the medication.  And, as at least one other person has already commented, I did have nighttime nausea for the first 2-3 weeks.  Again, tolerable, especially compared to the alternative.

My hot flashes are definitely better, but I have noticed my urine is cola colored and has a very strong smell.  Is this normal?

I had been having 15-20 very uncomfortable hot flashes a day for 8 years.  I had previously tried Prempro to alleviate the hot flashes, but it made me violently sick.  Activella has worked wonders so far(after 3 weeks of taking the medication)no hot flashes even with the 90+ degree weather!  The only side effect that I have experienced was a very slight bit of nausea in the evening during the first week of taking Activella.  That has since ended, and I am very happy with the results of taking this med.

Have tried Activella (lowest dose) for a month to relieve night sweats and hot flashes.  Got almost instantaneous relief from these symptoms and got a period within a week which has not stopped 3 weeks later.  I do not want to put up with this. Also have slightly tender swollen breasts and bloat/weight gain which are somewhat tolerable.  I had the same problem 2 yrs ago with Prempro,  thought it was wonderful at first then as the side-effects kicked in and worsened, put up with them until it became unbearable, went back to Nuvaring, changed insurance and it became big $$ for the ring, so used Black Cohosh for about 8 months before it stopped working.  I was interested to read that someone else had foot swelling - I believe I may have that also and I am shedding hair like a labrador.  I am so frustrated by the side-effects of these medications.  At this point, I will go back to Black Cohosh and try to put up with the sweats if they return or spend the $ on the ring.

Mentally, emotionally = greatest impact on quality of life. Increased my energy, mental state, ability to concentrate and focus, giving me more energy, too.  A big difference.  Highly recommend.  No downside for me.  I am 54 and have taken 3 years.

Be Careful!! I am now in the throws of horrible menopause symptoms again. Plus I have an inoperable tumor. I wish I could continue but I don't dare.

It has been extremely effective relieving joing pain, headaches due to neck pain, sleeping issues, and levels of energy.  Because I am turning 60, my doctor is asking me to reduce from 1.0/.5 to .5/.1  However, after doing this for six months, I am experiencing rapid hair loss, weight loss, headaches, and depression.

No side effects. No hot flashes, although I stopped taking it for a month after I turned 65 (thought I wouldn't need it any more), but started having hot flashes again, so . . . back on it. Would never want to go back to having those hot flashes again! Heart's good, weight's fine, no bloating, sex drive is good (i'm 66 now!).

I put up with hot flashes and waking up every night for about 8 years and decided there must be something to help. It has cut the hot flashes out from 25 a day to about 3 or 4. I notice breast tenderness. I don't think I have been it long enough to see other side effects.

I take the 1mg/0.5mg. So far I'm doing good with this. They came out with a generic, and it mad me feel like I was ready to go nuts. So I'm going back to the brand due to side effects. I'd rather pay more for the brand Activella, than have horrible side effects from the generic.

After research decided not to go the compounding pharmacy route, and was put on activella.  After 3 days woke up and didn't have any anxiety!  OMG I had forgotten what &quot;normal&quot; felt like!  No more migraines either -- after several years!  Jeez, why didn't my female doc tell me about this earlier!!  Just upset that my quality of life suffered for prob 5 years, but I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS MENOPAUSAL ONSET.  I love these hormones!!

After two months, I was having several hot flashes a day, night sweats, and depressed, PMS-like symptons. I will gladly pay the full freight for PremPro, on which I had NONE of these symptoms, if the insurance company will not relent.

I took it for 2 months and developed severely increased allergies, flu symptoms, asthma and the feeling that I was being strangled and suffocated. I also have fibromyalgia that became much more painful. Be very very careful with this drug.

Had an ultrasound and it turned out to be a cyst. Is this common? I am now on an antibiotic to treat the cyst. Very frightening as I feared inflammatory breast cancer. Still hoping it will stop my night sweating.

I had taken a stronger dose. This works well. Some breast tenderness but that is about the only side effect. I tried going off it for 6 mos but am back on it again. WHY HAS RESEARCH NOT FOUND RELIEF for all the women who experience so many problems with menopause? There is no excuse. HELP US! It is 2009. We should certainly have more substantial info on dealing with menopausal symptoms. It's not as if this is a recent revelation!

It did relieve those, but I developed bloating, back pain, pelvic pain and spotting. I had to have a uterine biopsy which showed &quot;abnormal cells&quot;. I went off this med and had another painful uterine biopsy which was then normal. I was suffering terribly from the sudden withdrawal of estrogen. Then I started doing alot of research and discovered bioidentical hormone replacement (estrogen patch plus progesterone). I am like a NEW woman now. I feel wonderful.

This is better than nothing, but I felt better on Prempro 4.5. She is paranoid about the breast cancer risk. I don't consider being a miserable person with healthy breasts a fair compromise, so I insist on at least a low dose of HRT. Quality of life issue for me. I experienced vaginal dryness with Activella, so she added Vagifem. I dislike using those tablets and intend to try the ring.

Breaking out in hives. Don't know for sure if its the Activella, but it is a stated side effect. Weird happening after I quit taking it. No more HRT for this girl.

I smoke and never thought much about the smoking warnings associated with this drug. Please stop smoking if you are taking this drug. I had an ekg in july of 2007 about 4 months after starting this drug and My heart was fine other than the mumer I'd had for years. One year later and still smoking but 1 month after stopping my Activella.05mg daily dose I find out I have heart disease. My heart is enlarged on one side and I have a severe aneurysm that is going to need surgery, one valve is leaking and my heart is having a hard time pushing the blood out to the rest of my body.  All this damage in ONE YEAR!!

Honestly after the 1st night I felt a difference.  After 3-4 nights no more hot flashes (day or night).  My breast are tender, and there is slight vaginal discomfort, but the trade off is huge.  Just a little nervous enough to keep researching possible side effects on a regular basis

I was a mess prior to taking it - crying, night sweats and unable to sleep.  The night sweats are completely gone.  Still a little moodiness, but very managable.  Still having trouble sleeping through the night.  Wake at 3 every morning and having trouble falling back asleep.  Even with the sleep problem still being an issue, I've been happy with how the medication has worked for me.

Got a severe yeast infection, then the awful PMS came back.  Hadn't had a period in 6 months, then bled for 11 days and felt horrible.  No energy, abdominal and back pain, bloating and cramping, depression and crying.  Then I noticed the main reason I will no longer use this drug, my hair is falling out on top of my head.  That is also one of the side effects. Now I just have to figure out if I can just stop taking it or should I wean myself off?
