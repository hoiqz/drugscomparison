Irritable Colon		5	5	5			4/9/2010 2:20:56 PM	I was diagnosed w/spastic colon.  This medication helped me tremendously.  then they stopped dispensing it.  I am now taking Hyomax and I am not getting half the results I got w/Levsinex.  Can someone tell me where I can get it...my pharmacist is unable to get it.

This drug has worked really well for my intestinal spasms/cramping. I can actually function normally throughout my day without all of the abdominal pain.

Irritable Colon	Girly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/29/2008 9:11:43 PM	Does not work for me.  I have every side effect except for the one I want (decreased sweating).  Today hives appeared on my eyelids, tongue, and lips.  Light red small blotches on my face and body.  I'm also still very dizzy and have blurred vision even though I haven't taken it in 24 hours.  The doctor said I'll be fine, but I feel otherwise...I don't have insurance and go to my universities health clinic, so they won't do anything else for me (not even give me treatment for the allergic reation..this better NOT be as serious as it feels..).  I also have alergies to sulfa and penicilin...so if you do to, you may not want to take this horrible drug.
