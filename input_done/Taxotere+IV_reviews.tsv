Breast Cancer	cans, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	5/1/2012 10:40:53 PM	2003 is when I was treated with this drug. I had an allergic reaction in which my feet burned like I walked on hot coals. I could not walk and soon layers and layers of the skin peeled off and lost toenails and finger nails and all the skin on my hands. Ever since I have had severe nerve damage. I do not have active cancer however. They did switch me to Taxol to finish my treatments.
Breast Cancer	Nissi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	35-44	9/11/2011 7:23:41 PM	I took Taxotere 20mgs once every 3 weeks as part of my chemotherapy for Stage 2 HER-2 positive invasive ductal carsinoma (breast cancer). During my second infusion I had a terrible reaction. A sharp pain ran from the nape of my neck down my spine and out to all my limbs. I was paralyzed by the pain and called out for help. Oncology nurses ran over and said that I had a reaction to the Taxotere and that my infusion rate needed to be slowed down etc. I was able to take Taxotere for the duration of my 5 chemo cycles but the infusions lasted 6 hours each visit. I was told that my name was added to &quot;a list&quot; but was not given any further information. In the months and now 2 years  that followed, I suffered from mild neuropathy in my feet and hands but what was worse was this gnawing pain in my back that has progressively gotten worse. I wasn't even able to take a shower because the water hurt my back as it came out of the shower head. I began to ask my oncologist what this pain was and he seemed baffled and didn't make any connection to the Taxotere incident whatsoever. Each time I mentioned it, he refuted that it was safe and not related. I had numerous MRIs and a PET scan, a full spinal x-ray series, CT scans and even a thorasic spinal epidural to try and relieve the pain and find the root of my pain. All came back that I was fine. With no further answers and help from my oncology team, I decided to seek help from other specialsist. I am now being seen by a Pain Management doctor who is treating my pain as nerve damage from the Taxotere. I am on heavy doses of pain meds and have drastically altered my quality of life. The pain is more manageable than it had been earlier, but it is ever present and masked by medication. I was NEVER informed that chronic nerve damage in my back could be a possible side effect. I have since connected online with others who have suffered with severe pain following Taxotere usage. I am cancer free, but in pain!

I have just over 50% of my lung function left.  If you experience shortness of breath to point that you cannot do the things you normally do - insist on getting your lungs examined (via xray or ct scan).  Be sure that you are okay.  Do not take No for an answer.

The good part is my PSA went from 1302 in May to 17 on June 28, 2011. However on the last 2 infusions, I had reactions half way through,chest&amp;neck pressure like a heart attack. They had to stop and give me benedryl, then proceed at a reduced rate.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	35-44	3/5/2010 4:31:14 PM	I have been  taking taxotere ever 3 weeks for 7 months and the excessive eye tearing and fingernail infections are wearing me down.  My CT scans have been coming back &quot;slight improvement&quot;.  I plan to discuss changing my treatment with my oncologist at my next appointment.  I previously had peripheral nueropathy of hands and feet from my first round of chemotherapy so I do not know if taxotere has had any effect on this problem.
Breast Cancer	Tori, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	55-64	3/3/2010 6:36:09 PM	Had 7 treatments with Taxotere-no one told me I could permanently lose my hair, but two years after finishing chemo, I have very sparse very thin hair on my scalp, and no body hair, no eyebrows or lashes.I just wish I had been given a choice.There is a sizeable contingent of women around the world who have had the same experience with hair loss and taxotere.Drug company denies it and says it is rare, but there are too many of us for it to be an anomaly. Be forewarned-you could lose your hair permanently and add the insult of alopecia to the injury of breast cancer. So far my cancer remains in remission (they don't say cured, they say remission), but I still continue to fight neuropathy, fatique, low blood counts and chemo brain. And again, it has been 2 years! I am grateful to be alive but if I had been given a choice of something that would not cause all these problems and still kill off the cancer cells, I would have certainly chosen something else.

Am able to travel and work. Feel better since beginning treatment. Side effects include hair loss, nail change, shortness of breath, fatigue, numbness in finger tips and feet. the stde effects have increased over time. The positive results are well worth the side effects.
Breast Cancer	Crazylady, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	55-64	9/10/2009 8:08:28 PM	I had breast cancer and was treated with Taxatere and Cytoxan IV.  Everything seemed to be going fine until the 5th treatment, when 2 days after treatment I got hives.  Then I went back for my 6th and last treatment and after approximately 1/3 of the bag had run in I got hives again.  They gave me Benadryl IV and I got over it but it was certainly scary at the time. Best advice I can give you which I didn't do.... because I was scared to pieces is ask questions, ask about side effects, ask about everything.  I found out that the other drug they gave me can cause heart problems so ask questions!!!! and keep asking until you get an answer you can understand.

I had been treated with 'Cisplatin' and 'something-16' pre-surgery.  After surgery (removed my left upper lung and one lymph node) all apthologies came back negative.  My Oncologist then head me do 3 'rounds' of Taxotere &quot;...just to make sure&quot;.  This is Aug 30, 2009...will have first followup CATscan 1st week in Oct '09.Side effects were bad...hugh increase of hearing, sense of taste is diminished, neuropathy in legs and arms, sharp pains in joints and chest.  Oncologist says these SHOULD diminish within 12-18 months.  Says that vitamin B-6 and B-12 will help.  Aslo, vitamin D (1000mg dose) and 'statin' drugs have awesome anti-cancer properties as well.  Both my surgeon and oncologist said I came through radiation and surgery exceptionally well and I have 30-40% chance of recurrance BUT that also means I have 60-70% chance it (cancer) does NOT return...I am holding on to those odds!

In remission for 2 1/2 months and tumor markers started going up, I had another PET scan that showed tumors had teturned.  Started 2nd round of Taxotere.  After 6 treatments I had  another PET scan that showed the  treatments were no longer working.I didn't have any major side effects with this drug...the first 5 days after a treatment I just felt kind of yuky and I was tired.  I did not have any problem with vomiting or the other side affects mentioned.Today, (08-26-09) I will start a new chemo drug, Xeloda, taken in pill form.

My fingernails have started to come off, severe swelling of hands and feet, swollen watery eyes, flu like symptoms, dry mouth. Seems like I get a new side effect every few days. It's working but its been very hard to get through. I am very strong and refuse to give in to many ailments but this kicked my butt!
Locally Advanced Breast Carcinoma	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	7/25/2008 10:53:16 AM	I was involved with the clinical trials for stage 3 breast cancer 12 years ago.  I had wonderful response to the drug (94% shrinkage in my tumor)and relatively few side effects.  I truly believe that I am alive today because of this drug.It was used a second time when I had the disease in the other breast.(Insurance company said it was not &quot;medically warranted&quot; to prophalatically remove the other breast when I had my first diagnosis).  I was only able to tolerate 3 cycles due to reactions to the drug.  But again, remarkable response the the drug.
