Cough	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		1/6/2011 7:26:28 PM	My 4-year old daughter was perscribed this drug to alleviate severe coughing symptoms.  As other reviewers have posted, she is considerably more agitated and restless, and the cough has gotten much worse (if that's possible). We have given the drug more than a fair shake (third dosage now, shame on us, but the doctor swears by it for extreme cases, so we've been patient), but I can't wait until the drug wears off so I can give her the old stand by, Robitussin.  It's not great, but at least I know she'll get an hour or two of sleep.
Cough	waittowearoff, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	12/7/2010 10:43:14 PM	I have a cough that resulted from what I believe to be flu. I was hacking every 30 seconds or so, making it difficult to get any rest. I had heard of cough syrup with codeine, and thought this might be a good solution. I was disappointed after taking Iophen-C NR and it made no apparent reduction in hacking, if anything it seemed to make my coughing more frequent and worse. With continuous hacking, I was also not able to get any rest, the whole reason to visit the Dr and get medication. After looking around on the web, I noticed that this medication (Iophen-C NR) is a mixture of an expectorant and codeine, a combination that makes no sense to me - increase the flow of mucus and try to relax - how is that supposed to work?  Shouldn't a medication either decrease the flow and try to relax OR increase the flow and get hyper for some good hacking? Suppressant with codeine OR expectorant with cocaine - now that would make sense.Looking on this list of comments, it would appear this useless product has other satisfied customers like me. Hopefully you're reading this before taking a dose - I'm waiting for my dose to wear off so I can take an antihistamine and get some rest instead of the coughing aerobics I've got going on now.
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/3/2010 10:43:31 PM	This was the only thing that helped me to sleep while I had a really bad cold and was coughing a lot.  As a nurse I would NOT, repeat NOT suggest this for the frail elderly or anyone who is really sensitive to narcotics for any reason.

Cough	Needsleep, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	11/7/2009 5:45:52 PM	Maybe I am too impatient. But so far I am into the 2nd day and I don't see it helping at all. The instruction says &quot;1 teaspoonful every 4~6 hours&quot;. I wonder if it was a typo for &quot;1 tablespoonful&quot;
Cough	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	65-74	10/28/2009 11:52:17 AM	It is quite possible, and agreed to by 2 MD's, that I had a severe reaction to this drug after the only the second dose of two teaspoons---extreme dizziness and disorientation that resulted in a trip to the ER and a CTScan.  It was probably 4 days before I completely returned to feeling normal again.

Cough	Jenny, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	12/6/2008 12:47:21 PM	Dr. prescribed this to me while I was pregnant with a sever upper resp infec w/ cough. It really hasn't helped the cough a lot (I think it could be because I'm taking a really low dose) However it does help me rest better at night.
