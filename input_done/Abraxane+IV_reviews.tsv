The oncologist described his oncology plan for me as, &quot;more treatments, less toxicity.&quot; I received weekly treatments of abraxane for twelve weeks. I was sick the entire time and in horrible pain.  I ran a fever and showed signs of congestive heart failure. The doctor told me there was nothing wrong with me other than not wanting to finish the chemo.  The effectiveness was great, but I have permanent nerve damage, pain, and neuropathy caused by this drug.  I was never told that could happen. I would have made different choices.

I still have severe numbness and swelling in my hands and legs. I also had substantial vision loss almost immediately after my first treatment. I was in terrible pain during the treatment. I think that the prescribing physician should tell people that it will age you 20 years, on the spot, and you will never be the same. My doctor tried this drug on 2 patients. We both had the same complaints. He said that he will never use it again. It is a HORRIBLE drug.
