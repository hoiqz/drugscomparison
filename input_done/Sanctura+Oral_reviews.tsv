Overactive Bladder	Justgertie, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female		1/26/2012 1:49:14 PM	I have taken Sanctura for approximately 3 years and it has never really worked. I have had two bladder sling surgeries, and the leakage has never stopped so I guess I will have to wear pads the rest of my life (cry). I tried Enablex and was allergic to it, Toviaz that seemed to work but I gained weight fast and was very uncomfortable and constipated, and am about to try Ditropan.

The second day I experienced severe bloating and abdominal pains, and every day since. This is the last med I can try and am now seriously considering an Interstim implant. I am only 27 and have been suffering for about 4 years now.

Overactive Bladder	jetwriter, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	10/6/2010 6:36:29 AM	Sanctura has made me pad free after a week. Since starting I've gained 15#, heat intolerance, major fatigue, muscle pain. I need to lay down every two hours just until the pain goes away. I've talked to Allegen. None of these side effects have been reported. I am on many meds but these symptoms are new since starting the sanctura. Has anyone else had these symptoms? On the bright side sanctura has really decreased my depression. The trade off isn't worth it. Going to talk with GU doc today.

Overactive Bladder	kristir, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	1/28/2010 1:25:03 PM	I have tried almost all of the other medications for OAB, and the implant surgery was the next option.  The doctor, as a last resort, started me on the Sanctura XR.  Within 3 days I was pad free and going when I wanted to instead of every 30 minutes when I had the urge.  Insurance would not pay for XR, so the doctor started me on the 20mg twice a day.  The dry mouth is not near as bad as with the XR, but I am getting the same great results for OAB.  I had both stress and urge incontinence, which is now almost nonexistent.  The only side effect is that it is difficult to take with my allergy medication. I have found a good time to take it each time, and by taking it two hours after dinner, it saves me from the &quot;midnight snack&quot;.  I have only been on the medication for about a month, but I have had no issues, and am very thankful.  I hope it doesn't wear off.

Frequent Urination	twinkie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	45-54	9/8/2009 10:15:38 PM	I was getting up 4-5 times a night to urinate and several times a day. I felt controlled by my bladder. The medicine has been great I sleep through the night and am not always looking for a bathroom during the day. The side effects have been gas and some constipation. I eat a lot of fiber and drink lots of water this helps.
Overactive Bladder	Ellie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	7/8/2009 8:23:35 AM	I have been taking Sanctura for almost one  month and it has really made a difference in stopping frequent urination and pressure to urinate.  I took DetrolLA before and it quit working.The side effects were less with Detrol.  The side effects I feel are EXTREME dry mouth and some fatigue.  I am debating whether to stay on this drug or try another.  
Frequent Urination	Cathnomore, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	45-54	6/24/2009 11:41:05 PM	I have been on Sanctura 60mg for a couple of months.  Recently started taking it first thing in the morning to guarantee an empty stomach.  I was not satisfied with the results to that point.  Dry mouth increased to near intolerable levels.  So I guess it really did help to have a totally empty stomach. Well, today I had to go to the emergency room for urine retention...inability to urinate.  Did not enjoy the catheter experience and will stop the Sanctura all together.  Was 60mg to high a dose?  
Overactive Bladder	Betty, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/11/2009 10:56:45 AM	Had a terrible problem with Oab and after tests with a Gu doctor they put me on this med. Except for a dry mouth it has worked beautifully and I am so happy not have to wear pads.
Overactive Bladder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	3	4	Female	45-54	5/10/2009 1:48:42 AM	My doctor told me to take this med once daily for 6 wks before deciding if it works or not. After 3 1/2 wks I find that it is making a real difference. Not going nearly as often or as urgently. It does give me a dry mouth but that is also a plus in a way because that encourages me to drink more which is good. I have been in the bad habit of drinking too little most of my life. I feel better all the way around!
Overactive Bladder	Web MD, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	55-64	3/23/2009 12:11:35 PM	I started Sanctura about 3 weeks ago, after trying three other meds for oab this past year.  This one is dissappointing also, because the constipation is awful and the drowsiness is overwhelming. I am not sure what to do next about my bladder problem.
Urine Leakage When there is a Strong Desire to Void	Mesa Verde , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	3/13/2009 3:29:23 AM	Started Sanctura when bladder support surgery did not stop leakage. I chose Santura from three medications because it seemed to dry out my mouth slightly less than the other medications. Today I stopped the drug after a dental checkup revealed four teeth with pockets measuring 6, a peridontal condition caused by a dry mouth. Normally, saliva helps keep bacteria in check. Before Santura, my gums had a normal measurements of 3. I'm having $1,800 in root planing to remove bacteria below the gumline. I realized that I won't miss Sanctura much. I wear pads to protect against wetness anyway. There's no protection from leakage when sneezing or coughing. The urge to urinate seems to come too late to make it to the restroom so I have to maintain an awareness and make more frequent trips to the restroom. If I were to remain on Sanctura, I'd have to drink fluids continuously to keep my mouth from getting dry. This would counteract the supposed benefit of Sanctura but wouldn't address the issue of a mouth that goes completely dry for seven hours a day, endangering my otherwise healthy teeth.

The urge to urinate disappeared, no leakage, but the side effects (cotton mouth, constipation, abdominal pain) made me stop taking it.  They were horrible!

The side effects are disabling to me.  Blurred vision, alot of dizziness, nausea and constipation. The dry mouth claim is an understatement...nothing resolves it! Going to finish the trial 7 day treatment of 60 mg one time per day and see what happens.  So far, no change and feeling sicker every day.

After 20 years of UTI's, a urologist diagnosed the problem as urethral stenosis.  I take sanctura to relieve my bladder spasms.  I notice a difference.

Further, I found that the restriction around dosing (2 hours after a meal or 1 hour before) to be inconvenient, especially considering that it was taken twice a day.

They found nothing wrong with my heart. My feeling is it may be the santura since that is the only change in my life. I wil start taking it at bedtime and see how that works.There is no side effects that I can find to support the chest pressure from sanctura. I do love how it has helped my overall symptoms and would recommend it to others with over active bladder.Most side effects of drugs do lessen or go away and I like sanctura too much to just give it up without a good try with the new xr.

When there is a strong urge, there is still leakage at times.  I am experiencing lightheadedness, but my doctor says it isn't caused by Sanctura.  Has anyone else had this reaction?

I took one sanctura at 5:30 PM and by 9:00 it had completely blocked my urine flow.  I suffered through the night and got a catheter the next morning which I am now wearing for 7 days.
