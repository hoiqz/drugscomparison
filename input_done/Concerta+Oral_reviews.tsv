Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Kimberly Todd, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	25-34	8/22/2012 9:56:55 PM	I have been taking Concerta for just over 2 years. Prior to my pregnancy I was taking Adderal. Once I started the Concerta I noticed my eyes seem misaligned and I get a weird blinking/ eye rolling tick. I still get agitated at times and overly anxious but it doesn't interfere with my appetite quite like the Adderal did. My weight has remained the same where the Adderal had me down to 89 Lbs, 10 Lbs too light for my height. I am also just finding out I have a combined type ADHD which causes anxiety so I may be looking at a med change soon. Hopefully the next medication will be on the first tier of my pharmaceutical plan so I can pay a $10 copay instead of $40. This new doctor is going to have a difficult time with me because I don't generally allow them to tell me what I am going to take, I research the medications and tell them what I am willing to try. I think the Concerta was given on false pretense since my old doctor in Tennessee told me it was a new kind of Ritalin. It probably time to try Dexedrine with an anti anxiety drug.

At the time I was on a PPO health plan which allowed me to get this med at $35 co-pay. Two months later I switched to an HSA with a $3,000 deductible. Having never checked the true price of the drug before I switched, I discovered that it's over $300 a month out of pocket. Not good... So, my doctor put me on Vyvanse which was half the cost, then Adderall. My results were mixed - Vyvanse was good but severely dehydrated me. My eyes, my mouth...I couldn't drink enough water during the day. Additionally, my sex drive evaporated. And when I did have sex, I was done in two minutes. NOT GOOD. I even had my testosterone levels checked and they were very good. Adderall had less side effects but wasn't as good as Vyvanse and still far less effective than Concerta. In the end, I went with concerta and for eight months I paid the $300+ a month out of pocket. Now, back on a PPO, I take Concerta and have actually increased my dosage as my body has &quot;settled&quot; into the medication. I now take three 32mg pills a day and it is working as it did when I started.  In the end, all I can say it that it's changed my life.  (FYI - I am 38, 6'5&quot;, 245)

Since then he has been a totally different person.  He is more relaxed and less angry at the world.  It controls his tempers and his outbursts and has helped him through school to stay focused in class. The only thing that I would say bad about it is that he now has picks at his finger nails that are already short enough.  I have to keep telling to stop picking his nails or hes going to make them bleed.  But WE LOVE THIS MEDICATION.. HE just turned 8 yrs old.

He was running around like a &quot;mad man&quot; when the med was wearing off. As the med was wearing off, we noticed his heart was racing and he was rambling on and on about non-sense. IT DID NOT WORK FOR US, EVERY CHILD IS DIFFERENT!!!!!!!!!!!!

That being said, I don't see where some of these parents with awful grammar skills read up on these drugs before they just listen to a psychiatrist. Personally, this drug has changed my life for the better. Finished high-school with a 2.75 graduated college with magna cum laude.

I do not recommend for children.

Fatigue when it wears off, with funny heart feels, some days even at 27mg.  Husband says I fly the broom worse now, but concentrate at work much better.  The real bad part is I have to share is a friend went on this stuff, 57y/o very medically educated male had his heart stopped after being on it for several months.  Only symptoms I know of at the moment were fatigue and just not feeling well. Alive and well(hopefully) now but the heart stopped on vacation.  And this person knows his drug interactions and warning signs.  My guess is that he did exactly what his MD told him to do.  When all else fails, use your commonsense to guide you, reguardless of what others say, they won't die beacause they give you bad advice.  Remember, you are ultimately responsible for you and your kids continued existence.

The last 2+ yrs health has gone down hill. From weight gain to migranes, throwing up, bloody nose and now liver damage.  I was happy with the results at lower doses, not so with the higher dose. He is now off the drugs and we are trying again to handle this holistically.  Was against the drugs from the beginning but he wasn't doing well in school.  It didn't make any radical improvements in his ability to focus, I think it just made him easier to deal with in class?! Good Luck and beware.

It is only available in a capsule form. My son had quite an issue swallowing it. It worsened the issue that I was having with my sons behavior. His issues went from not focusing to anger issues and full out &quot;Fits of Rage&quot;. I do not recommend this medicine for children.

I had stopped taking Adderall XR 10mg in 2009, and this was the first time using medication in a few years. Now, my dose was increased to 36mg in October and finally to 54mg in December. Now, I recently tested positive for amphetamines. I'm not sure how, but I can tell you I've never taken any. I have heard that this will may falsely test positive for amphetamines. Also, I'm rather irritable when focusing on certain projects, and I have been increasingly talkative. But focused. It's an odd medication, but I'm hoping I don't get into trouble for drugs I didn't use.

My wife has add and my son and daughters have add.  My wife and I are Medical Professionals both with over four years of college with degrees.  Within our family we have practically tried every add med available for the last 20 years.  3 members of my family are on concerta.  doses of 72mg 2 x day, 108 mg 2 x day.  I have also found combinations like, concerta + adderall to be effective.  My doctor has worked with our whole family throughout the years.  We have found occassionally changing medications every few years to be effective.  Sometimes because they start losing their effect.  Sometimes because of side effects, headache,lack of appetite, getting sleepy.  We have found all fo these meds to be effective like dexedrine, dextrostat, adderall,concerta, desoxyn.  Everyone metabolizes meds differently.  some of us need higher doses, sometimes have side effects but its good to have a doctor that will work with you through the years makings adjustments in your meds to fit your needs!  I JUST FEAR WHAT WILL WE DO IF OUR DOCTOR DIES!  ITS SO HARD TO FIND A GOOD DOCTOR!  GOOD LUCK!

This is supposed to not only keep him focused at school but control his behavior.  He has been on for a week now and so far everything has been fine.  No side effects.  I hope it stays that way!  He is on 18mg once daily. I give it to him in the morning before school and this is supposed to keep him on the right track for at least 12 hours according to the doc.  But no meds on the weekends or off days from school are a nightmare.

Unfortunately, i also became quite moody, guaranteed to happen once a week. Before I headed for a divorce I don't want, I figured I better try something else. Problem is those something else's (Focalin, Adderall) haven't been nearly as effective.

Have had to reduce from once per day, then to two days on and one off, now to every other day due to side effects. Physically and mentally hyperactive,insomnia,intense dreams disrupting sleep including violent leg thrashing. Also an extremely offensive body odour and bad breath upon waking. Had the same problems with Ritalin 20 years ago. Used to be on Cylert which worked well but it was pulled from the market due to danger of death from kidney? failure. Was put on Effexor, total disaster.

I find myself becoming less agitated with the inability to focus. Overall, if you are suffering from ADHD symptoms, talk to your doctor about Concerta.

He is doing so much better.  With tourette's it is difficult to focus and sit still.  He takes Concerta and Orap in the am and takes Orap and Clodine at bedtime.  I am cery pleased with the results we have seen.  At one point it was difficult for him to hold a pencil and made classroom time very hard.  He is doing very well in every area.  He is sitting in class and his &quot;ticks&quot; are much more subtle.  I will say that his appatite is not what it used to be.  He just makes sure to eat a solid breakfast and dinner.  He snaks the rest of the time. It is however very addicting and it is very noticable when he is without.  I believe that the good outweighs the bad and am very pleased with the overall results we have seen.

I am 43, and for the first time in my life I can hold still. I can maintain attention, I'm patient, and I'm a lot happier. I'm far less irritable.  I'm not as easily frustrated, and I'm only juggling two or three thoughts instead of five or six. I'm also far less impulsive. I am not constantly wanting new things, and my moods are calm.  I haven't lost my creativity or imagination. In fact, it improved. I don't procrastinate as much, and organization is easier. Finally, I can stay on task without getting distracted as easily.  I am so much happier. The fact is that, for me, it feels too good to be true. I wish Concerta worked for everyone who has ADHD.  But it doesn't. No drug works for everyone.  But this one worked for me.  I wish I had been diagnosed a medicated 35 years ago when I started failing in school. I spent years struggling and suffering. Worst of all my impulsivity caused me social conflicts, and romance difficulties. Thank goodness I sought help. My psychiatrist is amazing. Everyone who struggles with mental illness or disabilities should seek help.

It's worked great for me, although it seems I have to force myself more to take a break from my work and socialize at the office (kind of like a zombie glued to my desk). I DO notice that this far worse when I don't get a full nights sleep. However, the past month or so I've been working to get a full 8 hours in (rather than the usual 5-6) and I've noticed a huge improvement.  There's also little things that have changed since I started taking Concerta. I have no need to nap anymore, I no longer get overwhelmed/aggravated when the grocery store's packed and I can clean the house without calling it quits 1/4 of the way through! If I happen to miss a dose, there is some minor withdrawal (only on the 1st day). I feel horribly tired and cranky sort of like a cold without the sniffles. I can't even finish a full day of work. Finally the one major downside is the controlled substance restrictions. I receive a 30 day supply (no refills), which is fine, but I have to call my Dr.'s office, wait 2 days to pick up a Rx slip and then drop it off at the pharmacy. This all has to be done within a window of a few days. If I forget, I'm forced to miss a dose or two.

Concerta has been quite instrumental in aiding my ability to prioritize daily tasks and to focus on short term, as well as long term goals. I recently returned to college,(after 15 years) and last semester, I made straight A's (a 3.96 GPA) in all 4 of my classes. When I was a highschool student, and college student (in my earlier years), I was never quite able to fully engage in academics.  I became frustrated very easily, and let my grades go. I also had no idea that I had ADD/ADHD back then. I have been on Concerta for about a year and I am very pleased with this treatment. I have also noticed an anti-depressant effect from this medication as well, which is a plus! The only drawback that I have noted so far is the tachycardia from the medication. My resting heart rate is around 100 bpm, in the middle of the day. This medication may be dangerous for those with personal or FH of cardiac conditions. Having an EKG performed on you from your primary care doc is a good idea before going on this med, as well as a referral for a formal psych eval. Behavioral (unfavorable) changes can occur with the use of stimulants in certain individuals. All in all, this medication agrees quite well with me.

I finally discovered why I had done so poorly in school despite being rather intelligent.  I started Concerta right off the bat and have found it very effective.  The first couple of weeks I felt overly alert which freaked me out a little.  It seemed as if I was TOO alert, if that's even possible.  Once my system got used to it, I was fine.  I didn't experience and headaches or nausea, but my appetite did decrease. There was a brief time that I thought that it wasn't helping and my doctor said that he can see it's working for sure, but if I was doubtful, to stop taking it for a few days and compare the difference.  I did, but my doctor had failed to mention the AWFUL withdrawl i'd have!! I missed 2.5 days of work because I felt so terrible. I felt like a chunk of lead, couldn't drive, couldn't move, and couldn't keep my eyes open.  So I have no idea how these kids/adults that are able to not take it on the weekends can even function!! Anyways, needless to say...I wan't able to compare the differences because I had the worst Concerta &quot;hangover&quot; ever. I do experience the moodiness and the sadness, but I also suffer from depression (I take Paxil CR for that) so it could just be from that, not the Concerta.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	bella1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	9/17/2011 4:29:16 PM	I'm a female that was diagnosed with a learning disability and put on ritalin in 2nd grade. Then I was switched to 18mgs Concerta when I was 13 and have been on it since and I'm now 25yrs taking 36mgs. I have been a fan of this medicine because it really helped me focus in school and work. I have had lost of appetite in the day and issues sleeping. In high school I started getting headaches and have had them since. I also feel tired but can't sleep, lightheaded, moody and sick to my stomach often. These are all common side effects with these types of medications but I was just happy to be able to focus in school. As the years have gone on these side effects have increased. The past few years I seem to be emotional, irritable, have anxiety, no energy or desire to go out and be with friends. I am usually very outgoing and love to be with people. The problem is I am now 25 and have been on concerta for about 13yrs and my option is to stop taking it and go though withdraw while Im trying to start a career or take it and continue to have these side effects. I have been on it since I was little and it terrifies me to have to teach myself to focus without help of a pill while trying to work everyday. There has been days where I haven't taken it and I'm a mess. I compare it to a hangover. I'm slap happy, confused, can't stay awake, and I could eat everything and not feel full. I feel at this point it is a no win situation but being that I'm a women I also have to think of my future. If I want to have children I will have to stop taking it. The truly sad part is I feel like I don't know who I am without this pill. I feel for all you parents out there because your children are the most important thing and how do you choose between a medicine that can do wonders for them academically and even socially but at the same time lead to so many side effects. Please email me bellasgray@gmail.com if you have any questions since I have 13yrs on it maybe I can be helpful.

I'm 18 and I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in kindergarden. The Concerta has worked very well for me. It takes away your appetite but when you're off the medication (at least for me since I have been on it for so long) it can lead to bad withdrawals. I get headaches, delusional, I EAT LIKE A PIG, mood swings, depression. I was off it for 3 months at one point and gained 8lbs! Other than that I would recommend it to anyone.

I am now top of my class in mathematics and 3rd in science thanks to high levels of concentration however I have experienced many side effects mainly stomach craps/irritated stomach, insomnia and speech problems. this drug has also started to loose its effect.

I've always been a night-owl, but now it seems that I can be dog-tired and do whatever I can to fall asleep and can't . Also, I have started losing a lot of hair and I take a multivitamin and Biotin daily so I know it isn't due to malnutrition. Also, this medication has stopped working for me and I am already on 72mg a day and I'm worried about increasing the dosage anymore because of the side effects and the high chance of ruining my dopamine receptors and having to be on it for the rest of my life. This medication did help my grades tremendously, but I've noticed it doesn't work as well when you don't get much sleep and since this causes some insomnia...it can contradict itself.

Honestly this medicine is amazing. I almost feel like a superhero because of the insane increase in focus and brain control. I'm 22 years old and was never able to focus like this. For now my A.D.D. is gone while on concerta. Have noticed a slight headache and sleeping is a little bit harder for me but I have always had moderate insomnia.

He lost 29 pounds in a year and for a 9 year old boy thats alot!! he had to have his gull bladder removed also at 9 and would not eat on his 10th birthday he weighed 52 pounds.  I would not recommend this drug to anyone.  he now is taking vyvanse and and is back up to 70 pounds and eats often and does not have anymore negative thoughts ( well unless i tell him its time to clean his room )

However, I became depressed, and the depression worsened as I continued to take concerta. I would experience suicidal thoughts, push my loved ones away, and start crying for no reason. If you're considering concerta, please watch out for symptoms of depression, because I can't bare to think what may have happened if I had continued taking it.

So far, Concerta has been active in its assistance of being a calming influence as well as a moderator of sorts for my psyche.  I continue to take 36mg daily and feel well on my way to rewiring my altered brain waves cycle.

Since I had high blood pressure to begin with, I don't think it was appropriate for my physician to put me on this medication. I am on four blood pressure medications now.

I noticed after the first month on it that I was very sad and moody all the time, and I am normally never like that. I started to feel that I was slipping into depression and I quit taking it. After about 2 weeks, I was back to my old self, but my ADHD symptoms were right back, too.

In retrospect, I am very disappointed that it took 10 years of teachers to agree she needed some type of help.  As my daugher consistently tested very highly, the teachers did not think there was an issue.Her ADD testing proved, indeed, a genius IQ, and the results warranted skipping a grade, from 10th, to 12th. As she was younger than her present classmates, skipping a grade was not an option.She started on Strattera, which was ineffective.  The Concerta, which began with 24 mg, increased to 36 within a few weeks, and she has now been taking 72 mg for about a year.The difference in her school perfomance, as related to completing assignments, and actually turning them in as required, has been absolutely amazing!  I so regret not trusting my own instincts and having her tested years ago... so many family difficult times could have been avoided!Aside from the increased focus, a positive for the med is she does not need to take it on the weekend.  She must, however, take it when she drives, no compromise.She is affected with a decreased appetite, but no other adverse side affects.I can tell within minutes of a conversation with her in the morning whether or not she has taken her med.  The change in her attitude, or lack thereof, is almost immediately noticeable.Downside is that the RX can not be re-filled automatically, but needs a new, hand-written RX every month.  Not sure how I am going to handle that problem when she begins college in August.

My son has also had mood swings while taking this anywhere from being whiny and crying over little things to being very disrespectful to anyone and everyone around him. He also suffers from asthma and takes albuterol and flovent for that and sometime I wonder if they counter-act eachother and make his ADHD medicine less affective.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	19-24	5/15/2011 1:41:58 PM	I've been taking ADD meds since the 4th grade (Ritalin, vyvanse, then Concerta). I am now a freshman in college. Even though I feel like Concerta is the least affective of the three, but I don't experience the side effects that caused me to change medications (stomach pains (Ritalin) or depression (Vyvanse). The side effects I had may not happen to someone else taken the same dosage and type of meds. It all depends on the person taking the meds. I'm doing well on Concerta and will continue useing it for my ADD because it helps me concentrate and keep on task and do my best.

He is 60 lbs and takes conerta 54mg. we are going to try Strattera 60mg. i hope it works he is getting good grades for now. we shall see.

He started when he was 6yrs and will be 11yrs in 2weeks. He was put on this medicine starting with 18mg. Over time he was gradually put on higher dose as his age and weight increased. He is now on 54mg. Since my son has been on this medicine he has developed seizures bc concerta lowers the threshold of seizures. He was diagnosed last year 2010. He has paranoia, fearfulness, psychosis, headaches, nervousness, aggression, mood swings, trouble going to sleep, and doesnt want to eat alot. He has had suicidal thoughts and depression. I had to put my son in a mental hospital bc of this and I just don't understand. His Psychiatrist said no one knows the risk of these drugs 5 to 10yrs down the road what it could or would do to your child.The dr wants to increase the concerta to 72 mgs or keep him on the 54mg and add Intuniv. I want to take him off the concerta and may just try the Intuniv. I feel that over the years he has been on this adhd medicine it has cause these issues. I fill my meds at CVS and everything that is on the patient information has occurred. I feel that I am doing the right thing by taking him off the concerta and trying just the Intuniv. Can someone relate to my story or have any suggestions for me??
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	JJkenny, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	4	Male	13-18	5/9/2011 12:03:11 AM	This medicine is very helpful. I used to never be able to focus, which caused me to do terribly in school. When i started Conserta it instantly helped me out. I have experienced many of the side effects but none where permanent with the medicine. When i started it I had appetite problems but it only lasted for a month. I lost about 10 pounds but put it back on shortly after getting my  appetite back. I also experienced a facial twitch, where my eye would twitch every once and a while. This did not last longer than 2-3 weeks. I also experienced high anxiety and anger from this medicine. On these days i some times get very mad at the littlest things and cant control my anger. Ill just be mad at everything. It doesn't happen to often to me but when it does i just try to relax. The side effects make the medicine seem like it is not good but to tell your the truth the side effects do not out weight the helpfulness of the drug. I like Conserta because it is time released and it lasts all day. I also like it because t really works and i can focus. I have been using it for 2 years now and I still use it because it really works.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Bill O., 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male	19-24	5/1/2011 5:17:53 PM	Okay I'm a college student and my attention span is terrible, so terrible as a matter of fact I should be doing homework right now instead of Reviewing Concerta. Upon first taking it I did notice a improvement, my focusing abilty was better and I was in a better mood. Soon after taking Concerta I noticed I felt paranoid and would have mildly delusional thoughts, such as thoughts of being killed, or that I was going to get pulled over every time I drove somewhere. I later learned this only happened if I took it 4 or more days in a row so I started taking it 3 days in a row, 2 days break, ect.. Now All concerta does is give me anxiety, make me depressed and paranoid. I'm an adult so I figured I'd try it, and just like adderall it doesn't help me, it makes things and life worse.Here is a note to all you parents: If I would have been forced to take this as a child, I think it would have messed me up when I was older. I do not think these meds are appropriate to give to children.Bottom line: What's more important, Grades and Behavior or your Child?

It worked well and I hardly ever felt out of foucous, but the drug took away my personality. My group of friends changed temporarily, my attitude was diffrent and I was just knocked out of it. This medication also gave me ticks. I had this one facial tick that made me constantly pull wy mouth into a smile( the conors of my mouth back)in a jerking motion.  It was noticlple and after a while became pain full.

She is a twin and was almost 20 pounds lighter and she's a good 2 inches shorter. Since we no longer felt it beneficial to inhibit her health to have her focus we've taken her off Concerta XR and are looking for something with positive results without causing her extreme weight loss and loss of appetite.

He has been on concerta since first grade. The first year it worked GREAT,he was taking 18mg and he had no side effects like loss of apitite, and he was himself but clamer and able to color a whole page and play board games with his little brother.  He also stoped chewing on his clothing and toys.  But now we needed to increse it to 27mg and even tried 36mg and it really doesn't seem to be helping him the same way. On top of it his appitite is starting to be effected and he's chewing on his clothes and toys again.  We are going to try adderall to see how it works.

At work I don't seemed to be getting overwhelmed and I can stay calm and focus without getting upset.At home I don't seem to get all bent out of shape if everything is not done . I can sit and relax and enjoy some time for me . Without thinking of all the things that should be done. I am so much more calmer! Little things don't get to me as much any more. I stopped running around in circles, instead of rushing around all the  time I just do what has to be done and put the other stuff on a list and get to it when the time is right! I still not perfect and I will never be, and that's ok. Is it ever    nice to be able to relaxe. P.S I never would have taken the time to fill this out, wouldn't have had the time? I'm starting to take computor lessons , one on  one . I'm  loving it,it is  great ! I'm asking questions and really being able to enjoy it . I'm 52 and I feel there is so much I can learn , and want to learn. Any way thats enough now! Have a great day!

After taking it a while I noticed I was paranoid about things, and lacked emotions at times. It got so bad that I became mildly delusional, and had mild schizophrenic like symptoms. I stopped a month ago and have never been happier. School Rough now, but I'm trying to tough it out.

I started on 18mg, I felt fine and my Dr. gave me the choice to take 18mg-54mg a day. I am now taking 54mg every day, I am now excelling in classes, I can pay attention and retain information so much better.. it's seriously changed my life. I do experience loss of appetite quite often, but I just remember to eat a good breakfast, and sometimes force myself to sit down and eat. It was difficult at first but I'm used to it now. I highly recommend at least trying this medication if you haven't already, but I do know that these type of medications effect people differently. I guess I got lucky :) good luck!

I am an adult with adhd and for about the last year I have noticed that I get arthritic pains and symptoms of inflammation in my body.  I cant sleep at night and I feel depressed.  18mg as opposed to the 36mg stops some of these symptoms but although I can concentrate and have a clean house, these symptoms including a new diagnosis of high blood pressure just aren't worth it anymore.

Its worked wonders, I used to be annoying, get in trouble, etc. Now I'm getting good grades, have good focus, etc.The first week I took Concerta my appetite seriously decreased. The first day I took it my dad bought me a double cheeseburger from McDonald's and I could only eat a few bites. The loss of appetite is normal for the first few weeks, and you should see that after a year you will have lost weight(5-10 lbs max, which is a lot for a growing child). After that, growth should continue as normal.A down side of this medicine is that it causes irritability. Often at school I get irritated easily by things that wouldn't irritate most people, and most of the time it's just random.Another down side for me is the days I don't have Concerta. I feel completely lost and feel absolutely horrible, I find it hard to control my appetite and control my actions and words.

He was having the worst school experience before starting the medicine(got in trouble alot, couldn't concentrate, other kids were annoyed by him.) Now in second grade, he excels in math, is average in reading, has friends &amp; doesn't get in trouble. He does have a decreased appetite, but we monitor his weight closely. My only concern is he is having stomach pains more often. It used to be about once a month &amp; now it is a couple of times a week. The doctor did decrease his dosage from 27mg to 18mg hoping that will help. I am happy with how this medicine has helped him academically &amp; socially but I will find alternative solutions if it starts to effect his health.

I hope that my child benefits from this.

He took the medicine for about 6 years before being changed to another medication having reached a plateau on Concerta.  What we didn't find out until tis past year is that about a year after beginning Concerta he began having auditory hallucinations; voices telling him to harm himself and/or others.  He was too afraid to tell anyone.  An incident occured where this came to light for us and he had to be hospitalized.  If you read the package insert that comes from the pharmacy, auditory hallucinations are listed as a side effect.  That information was obviously not available when he was on the med.  Parents and prescribers need to closely monitor a child on any psychoactive medication and educate themselves about the signs and symptoms of this possible side effect.

Day 6 now, and I've noticed that I have overall, more concentration, drive, and a decreased need to smoke. Completing tasks are not as difficult. I still have the feeling that the results still have room for improvement, although I am reluctant to increase the dosage because of the possibility of the side-effects increasing also.  Additionally, I've noticed being less emotional and maybe a little detached from my environment. I'm still observing latter to determine if it is enough to be adverse to my well-being. As side effects go, I am experiencing hyper-active bowels, diarrhea, mild headaches, occasional teeth clenching, very minor changes in my far-sight, and mild insomnia. I do realized that I need to give some time for the side-effects to diminish. I am willing to give Concerta some time, but if the side-effects continue, or do not greatly improve, I am going to my doctor for a Rx change. My overall experience is acceptable for me so far, simply because I anticipated some issues with the initial use of Concerta. I will not find it acceptable if the side-effects continue on, however. I hope this helps!

I'm 19 now. I was originally on Ritalin and then put on Concerta when the FDA approved it. There was a huge improvement with my behavior and grades. My impulsiveness also ceased. Concerta (54mg) has always made me feel more emotionless and spaced-out. It felt like the only part of my body present was my brain, which absorbed information nonstop. Over the last year, I started to show signs of anxiety. I come back from college classes, go in my room, and cry for no reason. I'm tired all the time and have no motivation. I don't feel as emotionally attached to anyone and I'm no longer passionate about things I used to love. I feel as though I am existing, rather than living. While I originally had success with Concerta throughout my elementary and secondary education, school has become more difficult because of the new side-effects. My doctor gave me the okay to finally try Adderall. I'm absolutely petrified to try a new medication, but I'm hoping it will relieve my anxiety and give me back the energy I used to have to get things done. Concerta may work for you or your child, but pay attention to how they feel. While education is important in adolescence, emotional development is something you can never get back.

A Zombie at school (but focused) as well as at home. There was also increased irritability and lack of emotions. She stated that she 'did not feel right' on Concerta. Withdrawl after stopping Concerta as bad as the side effects while taking them. She is now on natural dietary supplements as well as doing 'Play Attention'. I finally have my child back!! She will not be ever drugged by Concerta again! Of course the teacher is not happy that I took her off the 'quick fix pill' but my childs overall health and wellbeing is my foremost concern. Grades and performance at school are important but priority is her health. After reading up diligently on Concerta with its side effects and unknown long term effects I am in shock that these meds are prescribed on a daily basis to our children!!

This was the hardest decision for me.  I felt I was drugging my kid.  However, I am so glad I did it.  Yes, the C's have turned to A and B's however this is not why I did it.  His self esteem has skyrocketed.  Every night isn't spent crying over school, begging to take the grade over again and making up fake ailments to get out of going to school.  He was below state average in reading and is now in accelerated.  He could read anything but close the book and not have any clue what he read.  Now he actually enjoys reading.  He did tell me I should go to the dr and tell him the medicine didn't work because &quot;he still doesn't like school&quot;.  Having a 9 year old that doesn't like school isn't out of the norm.  He did lose some weight and seems to be overly thirsty.  He only takes it on school days; he doesn't take on weekends or summer.  I like that he doesn't have to be on it all the time.

The first time was when she was 6 yrs. She took it for over 1 1/2 yrs. She lost all bladder control during the day. The doctors didn't believe that the meds was the problem, until they did physical exams and other tests. The results was that the concerta was the problem. They changed her meds and problem gone. She is 13 yrs old now and they wanted to try it again. She has been on it for a month now and is starting to have the same problem. Her grades are better in school but what 13 yr old wants to live with bladder problems. I have had a few friends that there children have had the same problems.

It did not work what so ever.  It would last till about 12, and then it would wear off.  My doctor changed my prescription to the extended release tablets, which last well past 9 at night.  I would then take a pill to make me sleep.  It also made me lose my appetite.  I had always been on the skinny side, but when I lost my appetite, my weight just spiraled downwards.  When I was 11, I weighed 70 lbs, and I was almost five feet tall.  After a few years off my Concerta, I am making a rebound with my weight, and I am doing well in school.

He takes it before school every morning and 9 times out of 10 his behavior is in the 'green' when he is on the meds. If I forget to give it to him he is usually in the 'red' meaning he has gotten in some trouble. The only downside I have seen so far is he has had a couple of emotional outbursts, but thankfully it hasn't occured often

I am on 108mg of Concerta in the morning and I still have a large if not boosted appetite. I have never really experienced any side effects except for if I missed a dose and then took it around 10am-2pm instead of 6-8am, which was trouble sleeping.

While using Concerta about 7 years ago, he experienced a bald spot to his scalp about he size of a quarter. At the time, the consumer info from the manufacturer listed possible hair loss as a side effect. My Dr. refused to consider the cause was the drug and suggested my son was pulling out his hair. That was not the case. Upon stopping this drug, his hair grew back. He was quite embarrased at the time of the hair loss.  I see that the manufacturer is now stating that this drug does not cause hair loss...they are lying...it does to some people. The drug also did caused lack of appetite and trouble sleeping. &quot;Listen to your child&quot; when they tell you the drug has negative effects.

This did the trick!  Concerta helps me quite a bit with attention, motivation, and socialization, (I used to avoid interpersonal contact, even with friends,) but it's wearing off too early.  I have a miserable &quot;come-down&quot; after only about 5 hours, which makes me want to take more, but of course, that would keep me up all night.  After reading comments from others, I think I will speak to my psychiatrist about a short acting, small dose for evening.  I highly recommend you don't let anyone other than a very reputable, knowledgeable psychiatrist diagnose you and proscribe this medication.  It can work great but you need to be monitored for effectiveness, blood pressure, mood swings, etc.  My doc actually checks in with my hubby (with my permission) to see how I'm reacting to the med, since a patient often can't accurately self-report.  Find a good psychiatrist &amp; you'll be fine.

The rest of the time had no effectiveness at all. Started on 18mg went to 56mg a day no effect at all except the anger got worse. Destroyed my microwave because the thing kept beeping and I could not turn it off so I kept slamming the door of it till sparks flew out. Another example I could not locate my key on a messy counter top. I started sweating profusely and I could feel myself getting angrier and angrier till I exploded and just threw everything on the counter against the wall. I stopped taking the med and as the days past I became less aggressive after 5 days I did not have these explosive episodes anymore.

The lessened appetite is a struggle but he more than makes up for it when his 36mg dose wears off around 5pm. The only drawback is a rebound effect he gets where all his energy for the day surges thru and he gets an intense hyperactivity with sensitivity (mood) he takes catapres to help with this. Which also makes sleep very easy for him. He has gone from being disruptive and having no focus (or friends) to being top of his class and a kind and helpful student. ( and very popular)This has been a miracle for my family and i would highly recommend this to anyone accurately diagnosed with adhd.all 3 of my children are adhd and i would say this drug has less side affects in my experience to dex anphetimine (my 20yr old daughter takes this).In my experience everyone is different in how they present adhd and the meds they respond to. Trial and adjustment is well worth the end results when you find the right medication.

Unlike other meds I had tried, this one didn't affect my moods or cause my heart to race. It did make me extremely drowsy when I first started taking it, but that went away after a week or so. I am no longer &quot;scatterbrained&quot; and with help from the Concerta I have been able to retrain myself to be on task and more focused on things I struggled with before. My relationship with my husband has even improved. This isn't a cure-all, no drug is, and you have to incorporate behavior modification and &quot;retrain&quot; yourself to behave differently. The medication alone won't fix all your problems, but it will help you get there!

He was recently diagnosed with ADHD. Since he started taking Concerta, he's been much more cooperative and helpful, pays attention to detail, follows directions without protesting and arguing, and loving. It's like the little boy who I lost somewhere along the way has found his way back out again. He hasn't been on this medication for long and I'm keeping a close eye on him. I am reading about possible adverse effects down the road and hope that he doesn't experience them.

From the first pill we saw a huge improvement over school work, listening, the ability to follow 2-3 step instructions.  My son is now 11 and there are a few things that are begining to appear that could be side effects of the drug.  Constipation and bowel irregularities for the past 4 years.  Over all I am satified with the drug and for the past several months I have been weaning my son off of the drug.

There are some side effects such as loss of hunger that I have recently stopped experiencing. I take 135mg of concerta and am finishing ninth grade. Some of the side effects I still have would be a lack of emotion, increased heart rate, and a cold personality. The increased heart rate is a thing to be concerned about if you are taking a higher dose(be careful what you do and just be aware of this). I recently went to a cardiologist for an Electrocardiogram and my heart was healthy and normal. Though during more intense workouts it gets to around 210-220 which I try to monitor to prevent this. Normally it is at 110, 20bpm above normal. But the effects it has had, I am getting better grade, I am in all honors, I am a much more intelligent person that I thought I was.Some helpful tips I have-try to limit the times you need to increase your dose-Monitor your heart rate-Eat when you don't want to because you are hungry you just don't feel it-Never take anything above your dose or if you must then make try to use a different drug, I recommend Focalian(Probably incorrectly spelled)-Monitor your supply of pills to make sure you don't run out(had this happen once or twice it was not fun)-Take you pills as soon as you wake up they last about 12-15 hours and you will not be able to get to sleep easily when you are on themI hoped this has helped you.

He began taking Concerta 18mg, which helped his behavior tremendously but eventually needed to be increased because his atttention span began returning to almost nothing. He took 27mg for the duration of first grade, which went extremely well as far as concentration and impulse control and was just increased to 36mg yesterday. Im hoping that it works as well as the 18mg and 27mg did without putting him into a vegeative state!

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	5/9/2010 10:47:54 PM	My doctor proscribed 5mg on concerta for my ADHD and there were 60 pills. Prescribed 2 each day. then i told him that they did nothing to help with my disorder then i was prescribed 10mg, taking two each day. Still was no working for me. after i just got tired and took myself off of them and as I did, I became angry and depressed. I was so depressed, I started to cut myself on my left arm with a razor blade. I was still angry and depressed. My friends and I would talk about happy things that had happened in their lives or would be wishing for things, and one moment I would would smile and laugh, but then at another moment I would be so sad and I sit and try to figure out why I am like this. Thinking of many reesons. I have thoughts of suicide everyday that I wake up, feeling like this isn't right. My thoughts are all confused. Alot of times when people are speaking to me, I'd tune them out with music in my head or just leave and act as though i didn't hear anyone speaking. things that I don't like hearing like people dying in the world, put downs  from my family, friends, and even from strangers. My best friend considers me one of the most nicest people in the world because I tend to everyone elses needs and feelings but my own. I consider myself a female that feels ugly because thats what my own mother told me. Also by never ever telling me that she loved me...ever. I'm just so sad and in my mind I'm thinking to myself, &quot;you need to got to your doctor and get your medication.&quot;In my spirit is telling me that I need a therapist because a ton of bad things happened in your life that you just need to talk about even though I hate and don't ever feel like talking at all because of the simple fact that NO ONE understands me or what I'm going through. this life is tough.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	5/8/2010 12:03:11 PM	i was diagnosed with ADHD at 7 years of age. i've been prescribed all kinds of long-acting stimulant meds for ADHD and none of them were as nearly as effective as Concerta was. i take 54 milligrams of Concerta 6 days a week. i'm able to fully focus on the task at hand, and remain completely goal-oriented throughout its duration. i'm the studious, hard-working student i know i am with the help of Concerta. i'm 17 years old and have been taking the drug for about 7 years now. the symptoms can suck sometimes, but you work through them the longer you are on them. i had trouble with the weightloss when i was first on the drug. i was an 89 lbs 11 year old. not exactly healthy, but i learned that i had to make myself eat even though i had absolutely no desire to eat during the middle of the day. that's probably, for me at least, one of the worst symptoms for me, still. the problem is, during the lunchtime hour, you FEEL hungry, your stomach is growling and such, but you do not want to eat. you know you should, but you cannot put the food in your mouth. that's something i hate (because i love food) but you have to make yourself eat. the other symptom i dislike, is somedays, when the drug wears off (around 6 or 7ish) you feel completely antisocial, and just want to do nothing and talk to no one. but that's me. all in all, i've had a great experience with this drug and will continue to use it as necessary.

I began taking Concerta in addition to the Paxil and Klonopin which I had been on for about five years. I felt more focused, able to concentrate, and calmer within a few days. I started at 18 mg 3 weeks ago and now take 54 mg. With each dose increase I felt even more calm. I previously had high BP and a fast heart rate that I always believed was due to anxiety. Both my BP and heart rate have decreased since I started on Concerta. I am not jittery at all, have no stomach upset, no loss of appetite, and I actually sleep better, fall asleep faster and only wake up once during the night. I would have predicted that if I took a stimulant drug, I'd be bouncing off the walls! How wrong I was! I never would have thought it would calm me down, but that's what it does. My dr says it's a &quot;paradoxical&quot; reaction. My depression has improved--I now have hope that my life will get better now that I don't feel like I'm living in a fog all of the time. My memory has improved. Before, I couldn't remember simple instructions 30 seconds after they were give to me. I realized I had self-medicated with Sudafed and had been on the antidepressant Pamelor for a few years, but I had cardiac side effects and was taken off of it. I didn't realize that it was helping to treat my ADD symptoms at the time. I feel much better on Concerta--my only complaint is that I can feel it wear off 12 hours after I take it and I feel mad at the world at 5 PM! To counteract that my dr prescribed 10 mg Ritalin to help me from 5 PM to bedtime, so I can have some kind of life after work. I feel more motivated and have more physical energy than I've had in a long time.

It definitely helped me stay focused, but with major drawbacks.  While I was on it I was severely depressed and didn't feel in any way like myself.  I didn't realize it for a long time, but the medication was making me insanely anxious and left me in a constant emotional fog.  I took myself off of it cold-turkey which was also a big mistake, because for about three or four weeks I was experiencing withdrawals.  I was having anxiety attacks during this period, and felt like I was going crazy.  It has been four months since I have been off of Concerta and I feel so much better.  I feel like my old self again.  While i appreciated the couple of pounds i lost, and the focus boost, it wasn't worth it in the end.  These drugs aren't taken as seriously as they need to be, because they can have a major impact on your personality.

I'm 19 now &amp; I've been on it for about 5 years &amp; it is by far the best. My loss of appetite &amp; upset stomach are way less intense than with Adderall &amp; it Concerta is the only one that I haven't seemed to grow a tolerance to. But, as with all of these meds, it still causes some anxiety, dry mouth, puts me in a cracked-out zombie-state &amp; keeps me up at night if I take it too late in the morning (but I have a set schedule for it now, &amp; I have no problems sleeping). It also makes my heart beat irregularly. I've taken it late one day &amp; early the next &amp; it felt like i was having a heart attack.  But all of these side effects seem to vary for everyone, &amp; once you get on it, you'll know for sure whether or not you have ADD/ADHD; if you don't have it, you'll be spazzed out &amp; talkative &amp; you probably won't sleep for awhile. Still, it's not right for everyone but I can't be in school/working/driving without it.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Grace, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	3/10/2010 6:59:46 PM	I'm a 51 yr old female, who recently was placed on 18 mg Concerta due to lack of concentration, not completing task and being very unorganized.  In the past I have experienced depression and tried multiple antidepressants, which only made me very tired &amp; was still having same issues as above.  The first few weeks of Conerta, this seemed to be a great drug; e.g. happy, energy, speaking out &amp; completing task, now I feel depressed, irratable, and overwhelmed with all the task I have &amp; not completing them based on organization.  Concerta is making me very nervous and anxious when I first take it.  One of my children indicated I seem somewhere else at times; this is usually when I'm coming off of it and I need to chill.  I'm not sure if uping the dose is the answer and/or adding an antidepressant to it.  Maybe I should wean myself off and think about the possibility of being Bi-Polar since I have highs &amp; lows???  I'm a little tired of trying to find the right mix to feel like a normal person.

My daughters teacher says she see a hugh improvement in her ability to stay focused. One concern I have is when the medicine is wearing off she becomes very irratable, and tired this seems to last for 30 to 45 minutes and her pupils are very dilated. Another concern is she does not have a large appatite during the day, but at night once it leaves her system she is very hungry, I guess this is okay as she is very thin anyway due to being very active with gymnastics &amp; cheer, and golf, but I just don't think it is a healthy way of eating. I do notice some irratablilty during the day on the weekends but i believe it is again because her appatite is surpressed, but her body needs the nutrients. So far we are mostly pleased with the Concerta, but will talk with the Doctor tomorrow to see what we can do about the irratablilty.

At the age of 4 he left his daycare, by himself, and was picked up by the police walking home. At 5 he could not look anyone in the eye and was failing kindergarden. We reluctently started Concerta (18 mg), and the change was almost instant. He is now an A student, and we are able to have calm and quiet time. The medicine has not altered his personality in any way. He is still the same happy, curious, inquisitive and playful child. But now he can finish what he starts with confidence and pride, and he is ahead of his peers in many of his school subjects. We have not had a single negative side effect.

I felt an enormous amount of guilt but I knew he was so frusterated with himself for not being able to do well in school. He started doing better right away so that confirmed to me that he really needed it but after about 3 months we've had to increase him from 18mg to 27mg because it was not working as well anymore. Hard to get him to go to sleep and acts pretty defiant as the medication is wearing off but I guess its a trade off. Have not noticed any other side effects except maybe decrease in appetite but I just keep forcing him to eat, eat, eat so he continues to grow properly. I pray there will be no negative consequences later from taking this medication.

When he started the second grade and was still falling behind I had finally decided it wasn't an age related issue and maybe we needed to do more to try to help him. We were given a survey/questionair from his Dr.'s office for myself and his teacher to fill out. Once completed his pediatrician decided it would be best to start him on Concerta in November of 2009. It worked great, still a lil slower in math but was catching on, until about 3 weeks ago when we started noticing head twitching in a no motion. We are not sure if it is from the medicine or if he might possibly have tourettes syndrome. We are going to be trying him on a new ADHD medicine called Intuniv and i am also requesting a referral to a neurologist. I would recommend anyone that has the tik problem to at least research Tourettes and see if any of the other symptoms might be seen in yourself or child. I was so scared I caused his tik's by puting him on the medication but now I realize there might be an underlying cause to his attention problems, tik's and throat clearing. I had never wanted to put my child on medication to begin with, I personally believe ADHD is the most over diagnosed illness there is. The concerta helped but I am worried about the other signs he is showing now, If anyone has any insight please help me. I am dying of guilt and hoping I have not made the wrong decisions in my son's well being.

Since I have started taking this medication my overall attitude, behavior, and focus has improved drastically. Also my GPA went from a 2.83 to a 3.68.

I experience dizziness, drowsiness, blurred vision, light-headedness, irritability, and loss of appetite.  But I have only been taking it for 1 month, so I am hoping these side effects will subside.  If not, I plan to discontinue usage.

Tonight really scared me and I realized I had to find an answer.  My son has been taking Concerta ER 36mg tablets.  Tonight, out of the blue, he began sobbing uncontrollably.  We were on our way home, and had been in the car for a few hours.  He was crying so hard that we had to pull over so I could sit in the backseat with him.  When I asked him what was wrong, he said he didn't know.  I calmed him down, and he seemed like his &quot;old self&quot; again. Again, out of knowhere, he starts sobbing again.  This time I couldn't calm him down.  I told him, &quot;You need to calm down honey.&quot;, and he told me that he couldn't.Needless to say, this really scared me.  Last week, he had a headache two days in a row. After brainstorming with a friend of mine a little while ago, we realized that we should look to see if depression is a side effect.  THANK YOU...Reviewer: Sara G., 35-44 Female on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver)!  When I saw your post, I was so relieved.  I have decided as of tonight, that he will be taken off the medication.

I don't have hyperactivity, but my focus had been off for so long and all through high school. I didn't know what the problem was till I considered I had ADD. I wanted to make sure I wasn't making a copout or being irrational, but I knew something was wrong and it seemed others didn't believe me so much. As years passed, my focus and grades got worse. I was getting more and more overwhelmed by work. I started out with 20mg Ritalin and the change was dramatic after a while, but my complaint was the short duration. I was so thrilled to have the ability to focus and read more easily, however, and lack being overwhelmed. What made me more overjoyed was to find this site and see that my symptoms were legitimate and that I haven't been quite the fool all these years that I thought I was. It's been a blessing and I've never been ashamed to say I've needed this help. With the gift it gives, it's hard for me to be ashamed of that. I'm thankful for taking this and not wanting to sleep instead of read just because it's easier. My grades have gotten higher and I now pay attention to things people say instead of having narrow listening. My doctor said this was the safest of all the ADD medications. So I recommend giving this one a shot- especially because of the slow release. I've only just begun trying Concerta, but it's been good thus far and I think it's the medicine I've been needing all along.

I am 25 years old and I just want to cry when I think that Concerta or any other form of ADD treatment was available to me. I went through school feeling like an idiot. I would randomly make A's although it was almost impossible for me to do my work and hand it in on time. I have been taking Concerta for 2 month intervals for 2 years now and after dropping out of 3 universities and quitting countless jobs, I have finally gotten myself together. I currently have a 9 to 5 job AND I'm getting my degree through correspondence. When someone is undiagnosed, they feel depressed, unmotivated, and they have low self confidence. I suggest it for anyone who has the symptoms, of course after a Psychiatrist's evaluation.

Helped me to concentrate better on tasks and not get destracted or ramble on. I noticed I got a lot quiter and became more focused on tasks. My body adjusted quickly to the medication and it lost some effectiveness. Now on 27mg and if I dont not have a lot of physical activity during the day I have trouble sleeping at night. I have not had any problem with appitite, the loss of sleep sometimes stinks, but it has done wonders that the side effects are worth the benifit.

I have tried Aderal, and Focalin.  He has had no side effects from Concerta.  I would recommend this medicine if you have a child that is ADHD.  I also have a 7 year old that has just started this medicine.  He told me the first day he went to school after taking that he completed his work, and paid attention to his teacher.  He also stated that his teacher did not yell at him today.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Tyler, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	19-24	11/18/2009 2:01:42 PM	My first ADHD drug prescribed was Adderall XR (30mg) quite some time ago, and I said at a doctor's appointment that I got somewhat more nervous on the Adderall. This in turn would cause me to smoke A LOT more than I normally do. He switched me over to Concerta (54mg). I remember when I took it that first morning. I went to class, but something was not right. I mean, I did some work, but the benefits were not anything close to the Adderall XR. I took it for a few more days and I just did not like it. I felt &quot;out of touch&quot; with the world, not psychotic or anything. I felt like a zombie, I wouldn't eat, I wouldn't talk, and I just was not doing to well. I called my doctor and said that I wasn't taking any more of it because of the &quot;zombie&quot; effects. When I went back he switched me to Dexedrine Spansules (2x15mg caps). The Dexedrine is way better than the Concerta, and just a notch better than the Adderall because I don't smoke nearly as much due to the nervousness. Concerta works wonders for some, but it didn't do anything good for me.

I'm still in trial and error stage of finding a medication to control my ADD but this did nothing.  I was switched from Strattera (which was working) to Concerta which does nothing for me.  Not sure if my dr gets some kind of money benefits for us activating those little free month trial cards, but there was no point for me to do it since I have TriCare.  Now I've wasted a month of my life in new job training that I got nothing out of because this didn't work.  Lets hope next month is better.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	ADH...Shiny, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/5/2009 1:08:37 AM	I have been on this medicine for about 7 years now. I have tried all the other meds including but not limited to Adderall and Ritalin. They both gave me depression at a young age and I would not each lunch. Concerta would wear off sometime because of a faster metabolism but that was changed by adding a second dose in the afternoon for studies and school. It is a wonderful medicine that I would reccomend to my own brother if need arises.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	etrvn1326, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	11/4/2009 1:25:00 PM	I currently take the 54mg of concerta along with 300mg of wellbutrin xl. My doctor started me on this dosage but i thought it was to strong for me so he lowered my dosage to 36mg, and I noticed it was helping me some but not fully. I just had realized i was taking to much water with it at 54mg. I have been taking both medicines for about 3 years now. I take the other to help with my chemical imbalance of depression. I take both of them 5 mins apart from each other with exactly 1 glass of water for each. I take my wellbutrin first then my concerta 5 mins later. So far for me I have noticed good results in effectiveness for my adhd. I have been able to really focus and concrete on things without getting easily distracted on something. Its slows me down alot to help with my impulsive reactions on either speaking or doing something. The medicine does  what its suppose to do as long you stick to a strict schedule on taking your dosage at the same time every day and get a full 8 hours of sleep every night. If not doing so it will not be effective for you. This is coming from first hand experience. Because pretty much it will act as a strong caffeine pill for like 20 hours, plus make you depressed and irritable after 4 hours from taking it. Some of the side effects, other then the daily or weekly loss of appetite or feeling nauseating while eating, that i have encountered thru my time of taking it is from time to time i will have mild fever that last for a few hours and feel a little down. The only thing i really dont like about taking these meds together is that it makes me a very serious person when I am on them or when i am socializing it makes me be boring and not very fun or outgoing. One thing that i have noticed about taking the medicine for my personal benefit, is if I don't get started on my day shortly after i take my meds. I will basically be a lazy bum for the rest of the day. So family members and friends make sure you give them physical supporttobeproductive.

You could also use pudding, or something that doesn't have to be chewed up.  Works like a charm!! Might work better if you don't tell him the pill is in there, just tell him to swallow the applesauce?!

We had to immediately take him off it and he just started Strattera. I saw the eye tic but I thought the other stuff was just part of his wiggling that he always had. I feel so awful as a parent that I didn't know these were tics and he might have them for a long time. He started the Strattera on Friday and when I came home, there was already a call from the teacher about my son's behavior so it's going to be a long hard road since it takes 4-6 weeks to get the Strattera working and there is only a 50/50 chance it will work. To all parents using concerta, it is a wonderful drug, but watch for the tics. A psychiatrist notices them immediately, even before a parent might be able to tell. My son's appetite has been like a pig for the last 24 hours as well. OMG and it's hell dealing with him too. 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Concerta Fanatic!, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	9/25/2009 11:37:31 PM	My son is 12 and was getting kicked out of school at least thress times a month for behavior and outburst while others were trying to listen or study. He is an extremely bright child for his age and has alway gotten along better with adult than with children his own age. Though he is bright, he has always been a talker and hyper from day one. As he had gotten older, then tolerance for his desire to speak out (at will) and share amazing facts in mid class were no longer cute (but annoying). We did a Concerta study and &quot;OMG!&quot;. He became this whole new little man in a boy's body. Calm, patient, attentive, the whole 9. Unfortunately, after the study was over, I found out that the ins. didn&quot;t cover the Concerta. The dr. had put him on Vyvanse, which didn't work at all and he started to develope female breast and became depressed and lathargic. Now we are on Adderall, but nothing worked like Concerta. The dr. is trying to work out something with the ins. company for us so that he can get back on it. It was the best med for him and he loved it too!

Initially, I had headaches, some dizziness, decreased appetite and a dry mouth.  I waited out the side effects and by 3 weeks time, they were ALL totally gone except for the decreased appetite.  I eat several small meals a day to combat my lack of appetite.  I find that my bouncing thoughts are gone and I am able to organize my work and projects and carry them out in a methodical fashion.  I'm thrilled with the results!

I do much better on a non-stimulant

At first I was on too low a dosage and it didn't help enough but when the dosage was uped when i was eleven it worked wonders for me. how ever since i entered high school at the age of fourteen I began to have small side effects which have only gotten progressively worse. In my freshman year I began to notice that I could go three days without eating more than a small meal a day if that and not notice. In my sophomore year I noticed that I felt run down and shut off, as if nothing was really worth the breath to say. My Junior year I experience heart palpitations and an emotion near anxiety when I did not have something to devote my attention to entirely. Now in my Senior year of High school I am more prone to headaches on the meds, I constantly need something to stimulate my brain to feel in any way happy and when I leave a structured environment that causes me to use a high level of concentration like school or work I become extremely irritable and angry towards anyone and everyone I come into contact with. Nothing can make me happy until the drugs wear off or i find something that requires my full attention. None of these symptoms occured while off my medication. (I am rarely irritable and usually a very happy outgoing person.)

I was a poor student-due to the fact that I did not like school. Regardless, my parents put me on Ritalin, 45mg 3x daily. I got through high school (somehow) but had developed interests in other illegal substances while on Ritalin. I believe it is a gateway drug. I had a lot of headaches and intense menstrual cramps.(By the way, Ritalin and Concerta are the same thing -- methylphenidate).Now, at 30, I am taking Concerta, 36mg to 54mg daily. I do not take it on my days off from work because I do not need it. Now my side effects are: jitters, chest pain, confusion, feeling disoriented, jaw pain, headaches, nausea, heart palpitations, no sexual desires, dizziness, and a few more. I would NOT recommend this drug for ANYONE under the age of 14 (high school aged). This is a dangerous drug comparable to cocaine that can have serious side effects. Please think twice before giving this to your children.

I went in to the doctor for depression meds and explained what was going on and I then felt that alot was cause I could not focus on anything. I know I have not had alot of time on the med but the ability to concontrate and think is great even when I typicaly would start to stress out. The only side effect that I feel is diffrent is I feel hyper but undercontrol. I have been told that &quot;you seem to be getting sleep and thinking clearly&quot; .. I have not told a person other then my wife.

Her doctor has decided to take her off of it due to her weight problems and put her on Focalin....hope it works!!

I do drink a lot of water with this medication.  I have no trouble falling asleep and staying asleep for a solid 8-9 hrs just as before the medicine.  My appetite hasn't changed.  I've found it interesting that some children are on a higher dose than i am, i am 29 years old, male, and weigh 190 lbs.

About 2-3 years later, my doctor recommended I try Concerta. I have been taking it ever since and am very happy with the results. However, recently I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism and discovered I had a large uterine fibroid. In addition, in he past two years my blood pressure has increased along with eye pressure and blurred vision. I don't know if there is a connection between taking Concerta (57mg)for nearly a decade and these other recent medical developments but I am a little concerned and wondering if I should suggest the dosage be reduced or stop taking it altogether.

He started in 3rd grade and is now in 8th. We have juggled other medications and concerta has the most effective academic affect over Focalin, Daytrona, or Adderrall. The reason we've been trying other medications over the years is because the effectiveness seems to wear off or the patient develops an immunity. Giving concerta to my son only 5 days in the week has helped somewhat with that. Also it seems to wear off by 2:00 which isn't helpful for homework. Side effects include easy to cry, no appetite, and headaches. The doctor suggested he take 10mg. methylphenidate for homework time at 4:00 but then he is not hungry for dinner. He can't afford to loose any more weight so I only give this when absolutely necessary.I wish there was a safe pill to kick in the appetite.All in all the academic gains have outweighed the side effects.

He was coming home from school in trouble almost the whole school year, he would bring bad grades on papers. (some werent even finished). He has always been hyper and never listened. He had a hard time focusing. He started out on the lowest and i only noticed small changes so now he is on 36mg and it is wonderful he goes to school and concentrates, doesnt get in trouble, doesnt disrupt the class, blurt out answers, and improvement on grades. I didnt want to start him on medicine but decided to give it a try and i am so happy i did. He has lost his appetite, it isnt severe lost only a couple pounds. Other than that no other side effects.

Loved the 12 hour thing until I reached high school; so many hours in a day. When taking these drugs can intensify depression or anxiety. Any parent with a child taking any type of these meds NEED TO WATCH FOR severe depression or anxiety because it might not just be the medicine.

I wouldn't even think to try another adhd med because this one works so well for me.. It may not work for everyone because different adhd meds(like adderall) work on different parts of the brain.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	6/3/2009 10:04:37 PM	I am a 28 year old female single mother of a seven year old boy.  I was recently(finally)diagnosed with adhd. Up untill now I had thought it was just a character flaw.  I started on concerta 18 mg 3 weeks ago. The first week I noticed no change, but the second week the dr increased my dose to 36 mg, and i have noticed a difference.  My temper is not so short.  I have been able to control my reactions to situations that ordinarily i would just flip out over.  My son has been behaving better and is happier as a result because im not constantly yelling at him for everything.  I have also noticed that i am not as restless as usual.  I have had no improvement, however, in my distractability, constant daydreaming, or jumping form idea to idea or task to task.  I also havent noticed an improvement in my forgetfulness, lateness, or motivation.  On the positive side(in addition to my improved temper/impulse control, and restlessness) I have experienced absolutely no side effects which is great because I had read a lot about them and was very concerned.  I feel exactly like myself only a little less of a spaz.  I am hoping that an increase in my dosage will help with my other symptoms without bringing on any unwanted side effects. I will keep you all posted.  I have not tried any other adhd meds as my dr recomended i start with Concerta because it is the safest, so I have no comparisons to offer.

I no longer interrupt others, jump from one task to another, or become as easily distracted. I also have a great deal more stamina and energy.However, here are the pitfalls with this medication.  First, I take a very high dose, and I have to take it twice a day. The Ritalin in the Concerta burns out after about 4 hours.  This isn't much different than the traditional Ritalin.I get a big hit with the &quot;Ritalin crash&quot; such as nausea, headaches, and a draining feeling in my head.  I get similar feelings on the ramp back up.Also, I am constipated a lot, and I have very little to no appetite.  For some, this may be a good thing for losing weight, but for me I am already at a comfortable weight.I also have high blood pressure.  Although, the Concerta may not be the cause of it.I like this drug because it does work and it works well, and all in all I tolerate the side effects.Regardless, my doctor is trying me on another stimulant for me to see if I can get away from the four hour burn out.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	6/2/2009 1:02:41 AM	I have been taking Concerta since December. I really didn't notice a difference until I got up to 72mg. I saw a huge change right away and an increase in my job performance. For the first time I had patience with my family! I even read a magazine for the first time (not just looking at the pictures). Recently though I feel it's not working as well. I have gone back to drinking TONS of caffeine even while taking the 72mg. I still feel like I could crash. I don't know if I am not getting enough sleep, need to take some time off, or need to try something new. I am starting to get &quot;short&quot; again and lose focus at work. Some days now I don't know if I even took it or not! All in all, it really made a positive impact on my life personally and professionally. I would recommend it. I think my personal situation warrants a change as my tolerance was built up very quickly. Other than that, only appetite loss (which for me was okay!).

It works great, though he's at the point where it doesn't last the full 12 hours, maybe 11.  He has difficulty sleeping at night and his appetite returns in the evenings and eats us out of house and home until bedtime.  The med. does the job for focus, controlling impulses and his grades are good, though around much stimuli his hyperactivity returns.  We like the med and are wanting to change just b/c of sleep and eating patterns, though are scared of the others out there; my daughter had a rough go with many of the meds to help with her ADHD through school years.  The trial and error of these meds for ADHD is scary, but you have to try for your child but be intelligent to know when to keep trying out the med or change all together.  I wish all those out there much luck.

His teacher says that he is doing better in school, but mornings and afternoons are pure hell.  Its like his ADHD is ten-fold.  The medicine just wears off way too soon.  He takes it between 7 and 8am and it has worn off by 3pm. The dr told me to double his dose to see if that helps, so I guess we will find out soon enough.  He had beeen taking Focalin XR and was having aggression problems.

Even when I haven't eaten anything in the morning, I will have heartburn and it just keeps getting worse.  The med works great... its just really painful for my stomach.

I am almost 19 at the moment. I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 6. I have since been rediagnosed with ADD. I grew out of the hyperactivity. I have tried many medications throughout the years and always come back to Concerta. I take 72mg daily. It is great for focusing on anything. But thats also the problem, ANYTHING includes slacking. In order for any medication to work, the patient must be willing to helo it. I have to motivate myself to start homework, but once i do, i stay focused. SIDE AFFECTS: There are many side affects im afraid. Excessive sweating caused by the stimulants in the drug, loss of appitite, i got migraines at age 13. Daily headaches, stomach pains, insomnia. My doctor told me that Concerta was probably the cause of all of it. But a word of advice for any parent or patient, if you have trouble sleeping at night becuase you are coming down off the drug, look into the over-the-counter suppliment MELATONIN. its not a sleeping pill but it helps to relax so you can fall asleep. Also try taking the medication as early as 6:00am, you should be tired enough to sleep at around 10:30 if you are like me. In my opinion, Concerta is pretty good, I'd rather be on it that Vyvance, Focalin, Adderall, or Strattera. Please compare side affects if you are considering changing. Adderall is a living h*ll when you come down off of it, and vyvnace can make you tempermental. Straterra made my neighbor start pulling out her hair and she thought the toothfairy lived in her doll house. Im not joking. It was very serious. Focalin makes the patient a emotionless zombie. Concerta has been the best so far. Hope this helps.

Another severe side affect is LOSS OF APPETITE.I used to be over weight in elemetary school, I lost alot of weight when I started taking this drug.All the way to today, I have no appetite durring the day, but i always have some sort of snack or drink at lunch or dinner. I take concerta at about 7AM and Have no appetite untill about 6 to 8PM.So that could be an upside for some patients.Overall concerta does a very good job.I was prescribed Focalin XR just to see if it were better.I stopped after the first month.I prefer concerta over Focalin XR any day.

Failing grades and missing a lot of school. The social worker at school talked to her and suggested we have her evaluated for ADD.  The psychiatrist said there is no test that says definitely if a child has this.  He suggested trying Concerta for a month and then check with her teachers.  I was skeptical about this drug, but after 2 weeks of being on it, her teachers already noticed an improvement in her.  My daughter says it has really helped her concentrate.  She hasn't missed a day of school in a month now.  On the tests she has taken in the last month she is getting b's and c's instead of failing.  She actually does her homework and hands it in.  I hope she continues to do well on this drug.

His doctor, without consulting me, changed his prescription to Vyvance.  In reading the reviews, the satifaction rating for Concerta is very high for children, low for adults.  It is the opposite for Vyvance.

He actually got kicked out of his first school after being there for 3 months due to the hyperness. when he does not have his pill, he is bouncing off the wall, rolling on the floor, has to yell scream and just have outburst for no reason. I was hesitant to put him on medication, but when I saw the affects, I was so glad I did. His doctor started off on the lowest dosage and gradually rasied it as he grew older. He is at 36 MG right now and in 3rd grade. He has his &quot;come down&quot; around 5pm and you can tell. The side affects are loss of appetite, emotional, growth. He is average in height but I know he could have been a couple inches taller if he didnt take the medication. As far as the emotions, he can cry at the drop of a dime over the smallest thing, because he is having chicken for dinner instead of spaghetti. All in all he is a better happier child on the medication and school is a happier place for him.

He is currently taking 36 mg and now the dose has been increased to 54mg daily. The reason is that he has gained weight and grown considerably (puberty). Anyway the doctor said that he would be quite tired the first few days of taking it. Does anyone know what &quot;tired&quot; means? Is it a zombie like state or just lethargic? Otherwise he has had great results with Concerta. His social skills have improved, is chatty, still struggles in school because he is quite disorganized.

Results: somewhat academically improved.  HOWEVER: side effects were consistent with warnings posted on medication and most detrimental was difficulty sleeping.  My daughter's dosage had increased over the years, the last 8 months she was on 72mg.  Over this period we eventually noted more anxiety, parental confrontations, involuntary trembling in her hands.  We had been seeing a psychiatrist during this period.  He had prescribed Trazodone as a sleeping aid, but said the trembling was not caused by Concerta.  I finally told the psychiatrist it was time to stop or change because of concern with effects.  Psych. agreed and said there was no problem with coming off the Concerta.  Wrong again.  Day 4 fatigue.  Days 5-10 intermittent nausea, dizziness, persistent moderate to severe headaches, abdominal pains, general ill feeling.  Her appetite has dramatically increased over this withdrawal period.  Consultation with pharmacist: stated it is very TYPICAL for withdrawal symptoms when stopping suddenly after this 5 year period.  Pediatrician visit: blood tests normal, no mono or strep throat, symptoms should subside soon, take Motrin or Tylenol.  Psychiatrist still states withdrawal symptoms are &quot;ATYPICAL,&quot; and is probably a stomach virus.  Time for a new psychiatrist.  I have done much reviewing on the web on amphetamines dependency, and just because you have a doctor prescribe it, don't think it can't harm you, or that you won't have withdrawal if you quit.  Most sources recommend tapering the dosage gradually to reduce withdrawal effects, I completely agree with that option.  My daughter has missed 5 days of school due to the withdrawal symptoms.  We are determined to avoid these drug types in the future.  There are no simple harmless drugs for ADHD that don't carry some life threatening risks.  I would rather my daughter be a slow learner than permanantly injured or killed by these &quot;medications.&quot;

I then switched back to 54mg when I started college, because 36mg wasn't doing it for me. I think I probably should ask my doctor about switching to another medication.

I decided to not medicate until recently. My decision to medicate was because he came to me and asked for something becuase he can't concentrate and his grades are poor. He has always had these issues but before high school were easier to control. I was able to work with teachers and staff to adjust his work load and they were more than happy to give him extra time or let him work somewhere with less distractions. Now that he is in high school, with all new teachers and staff they have a different attitude and have actually made the statement that they are not going to hold his hand. So basically I have have been forced to make a decision or he will for sure fail without any support system at school. He started this medication about 3 weeks ago andi have noticed increased ability to focus and remain focused for extended periods. He also seems to be able to finish tasks and chores with very little direction and redirection, which in his case is a huge improvement. There is a downside though which I feel is sugnifcant enough to discontinue using this medication. He has been experiencing severe mood swings and is emotionally unstable. One minute he is withdrawn and depressed even becomes tearfull and states he feels overwhelmed and lost. Then the next minute he is angry and cannot explain what is upsetting him. He also is experiencing headaches that make him nauseated and have cold sweats. My son is normaly the life of the party and has always been happy go lucky. I have decided to stop his medication until I am able to speak with the dr. I have heard alot of horror stories about parents having to try many different kinds of ADHD meds to find the right 1. I will be meeting with the school board to discuss the schools resposibility to work with my son and I. on a reasonable plan to make sure my son can be successful. Too many times schools force parents into making a decision againts what they believe in.

I don't really like it and plan on switching.

I continued to take it as directed. I did feel like I could focus a bit more, but not enough for it to be a huge difference. The worst part of this med for me was my moods. I feel sad one minute then the next I would be ready to fight. I also, have sleeping the entire night through. Im so tired all day that I fall asleep really well, but staying asleep is a huge issue, so that also contributes to the irritability. I hope that these side effects subside after I have been taking this medication for a long time.

He is a very creative child so i was afraid to give him anything because all i heard was that it would take creativity away and make him a zombie. WRONG this is the best thing that has happened to him, he went from F's in all his classes 2 months ago, to A's in almost everything and he is more creative than ever. His appetite has been a little too much in the evening when this pill wears off but that is the only side effect.

The Concerta has worked wonders for my childs impulsiveness, he can concentrate so much better and his work has improved to where he is AIG in math and reading.  We have noticed that he has developed some tics that are getting worse and would like feedback on this.

He was having major issues in school with not being about to focus and not retaining information (and being very disruptive in class).  I was &quot;talked into&quot; putting him on Concerta and I was truly amazed at the results.  He learned to read almost to grade level within a couple of months whereas before he had basically been a couple of grade levels below where he should have been.  His behavior changes were noticable almost immediately as well both at home and at school.  He is ten years old and says that the Concerta really helps him. He is still the same child, only with better behavior and he learns much more easily.  I am still concerned about possible long-term side-affects, especially since we have had to up his dose twice over the last year though, but I haven't seen anything that concerns me yet.

BUT he doesn't eat, he is moody, becomes withdrawn at times, sweats constantly, gets headaches, has become very nervous, heart palpitations, nausea ... the list goes on.  I want to take him off but am not sure if I can stop it all at once and wonder if anyone can recommend something else to me (not Ritalin, been there, done that).  I am trying to find something over the counter, i.e. not as strong and severe.  I am soooo worried about any long term effects that med has had on his health!

I've been on it for about 6 years and think that its starting to be less effective and will talk to my doc about switching to a different drug soon.  One thing I'm wondering, though is if this drug might be related to my being cold all the time.  I've always been the type to get cold easily, but its getting ridiculous and it seems to have been getting worse every year since I turned 30 (37 now).  I haven't seen anyone else mention this sort of thing, but am wondering if maybe its related but doesn't come on immediately, only after years of use.

I was diagnosed with ADD at like 6 years old. Ive been on ridalin (has drastic effect on growth), Prozac (made me sick), and some home remedies sauch as calms (its a vitamin and it worked ok, it smelled bad but wasnt strong enough) after quite afew years off of medications then restarted on them I have found the efficiancy has sky rocketed and Im now on 27mgs though I was started on a higher dose (it made my heart race and I would get faint when standing up) so my doctor lowered it and Ive been content ever since.

The side-effects I have are slight headach, dry mouth. I can live with side effects, but not the ADDHD. 
Other	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	19-24	2/20/2009 1:50:47 PM	I've been taking Concerta 18mg for about 3 months now.  Originally, I was on 36mg and that made me feel depressed and anxious.  I see a lot of reviews about how this drug hasn't worked or had negative side-effects.  I'm not a doctor but, my advice is: You're on the wrong dosage.  Lower your dosage, don't raise it.  That makes things much worse.  Also, tell your doctor that you wish to start at 18mg as that's the starting dosage.  You can go up from there but do so cautiously.  However, I have noticed that I can't fall asleep very easily.  Even if I spend all day doing a strenous and tiring activity, it's still difficult to fall asleep.  That's the only side-effect I've had and that's fairly easy to manage.  My appetite hasn't changed nor has anything else.  I can concentrate, do my homework, and best of all, I don't dwell over the little things in life that used to get me down.  When I was taking the 36mg, I did this.  It made me hypomanic, too focused.  So I asked my doctor to drop my dosage and everything has been great so far.

Other	Scatterbug, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	2/17/2009 10:38:00 PM	Like Brenda below, I was started on Concerta for fatigue associated with fibromyalgia.  My insurance company would no longer cover Provigil.  I also tested + for ADD.  I began taking Concerta on a weekend to be able to monitor potential side effects.  GOOD THING!  I vomitted for two days (I believe it was due to dehydration).  I am just now beginning to see results.  I have better concentration, I'm more organized, less anxious (with some recent MAJOR stressors that prior to this med would have me too distracted to attend to life), and best of all my time management and compensation strategies have improved greatly.  I have a student I am mentoring at my job.  She began just prior to my beginning this med.  I'm surprised she didn't hit the ground running in the other direction!  I am now able to shut up long enough for her to ask questions, help her develop her own ideas instead of trying to just take over and &quot;run the show.&quot;  I'm on 36 mg currently.  I'm not sure if this is an effective dose completely, but it is helping.  I am concerned/excited in regard to the appetite issues. I had gastric bypass 5 years ago.  It seems that the only version of this drug is extended release.  I have been told to avoid these kinds of meds because they don't remain in my system long enough to get the extended effect.  I am hoping that the decreased appetite people are describing comes my way.  I've begun to re-gain some weight.  I'll be a happy camper to lose my extra pounds as a lovely side effect!  I finally feel some hope that I can stop spinning in circles trying to get simple tasks accomplished.  Good luck with this med everyone!

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	19-24	2/11/2009 8:17:42 AM	I have ADD/ADHD, I was diagnosed in 3rd grade and I am now 21.  I have had some severe ups and downs with this drug, but recently, I am noticing some side effects.  This is the first time I have searched the drug to learn more about it but only because it has been bothering me lately.  I have been depressed and unmotivated to study in college.  I weigh around 160, but I think I would be at 200 if it wasn't for concerta.  I am a natural athlete, 3 handicap in golf, and can pretty much play any sport I set my mind to. Concerta has definitely screwed me up though.  I can go 2 days without eating, but because I have been on the drug for so long, I know when to eat even when I am not hungry.  I started on ritalin but have since moved on to concerta when it was recommended by my doctor around 8th grade.  I was fine at first, but I sweat constantly, even when its cold out.  My body could be freezing and I would still be sweating under my arms.  After reading, I am debating getting off the drug, but I feel those side effects will be a whole new set of things to worry about.  To parents, it will help your children in school but if the long term side effects are like mine, it is definitely not worth it.  Like somebody with ADD who hasn't been diagnosed yet, I still have a million thoughts running through my head. Some are good, some are depressing.  It just isn't worth it for an extended period of time.  I just hope when I am older, the drug does not carry long term side effects.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		2/9/2009 6:44:53 PM	I teach a class of K-2 students with Autism. One of my 5yr old male students took Concentra for about a month. At first he sat fine in the morning hours but by the afternoon he displayed signs of migraines (he's non verbal but when a kid grabs their head, cries uncontrollably, and begins to kick - I'd say he's got a headache). Then about two weeks into it, he would not play and only display aggressive behaviors towards peers and adults.   PLEASE Monitor your children on this!

I am now 24 and looking back, the side effects out weighed the actual effectiveness.  I was able to concentrate better, get things done, I was more productive, etc. Overall, I thought the drug did a good job at helping those with ADD/ADHD. There are, however, several cons that I'll list.Frequent urination, suppresed appetite, weight loss, shaking, poor circulation, depression, high blood pressure, rapid heart rate, nervousness, insomnia, restlessness, dehydration.....the list goes on.  It was almost like being on an extremely high dose of caffene. One of the things that concerns me the most even now is the high blood pressure.  I am not what you might call out of shape, unhealthy, or overweight, I even workout on a regular basis and have a somewhat athletic physique, but for some reason ever since I started taking this drug and even after I stopped, I've had high blood pressure. I'm barely eligable to give blood. It always shocks the nurses whenever they check my blood pressure because of how high it is for my young age and nobody knows why I have it. Maybe its different for everybody I don't know. I'm not sure if there has been any changes in the drug in the past 6 years since I've taken it. Just consider the side effects it may have and maybe consider another drug or ways of dealing with ADD without affecting your short-term and long-term health.

We saw immediate results in his ability to concentrate at school - esp. homework became so much easier for him. My concern is that this may stunt his growth - I have gotten mixed answers from pediatricians over the years.  This past month - he didn't take the medicine for 7 days and grew 1-1/2 inches.  Don't know if it is due to his age, not taking the med or both.  Any clues.

I discontinued the other drug and stayed on the Concerta for over 5 years.  Although the Doctor had originally said I also had adult ADHD, I felt completely normal while taking Concerta, no more panic or anxiety, no side effects, just normal.  And that is exactly what I wanted.  Other medications I had tried previously made me sleepy or grouchy. I have since stopped taking it and still feel fine.  I had lost a lot of weight while taking it but I was also on a diet.  Since I am no longer on the diet, I have regained the weight so I doubt if the Concerta was a factor.  I have nothing but positive things to say about it and have recommended it to several friends.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/27/2009 8:15:13 AM	My husband and I were concerned about putting our son on any medications because he was 6 years old.  We told ourselves it was his age and that he would grow out of this behavior.  The problem started in preschool and in to 1st grade.  We dreaded seeing his teacher to hear about his behavior that day and what happened in class. It was always that he couldn't sit still or wouldn't comlete his work and wouldn't stop talking in class.  We finally went to the doctor and poured our hearts out to her and asked for help.  She explained that it is an age and maturity factor but there were some ADHD symptons based on what we described.  We chose concerta and started out with the 18mg dosage and noticed a difference within a couple of days.  We made his teacher aware of the medicine and after a few weeks and discussions with his teacher we went back to the doctors and decided to go with the 27mg dosage.  That was the magic number!  Our son has made a 180 degree transformation.  He pays attention in class, follows directions, completes his work and receives high marks from his teacher daily.  It's a great feeling knowing he's doing so well in and out of school. I have to say that even though I was against putting our son on medication, it was the best decision we made. We are so proud of him and he knows that. He even reminds me eveery morning that it's time to take his &quot;vitamin&quot;.

I was then put on concerta 36, it worked well but when coming off it about 3 pm for me, I was a bear, so they switched me to vyvanse....ggrrrrr.......they put me back on concerta with taking 10 mgs of Ritalin at 2 pm.....the magic compo. for me.. With two toddlers, full time collage and a part time job , it's working excellent. Moral of the story....gotta find the right fit for you..no one else.

He was diagnosed with slight ADHD, this has totally helped him actually LIKE school and actually do his work. I am very pleased with the effects it has had on him. He does not know it is a controlled substance though. He is taking it in conjuction with Effexor, approx 75 mgs also.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	1/20/2009 6:03:11 AM	I am 28 and was diagnosed with ADD 2 months ago.  It sort of happened by mistake.  I was trying to lose my baby weight after having two children and I started taking Hydroxycut...equivalent of 6 cups of caffeine.  I felt amazing for the first time since I had kids.  I was adopted when I was 9 and got good grades, so any behavior problems I had were attributed to my prior life.  I never got along with my adoptive parents and after I moved out life was great.  I got married, bought a house, had a good job...but when I had kids (that I love to death)...things changed.  With the birth of my second child, I started feeling like I was losing my grip.  Where I once thought I was a great mom...I started doubting my sanity.  I would become very moody and unable to control emotions when I was overstimulated by too much noise or stress.  Kids fighting with eachother, husband yelling at the kids, mom getting worse and worse.  I had to do something.  When the Hydroxycut made such a huge difference I went to a doctor and after a few sessions was told that I had ADD.  I've been on concerta for 1 month.  I can concentrate on one task at a time now...where before I was constantly multi-tasking...more so than would be considered normal.  My side effects have been much welcomed weight loss and not so welcome stomach aches that leave me grouchy towards the end of the day.  the last few days sort of a fuzzy pressure in the back of my head...not like a headache, more like a weird buzz.  The most disturbing, that probably attributes to the weight loss is that I have ZERO hunger...no desire for food, no will to eat, no concept that I should eat.  I have to set myself reminders on my calendar to make sure I look up from the computer while I'm working...I can go the whole day and feel fine.  I don't have trouble sleeping, but I'm not tired and its 3am...this all worries me a bit, but if I didn't do something my family was going to fall apart.

I was diagnosed with A.D.H.D when i was about 21 months old. I have a very big history with taking different medications. When i was in gradeschool, i used to take Ritalin. It works the same as Concerta, but i didnt like it because i had to take 1 1/2 in the morning and then another 1 1/2 at lunch. I was embarassed because it got to where everyone knew i had to go take my medicine. So i finally switched to Concerta, 12-hour. And i love it.

My 12 year old has been on Concerta for 5 years. She was on 72mg and I tried 36mg a year ago for her and now that is all she needs. Her ADHD symtoms w/out the meds aren't as bad as they use to be. My 8 year old has been on Concerta for over a year. She was on 36mg, but I had her lowered to 27mg. To higher dose lasted longer, but her stomach hurt her every day. Lowering the dose stoped the stomach achs. Her weight is the issue now. She has been in the 40s for 2 years.

My daughter decided not to give him the pill over the Christmas Holiday break. He hadn't had a pill for the past 13 days and all of a sudden developed a severe headache. He is 6 yrs old and never complains of a headache. I am trying to find out if this is related to him not taking the pill for the past week. Has anyone else had this experience?

As a long-term user of it I wonder about the social and mood affects. I'm concerned that sometimes I become too serious / focused and not lively and funny. Does anyone else take the medication Monday through Friday and not take it on the weekend? As in, I dont need to be focused to relax on the weekend but I'm wondering about any side affects of going on/off the medication

As a college student, distractions are fatal challenges but this medication has helped me go from a C student to an A stuent!  I take it everyday, if I miss a dosage, that entire day I am extremely drousy.  Once in a while I will have a day or two where I am extremely depressed, but it goes away with time.  Weight loss is common, but I am mature enough to recognize when I must eat and ignore my lack of appetite.  Other than that, this medication is extremely beneficial!!!

Concerta is, by far, the most effective. I take 54 mg. and, as long as I take it early in the morning, have no major side effects. I think it really depends on the individual but I think it is a lifesaver, especially for adults with ADD. But parents: BE AWARE!! I just finished college but throughout my high school and college years, kids were constantly trying to buy my Concerta from me and many students I knew would regularly sell theirs in lieu of taking it so just keep tabs on the meds as well as adderall.

The doctors were aware of my high blood pressure but said it would help.         
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	12/3/2008 9:55:54 PM	My grandson had a terrible time sleeping and would be up until 3 or 4am and then have a terrible time getting up for schoo.  He had no appetite at all once he took the pill so the only time he ate was in the morning before school.  Then he started with obsessive behavior.  He would brush his teeth for 2-3 hours at a time, line up his toys and papers in straight lines.  My daughter just took him off the med today and we are going to see the doctor tomorrow for some advice on what to do next. The response when he was called about the sleeping problem was we can give him a sleeping pill ( he is 8 years old ) so i don't think so and as for the appetite he said well just let him have whatever he wants whenever he wants it.  We don't think this was a good choice for our child.

He is a different child since day 1. His teacher noticed a difference on the first day. We had to adjust the dosage to see a difference in completing homework. He has been ADHD as far back as preschool. He was always labeled as the bad kid. Always getting into trouble. We never wanted to put our child on medicine like this, but he is a huge success story. His teacher has even recommended testing for being gifted. What a great turn around! Don't be afraid to medicate. You certainly would not think twice about taking medication for High blood pressure if you needed it.

(to the person below...) Im 19 years old, and have had &quot;sufferd&quot; with ADHD for my entire life... my dad use to try and refuse to admit it and never wanted to medicate me... and my mom had me tested when i was about your daughters age... actually i had just turned 7. I never took any type of medication for my condition untill i reached high school where i was able to make the decision on my own and aked my doctor and mom for it. I have been taking concerta for 5 almost 6 years and have been so happy with my choice. Knowing how it helped me now makes me wish i could have started it earlier so i wouldnt have struggled so badly. I am still on concerta and am currently going tough nursing school, my only problem with my med that i have ever had is remembering to take it! (Guess its somthing we deal with being so scatter brained) Dont be concerned or upset, its okay. she could have something worse and its most important that you support her, as im sure you are. Be sure to explain to her and make sure she understands what it is she is taking, my nephew is 8 yr old and has sever ADHD and has been taking concerta for 2 years now, he is aware of how it helps him at that age and is even able to concious and notice when he doesnt take it hes &quot;out of control tia.&quot; We like calling it a &quot;vitamin&quot; so he doesnt feel Embarrassed about it. My point is dont be concerned and stop cryig because everything is goign to be alright and it will help your daughter AND YOU. We learn to accept ourselves and even learn how to make fun of ourseles when we read the diagnosis and conditions with ADHD, ( I do down the list and go check, check, check, gosh it sounds like its talking about myself.. ha how we relate)I was always been told i you &quot;wont take this for the rest of your life&quot; &amp; i dont have to just while im in school &amp; while you need it everythings gunna work out

I've been considering switching to adderal.  The concert works for me as far as focusing in class.  You see,  I am a 30 yr female cosmetology instructor, so it is imperative for me to concentrate during classes.  However i feel like crawling out of my skin by the end of the day.  Anyone have any feedback on comparisons?  I know ritalin made me feel ten times worse!

I will be picking up the prescription tonight. He has a hard time staying focused in school and completing/starting projects, his test scores and homework scores are failing in two classes. He is not hyper, does not disrupt classes or other students. His behavior is fine.  It's just the fact that he is unable to focus and concentrate.  With your experience, do you believe this is the proper medication for my son?  Any thoughts will be helpful.

Everything is normal with her, good grades, better concentration,  able to focus and stay on task.  Isn't loud or busy anymore.  She is right where she needs to be.  No side affects.

Does a higher dose make you feel alittle out of control at first. I have had alot of melt downs in the past few days. Though I have alot of new things going on that is stressful. Remodeling house. I just wonder if its the medicine, or the stress that makes me feel like this. Someones comments would surely help.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Tiffany, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	11/1/2008 3:37:18 PM	I have been recently diagnosed with mild/moderate ADHD and this is the first medication we started with, 36mg. 12 hour continuous release.  It felt like a miracle drug at first.  I was in a extremely good mood and felt like I could run a marathon!  I was motivated and felt able to accomplish whatever I put myself to.  However, the longer I take the medication (I have not completed a full 2 months yet)  I am noticing that I still feel the way I did initially for a short while, but for the other times I feel light headed, dizzy, and quite frequently I feel like I am about to pass out!  Also, I am noticing bruises all over my body and I can't think of anything I did to cause them.  That is kinda scary to me.  On the upper part of my body they are small, but on my legs they are nasty and seem to grow before they start to go away.  Has anyone else had this problem?
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Clarity, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	19-24	10/28/2008 9:59:38 PM	I'm 23 years old, and was diagnosed with ADHD three months ago, and promptly prescribed 36mg of concerta daily.  i am still very happy that i began taking concerta, it changed my life in a more positive way than any single thing ever has.  however, i plan to begin researching alternatives treatments immediately.  concerta was a blessing when i started.  the jitters and the lack of appetite weren't appreciated, but weren't detrimental enough to discourage me.  i could make myself do things without needing the motivation of dire consequences.  i stopped losing my temper as easily when overstimulated.  i was able to finally have conversations without having to constantly struggle to keep my words organized.  i'm quickly realizing that i may have been too desperate to fix the problem that i didn't care what the solution was so long as it worked.  the benefits i described are not because of concerta, but because that is what life is like when my symptoms are controlled, and they never have been before.  lately it's been feeling less effective.  i was told to expect it to be less noticeable as time went on, but my problem goes beyond that.  i feel like i have yet to reach my true potential.  yes, things are easier but the core symptoms that i need pharmaceutical back up for are not being regulated to the point where i need them.  yes, a higher dosage would easily fix this, but could cause the side effects to strengthen and even develop new ones.  the heart palpitations that i'd written off as my imagination, stress, or whatever other self deceptions felt comfiest are suddenly terrifyingly memorable.  if you've recently been diagnosed and concerta is your first medication, learn about all of your options before committing to one.  all medications have side effects, but concerta's biggest negatives seem to be most commonly reported.  i love anything that weakens my symptoms, but ADHD is not fatal.  heart disease is a whole new monster, and i've got enough to fight.

She's now 11, just started middle school and her medication was increased to 27mg.  Having her on the medication has been such a blessing - her ability to focus, concentrate, pay attention and follow instructions has improved significantly.  In fact, you can tell when she doesn't take the medication-everything suffers.  Has anyone using Concerta experienced any side effects such as stunting growth?  She's being treated for an eating disorder and the team of doctors have suggested we take her off the Concerta for at least one month, maybe more.  She's only been taking Concerta for about 1 year.  I gave her the summer off and she didn't gain weight so I'm not totally convinced this medication is really stunting her growth and I really hesitate to take her off because she's been so successful being on it.  If anyone has any material, proof or experience with Concerta stunting growth in children, I would appreciate hearing from you.

I take 36mg which is enough to help me concentrate in school. I was on Adderal and that was a nightmare. I would take the medicine, fall asleep - wake up and be soo irritable and moody. Concerta doesn't make me sleepy but I do go into moods throughout the day when I don't talk and in my own old. People start to wonder if I am okay. Also when I take it in the mornings and I'm in class I feel like I am going to vomit. Lasts couple minutes, then I'm okay. Don't have much of an appetite either during the day.

Day dreaming and loss of focus have always been problems, except when especially interested in something.I've struggled in recent years with keeping focus unless under a ridiculously strict deadline at work or at home.  Having trouble starting, staying on task and completing tasks (the biggest problem) have encumbered me through my adult life.  Concerta has definetely helped with focus and allowing me to remeber conversations and function without forgetfulness.  It's not a magic pill that makes everything better, you still have to motivate yourself to do those tasks, however the motivation is much easier.  I'm in my second month of Concerta and am taking 36mg daily.  Aside from a bit of a body buzz midday, the meds clearly help with concentration, focus and preventing distraction.

I was taking Provigil 400mg 2x a day and made me very moody and irritable and it felt like I had lock jaw and my heart was very racey.  The doctors want me to take my provigil with the concerta xr for Narcolepsey along with my depression but I am afraid so I take just the concerta by itself and I got to say the concerta is 100% better than the provigil for the Narc. and depression.  I no longer pass out when sitting down with friends or family at the kitchen table.  I feel like if I was to mix both together Provigil and concerta I will take a heart attack.  I know I might be wrong but I am scared.  I took Ritalin and that made me so irritable, no one wanted to come near me.  So I really like concerta for my issues, I am not into pills to function on a daily basis but no this time in my life I have to accept it, Narcolepsey is NO JOKE, YOU CAN PASS OUT ANYWHERE AND AT ANYTIME, so look into that drug for Narc. I am very pleased, I somewhat of my life back.

We later tried Concerta and have taking it ever since.....he is 14 and he takes only one 54mg pill a day and is doing great.  He does not like to eat lunch because he is not hungry but does eat two meals in the evening.  He did not gain weight when he was younger and I was concerned but after puberty he started gaining weight.I have always been really pleased with the his abilty to focus with this medication.

It decreases my appetite and I sometimes forget to eat.  I also had trouble sleeping when I first began to take it - my doctor then prescribed a mild sleeping aid.

We stopped today and are going to try adderall xr. The concerta helped in some areas but he has became increasingly hostile, disruptive, and disrespectful in school and at home. After reading many comments I'm beginning to think parents who are experiencing ADHD for the first time should try something else before allowing their child to take concerta as the initial treatment. He didn't have any problems sleeping, but getting him to eat was difficult at times. His self esteem has taken a real nosedive in the last 2 months. He repeatedly says &quot;No one likes me&quot;, or &quot;No one wants to be my friend&quot; and tell his teachers he just wants his mom and dad to be happy with him. It's heartbreaking because he use to be such a warm, loving and friendly little boy. I know more people whose children take adderall successfully, I just hope it works for us.

It seems to help her attention and filter. I am very concerned about psychosis side effects.  Anxiety and deppression might run in the family.  A very intelligent cousin saw the meds while visiting one day and encouraged me to research this med further.  He said he had a friend who has done all kinds of illegal drugs including acid.  One day she took her daughter's concerta.  She told my cousin that she will never again give her daughter this drug.  Naturally I am worried with the school year approaching I want to give my daughter the tools she needs without blowing her mind or heart.  She is also a very social person so I am keeping an eye out for that aspect.  She tells me she needs it but I am scared.  She also has a stutter that I felt might be improving with the meds.  Can anyone comment to this???

He is now 10 (almost 11). He was on straterra for a few years and it worked to an extent, but then he started getting very violent, getting really bad migraines and his fits would last for 2 hours or more so we took him off of it. We just started him on Concerta last week and he is already having really bad migraines and I haven't seen any improvment in his behavior. Beware of this medication if there is ANY family history of migraines. If there is any family history of migraines and you or your child take this medication, it is likely to cause severe migraines along with vommiting.

My son is almost 10 and he has been on this medication since he was 8. What I thought were just complaints I have come to realize are serious side effects. He would say &quot;my stomach hurts&quot; or &quot;my head is killing me&quot;. Then he would go and &quot;ZONE OUT&quot; for about 1 hour. I thought that the benefits would outway the complaints but seriously they dont. His grades arent that different than that of before. And he isnt the same outgoing kid that he is when it wears off. I'm not trying to say that it wont be effecive for someone else but the risk of heart problems and other side effects are very scary and as of this moment I am taking my son off of it and going to find another route.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	6/24/2008 5:21:01 PM	I started out on Concerta when I was 13, it worked great in the beginning, but my body kept adjusting to the dose and my dosage just kept going up and up. I'm 21 now, and up until two weeks ago, I was taking two 36 and two 54's each day, so 180 overall. Of course, on this high dose, I began to notice heart palpatations, extreme anxiety, and paranoia, but my doctor said this was all normal. I finally decided my heart pals and shortness of breath were too much and went to get my heart checked out. They found some serious heart rythem problems and trachycardia issues that I have to see electrocardisit specialists for and possibly get surgery to correct. Though Concerta helped me maintain a 4.0 all through college, I'm not so sure it's worth this. I know they say Concerta doesn't create heart problems, or there is very little risk, but I come from a family of absolutely NO HEART DISEASE and this is pretty serious. And even if Concerta didn't create the problem, there is no doubt in my mind that it made it worse.  Basically, if you are considering putting yourself or your child on Concerta, make sure you have constant, regular doctors check up, specifically for your heart, make sure you keep an eye on your heart rate/pulse, and don't take palpatations or shortness of breath lightly.

Tried each for a couple days.The 54mg was somewhat effective, but I wanted to try other medications to have a basis of comparison since 54mg was the highest recommended dosage.I am currently testing Vyvanse at 70mg, and feel more concentrated, but at the same time have shown instances of rage, mood swings, and paranoia.I have also been diagnosed with depression and will be trying an SSRI antidepressant next week so that may change things, but right now I am thinking about trying adderall XR.

I was able to concentrate, but found it very awkward to be around people. The long-acting dose made it a pain since I have difficulty sleeping. 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	 (Caregiver) 	4	4	3			6/3/2008 11:17:24 AM	Started my 5 1/2yr old. son on Concerta long acting one week ago. I saw an immediate difference. He was much more calm and focused. However, by the end of the week he had developed a facial tic. He would make angry faces. Doc said to give it another week to see if the tic goes away. Also, I was told by the pharmacist that I could continue to give my son his allergy medicine (clarinex). Well, it seems the allergy medicine counteracts the Concerta. My son starts talking about everything and anything and his hyperactivity has returned. I have chosen to stop the allergy medicine and continue the Concerta to see if it works again. I am also waiting to see if the tic stops. I hope it does because I saw an immediate (I mean literally the same day)improvement when my son started taking the Concerta 18mg. Also, the pill cannot be broken or crushed so I was worried about him taking it. Well, it's getting easier, I just let him drink alot. His appetite is not very good,but surprisingly, his sleeping habits have actually improved.

My mom made me take it at first. I was 15 at the time and honestly it has been an overall bad experience and has been holding me back ever since. At first it took my personality away and i went from a very social, creative, outgoing person to an anxious, nervous, withdrawn and just didn't have anything to say to anyone. That made me depressed since Ive always been social and then went to nothing. My depression made me act out in ways like drinking too much. Also since it extremely suppresses appetite, it isn't smart giving that to a girl adolescent. It has grown into a horrible battle with an eating disorder. The side effects of coming off concerta are so unbearable that i cant ever get off of it because my life falls apart. Ive become an EXTREMELY anxious person. I have worrying thoughts about everything. I also have bad irritability and mood swings. It doesn't help much with concentration. The cons out weigh the pros and there are a lot more options to help adhd. It just takes practice and patience. Even if you decide to get on concerta, adhd will come back after you stop and you will have to eventually learn how to live with it. But hey this is just one 21 year old girls experience. Some of you will try it for yourself. I'm stubborn like that. But Ive been going through it for 6 years and only want to save people from going what Ive been through.

Concerta has the same effect as Ritalin - but less side effects. It is WONDERFUL! It helps me stay focused - I remember things - it has been a saving grace in my life. I would highly recommend over the other two.

I noticed a big difference at first. it helped me stay focused a lot better than the adderall did, but it didn't allow me room to be myself like the adderall did. I have also have had some feelings of depression a lot lately, and its starting to get serious. It is the medication, so i suggest anyone out there that is capable of being unstable, try to stay off this medication.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Lane Myers, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	4/29/2008 6:54:17 PM	I was diagnosed with ADHD three years ago after both college and graduating from a difficult top tier law school. Had I known I had the disorder sooner, things may have been easier. However, I was leery of Adderall or Ritalin because students would deal them and take them with other illicit drugs to study. I wanted nothing to do with it, though it was prescribed. Just this year, I started working 2 hrs away from home, 11 hrs or so a day. I had to do SOMETHING. I was in a large room filled with chatty attorneys, constantly distracted, and was drinking 4 redbulls a day, 2 cups of coffee, AND popping no-doze for my sleepiness. My doctor said &quot;I prescribed something for you three years ago. You didn't take it. But now there's something new and less habit forming.&quot; He put me on Concerta, and I haven't touched a redbull in a month, after having taken copious amounts of caffeine (vivarin, coffee, jolt, no-doze, green tea) since I was in Boarding School! Suddenly, I need none of it. I can focus on my work, I stay awake, I don't get sleepy driving anymore, and I feel much better without all the caffeine running rampant in my system. I'm calm, I'm effective, I'm productive. I get the apprehension many have with Adderall or Ritalin or even Concerta, but if you are prescribed any of these medicines LEGITIMATELY, I suggest you take it. There is no reason to live in a cloud. Oh, and for creative types: there is no need to fear the idea that it somehow takes your creativity away from you. I am also a songwriter and have been for many years. I have no trouble writing even AFTER taking the concerta.

I got organized and saved a losing job into a good one. I also at the time had quit drinking and druging and I feel that it helped me get threw that as well. I quit taking it recently because it was not helping me out any longer and on top of that I would get very sleepy a few hours after taking it. I have not taken it for almost three weeks and I still get very sleepy. I sleep dead out at night and wake up hard in the morning and then about two to three hours later I have to lay down for ten to twenty minutes. Why?? I eat good, I sleep good.Is it Concerta withdrawl? Any suggestions would be great. Thank you

I found that it changed my personality, not in a badway, but I became very introverted, when typically I as a very outgoing person.  It was effective at helping me keep my focus, definitely, but I wasn't the same me.  So, I stopped taking it.  Recently, I have been having some problems at work keeping focussed.  I am a nurse who works 2-14 hr days and 1-12 hr day, so I have to get a lot done, and stay on task.  I went to my doctor, and decided to try this medicine again, but at a lower dose, 54 mg.  The difference is amazing.  I stay on task, but when I have free time, I'm still pretty much the same old me. I would definitely have to say that this is a great medicine, and is making my days at work go much smoother.

Im a college student so while i was studying today I was satisfied with the treatment,  I was able to focus and understand my course load.  Around dinner time, I noticed that my upper lip was twitching.  From that point on I picked up every side effect imaginable until I reached the point of psychosis.  I was parinoid about everything around me, scared and felt depressed.  I would be talking and suddenly something would freak me out and id start crying unconftrolably.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG

I fought the teachers and doctors when they told me my son may need medication. I remember leaving a meeting in tears. Yet when my son was in third grade and not reading yet, I knew he needed help. I let his doctor put him on a min dose of Concerta, and pulled him out of school to homeschool. I was shocked at the change in his work! The first few weeks of homeschooling were &quot;un-medicated&quot; so when we finally filled the RX, the VERY next day his work was more neat, he didn't fight about working, HE was so happy that he could actually listen to what I was saying! I have to say that I was very upset that I had denied my son of this medication for so long. It has been almost 4 years now, and he is doing wonderful! The days he does not take his medication it's like he can't control himself, it has nothing to do with our parenting at all. He is a well behaved, loving, sweet kid who just needs help to focus. I pray that he grows out of it, or that I will be able to teach him skills to deal with his ADD for adulthood,(I won't always be here to pick up all the lost items and help him to remember EVERYTHING!) but whatever happens, I am glad that we found this medication.

It has gotten him to start talking and easier to handle in school and at home.  He does have to take another drug to treat possible side effects. Treatment is best with a phsycitrist who specializes with children.

I was a skeptic, now I'm a believer. I believe this is a case of both parents having to work to buy gas, food, just to survive and both are tired when we get home. Kids can't get out like they used to because of the sick people in this world so it's TV and video game for most parent to feel safe. The children need more fun places to go that is free and safe in this world

My grades have gone up too. I started using it when I was 11 and it has worked very well.

I have been on Adderall XR since 2005 and it is not working as well as it used to.  My doctor is switching me over to concerta soon.  I had similar side effects, weight loss, now weight gain, short temper, etc.  I think that is just the case with these types of medication.  However, you may want to ask your doctor why he/she will not put you on Adderall XR.  There may be a good reason.  I began to experience a rapid heart beat and shortness of breath (Tacacardia) a few months ago. I don't know if these medications are really intended to be used for a long period of time, I have been on Adderall, then Adderall XR since 1999 and the side effects never really bothered me until recently.

Now that she has a diagnosis and hopefully the right meds this may help her immensely. I was just prescribed concerta for my ADD.  Before that I was on Adderal for 6 mos.  Until I was correctly diagnosed I had a tendency to drink too much alcohol just to make me feel halfway normal-my ADD meds have helped me in many many ways.  I hope she continues w/ treatment after leaving jail.  As my doctor says meds help, but you also need to retrain your brain and correct past behavioral issues.  Its hard but worth it. 
Other		3	3	3			2/23/2008 10:38:47 AM	My stepdaughter is presently serving a jail sentence for possession and use of cocaine.  She is receiving counceling while there and has been given Concerta, Seraguel and Depakote.  All of which are being used to treat A.D.D. and bi-polar depression.  I am concerned that this is only going to replace the cocaine for her while serving time.  I live in another state and wish someone had some information on a situation like hers.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity		3	4	3			2/12/2008 1:40:39 AM	I have been taking concerta for 3 years now, and while it has helped my studying, it is extremely difficult to come off of.  What most people who comment on this site neglect to mention is that when you stop taking concerta you will become severly depressed.  Prior to using concerta I NEVER experienced feelings like this.  Concerta is just an easy fix for lousy parenting, but what most of these parents dont realize is the cost that comes with this

I lost about 15 lbs, which I was happy about but I turned into a psychotic b*tch who would flip out and cry over nothing. I'm still taking it and it's Feb. 2008. Now since being on it for 2 years and some months, I have gained all of the weight back, I'm always depressed, I have anxiety over the littlest things, I have severe mood swings, and I never want to hang out with friends because I just feel too depressed to even be around people. The first couple of months of taking Concerta in 2005 went like a flash and when I look back on the way I treated my loved ones it depresses me. I put myself in stupid situations, I was so mean to my mother who was going through radiation at the time. I'm just so depressed due to the weight gain, mood swings, crashes around 6pm, laziness, binge eating, headaches, irritability, and fatigue but yet unable to fall asleep so once I do fall asleep I can't wake up on time. When I first took it my grades were a lot better in college, but towards the end of junior and senior year I was back at a C average and the drug seems to have worn off its ability to keep me focused. I've been asking my doctor for a year now to prescribe me adderall xr, but she keeps prescribing everything but adderall (ie focalin: nothing but blurred vision; strattera: headaches and no improvement with my ADD; and Ritalin 10mg plus Concerta 36mg: didn't really notice a difference). She says Adderall is going to be the last resort, hopefully I won't go into severe depression before then. Reading these reviews has convinced me to put my foot down and tell her to let me try Adderall since I heard it's been used to help with depression or else I will seeking a new doctor.

I took it for ADD for 5 1/2 years. They finally took me off when i realized that I was in depression for the time I was on it. It affected the way I ate and all my moods. When I took it i felt like someone else was in control of my body. I did not gain any weight. It changed all my eating habits. It did not really help me focus. It took me from being able to talk to almost completely stop talking.

I have terrible headaches, no desire to do anything and very little to no energy!  I really just want to sleep after I take it!  I don't feel as though it really does anything as far as helping with my concentration problems.  Help!

IT is the first and only Add drug i have ever had and it works great with anti-depressants that i have tried. For about a month i had to go on buspar for anxiety but that went away. I didn't feel like i was drugged, i just felt more focused. It is nothing like caffeine for me (which i tend to subconsciously medicate if i miss a dose). It is a drug you can miss a dose and not fall apart as long as you aren't Hyperactive (maybe it is ok to do that too but i wouldn't know). It takes about thirty minutes to kick in so if you are in school then take it early. It really is what i needed even though my father does not like me on stimulants and my mother took about 6 years to finally agree. It also makes driving much much easier, but be careful if you learn on it do not drive without it. I got in every accident i have on days i missed it. To tell the truth it isn't addicting, it is more fun for me not to take it, but it really helps focus and sometimes even sleep. And parents should listen to their kids more if they think they might have it, it is very depressing to be told you are wrong when you know something isn't working right.

We had to work at home and at school with coping skills and stay consistant and she was able maintain and as a middle schooler is doing better then I could expect. I recommend this with medication and a plan to help your child, it can be done.

Concerta, on the other hand, gives a slower, smoother experience and tapers down without the headache. It also allows me to focus on one thing at a time. I have a much better quality of life with this med.

I also do not take it during the summer. I noticed with Concerta that I am more focused and I do not talk as much as I used to during school without it. My mood doesn't change that much, but it makes me a tiny bit more irritable. Overall I like it.

There is a definite night and day difference if I miss a dose. It gives me the patience to get through the things in life that used to set me off. I don't feel like a zombie nor am I flying high on it. I simply feel better, and those who know me say its made a huge difference. People used to say that I made them nervous just being around them because I was so spastic and fidgety. People can get to know the real me and not be turned away by the spastic, nervous ball of energy I once was. Concerta does not change your personality, it allows you focus and express it. I don't suffer from any adverse side effects from this product but I do feel it has lost a bit of its effectiveness over the years. Maybe my body has developed a bit of a tolorence over the years to it. I'll discuss this with my doctor in a few weeks. For parents of children with ADD or ADHD take note that this product does really work. It is, however, very expensive at approx $160 a month. Don't let this steer you away though; because there are patient assistance plans out there that will cover the entire cost of this any many other medications.

The 36mg dosage seems very effective.  Once in a great while he has some difficulty falling asleep, but overall the results are very good.  His teacher noticed an immediate difference and, truth be told, the bigger illustration is on days he doesn't take it.  The boy drives us crazy... and the hyperactivity element isn't really even present with his ADD.  At any rate, thus far, we've been very satisfied with it.  Be prepared for some headaches, which occur once or twice a week, along with some fatigue at night (on occasion).

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Loving mom of teenage son, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/27/2007 6:48:07 PM	My 15 year old son has been on Concerta for 3 years. Our Dr. started him on the 27mg dose &amp; has increased him to the 36mg.  My son has never been hyperactive, just not able to stay focused or complete multi tasks. Since he has been taking the Concerta, his ability to remain focused and actually remember things has been amazing.  Concerta started working within 3 days for him. He did loose 2 lbs when he first started taking it, and will have some evenings when it is harder for him to get to sleep, but nothing bad.  I am amazed at his willingness and ability to interact with family and friends.  I have seen a whole new kid come to life.  He doesn't have any side effects at all.  I feel that Concerta has given him the ability to fully enjoy life instead of missing it because he couldn't concentrate.  I highly recommend Concerta and after reviewing other meds, I feel confident in giving my son his Concerta daily.  We did try Neuro feedback for 3 months and I do feel like that also helped in many ways.  My son use to say that the medicine didn't help him, until I decided not to give it to him for 3 days (he doesn't remember to take it), and one day he came home from school and said that he needs to take his Concerta tomorrow, because he noticed he was having a hard time focusing in class.  That sold me right there!  I was happy to hear him say that he noticed a difference.  Nobody likes to have to medicate their child, but when you witness first hand the benefits it brings to your childs life, it may change your mind.  I also like the fact that the drug doesn't stay in their body for more than 8 hours.  I am sold and recommend Concerta.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	3			11/25/2007 10:44:23 PM	    To any parents considering Concerta, here is some insight from a college junior. Concerta is effective for school kids but, I have had some issues. I had been on a relitively small dosage of ritalin for a long time befor switching to concerta and upon switching I ran into dosage problems. I had been 130lbs before changing dosage at 225. I had been put upwards of 54 mg of concerta and after a couple of months I was a zombie. Totally apathetic. So, monitor dosage. The other problem was that because I wasnt taking it at school anymore none of my teachers knew my situation so make sure to inform them. In a bunch of situations I have found ritalin to be better then concerta. The first was high school football. My doctor and I decided that by kick off at 7 I had no concerta in my system and to supplement this he gave me 10-10mg ritalins for the season. This is better then concerta because if you take a fool dosage of concerta you could not sleep and on ritalin you can at least get to sleep although it is still difficult. College is also better for ritalin because, you dont go to class from 8-3 so concerta is useless. The thing to do is to be on small dosages of ritalin through out the day so that your covered for your 9 am class and you 8pm study group. I hope I helped.

I started taking Ritalin but didn't like the ups and downs of a 4 hour pill, plus remembering to take it once it had worn off was darn near impossible.  When I started taking the Concerta I was at 54 mg.  I found that I would think about all the stuff I had to do but I couldn't seem to act on it.  I would be completely immobilized by the thought of all the work.  My doctor and I slowly moved the dosage up.  My dosage was 108 mg but I was completely organized and able to focus.  My room was even clean and stayed clean (much to the surprise of my mom.)I was treated by an ADD specialist that had been seeing me since I was diagnosed at the age of 6.  Even though my dosage was considered high by most medical journals, my doctor and I both agreed that it was what I needed.  However, when she passed away unexpectedly I could not find another physician that was willing to write a prescription for that dosage.  Every doctor I saw kept saying that it was twice the recommended dose and then they would try to send me to a shrink.During this time everything suffered.  My apartment became cluttered and disorganized, my grades plummeted (until then I had maintained a 3.8 through my junior year of college), and I was late for appointments and classes.  I was even more impulsive.I was finally able to find a doctor that was willing to work with me. She is a specialist that works specifically with women that have ADD.  She built me slowly back up to the needed dosage over the course of two month. I am happy to say that I am back on track.I have found that the medication only lasts 8 hours and if I am trying to study after that I will take 30 mg of Ritalin to get me through the rest of the day.  No medical journal knows what is right for you, you know your body and whether a medication is working or not.  Your doctor should realize this and take the steps necessary to give you the medication YOUR body needs.

She was at the point of failing and being kept back a grade and this drug changed everything.  She has not had to increase the dosage and we continue to see improvement.  She has had an increase in her coughing and her sleep has been affected but not so bad that she wants to stop taking it.  She has commented that she feels better about herself, her schoolwork, and she is not excited about going to school.

I now read, work with little to no concentration problems and can do handwork again.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	dnm, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Male	13-18	9/25/2007 7:29:47 PM	My son has ADD inattentive type; he does not have hyperactivity, just a complete inability to concentrate, remain organized, filter out ambient noise, remember tasks or finish tests on time. This medication has helped him greatly in all of those areas and he now finishes timed tests on time at school, a first in many years. He gets mild headaches, which is thus far the only ill effect. It's great to have a kid who does A work actually have the teacher see the work because tests are completed and homework is not continually lost, left on the printer, left in the car, on the steps, etc. Having resisted medication for 5 years while all else was tried, we're very happy with the result. The worry that the medication might make this laid back kid hyper turned out to not me an issue at all, and his sleep has not been impacted.
