High Blood Pressure	Lisa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	2/5/2011 7:44:39 PM	I have been taking Methyldopa for the last 18 months (250mg, 3x/day).  I have HBP which is secondary to Polycystic Kidney disease.  I started taking it because my partner and I are TTC.  After 11 months of trying I became pregnant but lost the baby 3 months later (that was 2 months ago).  Today I went to the Dr. because my BP was 156/113 (at home - after having rested for 15 minutes).  The Dr. informed me that sometimes this medication stops working after a while (or rather, your body gets used to it and therefore it doesn't respond in the same way).  My options were to increase it to 500mg, 3x/day or switch to Atenolol.  My Dr. said Atenolol is safe during pregnancy but I've heard and read the opposite.  Does anyone have experience with this medication? 
High Blood Pressure	shanell, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	11/28/2010 2:07:21 AM	Well I was started on this medication, because I became pregenant and have an issue with HBP. I was started on 500mg twice a day, then moved up to 500mg three times a day. This medication has helped some with my HBP, however I still lost the baby. I started spotting and still is spotting. I'm wondering if this drug had anything to do with me losing the baby???

Dosage was upped 500mg 3x a day after 8 months. It helped my BP...for a while. It stopped working, FATIGUE, mood changes, dizzy feeling all the time period stopped for 2months after final dosage increased. Liver function test show elevated levels and I switched to labetalol last week. My doc is testing me for Liver function, HEP B and HEP C which happen to be side effects. I will not recommend this drug for anyone.
High Blood Pressure	Amber, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	4/28/2010 4:33:26 PM	Started taking this medication because my husband and I wanted to try for a baby. Took it for 1 year and suffered through extreme fatigue, extreme dry mouth, muscle pains, lack of motivation, dizziness. Had no ambition to leave home at least not before a nap. Continued to take hoping it was best for possible pregnancy. Never got pregnant. After doing more research found this could make pregnancy difficult. Switched to Labeteol 2 weeks ago and still trying. So far side effects from Methyldopa are gone! Finally some energy!
High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/14/2009 12:16:47 PM	I started taking this med b/c we are trying to get pregnant, this one should be safe for my baby. After one week of taking twice a day, my BP was back down to 110/78. I have seen it as high as 174/102, so this is great news. The first 3-4 doses I did get a little sleepy and dizzy feeling but for those results I will sleep for a bit.
High Blood Pressure	Julie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/12/2009 4:04:08 PM	I was recently switched to Methyldopa in June of this year. My husband and I are planning on extending our family so this was a safe medication for me. I was currently on Micardis which I didn't like. Methyldopa has been fantastic. I have no side effects and my blood pressure has been great. 
High Blood Pressure	Dawn Anonymous, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	10/12/2009 6:43:34 AM	I started with 250 mg twice daily, and then after three weeks was moved to 500 mg twice daily. This was to decrease the chances of me fainting due to side effects. I have experienced dry mouth, dizziness, and a few other mild side effects but they always go away within 3-5 days. I am also trying to conceive, so I was switched to this from diovan. I recommend anyone taking it to up the dose slowly - it has really saved me a lot of trouble and now my BP is under control.

High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	9/18/2009 9:41:21 PM	I have been taking this for over 5 years.  When I was first diagnosed as having HBP I was trying to get pregnant, so my DR prescribed this.  Finally, after 2 pregnancies, I have decided to continue using Methyldopa as I have had no adverse reactions to it, and it seems to keep my blood pressure in the normal range.
High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	5/21/2009 1:32:32 PM	I had been taking Methyldopa because I have hbp and I also want to get pregnant. I have never been so tired in my life.  I am having trouble working because I feel semi sedated. Two weeks ago I was at a party. I was standing outside talking with a friend when I felt dizzy. I ended up passing out and fell back and hit my head on the cement. I went to the ER and after lots of tests they decided it was just the side effect from the medication.  I personally would not recommend it to anyone.
High Blood Pressure	Liz, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	5/7/2009 10:33:29 AM	This medication gave me rapid heartbeat and extreme shortness of breath. I was taking it for HBP during pregnancy, which is not pregnancy induced. I was on Lopressor when I conceived, but my MD switched me to Aldomet/methyldopa. I was on it for 10 weeks and had to be hospitalized because of the side effects it had on my heart. I was switched to Procardia XL and so far am doing great with no side effects.
High Blood Pressure	angela8999, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	4/9/2009 1:04:43 PM	my doctor put me on this med because i was trying to get pregnant. After two weekks i came down with every side effect- dizziness,extreme fatigue, headaches, upset stomache, confusion, depression, joint pain,swelling of legs, sleeplessness, and went to ER for dehydration. It took my doctor two weeks to figure it out after several antibioticcs that made me feel worse. She said it might take another week before its out of my system but I've never felt so horrible. 
High Blood Pressure	ccshin, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	35-44	4/2/2009 7:26:40 PM	I was put on this med when I got pregnant.  Previous med was Metopolol and worked well but was not safe for pregnancy.  I had a miscarriage in my first trimester (not related to meds) and stayed on the Methyldopa in case we got pregnant again.  I have not ovulated since the m/c and the Methyldopa is not controlling my HTN.  I just read the side effects list and it says it can cause difficulty getting pregnant.  I'll be contacting my doctor and asking for alternatives.

I will admit initally it was difficult remembering to take it three (3) times a day, but it just took it with each meal. My son was born healthy &amp; very happy.

During the month that I took these pills I experience dizziness, nausea, and I felt like I didn't have the strength to get out of the bed in the mornings. I am now back on my pills that I was on before and I feel fine.
High Blood Pressure	Jaynee T, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	11/18/2008 4:12:55 PM	I had never felt so tired or so dizzy since taking this medication. I could only manage one table a day opposed to two, driving was a nightmare and I used to  zonk out every night after dinner, and ache all over.My eye lids had started to twitch and I had frequent cramps.For some reason I had to stop wearing any perfumed products as my skin became sensitive, and my eyebrows fell out.My blood pressure is now higher than ever I am delighted to report I have been switched to something else...... never again!!! 
High Blood Pressure	madcat, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/27/2008 9:17:54 AM	I took 3 pills a day for a few weeks because I suffer from High blood pressure and wanted to become pregnant. It made me feel exhausted not to mention a lack of periods. I didn't have a period for 2 months and went to see my doctor only to be told the tablets were the problem.

High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	1/7/2008 10:27:34 PM	I take methyldopa (aldomet) for pregnancy induced hypertension (postpartum). Dr. started me on atenolol (100 mg) which didn't lower the BP enough, so she added methyldopa (250 mg, 3 times a day).  This worked.  I now take it only 2 times a day and it is still working.  At first felt very tired when taking it, but now I've gotten used to the drugs and have no side effects.
