Neck and soulder pain (swollen)on both sides of my neck.   As of today I am stopping this medication regardless of what my dr says.

My blood pressure was borderline high.  I believe it has kept my blood pressure from consistently staying in the high range.  However, after seeing family members with one symptom after another from being on various medications, and reading reviews on various websites, I really am going to put all my efforts into getting off of this and my other med, by losing weight and becoming more active.  Side effects from drugs are no joke.

I felt ill each morning after taking the first dose of the day. This ill feeling would last for 3 hours or so. Discontinued all BP meds and controlling BP through exercise. Current average is 126/80. My fasting sugar level increased while on this drug and it has not returned to normal after nearly four weeks without using it. I will not use this drug again.

High Blood Pressure	65-74 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5		65-74	4/17/2010 4:17:41 PM	I've had high blood pressure for about 25 yrs.  in early 2007 a 6 1/2 cm tumor on left adrenal gland was found and removed.  The adrenal gland has a big influence on blood pressure.   Over the yrs I have found that:1 - if on more than 2 differnet BP drugs, see a kidney specialist.  They are the true BP experts.2 - If you develope a cronic cough, it can be your BP meds, expecially Ace Inhibitors.3- I'm on Coreg and Micardis now and they are working for me.  I've tried the generic Coreg twice and BP went up, so generics don't always work. 4- Micardis, the small pills are very  hard to open.  I've recently been switched to the larger 80mg time release pill and they are much easier.   However, not sure they are going to work as well as the 40 mg twice a day.  Insurance co made my doc switch me.  We may have to fight it, if my pressure continues to be higher from time to time.  5 - It's important to take your BP medicine.  Don't be afraid to ask your doctor to try something else.  Not all drug work for everyone.  It's often trial and error at times to find the right ones for you.   Also what works great for a while may stop working.

Doc needs to submit extra approval for insurance to cover this.

About 1x/wk, I experience numbness in middle three fingers on both hands (turn white) and fingers/toes lose sensation quicker in cold weather---but not a big deal. Also, I have NEVER been able to rise early but I am popping out of bed 2 hrs earlier than my previous wakeup time! I do experience fatigue later in day. I might try something w/o diuretic as I can't seem to pass up a bathroom now. Packaging: I had brain lock at first but now find it easy to open.  Price: recommend you get &quot;Mycard&quot; discount card from Dr if you don't have; saves me about $40/mo, I think. Pain to enroll (15 min on phone for me) but worth it.

I took this for 5 months did not like what was happening.  I advised my Dr. that my hands were always numb and tingling when I woke up.  He attributed this to my many years of computer work.  So I continued for 2 more months until I could not hold my cup, bowl or anything until about 2 hours after I was up and about.  I am only 53 not 93. I told him I am not taking this drug anymore.  After 3 months the numbness and tingling has gone.  My bp is very good.  I only take caduet and that is working just fine.  Sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands.

I just lift the back from the corner or push the pill right through it. Can't think of how it can be improved. The medicine is great. I have been on it for at least three years and my bp has been consistently normal. Other meds have had side affects and my bp was up and down with them. Hope there are no long term side affects. Time will tell.

High Blood Pressure	 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	2	2	1	Female		10/28/2009 10:57:23 AM	caregiver for 76 yr old aunt.  You had better be really careful taking this med.  Aunt totally passed out, white, eyes rolled back, hospital dr said very low sodium due to many years on this drug.  Hospital dr. took her off it.  This was 2 years ago.  After few months regular dr. put her back on it for ankle swelling.  She has had dizziness, diarhea, confusion and kidney disease!  Last week back in hospital - very low sodium again!  This can cause death!  Hospital dr. took her off Micardis HCT again and told reg. dr. NOT to put her back on it!  Also many of you said to drink lots of water, but if you do you are FLUSHING the sodium, potassium etc out of your system and making the problem worse.  If you continue to take this drug drink sports drinks with electrolytes as well as water and have your sodium levels monitored.  In my opinion this is a bad drug!
High Blood Pressure	Pearlie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	55-64	10/24/2009 8:08:24 AM	I have been taking Micardis, 40mg.  and a separate hydrochlorothiazide pill, 25mg. I was taking the HCT before the Micardis was substituted for other drugs that were causing problems. Took the combination for about a year, and suddenly my blood glucose shot up very high, after always having normal readings.  My hair began to thin extremely, and my vision became blurry.  I thought I had read on the Micardis package insert that diabetes was one of the possible side effects, but my dr. denies this, and I cannot find this information again.  However, the side effects of HCT are listed as dehydration, dry mouth, thirst, hair loss, blurred vision, which I had all of.  I stopped taking the HCT, and shortly after, the dry mouth and thirst disappeared completely.  The hair loss seemed to be lessening, and hair might be growing back in again.  In the meantime, dr. will not stop the Micardis because he swears it has nothing to do with the glucose levels.  So I am still taking it, but worrying every day that I swallow that pill.  I am writing on this board to caution you about the diuretic portion of the Micardis HCT.  These symptoms sneak up on us and as for me, it took me awhile to figure out what was causing them, if I have.  I prefer to take the diuretic separately from the bp drug, as it gives me more control over the dosages and necessity for them. I will go on another diuretic and see if I can avoid those problems.If anyone has information about a Micardis package insert stating that diabetes is a possible side effect, please let me know.The Micardis is very effective in lowering my bp, but since I stopped taking the HCT, the bp has been a few points higher, but still in a pretty good range.  I will start Lasik, which I hope will bring the bp back down.  It was running about 110/70 or thereabouts.

I had good results within a few days of using it.  I did not experience any side effects, which is wonderful.  For the past 8 months, my medication had to be changed 4 times due to unbearable side effects.  The only problem I have with this medication is its price.  It is expensive even with my insurance coverage.
