I developed osteopenia (early bone loss symptoms) after years of oral predisone use and when my dr. recommended Fosamax 10 years ago I agreed to take the weekly medications as prescribed.  My bone density improved dramatically after just one year and I never had ANY side effects.  A few years ago I switched to Actonel monthly medications--still had no side effects.  When my insurance company increased the price of Actonel I switched to monthly Boniva and no side effects with this medication either.  I asked my dr. about all the bad reports of jaw necrosis and femur breaks and she said the studies where these side effects were noted were primarily done on older woman who had other medical issues and many had been on chemotherapy.  She said if I was healthy and had no side effects after 20 years of use, then I shouldn't worry.  I also take Citracal with Vitamin D, walk every day and am in good health and normal weight--a young 60 years of age!  My dr. has even stopped taking DEX scans annually as my bone density has improved so much. My mother had osteoporosis with a dowager's hump at 70 and shrunk 2 inches in height--she never took hormone replacement therapy drugs which contributed to the bone loss. I also have taken bio-identical hormones in the form of Tri-est compounded estrogen and that is also a contributing factor to my good bone health now I beleive.  SO DON'T BELIEVE ALL THE BAD REVEIWS OF OSTEOPOROSIS DRUGS-MOST OF THESE ARE BEING WRITTEN BY WOMEN WITH MANY OTHER HEALTH ISSUES AND/OR ARE SENSITIVE TO MOST MEDICATIONS IT SEEMS.

I had mild side effect after the first dosis and charged it to stress. After my second dosis I developed flu like symptoms, stomach cramps, diarrhea, and pain everywhere. Called my gynocologist but he just referred me to my PCP. The PCP prescribed Zantax, which I refused to take because the side effects also stated stomach issues - that I already had plenty of. I took my 3rd dosis this week and 5 days later I am finally able to sit straight, eat and function normally. The pain was unbelievable and I had work through it (unable to take leave). I spent my evenings sleeping and just exhausted from pain. I will not take Boniva EVER again. I thought I was overreacting but reading all these other reviews I feel normal - while many thought I was just overreacting. Very reassuring that my symptoms are not in my &quot;head&quot; but REAL. Not sure what to do next for treatment - I don't see my doctors as any help. Wonderful healthcare system :( NOT!!!

I was excited about going on a monthly schedule. Ads seemed so positive.  At first I did not realize that I was actually having side effects.  Within two weeks I was so sick. Flu like symptoms, bone pain, and actually felt like my bones were stretching in my legs. That sounded like a weirdo to me!  I did not connect symptoms to Boniva until it was about time for me to take the second dose. I was so miserable and could not tolerate any more of these symptoms. I have a full schuled working full time. I did not take anymore boniva.  I did not have problems after drug was out of my system.  Trying to figure out what to do now. Read so much about diet helping?
Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	12/30/2011 11:12:42 AM	I started once a month Boniva on Wed. Dec. 28th. in the morning. At 10:00 pm that night I had severe stomach cramps and diarrhea. By morning the cramps and diarrhea was still severe and I had flu like symptoms with a 102 fever. I felt horrible all day. It is now Friday morning and I do not feel any better. I can't eat anything without running to the bathroom. I am so mad at myself for not doing more research on this drug before taking it. My Dr. has not returned my calls. I hope this pain goes away soon. I won't be taking any more of this bad drug.

I have been on Boniva for 6 months with no ill side effects.  I also had a dental exam before taking the medication to make sure I have no dental issues and get baseline x-rays.  I follow the directions to a T.  I drink more water than recommended and wait over 60 minutes before eating anything.  I make sure that I am up and about for at least an hour (not lying down like the directions tell you not to do).  I have to wait at least one year for another bone density test to see if the drug was effective. I was very scared to take the drug because of all the negative reviews.  For me, the drug is fairly safe.  
Other	Miss Casey, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	65-74	10/29/2011 3:10:29 PM	I was told after my last bone density scan that I had osteopena, particularly in the hip area. Previous bone scans had already shown that I did NOT have osteoporsis. My doctor recommended I take Boniva. I am a fairly active 65-year-old - we ride motorcycles, we are avid campers, I had lost 30 pounds after recovering from treatment for rectal cancer and I was finally beginning to feel really good. Ride the motorcycle was a joy, getting on and off was no longer a major problem. However, I started taking Boniva and I took Boniva for the 4th time. Every joint in my body is aching - if I sit or lay too long I hobble like a really old lady when getting up. I said to my husband that I wondered if it was possible that the Boniva could be causing the joint pain and decided to look it up on Web MD. Much to my surprise, I find that I am right. I have taken my last dose. I will talk to my doctor about something else, but I believe they're all about the same.
Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	concerned_patient, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	10/28/2011 3:22:01 PM	I'm a 46 year old woman. Previous Graves disease patient. Now Surgically induced hypothyroid. My doctor told me that many hyperthyroid patients can suffer from premature bone loss so I went for testing. I was diagnosed with Osteoporsis (very beginnings of it). Boniva once a month was recommended. I read the side affects before I took it so I thought that it was possible to experience mild symptoms. I felt for the benefits it was worth some mild discomfort. I was sadly mistaken. After taking one dose I had severe stomache pains and indigestion almost immediately. Also within in 8-12 hours I had severe flu symptoms. I was bed ridden for 3 days. I felt feverish, sick to my stomache, skin sensitivity and my bones hurt. It felt like the worst flu I had ever had in my life. I literally laid in bed for 3 days before I was well again. After looking up reviews and other potential side effects online I decided I will not be taking this medicine ever again. If you research the other medicines they nearly all carry the same risks. I would rather take my chances with Osteoporsis than take the chance of jaw necrosis or being severly ill 3 days every month with excruciating stomache pain. You have to ask yourself how much of something you are putting into your body if it is only a monthly or bi-yearly dose. It only makes sense that a large dose of a medicine, which you do not know your body will tolerate, makes zero sense. Only a few months ago I remember seeing an article on yahoo about the FDA effectively recanting their support for Boniva/Fosamax. Stating that the actual effectiveness and saftey is not certain. Be informed!

Did fine all day then by 8pm the chills started.  Felt nauseated. At 2am awoke with a headache (very unusual for me)and very weak. Went to the bathroom and threw up. Layed on the bathroom floor because I was severly sweating and weak.  Took Tylenol for headache and went back to bed.  Today I have gradually felt better but still feel fuzzy headed and my shoulders are achy. They say that the side effects will go away after the first dose. After reading all the post here I am not going to give it another chance. One dose was enough for me. I am looking for an alternative other than the poison drugs.

I believe as a result, I ended up with Osteoporosis.  This was discovered after a DEXA scan.  The Dr. gave me my choice.  I decided on Boniva because it was only once a month, and easier to remember.  I have never in my life felt so horrible.  I've taken 2 doses..  The first dose, I had flu-like symptoms and bone pain for 3 days.  I took my 2nd dose 3 weeks ago, and thought I would have to go to the emergency room.  It's been 3 weeks.  I felt as if every rib in my body was broken and could barely sit in the tub my tailbone hurt so bad!  I felt like I had the flu, and still have been coughing up phlem.  I told my oncologist that I REFUSE to take another dose.  I am trying to figure out what to take.  Read this website SERIOUSLY.

It seemed like a perfect fit easy to use , ect. After my third pill,April 5th, I started experiencing pain in my hip that radiates down my right leg. The pain gets so intense it wakes me up at night and I have only been able to sleep 3 to 4 hours at a time. After reading some of the comments posted I have decided to quit taking Boniva. I have been to my primary Dr; the chiroprator, massage therapy and the orthopedic Dr. No one can tell me what is causing the pain, very frustrating. Does anyone know how long it takes for these symptoms to disappear? Would love to be able to sleep all night.

At first I didn't relate it to the Boniva, until now, a week later. I can't even get comfortable in order to sleep. As a matter of deduction of 'what was different' - I realized it started soon after taking the Boniva. So, I started researching and found this site. No more Boniva for me! Or the Alendronate Sodium that my doc just switched me to at the urging of Medco (as a cheaper alternative) after reading it has the same side effects.

My Dr. prescribed Boniva.  I took Boniva for 2 years.  In November, 2010 I was in NY walking a lot during the trip.  By the end of the 3rd day, I was limping and putting weight on my right leg was very painful in my thigh area.  After xrays by my orthapedic Dr. we discovered that I had a fractured femur.  This is one of the two main side effects of the osteo drugs.  I will no longer take any of the drugs, as they all have adverse side effects.  I am treating myself by diet and exercise.  There is a ton of good information for cases like mine, relating to the proper diet to enhance bone longevity and health.

Only now am I finding out why there was no improvement - I've been taking it wrong. Neither the doctor or pharmacist instructed me on the importance of a strict schedule, or fasting for an hour. I even asked the doctor if there were any special instructions, was told no. In the long run, it's my own fault, I'm responsible for my own health. I've been looking into alternative meds but so far all the side effects scare me. I'll continue to take Boniva but on the recommended schedule.

I started about a year ago with leg cramps.  Previously I had no side effects from the drug and was very satisfied with the results.  When I asked my doctor if I could be getting more than I needed she didn't feel that that was the case.  I did decide to take myself off after my Jan 3rd dose due to the fact the leg cramps were at night and wake me up plus during the day and I was an avid walker.  They did decrease after walking for a while.  I now am without leg cramps for about 1 1/2 weeks.  I do believe that you need to take a vacation from the meds especially after 5 years.

My mother takes Actonel and when I told her my problem with stomach pain she advised me to take it one hour before taking anything else by mouth.  The instructions say to take it 1/2 hour before taking anything else by mouth, which I had been doing.  Boniva is similar to Actonel in that regard, so I waited 1 hour before eating or taking any of my other pills and I have not had any stomach pain whatsoever.  So be sure to wait at least one hour before taking ANYTHING else by mouth.

The doctor then put me on Boniva.  I took 2 doses of that and also experienced severe stomach problems.  I stopped taking all osteoporosis medications but still have adverse affects.  Since then, I cannot take antibiotics or a simple baby aspirin without becoming very sick to my stomach with abdominal pain for days. I never had ANY problems with my stomach before I took these medications.  The doctor has said I will probably have to have antibiotic IV's from now on whenever needed.

I have had almost daily fecal incontinence for the 5+ years that I have been on once-monthly Boniva.  My doctor told me to try stopping it for a while to see if the problem cleared up.  I have been off it for only 3 weeks and my lower GI problem seems to have finally cleared up.  How great to finally have no more of that awful fecal incontinence!  I am supposed to let my doctor know in another 6 weeks if stopping Boniva helped.  I had the same sort of problems on Actonal and Fosamax, so I don't know what my doctor will want me to try next.  I am a small-boned caucasian woman whose bone mass went down a lot after I went through the menopause.  I think she will want me to take something for my osteopenia, but I don't know what other drugs there are to take for this.  I do have a friend who takes Evista for osteoporosis prevention.  She hasn't had any side effects.  Does anyone else have any experience with Evista?  Did you have any side effects?

It took me longer than that to associate Boniva with a whole different problem - my teeth started dying! And, after extraction of 1 then another (no more, ever!) I was suicidal because the pain was sooo bad.  Nothing helped and it went on for months.  The endodontist who did my root canal most recently *(3rd tooth to die) commented that it was really odd to see no blood in the soft tissue at all - also no cracks, no decay, no good reason for my teeth to die.  And this is now over a year after I stopped taking the drug.  (The first tooth to die was 8-9 months into treatment.  the second 6 months after that.  The third was the least awful - about 8 months after I stopped taking the drug.  I also feel a LOT of bone pain in my back, hips and legs.  At one point while on the drug, I reported to the MD that I could no longer pour myself coffee from a full pot.  She just said &quot;your labs are OK&quot;.  Dang! From an hour / day at the gym to unable to lift a coffee pot, and she thought nothing of it!  I feel like I have aged 30 years in the 3-4 years since I started the drug.  Feel a BIT better a year after stopping.  Oh, and my acid reflux has pretty well gone away, as well.  I was taking conflicting meds of Nexium and Boniva for over a year.

Face itching, swelling, tongue swelling, throat closed shut, had extreme trouble breathing, both arms went numb and pain was shooting down right arm. After 4 hours in ER, feel much better. I will not take this again. Please pay attention to these warning signs. If face and neck start itching, head to hospital, be most assured you will need them.

My body was sore, all my bones ached, my back hurt and I shivered with the heat on in the car, it was 80 degrees outside.  The next day the flu symptoms were replaced with recurring stomach pains, stabbing aches and I could not sleep, rolling and moaning with the pains.

There is no way I will ever take this medicine again. I've never had an adverse reaction to any medication. I am worried how I will work tomorrow and the week to come. The pain is debilitating not to mention the nausea and fatigue. I wish I had researched it first. I am miserable.

Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	Eleanor, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	8/7/2010 4:05:03 PM	I only took one pill and will never take another. The very next day I was laid up with what felt like flue and had chills and low fever. Next day and following 2 or 3 days I had trouble going up and down steps and hurt all over.  Those aches and pains finally went away after about a week, but 3 weeks later, I still have nausea every day and feel bloated. I would recommend anyone considering this medicine not to take the monthly dose.  At least start with a low dose, I wish I had. I have told my doctor I will never take it again.  I just hope not permanent damage has been done.

By the next afternoon I was crunched over and hobbling from the pain in my right rib cage. Today is Wed and the pain is still there, but more severe after I've been sitting or laying in bed for a while. I'm feel a bit light-headed at times also.  I won't take another pill. Diet and exercise will have to do it for me. (as soon as this terrible pain goes away).

Boniva did not help. Also, I am only 58 but in the same year I developed cataracts in both eyes that have affected my vision. Is there a relationship between cataracts and Boniva?

X-rays showed my hip has seperated from my pelvis! 1 inch. My osteoporosis is better but my hips are really bad!!

Although the bone density test (DEXA) shows that I am staying the same.  I was concerned about this, but my doctor said that as long as it isn't any worse that the drug is working.  I have no side effects that I am aware of.

I was taking darvocets, NSAIDS, and finally, Hydrocodone just to relieve the pain.  When I complained to my doctor about the extreme pain, she said &quot;Good, it is working!&quot;.  Well, no thanks, I do not care to be an invalid and doped up on painkillers.  The pain would always begin on the second day after taking the pill, continue to build to extreme pain, could not sit, walk, sleep, climb stairs, etc.  I used to walk two miles a day, at 3.5 mile pace, I'm lucky to get around my house, let alone feel like going anywhere.  I am a retired math teacher, and decided I can logically decide that exercise, diet, supplements do more to promote good quality of life, than to feel chronic extreme pain everyday.  I feel some relief now that I have not taken a dose for 5 weeks, am hoping that pain will gradually diminish as time goes by, I want to be able to enjoy retirement and be able to do more traveling and I don't mean in a wheelchair.

The cramps are bad and I have to take a laxative to feel better.  i've never taken laxatives before.  This medicine is not worth the benefit or $164.00 price with insurance for a 3 month supply.

My T-score was -2.3 on 2/25/08. Today on 3/19/10 it is -2.0. A good improvementaccording to my Dr. My insurance company will not pay for it any more not that they did before because it cost $100 for 1 pill out of my pocket so I have spent $2,400 for a .3 improvement in my T-Score. At this rate it will take me another 7-8 years to get my t-score below -1. and $8-10,000. WOW Pretty costly. I did develop some symptoms, bone pain, rapid heart beat( which they could not find any cause)that is scary. and heartburn/acid reflux, which is pai. My doctor has Rx'd Fosomax for me to replace Boniva but I don't think I want to chance jaw bone loss so I am going to try the good old fashion remedy of eating the right foods and exercising for one year to see if I can improve my T-score. I have been doing a lot of research and think that this may be possible. If not then in an year I will look at one of these drugs again. Hope this is helpful.

I could not lie down in bed for 4 weeks, could not get out of a chair without assistance or walk without pain. I developed plantar fasciitis in my left foot,heartburn, sensitive teeth and jaw pain, and lowered platelet count plus lowered hemoglobin.I am 55 years old and felt that I had aged 30 years. When I went to my doctor to report these symptoms, she had taken one dose of the medicine herself for lowered bone density and immediately developed the severe pain. She said that she will no longer take this and she took me off of it also. It has been 4 months since my last dose and all my problems have resolved for the most part. I feel an occasional burning pain in my bones and a little pain in my foot sometimes.I will not take this again. My doctor has greatly increased my calcium and vitamin D intake and with this plus exercise I will hope for the best.I reported these side effects to the FDA and I hope that something is done about these medications as many people have been hurt by bisphosphonates.

But in the end all that really matters is does it work. Alittle sick once a month or broken bones the rest of your life. Move around when you take it I clean, vaccum anything to kept busy it really helps.

After second dose I developed severe joint pain,difficulty walking,bending,unable to do stairs. Pain continues and I have gone from walking at a fast pace 3 miles a day to now using a cane at all times. I had to quit work as I couldn't perform my duties(I'm a nurse)as the pain is so intense.  I also developed severe foot and lower leg edema,shortness of breath which lasted for 4 months. The knee,hip and back pain has completely changed my life as I am now considered disabled per my doctor and now the state of WI. This drug should be removed immediately!! The side effects are terrible and lasting.  I continue with leg and foot tingling, inability to walk without a cane due to the pain. Has anyone with adverse side effects heard of any type of class action suit?  Do not take this drug.

The third month, several days after I took, I developed severe diaherea and vomiting.  Thought it might be food poisoning.  The next month, once again I had the diarrhea and vomiting lasting over 3 hours.  Totally exhausted, I just wanted to lie down on the bathroom floor and die.  After it happened again the fifth month, I finally connected the dots and decided it was the Boniva.  I stopped taking it and have had no problem since.  I would never take it again.  I have a nasal spray now for the problem and so far, it's been fine.

I take a nexium pill 1/2 hour before I take the Boniva and have not had any heart burn or other pains my only concern is and I am not sure it is from the medicine is that foods that I have always eaten sometimes do not agree with me anymore and I do get diarreha for a short time. I am just wonder if this medicine could be causing this.

Right away I had joint pain of the legs, feet arms and back.  Also had blow out diarrhea for the last 7 months. It takes atleast 4 hours for the diarrhea to quit.  My hands are swollen and tingly and feel like I slept on them all night.  I can't get out of  bed and walk in the morning.  I feel like I am 90-100 years old.  I am very tired and have weight gain. I was thin to start with.  I find that after eating I get stomach cramps.  I think most of the posts on here are negative which makes me wonder about the handful that aren't.  I think they should take this off the market and do more research before they kill someone.  Ijust found out a woman I know was in the hospital and they found out Boniva put her there.  If I were Sally Field I would not want my name attached to this.  I wonder if she even takes it or just endorses it?

I took my first pill that month.  The first morning I was fine.  That afternoon, I started with the diarrhea.  By the following day at noon, I couldn't move.  Every bone in my body hurt.  I have had pain &amp; muscle aches before but nothing like this.  I thought I was going to die.  It was intense bone pain.  It left me weak &amp; fatigued for another week.  I am now on my 6th pill &amp; the side effects are now hardly noticeable, except that I still have the diarrhea for 1-2 days each month.  I figure if I can reverse the bone loss after 2 years, all of this will be worth it.  My mother had severe osteoporosis &amp; I watched her suffer with it.  I will do what I can to not have to go through what she endured.

Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	10/30/2009 8:02:36 AM	I took my first dosage of Boniva two days ago as prescribed and exactly as the package insert indicated. Less than 24 hrs later, in the middle of the night, I woke with severe pain in my shoulder/back. I experienced flu-like symptoms,chills, low grade fever and body aches all day. At one point, the pain in bending over to pick up something off of the floor was unbearable. I had trouble getting in and out of bed. The gastrointestinal problems noted by most were not as much of an issue as the muscle and joint pain. Taking advil helped with most of the symptoms except for a terrible headache. I am feeling better on the second day, but yesterday was awful. Worst part was I called the pharmacy and the doctors office to see if my symptoms could be coming from Boniva and they said definitely not. I felt like I needed to go to the emergency room at one point before dawn yesterday thinking maybe I was having a heart attack with all the pain in my shoulder and back. Doctors office said I need to take it again next month to see if it is definitely the Boniva and not a bug, GREAT!

Have had no side effects except maybe stiff fingers every morning, started a year ago. But due to taking Depo-Provera for stopping horrible periods (DON'T EVER TAKE IT - CAUSES BONE LOSS!!) I keep losing Bone density. So Doctor wants to switch me to something else. But review for Reclast and Actonel sound awful. At least Boniva hasn't hurt my joints or GI the way it has other people. Don't know if I'll try another drug, or stop everything and take my chances with broken bones. ??

I feel like I did a hundred push ups on my legs because of the soreness.  I thought it was because I am suffering from osteo arthritis, but reading all these comments from the Boniva users, it appears that  it's all identical to what I am feeling now. I will definitely go back to my Doctor for re-evaluation. I just felt so bad because it is very easy to use.

Soon after I started taking it I started having pain.  It first started in my feet then up to my back and hips, legs, etc.  Because I had had back fusion in the past, I thought it was something wrong with my back or hips.  I went through MRIs, Xrays, steriod injections,and etc. I was told there was nothing wrong with my back or hips. Last pill was 1/1/09 I had to go off the Boniva for oral surgery.  My pains started to go away. It has been 7 months.  I am probably 80-90% back to where I was before I started.  Still have some pain.  In all the doctors I saw, no one put it together that it might be the Boniva.  Will not take it again or anything like it.  It's nasty stuff.

Bone scans have come back with differing results, nothing dramatic.I had to stop taking all of these drugs because I had pain in my left hip, then my right hip, that prevented me from lying on the left side mainly, and at one point, could not even go up stairs right because I couldn't put my weight on my right leg.  I was actually considering using a cane.  I had my leg xrayed but it didn't show anything because at the time I thought perhaps I had a fracture.  I think these drugs do cause musculo-skeletal problems that doctors won't admit to, and don't lead to great bone density results in every woman.  There is a lot of information on the jaw necrosis issue that can result from taking these drugs.  My dentist was horrified to hear that I had been on them in the past.  Thank God, my gums and jaw are all healthy.Well, be careful when taking any of thesethree drugs.

It has been four months since I stopped and I am still in pain...painfull getting in and out of a chair, a car or just normal chores. I feel like I am 95 years old and disabled when before I could do everything and anything before Boniva! Drug companies advertise and make money on a drug that is doing more harm than good. I hope the pain will go away soon. Has anyone had the pain leave them after a while? And how long did it take?

I started feeling very ill around 8 p.m. and @ 3 a.m. was awakened with SEVERE abdominal pain under my ribs. Within minutes had SEVERE diarrhea and vomiting. This morning 8 a.m. again severe abdominal pain and my arms ache. Wish I had read these posts before taking the $92.00 pill that poisoned me. I'll build my bone through diet and exercise. This pill has ruined my health.

I also developed severe lower back pain and flu-like aches. I will not take another dose. Reading these reviews made me feel a little better about my condition because I wasn't the only one having these side effects! Thanks!

I soon developed severe joint pain and pain in my lower back.  I couldn't get in and out of the car without excruciating pain. I had extreme difficulty going up and down stairs.  I also had spasms that would almost bring me to my knees.  I didn't connect the severe pain to the Boniva; I thought it was an extreme worsening of the osteoarthritis I've had for approximately 30 years. (So stupid of me!)  I read the reviews and took my last dose of Boniva approximately six weeks ago.  I feel somewhat better but I'm hoping for much more improvement.  I will never take Boniva again, nor recommend it to anyone.  I have yet to go back to the physician who prescribed it, but will make that appointment soon.  I have made no other changes in my life and now feel that my pain is caused by the Boniva.  Hopefully, a little more time will confirm that.

I followed the instructions and took with a 6-8 ounce glass of water and stayed upright for over 1 hour without eating or drinking anything else within this time.  In the evening, I developed chest pain and shortness of breath with an increase in blood pressure and heart rate.  I called a provider and was told to take ibuprofen for the pain and to call back if no better.  This morning, I called again and was told to take (2) Aciphex and also Pepcid complete this morning and tonight if needed.  I am misserable and cannot do anything due to the pain.  I think there has to be another option for me as I will never take this drug again!
Other	kkst, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	55-64	5/23/2009 5:05:22 PM	I have only taken one dose of this med. the first day I felt fine, but now about 2 weeks later I have daily been feeling like I have the flu and have just been really tired. I decided to read the reviews since I am usually very healthy without these symptoms.

I would get severe muscle spasms that would literally take my breath away. I will never take a medication thats only &quot;once a month&quot; again. If you get side effects you can't stop taking a drug to get back to normal.

Sat. afternoon I felt tired and slept the rest of the day. Sunday got up and showered to run erronds. After showering I felt very ill and weak with severe back pain. My last meal was on Saturday. It is now Wednesday and I have missed 3 days of work (5 days of my life) to diarrhea, fever, stomach pains, and weakness. Any food or drink feels like someone is scratching the inside of my stomach with their fingernails. A couple hours later the diarrhea starts again. I have lost 5 lbs since Saturday. I have no appetite or strength. I started this med with a good attitude-read info provided but did not check it out on line for fear I would be discouraged. Now when I was checking my symptoms on line (thinking I had the flu)I realize that I am in the same 'boat' as a lot of other people. I don't think my MD will be convincing me to &quot;try one more dose&quot;! I am going to just pray that I do not continue to feel double my age from here on. I also hope that I haven't damaged my gastrointestinal system.04-25-09
Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	grace, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	4/26/2009 12:58:56 AM	Took this for 11 months.I suffered searing &amp; burning lower back pain starting about the 2nd month, never connected the dots. Sitting, back seared. Walking, back seared. Turning in bed hurt.Getting out of bed I felt stiff, achey and shuffled liked I was 97. I was miserable, popping ibuprofen and quality of life declining.Dentist was the one who mentioned that being on Boniva put me at risk for jaw deterioration if I had dental surgery. After that news I started researching the drug on Internet and was shocked at what I learned. I decided to stop the taking it for 3 months to see if it was the cause of my pain. Within a couple of weeks improvement was DRAMATIC! Gone was the searing, burning pain and gone was the stiffness in my legs and shuffling out of bed. No pain turning over in bed.Still some pain when walking for long time. And still some pain and stiffness in my neck, but I feel so, so much better! Reason I give it a 3 star for Effectiveness as recent scan showed some improvement in spine, none in hip. I will NOT take this or any other similar drug. Done with it. I will take calcium pills and exercise. By the way,I tried to tell my dr. last year about my back and she was rushed and indifferent...as usual. Recently went to her and told her what I did..stopping Boniva.. and the DRAMATIC improvement I experienced and she had little to say. Time to find a new dr.! Dr's listen more to drug companies than their patients. If you are having back pain and stiffness in legs consider Boniva the culprit. I thank God for my dentist otherwise I'd still be on that poison! It wasn't very smart of Sally Field to put her name in support of this drug.

Have been itching, red spots that burn and turn into welts when I scratch.  Constant headaches, dizziness, dark circle under my eyes (Dr called them allergic shiners!), gastro problems bloating, arm, back and neck pain.  I have gone thru 3 boxes of zyntec and a steroid shot to no avail, trying to figure out what was causing these problems.  On no other meds and thus this product is the culpret!  I dont know how long this will last and am very angry that I was not informed of these possible major side effects. I have a sore throat, my tongue swelled up on Easter, it is not at all worth it!!  Would never recommend this to ANYONE!! 49 and was told it would be a good precaution to prevent osto, NO THANKS! Thank you to everyone who has posted, it helps to know that I am not alone, wish I had found this info before and never taken it!
Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	4/9/2009 9:09:14 AM	Because I have only taken one dose, the effectiveness is not known but the side effects certainly are!  I have been worried sick about this aching and stiffness in my lower back and also aching stiffness in my legs. The right rib pain just started. Getting in and out of the car or sitting for any length of time and I am groaning like I am ancient.  I am 47 and have never felt like this. I have the gastro symptoms as well, but not as bad as the others.  Will not take this anymore.  
Other	JeanMCR, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	65-74	3/20/2009 11:22:47 AM	I am a 71 years old male, with COPD, diabetic, and osteroposis.  I had to stop taking Actonel because my insurance company upped it to Tier 3 and it was hard for me to pay for it.  My first dose of Boniva was on Saturday a.m., by that afternoon I started coughing, breathing was worse.  I was put in the hospital for 8 days with severe breathing problems.  Along with the breathing problems, when I coughed up the phlegm, it was bloody. I, also, had a severe pain in my right side for several days while I was in the hospital which caused me to take pain meds during my stay. I never thought to tell my pulmonary doctor that I was on Boniva, until I came home and started reading the different reviews from people on your web site. I, now, am home from the hospital, spitting up blood, constipated, weak, not eating as I was before taking this med.  This is not a &quot;good&quot; med for people in my condition.  Won't take anymore of it.

Last July, I began experiencing excruciating pain in my back, hips, knees.  In August I ended up at the periodontist due to extreme pain associated with bone exposure at my gums (bleeding and trobbing).  I now need a gum graph.  I was told to stop this med.  It has been 6 months since my last pill and I still hurt - back, hips, legs, knees, but it is getting better.  I've always been in good shape and physically active, but this pill has given me a lot of pain, expense and agony.  I won't take it again.

Within 18 hours I experienced intense flu symptoms-hard chills, fever and every part of my body ached. Next day the raging diarrhea started. There is NO WAY I would be foolish enough to take a second dose.  Especially after reading about more potential side effects. I am surprised the FDA did not post more warnings about this drug. This stuff is toxic!

No side effects whatsoever--I guess I must be lucky, judging from others' comments. After 2 years, I had another bone scan, and there is marked improvement in my spine &amp; thigh. So I will continue with Boniva.

Post-Menopausal Osteoporosis Prevention	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	5	1	Female	45-54	1/1/2009 12:03:50 AM	I took this drug to ward off a possible future osteoporosis problem.  My mother died from osteoporosis, and my bones are smaller than her bones were, when she was a young woman. After taking the once-a-month pill for several months, I suffered a sharp sharp pain in my large toe joint.  When the pain subsided, I was left with a sizable bunion protrusion. I had never experienced pain in my toe joints before taking Boniva. Of course I stopped taking this drug.

It burns and itches like fire. It does not respond to steroid injections. Topical creams can only slightly make one feel better. I have awakened in the middle of the night so many times itching to the point of causing my skin to bleed. This side effect is only in 2.8% of the population tested for side effects. The rash covered even my scalp, but not my face. I would have continued this medicine if I thought it was safe but in truth, it is not. I know now I am allergic to this drug and will never take it again. I am looking for alternatives. To anyone out there who is suffering from this particular side effect, I feel for you.

Was put on Prednisone for 8 days, Zyrtec for the itching.  No proof that the Boniva is the cause of the hives, but there is not other explanation.   I did not eat nor drink anything to cause the hives, and the Boniva is the ONLY thing differently that I have been doing.   I am normally a healthy, non smoking 63 year old female.  I exercise and drink milk and yogurt, and take Calcium.  I am stopping BONIVA now!!
Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	12/10/2008 6:17:09 PM	I came to read user reviews because I am concerned about jaw pain that has been developing for the past month, but I now realize that I have been suffering from a variety of ailments since I began taking Boniva around early 2007: joint pain, acid reflux, hives (but these may have been caused by another drug since they began several months later). Apart from one brief episode of taking another drug for two weeks in August 2007, I have only been taking Boniva. All this time, I thought my ailments were symptoms of aging! (I am 56) But the difference in physical comfort before and after Boniva over the past two years has been dramatic.

I took this medication as a treatment for bone density loss for being on prednisone for six months (treating PMR).  First dose was on 12-03-08.  Within 18 hours I began having back pains.  Within 24 hours I could hardly roll over in or get out of the bed.  I had terrible back pain; shoulder pain; chest muscle pain; and stiffness in neck; flu like symptoms.  The next 48 hours just got worse. I now have pain in the leg bones, hands and muscle pain in back and legs.  I called my doctor to inform him I will not take another dose of Boniva and will seriously review all options before taking any other type of similar medication.

I truly beleive that Boniva is the cause for my discomfort. One years ago, I was a very active 53 yr. old. I can barely stand and fix myself breakfast, without experiencing fatigue and pain.. BONIVA HAS TO BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET...and the company that manifactures it, needs to be held responsible.

The lovable Sally Field commercials can work on your sub-conscious making you feel you should try Boniva but beware.  Boniva (bisphophonate) could be dangerous, even fatal. This healthy woman who practiced a perfect life style, never caught up in the &quot;health care system&quot;, suddenly is in a struggle for her life. One half of a Boniva pill in May 07, as a cautious approach, followed by one whole pill in June and the lights went out. If your doctor recommends any of the bisphosphonates class of drugs, Google Actonel, Fosamax or Boniva and read and study before you decide to swallow. These potentially dangerous drugs have a long half-life and accumulate in your body, increasing risk as time passes. Please warn people you love that might be frail, petite, thin-boned, sensitive to chemicals or drugs, or in poor health to avoid Boniva. In Japan Boniva is not promoted; and, it may be especially dangerous for small Asian women of slight build.  If you do take Boniva, eliminate orange juice and other acid producing foods from your diet, and do not take Advil or most of the other over the counter pain relievers, as I have read they can interact negatively with Boniva.  Being informed will help you stay healthy.

By Monday I grew very weak and develeoped fever and chills I could barely drive myself home from work.  I had severe pain in my cervical and thoracic spine and achiness in the lumbar, sacral and coccyx region.  I experienced strong pain in the muscles in both arms, upper back, jaw joints. My fingers and toes of my right foot also hurt. There was numbness in both of my pinkys and ring fingers.  I had generalized weakness and poor balance. My vision is also effected.  I have a gross increase in gas and bloating.  I am 53 yet with all that I am experiencing with one dose of Boniva I feel as though I am well over 100. My strength has been zapped.  I strongly would not recommend this drug to anyone.

My OBGYN, the idiot, didn't know the drug has the same basic componet as the others that caused such a reation before. I am now 3 days out from a single dose (150mg) and can't eat. I have constant heartburn, and terrible chest and throat pain. My Dr. isn't answering my calls as to how to treat my stomach and esogaphagus condition. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.

On Mon I awoke with severe nausea, chills, extreme body aches, stomach pain and a fever in the pm. This lasted for 2 days. On Friday my body aches have become more severe. My back hurts so much I don't like to take a deep breath. I have lost alot of time at work this week and am wondering if I will ever be the same again.

I would never recommend this medicine to anyone. How long does this agony last?

I have experienced almost every side effect there is listed with back and chest pain being the most prominent. The gastro effects were awful also.

I am 54 and never had bone pain before in my life.  Since taking my last dose, I am experiencing bone pain in my long bones of both legs.  It seems to go from one place to another.  I also have some sort of gastro problem.  If I eat certain foods, I will have pain over my entire abdomen that lasts about 1-2 hours. I am not sure about the gastro events, but I know that the bone pain has to be related to my Boniva. By the way I take exactly by the directions. I will be talking to my Doctor about another treatment.

After taking my 2nd dose in 07/08 and again experiencing upper and all-over stomach pain, nausea and a general yucky feeling, I have determined that Boniva is the cause.

Each month I continue to have bone/joint pain. Most recently I experienced severe hand and finger, foot and toe pain. The pain in my fingers is so severe that the joints appear to be swollen. Really want to stop this drug and take my chances with broken bones.... I can truly say that all the pain, reflux and indigestion is really not worth the benefit. I have not had a second bone denisity, I will take my chances. No more for me!

Presently I am being tested for Celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome.  I do not know if this drug has benefited my osteoporosis or not since I have not been re-scanned as yet.  Seriously considering discontinung to see if I can eat normally again.

I do not yet know how effective it is, but this side required entering a rating for effectiveness so I gave it a 1.  Side effects are noticeable, but my physician is insistant that I stick with Boniva.  Side affects did lessen some on dose #2 &amp; #3, but do still occur.  I find myself not wanting to take it, but continue to do so knowing that the presumed result is worth it.

I took Fosamax for 2 years and it worked fine but I like the ease of only having to take it once a month.  I wait 2 hours after I take it before I eat or drink anything and take it with plenty of water.  So far so good.

I'm now waiting to do Physical Therapy at home.  I will never take or recomend this med to anyone.

I will be seeing my family doctor this Monday to rule out flu, but I don't think this medication is for me.  The side effects kept me out of my job for 3 days.  I couldn't even get out of bed the first day. I going to ask if there is any other medicine without these side effects that I can take to treat the Osteopenia.

Also within about a week of taking the pill I am experiencing a mild pain in my bones and feel somewhat stiff. I am only 28 and have never had bone pains - I am taking this medicene because a recent bone scan revealed that I have osteopenia. If this pain gets any worse or lasts longer than another day or so then I will not be continuing this medicene.

The pain increased over the next two weeks and gradually decreased.  I still have severe pain in my knees after almost a month.  I will not take another dose.

I felt like I had been hit by a truck.  It lasted for about 4 days.  I talked to my doctor after the first dose but she said it was a rare side effect and to try another month.  I did but I'm through now!

My lower left side became tender and felt like I was being stabbed.

I tried Actanol and Fosamex with side effects of joint and chest pains.  I hope this continues to work for me.

Now I have developed severe upper gastric symptoms (reflux, burning, painful swallowing).  These are all side effects this medication.  I haven't taken any for 3 months but my symptoms have not gotten better.  I am pretty certain this medication caused the GI problems that I am now having.

After reporting this to my doctor, he has said to discontinue the drug and see if the reflux problem subsides.  I never had experienced this problem on a nightly basis before. I'm pretty sure it's the Boniva.
