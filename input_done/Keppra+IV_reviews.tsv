Apparently, keppra causes these side-effects in 20% of those who take it!  Please be aware of the awful side effects!

The one thing is bad is that I have to take keppra twice a day, one in the morning and one in the evening. I just hope to get off the med one day.

I have been on Keppra for a while at a wide range of strength/dosage(small to large amounts). It has been quite helpful. It was first added as an additional drug - I have had 3 other drugs. It decreased and sometimes prevented the seizures. At one time, for about 1.5 years I only had to take Keppra at a low strength and didnt have a single seizure. However My seizures came back recently due to extremely high stress for a an extended period of time (Stress= #1 cause of seizures occuring). As of now, I am on a high strength of genetric Keppra (4000mg daily) with an additional Rx. The most notable side effect  of Keppra is that my emotions are sometimes applified in certain situations: anger/frustation/anxiety. I have had applified happiness too, but not frequently. Overall I think its fairly effective.

Unfortunately, that was the ONLY good thing about it as Keppra actually made me have seizures at least twice a week and Tegretol let me go almost a month without any. Explain this if you can: Keppra INCREASED the number of seizure triggers to include  some startling noises (such as the phone ringing). As if that was not bad enough, I got the side effect I had been warned about - severe anxiety and irritability - and was lucky to not get fired from my job. What a shame because it did have the two benefits I do not get from Tegretol, no blood tests and no interaction with my birth control pills. Now I am back on Tegretol because the Keppra did more harm than good the whole time I took it and much better both physically and mentally.

He was given htis drug the second go-round. I have noticed that he seems to not remember alot and for the very first time he did not obey staff at his school and kind of being &quot;snippy&quot; towards me, this is not like my &quot;A&quot; student. What is going on.
