Parkinson's Disease	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	5/16/2008 4:05:02 PM	husband developed a VERY BAD  rash from the patch.  Had to take him off the medicine and then we received notification that patch has beepulled off the market.  What happens to the HUGE amount of money we paid as our co-pay for part D coverage for 90 patches??  We paid out of pocket $264.25 and Part D plan paid for us $429.75 and this put husband into the dough hole so that now we are into the part of paying 100% for medicines.  We need assistance to return these patches we have and reimbursement so that on fixed income we have a little to use for more medicines which are very expensive and hard to pay for on very, very fixed income.

But the if you missed ONE doseConditions grew WORSE! To the point of uncontroled body spasims. Legs, Arms, Torso,Was referred to a neuroligst. The previous doctor was treating the symptons. The neuroligst found the cause.   LOW IRON  He also said of REQUIP....It's POISON!  NOw I am on these patches and something for sleep at night. In just 2 days I can feel a difference. They are weaning me from requip with the Neupro patches; and say it could take 6 months. Meanwhile, I am to take an iron pill daily.   NEW DRUGS  PEOPLE BEWARE

Since I have had Gastric Bypass most meds don&quot;t disolve properly in my stomach.  This patch has been wonderful.  After a year of suffering I am now feeling normal.

I am having a lot of difficulty sleeping at night.  Overall the treatment is better than adverse reactions.

The effectiveness of the patch appears to weaken at times. Sometimes I have to assist it during those times with additional meds.I am a regular exerciser and have found that sweat is definitely a problem. Need to design a more effective releasing substance and adhesive combo. Overall, I like it.

After about 12 hours on legs were restless again.  But biggest problem was a reaction.  I developed a bad case of hives.  Not a good choice for me.

The higer dosages put me to sleep a weird times. I was told to use a lower dosage .  Works just fine. Fell better than I have in a long time.  PS WE Must Have Stem cell Research, we need a cure not a patch.ivwasctold
