In order to benefit from this disease always see a Endocrinologist.  Take vitamins to help, but check side effects before taking.  You are going to almost take this meds for the rest of your life, but YOU MUST exercise, drink water and limit your intake of food.  I am 63 and in the last 4 months, I notice weight loss, more energy.  Also STRESS level is also important.  You will notice that weight loss is extra hard, so if you use to exercise 30 min a day, you will have to increase to 45 minutes and at least 5 days a week.  We all sometimes don't like exercising, but remember we can't blame the doctor if we don't follow his advice.

Underactive Thyroid	Waiting, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	8/12/2012 7:34:35 PM	On this medication for 16 months. Had more energy for about 3 months. Then felt tired and weak all the time. My dose was increased, then I felt even worse. Decreased my dose, not an improvement. I am considering stopping this medication. It is of no benefit at all. Also I have had a weight gain of 10 pounds since starting. Cannot seem to loose the pounds. Does anyone know of a natural alternative or a better medication?   
Underactive Thyroid	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	8/12/2012 4:57:50 PM	I've been taking this medication for three and a half years with a 125mg dosage for the last two or so. While I have gone a long stunt without the medication, so I know how it feels not to have this treated, I am not really satisfied. There are so many thyroid related problems that I still suffer from although my t4 and TSH levels are normal and have been for a long time. While there are many problems that are at least some what elevated, my symptoms are in no way gone. I want to be normal again. A better treatment needs to be found.

I have been on homeopathic medicine for almost a year...now taking levothyroxin....started with 75Mg and now after last blood test the dr's moved me to 125Mg. I had developed numbness in my left arm, hand and side...now since I have been taking the thyroid medicine levothyroxin i have been experiencing dizziness when quickly standing or sudden movements...this is not a regular thing...is this due to the thyroid not working or due to getting the thyroid on track again with the levothyroxin

I take it like the dr said no food for 1 hr before or after I take it with a full glass of water. Take it at bed time. So far I have noticed I have A LOT more energy!!! Before you couldn't pull me out of bed before 10am on the weekend and by lunch I was taking a 3 hr nap! I have been waking up ready to go about 8am on weekends and when the alarm clock goes off I'm ready to go! I have another appt with my dr in 7 weeks for more blood work. I have to say I have the most amazing dr EVER!! Dr. Anthony Scott Greer in Auburn, ALabama. He listens, and takes his time when in the room like I am the only patient he has for the day. I think a dr like that is VERY important to ANY treatment!! I will post more if I have any other problems or if it continues to help... 
Underactive Thyroid	zachpeter, 65-74 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3		65-74	7/15/2012 12:11:55 PM	I have been taking Levothyroxine oral for a little over 2 months, just increaed the dosage from 25mg to 50mg.  I notice my pulse rate increased, can't tell if my hair is falling out, because it's been doing that for the last 30 years anyway.  I do feel a little tired, however I force myself to go for a bicycle ride daily and keep my weight down.  I do feel a little stomach discomfort.  I will have to tell the doctor at next appointment in 2 months.  Otherwise I fell okay.  I can't give 5 stars until I'm sure it's done what it's supposed to do. &quot;Whatever that is&quot;

I have never before had any of these things on such a regular basis and I definitely do not feel entirely well.  It is a big disappointment to me that the medication has not made me feel healthier.  Until the symptons leading to my underactive thyroid were diagnosed I hardly ever consulted a doctor, preferring to deal with minor health issues by using 'natural' products, homoeopathy and acupuncture.   I have not investigated the use of acupuncture for this condition and would appreciate any input available on this.

I usually take Synthroid, however, recently my doctors office forgot to write &quot;dispense as written&quot; and I was given this generic drug. I thought I was dying. I had body aches and joint pain, loose bowels, racing heart, insommnia (no sleep for days at a time), caffeine made me sick all of a sudden. I was a mess until I finally asked my doctor why she had given me this drug instead of Synthroid. She immediately new that was what was causing me to be sick and put me back on Synthroid. It took a couple of weeks for me to feel normal again but I'm fine now. They should take this drug off the market.

I wound up in the hospital after have a severe allergic reaction to it. I was on it 20 days and it almost killed me. I felt good for the first 72 hours and then after that I felt worse than I did prior. Mood swings, stomach issues, complete loss of appetite, memory loss, joint pain... I felt like I was dying, essentially I was. Good thing I didn't start taking it at night, I was going to that night before, I would have died.
Underactive Thyroid	Nana, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	5/23/2012 11:05:35 AM	After having been diagnosed with Iron Defiency Anemia and going thru 6 Iron Infusions 2 months ago, I was feeling like a new person. I had been so sick for 2 years and turns out my doctors weren't taking my Low Hematacrit numbers seriosly. Now, they say I have low thyroid(even though I feel great)so they put me on this medication a week ago. As each day passes I am feeling sicker and sicker. So weak I can barely move around. Aching muscles, numb hands and feet, bad cramping, stinky urine, and today short of breath. Called doctor...says NOT the medicine. Yeah right!!! Called again today and said I am stopping the med. Still waiting to hear back from him. I know my body well and this med is nasty. Also causing me to have low blood sugars and screwing up my coumadin levels. I felt so good before taking this. Today I am having a hard time getting out of bed. Legs feel like rubber. Like many of you, I am going to seek out a natural way to deal with the problem. Quality of life is very important for me and right now I have none. One thing I have learned after finding out that for 2 years I had anemia and not one of 3 doctors I saw picked up on it, is that doctors are not always right. If I don't stop this med I am going to end up in the ER. Wish I had come to this site before I started it!!!

Brought this up to my doc he says that it is normal until we find the right dosage for me. Apparently this issue runs in my family. My dosage has been increased three times now..haven't experienced the hair loss that I read about but I did get crazy heart burn when I started on it and when my dosage has been up'd... the only downside that I've noticed is the weight gain. I still eat healthy and have an active life still but 9 months down the road I am 40 lbs heavier.. yuck!

The only symptoms I had was weight gain and being very tired and weak. I am 52 yrs old and had menopause when I was 46 yrs old so I can't be sure of other related symptoms. Doctor said I need to loose weight due to being on the edge of type 2 diabetic so I am hoping that the increase in mcg will help me lose weight. I don't know why I have low thyroidism.

Every 6 weeks I had my dosage raised slightly and each time felt better for a month or so then I would slide back into feeling bad. About 6 months ago we added T3 on top of the T4 and I have felt somewhat better though not at 100%. I am currently at 125 mcg levothyroxine and 25 mcg liothyronine.

I feel so much better in many ways. I'm warmer, my heart rate is up where it should be, my mood is better, etc. The negative side effects have been constipation, hair loss, and insomnia. The constipation and insomnia are going away, but my hair is still falling out. I've lost about 1/4 of it. My doctor just put me on a lower dose, so I hope that will help. I read that the hair loss is usually temporary.

Saw another doctor in regards to they thyroid only - she did not offer any alternate as her bloodwork was within normal range.  She obviously failed to see the extra 50lbs weight I happen to be carrying around my body!!!

I  never had flashes during Menopause!  Going to a new doctor next week and hope to get off Levo! Find a doctor that looks at the whole picture and doesn't treat according to the TSH!

Started at a lower dose, now at 88 mcg. Other than having to wait 1 hour before eating breakfast, I am very satisfied with my results. I'd taken meds for depression long before starting levothyroxine but noticed no difference after starting it. Also was very tired before and discovered I also have sleep disorder &amp; CPAP has helped a lot. If you are still having problems, keep talking to your doctor. I needed to increase my dosage a couple of times and treat other problems to get my life back. I now sleep well, have energy and am slowly loosing weight. 
Underactive Thyroid	cassvap, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	3/22/2012 2:53:32 AM	I am a 30 year old female, and I've been on Levothyroxine for about 6 weeks. I have subclinical hypothyroidism, but I have every symptom except the dry skin, so I was put on Levothyroxine. I started at 25 mcg, and felt exactly the same. I've been taking 75 mcg per day for about a month, and the changes have been pretty subtle. The only negative thing that happened was that my throat felt tight for about a week. I can feel it doing that when I work out, too. It felt like that lump in your throat you get when you're trying not to cry. I do feel slightly less fatigued, and my heart rate has evened out. I'm also a little warmer, and it's not as hard to leave my warm shower in the morning. :-) I have been a little hungrier, but my weight is dropping every so slightly. I was hoping for big weight loss, but so far it's barely moving. I've spent years trying very hard to lose weight, so I'm hoping it will finally happen. I'm very surprised that these pills didn't have any bad side effects for me, because normally my body freaks out if I start taking anything.

I found out I had an underactive thyroid in Nov 2011, &amp; my TSH level was critically high at 92.52. After taking levothyroxine 100 mg daily for less than 4 months, my TSH is completely normal at 1.79. Since my thyroid problems are caused by Hashimoto's Disease, I will need to take this medication daily for the rest of my life, which is somewhat annoying but made much better by the fact that I've experienced how incredibly effective it is.This medication is slightly inconvenient to take since it must be taken on an empty stomach, &amp; you can't eat an hour after taking it. However, it is so worth it because I have much more energy, have lost weight, &amp; my hair quit falling out!

Marked improvement in overall health. My dosages continue to increase though to due to gradual weight loss (not because of meds, but because I can finally exercise - no longer fatigued). Make sure you take regularly and see your doctor as soon as you feel like it doesn't work!!

I'm cold all the time, depression has become really bad, heart pounds, and can't sleep.  Have lost 35 pounds without being on a diet - just have no appetite/no interest in eating. Latest blood work shows T3,T4 and TSH levels within parameters, but I feel terrible.

Started having hot flashes from the start-4-5 during the day, 4-5 during the night. Have not gone away during therapy. Can't think of another cause because I too am done with menopause x 5 years ago.
Underactive Thyroid	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	2/11/2012 11:22:56 AM	Taking 50 mcg daily. I have been having hot flashes that started when I started taking this medication.  I have already gone thru menopause, so this is unsettling. Otherwise I have tolerated the medication and have had more energy, less forgetfulness.  Have not lost any weight-even gained 5 pounds despite exercizing and eating as healthy as possible. I hope that this is not the start of more weight gain!  My insurance company is trying to dispense Synthroid instead of levothyroxine.  Is that safe to switch??

Everybody body reacts differently and that is not fair to any of us for you people to just say it doesn't work because we're all different. All i can say so far is even though its only been 2 days i feel much better as far fatigue goes, I have been sluggish and little hair comes out when combing for the last 2 years being untreated but now it feels great 2waking up not tired, no side effects yet and hope to stay this way, hope everybody is being honest about there side effects because it does say if combined with certain medications it can/will casue side effects!

Higher dosages improved TSH marginally (down to 4.18) but felt worse than when initially diagnosed.  Spent most of the day in fetal position in bed, unable to  function.  Most miserable time of my life.  Finally convinced Dr to Rx Nature-Throid after much research.  Some people cannot convert T4 to T3 effectively and need a T4+T3 Rx.  Too bad levo is the first choice for most docs and they resist prescribing T4/T3 like Armour or Nature-Throid.  Getting off levo changed my life for the better.

Initially I felt better and symptoms improved.  I am still doing well overall, but lately the leg pains and fatigue have returned.  I am due to have my first blood work today.  Maybe I need an increase in dosage as my body has gotten use to the first dose by now??  I guess that's why they do regular bloodwork :)  I have not had any unusual side effects, I am tolerating the medication well.  I do take it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. Drink a small glass of water with it-the pill does tend to stick in the throat as it is not coated.

Underactive Thyroid	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/8/2011 11:24:03 PM	After being on levothyroxine for 4 weeks I feel so much better.  Mental fog has gone away-things seem so much clearer now, brighter, more colorful.  I'm better able to concentrate, less forgetfulness.  Fatigue is gone. I feel like I am the 'energizer bunny'!  I have energy that I have not had in years.  Leg pain/aches are gone too. Constipation is much better.  Was not expecting the awful smell of my urine that first week, but that has now gone away, thank goodness! I take the medication when I first wake up on a empty stomach with a glass of water, then fall back asleep for a while-or-get up and shower and read the paper until an hour or more has passed before I eat breakfast. I still take my vitamins/supplements but make sure that I wait at least 4 hours after I take the levothyroxine.

I'm 29 now.  I haven't noticed any hair loss.  Keep in mind that you need to take it for 30 days and need to have your blood levels taken again.  Many of the symptoms that people complain about are syptoms for OVER active thyroid, so it could just be an adjustment period or that your dose is too high.  Diarrhea and nausea are symptoms of OVER active as well.  I did have adverse reactions to certain varieties of the med.  For example, synthroid made my face swell up for some reason.  Levothroid irritates my stomach more and Levothroxin seems to be the best for me.  So, that may make a difference.Many people switch to taking it at night, because you need to drink it with water, have to wait 30-60 minutes to eat, and can't drink coffee 60 minutes before or two hours after, because it's a diarretic.  The reason why you can't eat or drink diarretics with this med is because it needs to sit in your stomach for a while to work.  For people with stomach pareeses (nerve damage in the stomach that slows the digestion process) you need to be careful to give it extra time.  However, I find that if I take it at night, I struggle to sleep.  Taking it in the morning, before my shower allows it to kick start my system a little.Iron and some other vitamins can prevent the body from absorbing it properly so be cautious.I'm a 29 year old female, with type 1 diabetes, stomach pareeses, underactive thyroid, excema (from throid issue), chronic anemia.With this medication, my emotions and mental health state are much improved, I am less irritable and moody.  I also have more energy for several hours after taking the med, but it does wear off.  Weight wise, I've never noticed a difference, but without the med, my ankles and lower legs swell.  The thyroid gland sets your metabolism with the thyroid hormone, but it also regulates a lot of things in your body, like breathing and blood circ.

My bad because I did not research, but I did not know until a couple of weeks ago this could all be caused by levothyroxine.  I believed my doctor when he said there were no side effects.  I hate it!

I started off @ 112mcg and now down to 75mcg. I trust my doctor thoroughly. My Yearly exams since my first diagnosis have been wonderful. I am not getting worse. I only imagine i am getting better. I do lose hair in the shower, but who doesn't? My weight has really not changed(and i hope it doesn't) my weight fluxuates from 97-103lbs. My last physical was a few weeks back and i weighed 97lbs. I've always been a pretty tiny person. I have been depressed since my sophmore year of highschool, and i do not feel it is thyroid related, its a completely different disease on its own. Since I've been on this medication i have noticed i do have more energy (when i am awake) especially if I've had  coffee! I do sleep in whenever possible. If my alarm is not going off i am known to not wake up til sometime in the afternoon. &amp; i'm okay with that. I hope this helps some of you..

As an &quot;informed consumer&quot; I researched both disease and drug.  I was scared to death and would not take the med.  After talking to my brother-in-law and my best friend, who both take the drug, I decided to try it.  Well let me tell you, It is like coming out of a coma.  I'm 62 and thought all the aches and pains were age related.  I had been lethargic and borderline depressed for some time, and had let my housework duties go because I just didn't have the energy to do them. I started this med 5 days ago, and have about killed myself everyday making up for lost time.  My energy level is through the roof and I actually sing while cleaning.  If I could dance and do housework at the same time, I would.  My advice to anyone who's doctor says they need this med (my count was 5) please try it.  Everyone is different and reacts differently to medications.  I wake up about 6:00 AM to take it then take my other meds around 10:00AM and have had no ill effects.  My hair is NOT falling out.  I also take Colestid, Ambien and Motrin with no problems.  Be smart and follow your doctors directions.  
Underactive Thyroid	polabear, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	9/27/2011 8:49:49 PM	Dr. put me on 25 mcg for 1 week them upped to 50. At 25, had no side effects, but as soon as I increased the dosage, I would have abdominal cramps, pain in my back like being punched in the kidneys, severe depression and no energy at all.  After a week of suffering, I decided to get a 2nd opinion.  I feel maybe my thyroid problem may be due to iodine deficiency. Am going to try iodine supplements. Fingers crossed.  This isn't living.

Yikes. After 4 weeks on 100mcg Levothyroxine TSH went down to 14 ! Yes, I would say it works. And not just in numbers, for me. I feel much better.The first 2 weeks were rough as my body adjusting to the rapidly dropping levels,I experienced the worst of my symptoms.Now, at 5 weeks out, I have been able to finally lose 2 lbs, and am SO happy about that. It's a great start and I'm being retested in another 3 weeks.

I have been taking this drug for 3 yrs and before that Synthroid for 3 yrs. Both drugs have side effects so make sure if Levothyroxine had too many side effects try Synthyroid. I had to switch due to dizzy spells and this drug is better for me. I also take 175 mcg a day so I am in bad shape. Drs. don't always do what is best for us and we need to study and review this drugs ourselves. If you have the disease you need to do a lot of research especially if you don't feel right. Don't take the drs. word. If they won't listen to you get a SECOND OPINION! Our whole endocrine system depends on our thyroid! Take care of this situation. Good luck.

My levels are now even at 112mcg.  I eat less, exercise everyday and have been able to lose 30 lbs in 6 months.  I have had no ill side effects from this medication and I tend to have ill side effects from most medications.  The only thing I find annoying is the waiting to eat breakfast.  To counteract that I take my pill and then work out for an hour.  Works Great!
Underactive Thyroid	giggles, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/18/2011 12:26:31 PM	I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease 15 years ago and had been taking 75 mcgs for that period of time. I was in remission until a few weeks ago my levels increased and I have to increase dosage. This medicine does work, but you have to do your part as well. Eat healthy, exercise and get your levels checked as often as necessary. Over the years I've maintained my weight (I have high Cholesterol also) and walk at least 6 days a week. Not everyone is the same on where their levels need to be, but once you find what is good for you it's worth it.

I had thyroid cancer and a total thyroidectomy 3/29/2011. RAI 5/20/2011. Put on 75 mcg 3/28/2011 for almost three weeks and began to feel better after about 9 days and then hit rock bottom again. SUFFERED with Anxiety, panic, fear, sweats, insomnia, exhaustion and on and on. Finally went to see my MD. He was amazed that I was only taking 75 mcg with no thyroid tissue at all. He increased it to 150 mcg. Feeling better after four days, (at least no thoughts of suicide) but still not myself and some anxiety which I control with clonazopam as needed. Someone suggested Lavender essential oil drop unbder pillow at night and one drop on wrist and ankle for anxiety. I will try that as well. I am scheduled for more blood work in a few weeks. I may need to increase it to 200 mcg. I am wanting to increase it a little at a time so I don't get too much. I take it as soon as I wake (which is early)with a full glass of water, then do my relaxation and meditation ritual. I don't eat or drink for at least 30 minutes. I cannot stress enough your communication with your doctor. My ENDO dropped the ball after the RAI.

At first I was started on 25mcg, then progressed to 50mcg, then settled for the rest of last year on 75mcg.  About 2 months ago I started feeling the old symptoms gradually returning, so I went to the doctor and asked for a blood test and my TSH had risen to 9 so he gave me an increase to 100mcg and I am now settled again at this dose.  Finding the right dose of medication for you is the important key in feeling good.  I am thankful I was diagnosed and put on this medication and I cannot imagine life without it now.

Before I started the medication, I already felt severe fatigue and loss of energy. I read most of the reviews and have an understanding we all have a different  body chemistry and we will all have a different exp. from meds. and I have a great Dr. with a great relationship. My TSH values on last blood draw were 5.76, out of range by 1,56. I was already putting on weight and my cholesterol shot up between last 3month blood draw and my testosterone went way down.  We have doubled my testosterone and now starting the Levothyroxine Sodium 50mc with an OPEN MIND and Hope.. I will keep you posted. I am a 48 year young man who has been HIV 25 years and suffer from a degenerative spinal disease, and have had 3 surgeries already that requires pain medication. I am grateful for everyone reviews and will update mine as I see what the progress is, follow up blood draw in a month. I gace 1 star to effectiveness and satisfaction because I do not know anything yet, Today being my 1st dosage, so do not count those as rlevant scores.

My doctor put me on 75 mcgs. and I feel so much better.  I have been on the medication for over a year and am still at the same dosage.  I don't like the fact that I have to be so regimented with the timing of the meds but I'll do it if it means I can continue to feel like a whole person again.

What a difference.  I have so much more energy than I have had in a long time.  The first few days I was a bit lightheaded and nauseous, however that has gone away.The only negative is having to take each morning and having to wait before eating or having any dairy etc.So far so good, hoping that it continues to help.

My primary care dr.just upped my dosage from 88 to 100 (4th change in dosage since I started).  He partly did this to see if it would help my metabolism because of some other health issues I am having.  My main concern now is that I also take Nexium and I noticed on the label for this medication it says to wait four hours before taking an antacid!  This morning I took it really early and then waited three hours before I took my Nexium, will have to get into a new routine!  Anyhow, I still have problems with fatigue.  I have been losing weight steadily, especially since the latter part of 2010 and I have not gained it back.  I am hoping the higher dosage will help with fatigue and am curious to see how my thyroid/diabetes dr. feels about my primary care doc upping the dosage.

I don't feel any benefit to taking this medicine, yet dr warns me that I must.  I was losing weight until I started using the med.  I haven't been able to lose the weight inspite of starting a diet/exercise regimen.  T3 and T4 levels are checked.  Yet, my feet are always cold, rapid heartbeats, tiredness. As of tomorrow, I will no longer take it.  I do NOT feel well and want to go back to being myself (energized, active, etc.).

Before i started taking it i was quite a crab, i was loosing a lot of weight, shaking, unable to think clearly,and  depressed. During the first six months after taking it I started feeling better except for mild hair loss. Well recently i have started gaining weight(10 lbs) i feel bloated, having trouble breathing, mood swings, anxiety attacks, i cannot stand being cold, i have hot flashes at night, cannot sleep, muscle pain, my spine feels like it cannot support my body. I feel like i am going crazy at times. I hardly want to be around anyone because of it. At times i just want to crawl in a hole and die.

Then as the weeks went on I started feeling worse and worse.  I am extremely anxious and have bad mood swings.  Called my doctor about this and she was surprised to find that I was on the generic form of Synthroid which is what she had prescribed for me.  She submitted a new prescription to my pharmacy.  Can't wait to get off of this medicine and get on the name brand.  I understand it is way better.

I have noticed that I am not as tired and I am not losing as much hair as I was before I was taking it. I was considered borderline before taking this medication and started on 50 MCG. I am in the middle of checking to see of this is a good dose for me. The only kind of scary thing is that I have noticed my heart racing at times when I'm not really doing much of anything. And when I am exerting energy I feel more short of breath, which I will ask my doctor about. On another good note, I have lost 4 pounds since starting. Don't know if it is the meds only, or because I have been watching my diet and increase my exercise.

I started eating healtheir, walking everyday and in the course of a year and a half I lost 75 pounds.  I have been able to keep the weight off.  Now I've been told I have a low thyroid.  I started taking 100 mcg of this med and I feel terrible.  I started gaining weight, losing more hair than normal, starving all the time, hot then cold, my skin is really dry more than normal, craving foods that I never craved before, tired all the time but have trouble sleeping and mood swings seem to be worse.  I caled my doctor and I was told my levels were fine now and not worry.  Thinking about taking myself off it.  I swear I felt better before starting it.  What do I do?  I need some help?

I had my thyroid removed two months ago and still have not felt a single symptom. I was very nervous at first because I am young and will be taking this medication for the rest of my life, but my two sisters had their thyroids removed as well, ages 13 and 15. Now my father, myself, and my two sisters are all taking Levothyroxine and we are all doing great!

Underactive Thyroid	FaithPickett, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/8/2011 9:27:51 AM	During a physical, my doctor noted that I was a little low with my thyroid.  She suggested this med (50 mcg).  I noticed a difference within a week.  My energy increased and was more alert.  A year later she felt that I could tweek it a little more.  I agreed to try to see if I noticed any difference in the way I felt.  We increased to 75 mcg.  After about 2 weeks, I noticed even more energy and less brain fog. I've been at this level for about 6 months.  I have noticed  a few anxiety symptoms and some muscle spasms, but I don't know if it's related.  For those for whom this med is not working, I would recommend checking the t4 and t3 figures.  This med is the inactive form, and if your body does not efficiently convert it, you may need the active form.  Talk with your doctor.  Also, there may be other issues involved and not the thyroid.  For example, gluten sensitivity.

Switching dosage throughout because i never had felt normal even though my levels say they are. Had seen lots of different docs, even a specialist and still no help. My life has been upside down for quite sometime now. My marriage is a rollercoaster. I feel sorry for my kids and husband because of my terrible mood swings. I am a complete wreck! My weight is up and down, dry skin, loss of hair,and hands and feet always cold! I have to wear socks to bed! I switched dosage again to .150 and my life got worse! I hate everything and everybody! It seems like there should be more help out there somewhere. I know theres lots of people that feel like i do. I wonder sometimes if there is a more serious underlying condition besides the thyroid. Because it seems like no matter what i do, nothing works! If you are like me and cant afford health insurance, how much can a person do? I wonder if it has something to do with  my pituitary gland or my brain for that matter! Im out suggestions and need of an answer. I deserve to be happy and live a normal life! This is ridiculus. Im just tired of feeling like a test rat. I need to find answers.

Dr. refuses to order T3 or T4 tests. Have heard by MANY that levothyroxine is not as effeftive as synthroid (another synthetic.) May need armour. Friend is having great success with combo of cytomel and synthroid. Having terrible symptoms, depression, hair loss, fatigue and always cold. PCP dismissive of my concerns. Need to dump him, get new PCP and find a decent endocrinologist. Diffficult to self-advocate when feeling bad and invalidated. Some Dr.'s really don't care.

While I wouldn't say that the excess weight is melting off, the meds do make it easier for me to lose weight while dieting and exercising.

Underactive Thyroid	rgolden, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/13/2010 7:48:26 AM	I have been on this for 4 months now. It started off with some side effects like dry mouth, coldness and some irritability. I was so scared because of all the negative reviews but, I must say I am so glad I stuck with it. I am slowly losing weight just watching my portions and walking several times a week. My energy level is up and I feel great. My &quot;brain fog&quot; is getting much better and I am no longer experiencing the extreme coldness that would come and go before. If your side effects aren't bad then let your body adjust. It is all about what medication works best with your body.

After reading the reviews I am wondering if it will make me gain more weight? Just started 50MCB today. Will have blood checked in a month to see if I need to increase or decrease. 
Underactive Thyroid	skeptical, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	10/3/2010 9:12:53 PM	I had been on levothyroxine for several years when I stopped last fall due to a case of H1N1. I felt so bad, I could not keep anything down. One week turned into 6 months, during which time I lost 15 pounds without much effort at all. At a visit to my doctor this summer, he put me back on it due to low levels in my blood. Within 1 1/2 months I have put on 12 pounds with no change in my eating/activity level. I am puzzled over the claim that going on the levothyroxine will &quot;help you lose weight.&quot;

Underactive Thyroid	Clark, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	9/11/2010 8:09:45 AM	I have taken this medication for at least eight years. I have been on some type of thyroid medication since 1990. I seem to have plenty of energy and am usually very sharp mentally. Typically, I am able to put in 14-16 hour days with little fatigue. Generally, I wait one hour before eating breakfast.  I try to also refrain from coffee  during that same time period. The key is to incorporate the regimen of taking this medication into my daily routine. I try to always figure in a one hour lead time before I  eat breakfast. Eating breakfast consistently also seems to help. I usually eat Kashi cereal and fruit for breakfast.

Other	curtsgal, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	9/7/2010 10:09:21 AM	I am a 25 year old mother of 2. I have been on this medicine for about 2 months and my hair falls out in hand fulls (my tubs drain clogs every day!) I feel like I have to sleep constantly and I have a 6 month old that tells me NO! I am not happy with it at all. The only thing it has done for me is my thyroid is not swollen as bad now. I do not have any energy either. My Dr. says that I have to wait to let it work but why do I have to wait so long? I can not wait because I don't have any one that can take care of my baby. No one will help me either, because I have a medical card because I lost my job because I over slept all the time so they fired me. I don't know what to do.

Underactive Thyroid	Relieved!, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	8/27/2010 2:28:25 PM	I went from being literally non-functioning, constantly bone-cold from the inside out and lethargic before starting my levothyroxine in 2006, to being comfortable, healthy, and able to maintain my weight with no difficulty.  My dosage has been slowly but steadily increased over the past 4 years, probably due to an increase in physical activity (because I now have energy).  My Dr. told me that I'd never feel completely &quot;right&quot; since I'm relying on a medication to regulate my hormone levels rather than having my thyroid do the job, but overall I am the best I've been in years. I don't know what I would be doing now if I had not been diagnosed and placed on this medication.

Underactive Thyroid	golden, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	8/13/2010 10:37:55 PM	I have been taking 25 mg for 2 months. Before this medication I was tired all the time, irritable, had serious brain fog and had gained weight that I couldn't lose. Now, I have more energy, less brain fog and the doctor put me on Atipex to control my appetite and help with weightloss until I find my proper dosage. It takes time and it's an adjustment. They are increasing me to 50mg now, we will see how that goes. Hopefully I will just keep getting better.

I remember when I first started taking it.  For the first few months I had severe nausea and headaches for a few hours after taking it.  But that eventually subsided.  I've gained more energy, lost weight and am no longer depressed.  Although, I hate the wait time before I can eat breakfast.  While I've had a great experience with Levothyroxine, others have not.  Please just give it a chance if your doctor want to prescribe it to you.  Take a chance on feeling better.

Underactive Thyroid	Jackie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	7/14/2010 8:21:33 AM	I start to feel hot,weak legs, a bit shaky &amp; need to sit down about an hour after taking my tablets.  This lasts all morning. My TSH levels have been within the normal range so I assume this is a result of getting my thyroxine dose for the day in one go. I assume that naturally the body would maintain homeostasis so the correct dose in &quot;normal&quot; people would be maintained as needed.  I also feel often tired in the afternoons after eating (a couple of slices of wholemeal bread &amp; homemade soup).

It is the worst when it's HOT and living in the south I am covered from my knees to my neck. At first it caused blotching which has since become permanant brown blotches and red rash's when I get heated, even alittle. I had seen an improvement in energy the third and fourth months but since not sure I am any better off. I am going to stp taking the medication and start using Sea Salt which has alot of pure minerals that will help in leveling off my hypothyroidism. I will spend the extra needed to by &quot;Himalayan Sea Salt&quot; 352 563-5200 is were I order mine.

So guess I will try this for now and let you know what I think of it. I am 50 yrs old and female.

Large doses of this medication, especially with diet pills, may cause symptoms of toxicity.

Lost hair by the wads in the shower, skin dried up, lips dry, skin iched, migraine head aches so bad I'd throw up, I was a mess and thought I was dieing. The dr just caught my thyroid in time to start it up again. With in 2 days after taking this med I thought I died and went to Heaven, no joke. Remember, I was in a depression for 3 years could'nt work. It will be a year this month since on this med. Here lately I've been having my feet swell and the lower legs feel like I have rubberbands cutting off circulation from the knee, on down to toes. Dry sinuses, dry eyes and sore throat. Sometimes my skin looks like round red patches on arms &amp; legs. When I got married I wasn't stressed at all, but my pictures showed hives on my neck, weird! I don't have very much hair lose anymore, I have lost 10lbs of water weight and I'm happy on that part, but I'm like all of you....still seeking a natural way to get better. I'm going to pray cause my God will lead me to a better med. I'll be praying for all of you. Take care of yourselfs! And on another note, I'll see if we have to really be on this med for life, I just think the dr's are lining there pocket books. P.S. Don't drink the tab water, it has to much floride/cloride in it and will delute your meds, go with distilled water!

Underactive Thyroid	LWE, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/1/2010 12:44:46 PM	Six months after having my son, I started on 50mcg's, then tested 6 mo. later and was increased to 75mcg's. Levothyroxine has worked for me. Increased energy and some weight loss. I exercise moderately, eat a balanced die, and follow the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist/med.label. Only other meds I take are BC pills. A year later, I have had no side effects.

I have been on it for 3 months now and have no noticable side effects.  My TSH has decreased to normal range now so it has been effective. I have lost weight (16 lbs) and am less tired, however I also exercise on a regular basis now so I know that helps A LOT. I take it as soon as I get up in the morning so that I can eat breakfast about 30-60 minutes later. It has been beneficial for me.

Serious Decrease in Thyroid Function	inam, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	35-44	4/24/2010 9:19:03 PM	Hello again, been taking over 200 to 250 mcgs daily for over 25 years since i was ten. It is best taken whilst you are just hitting the pillow with a full glass of water on an empty stomach. as you sleep, it will distribute itself around your body much better. You have to eat exceptionally well. Avoid coffee and anything that is heavy on the liver and kidneys. If you have a candida infection, start to include herbs in your daily diet, thyme, oregano, basil, rosemary, and any other anti fungal, anti bacterial foods you can get your hands on. Vitamin B12, zinc, vitamin C rich foods are required for the levo to work properly. To protect your kidneys, drink the water left over from boiled rice as a tea. Drink white and green teas. Those of you on high doses, use lavender essential oil to control the palpitations and insomnia. one drop under your pillow works wonders. If you legs are aching and restless, add one drop of lavender essentail oil to good light virgin olive oil and massage into your legs. rub tiny amounts of lavender essential oil on your wrists and ankles to ease anxiety and sleeplessness. Eat porridge made with a mixture of equal quantities of wheatgerm, oats, barley flakes in skimmed milk cooked well. this will cure you constipation. Eat plenty of low fat yoghurt. avoid soya. drink plenty of water, 2 litres plus if you can. avoid saturated fats. start using herbal teas like chamomile, peppermint, etc. Get yourself some detox teas. Milk thistle supplemnts, or preferably drink milk thistle tea every other day and your liver will be protected. to help with the hair loss, use zinc supplements. For more energy, use vit b complex. Smokers, eat plenty of brocolli, don't take iron supps along with this med. Watch out for your calcium levels. for more advice email me, inam26@hotmail.com. You drs wont tell you anything because they are simply not trained to grasp endocrinology. expect them to be tight lipped about everything. do not be fobbed off. ths drg cn mk or b

When I was at 200 and 225 mcg my mood changed drastically..bad mood mostly, anger, fear, nervous. Ive been taking 250mcg for four weeks and feel wonderful, loosing weight, happier mood.  I guess the symptoms dissapear once you hit your target.  I drink it first thing in the morning, then wait 2 hours to eat or take any other meds..on an empty stomach!! Hope this helps!!

My Dr started me on 50mcg and i could tell it was trying to work (i would feel great one day and the bad the next) i did my blood tests and she increased me to 75mcg and it has been a miracle worker i feel so much better!.  I am still very sensitive to hot and cold temps but i take it everyday and eat 30 to 60 min later.  I haven't had any side effects.  All I can suggest is to listen to your Dr and take the meds according to the directions

Still rating effectiveness as '3' since I have not had follow up blood work yet, will have that later this week.  I feel great and I have lost 14 lbs although I would probably say it's mostly because I have increased my physical activity and am changing my diet (all for the good!)I was very frustrated before because I would gain like, 12 lbs a year for the last 10+ years (yes, that is A LOT of weight!!) so treating underactive thyroid is serious business!

They should discuss with their physicians. Not tell people reading these reviews it doesn't work.  I have been taking the drug for over 20 years. You take the pill in the morning with a full glass of water then eat after 1 hour. I have had no side effects of this medication whatsoever.

I have felt no side effects, I do feel less tired, especially in the afternoons, but I have also increased my physical activity.  I only rated effectiveness as a 3 because I have not had follow up blood work done yet to check my TSH level.  I take this in the morning so I have to wait until after lunch time to drink milk or eat any other calcium-containing foods.  Overall, no side effects for which I am glad.

Underactive Thyroid	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	2/2/2010 12:15:04 PM	I had been taking this drug starting 12/21/09 since I could not get Armour which I had been taking for five yrs which I felt good on.  After one wk I notice a cramping in the muscle around my knee on one side.  It progressively got worse to more like a charlie horse cramp which was there constantly.  I had the same trouble with the brand name Synthroid.  So the people I see on this websight complaining about muscle aches/cramps you are completely right!  I am now looking for another drug to take after going off this medication and using the rest of my supply I had before going on this drug in December which was Nature Throid which I had to substitute for Armour.  Something is not right with the shortage of Armour in this country, but my pharmacy has no answers or my doctor for the shortage. I feel I don't have many options and my pharmacy and medical profession doesn't really care about our welfare, you have to take your health into your own hands and research medicines and then bring them up to your doctor.  I do the best on a combination of T3/T4 like Armour provides.
Underactive Thyroid	sd, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	2/1/2010 9:43:34 PM	I started on 150 mcg 8 yrs ago.  I am currently on 188 mcg.  I switched from synthroid to levo 1.5 yrs ago and have noticed no difference between the two.  Overall this drug has worked very well for me.  I strongly suggest that if you have severe symptoms that you seek help from an endo.  My endo discovered nodules that was causing problems for me.

Underactive Thyroid	pediladi, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/30/2010 12:15:14 PM	I was diagnosed with hyperthyroid in 1983. Had 95% removed, didn't take any meds for years, then finally got a dr. to put me on Armour Thyroid. I saw a new endo dr. last week. He was upset that I was taking Armour &amp; put me on Levoxyl 125 mg. In July  I went on HCG for weight loss &amp; lost 47 lbs. was NEVER able to loose weight working out 3 days a week with a trainer &amp; watching my food. My levels are too low now, I think the weight loss has affected my thyroid. Im loosing lots of hair &amp; am freezing all the time. After reading all these blogs, Im not sure I want to go on this stuff. Im not taking Armour right now, they  took it off the market for awhile, I hear its back. I ordered on line a natural one, am going to see if I can get the Armour again.  Im NOT going to gain weight after I just lost it!!
Underactive Thyroid	Beejay, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	1/28/2010 8:18:55 AM	I have been reading these reviews and would like to add this..I too  am having muscle aches in my legs. My Dr. also says it isn't my meds. I have been on 75mg for awhile now. I would like to think just because one person doesn't have this side effect another can't. Anyone else?
Underactive Thyroid	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	1/24/2010 8:41:26 PM	I have been taking this since 1996.  Works for me, but dosage has gone up and down.  I had trouble sleeping &amp; had leg cramps, but my Dr checked vitamin D levels.  There are links to thyroid and vit D defficincies.  I feel much better now with the right dose of levothyroxine and vit D.

I was constantly tired and at my age Im set in my ways its coffee once I open my eyes but instead I have to drink a bottle of water and just sit for the first hour tends to put a cramp in the way I do things but most notably I spent the entire day in bed two days ago sleeping and now I cant sleep the last time my eyes were closed it was for less then four hours and to make that even worse I now have diarrhea. I hope all this gets better soon.
Cancer of Thyroid	25-34 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	3		25-34	1/18/2010 1:23:10 PM	I have been taking this medication for 18 years and will continue to take it for life, I think that all medications have side effects due to chronic use but there are no alternatives to losing your thyroids  to cancer, at age 12 I was given this medication for life and will continue to take them even knowing that I will probably have liver and heart problems in the future, I already have kidney problems and have had to change my life style, but it beats not having a life at all. so I thank the doctors and scientists who continue to improve this medication for the people who depend on it for life like myself.

My surgery happened because the test indicated thay my thyroid was cancerous, but after removal my thyroid was not cancerous.I take my medication daily and for the most part have very few side effects. My hair has some shedding and once my my level was low I experienced shedding of hair, dry skin, and brittle nails, but when medication was increased symptoms went away. I do sometimes experience bouts with constipation and diareah.

Those of us who have experienced weight gain need to do some serious workouts that will help. Please make sure the Dr keep an eye on the thyriod. I had cancer in mine.
Underactive Thyroid	Rae M., 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/9/2010 10:58:34 PM	I was diagnosed in 1994 at 32 years of age. I had a lump the size of an apple in my throat. I ate anything I wanted, lost 20 lbs and had heart palpitations. Was Diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Was given a dose of radioactive Iodine. Lump went away in two weeks. Within a month I gained 40 lbs, hardly ate and felt tired and sluggish. Was then diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Was put on levothyroxine 125mcg. Hair falls out, skin is dry, adult acne, night sweats, diarrea/constipation and haywire cycle. Lost the weight when they stabilized thyroid. It takes about a year to get it stabilized, so do what your doctor tells you. Get your blood tested every 6 months (more during the 1st yr). I only feel bad if I miss taking the meds for one day. The weight gain will decrease, unfortunately the rest hasn't. I don't take any other meds and have no other medical problems. This disease is hereditary. I know several people who also have hypo &amp; hyper thyroids. They do not mess with their meds and do not have any other symptoms other  than the ones stated above. Even those with severe heart and kidney problems. So the other problems mentioned in other reviews must be because of some other medical problem. Not taking this medication the way it is prescribed or not at all can cause serious problems, even eventually death. I recommend this drug if you need it. If you are feeling sluggish, you may need to have it increased, If you are felling anxious and having heart palpitations, you may need to have it decreased. I went about 4 years with no medical insurance, but made sure that I did what I was supposed to do for my thyroid disease. I don't feel like dying yet.

PLEASE PEOPLE DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE IGNORANT PEOPLE WHO DO NOT FACTOR IN OTHER MEDICATIONS AND OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS!

Prior to that, and even today, I am not able to wear a turtle-neck shirt because of that choking feeling.  The medication has taken away the choking feeling.  My thyroid is still swollen and I still experience fatigue so I have asked my doctor to increase my medication to 88 mcg so I hope that will make a difference.  I will start that dosage tomorrow.  I am very tired and also hope that will be relieved.  I stay awake for ~12-16 hours/day.  Vitamin D pills also helped a lot w/ my enery/sore muscles/flu-like issues.

I am post menopausal and I have hot flashes and insomnia sometimes.  I thought it was from menopause but some of the other posts have the same symptoms/side effects from the drug. My concern now is that I have recurring episcleritis (inflammation in right eye), itchy and peeling left toes and a rash of sorts underneath my breasts.  These all seem like an inflammatory response or maybe drug toxicity.  Anybody else have anything like this.  I didn't have any of these problems before being on the drug. I am generally very healthy so these symptoms seem strange to me.

I came on line to see if others are feeling this way.  So, I really don't want to rate the drug completely, yet.  Will discuss these issues when I see my doctor in Jan.  Joint and muscle ache seems to be getting worse.  ??  Is it from the drug?

The meds have increased my energy level, but I have not seen a significant amount of weight loss. I have not had any major side effects - only my face feeling warm from time to time. I also had some lower back pain, but it was due to my bed/pillow. Once I changed that, the back pain went away. Overall I'm very happy with how the meds make me feel.

I have finally managed to get my cholesterol down after 20 yrs. to 174 w/Crestor. Have panic disorder since '93. half of thyroid taken out in '05 for a cold node &amp; gained 40 lbs in wks. For the past several months, been losing hair, nails brittle, fatigued, etc. Blood tests showed abnormally low thyroid so dr. put me on this. It's supposed to take about 2 months to kick in so I've been living w/side effects, esp. hot flashes &amp; I'm 61!!Worst thing is dizziness. Dr. is getting a call in the A.M. - this is not right!! 2 weeks of this &amp; I'm going out of my mind. Unless he can give me a med. that doesn't cause dizziness, I'll live with the underactive thyroid - I may end up bald but anything is better than this!!!

And the muscles in my legs have been like rocks..spasming. I have had muscle spasms in my back also.  The only relief came when I stopped taking it. By mid day the muscle pain was gone, and by evening, the dizziness was gone. Pharmacist says it would be a stretch to blame the med, but... I say, feeling is believing!

I went to see an Endocronologist yesterday. I did not need lab work he was able to look at my previous tests that were done by my regular MD and diagnose me. My TSH level has been up in the 3.5-4.5 range he said it needs to be down to 0.3. My TPO antibodies have been as high as 1800 and recently down to 600 the normal range is 0-34. He said they will most likely never be normal. I have what is called Hashimoto disease which causes Hypothyroidism. He just increased my Levothyroxine from 75 mcgs to 88 mcgs. He told me the weight gain which is not from the meds but from the disease itself. I have to start exercising and walking again. Hopefully, I can shed some weight.

Underactive Thyroid	Chiara, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	11/13/2009 10:48:43 PM	I have been taking levo for a 1 1/2 years. I was having sleepless nights with hot flashes, hair loss, and the weight didnt come off like I hoped it would. The hair loss and sleeping issues subsided in 2 months but no weight loss even though I was running 4 miles 4 days a week and doing lots of resistance training. After 6 months I was convinced I was not taking enough being on only 25mcg (the lowest dose). After many failed attempts with my doctor to increase it, I switched doctors. My current doctor has increased it first to 50mcg and now to 75mcg. I quickly lost the extra weight I had gained and have not felt any of the side effects I felt over one year ago. My test are still in a good range and most important... a range that is good for me.

As time progressed not on the meds, the only symptom I felt was the weight gain, I weighed myself every week and the # of lbs did not change, but my clothes were definitely fitting tighter. I went to the doctor 6 weeks ago to get my TSH levels tested and they were up to 22.49. So, I went back on the meds, my clothes are fitting better but I have had about 5 migraines in the last 6 weeks...I have to go back to get my levels tested again soon.

They have now discontinued Armour and have gone back on Synthroid.  Again, terrible side effects include headache, all-over muscle pain, nausea, heart palpitations, itching and insomnia.  I really need to find Armour thyroid; it worked great!

However, since starting the medication, I have had increasing trouble with insomnia.  Every time my levo prescription was increased the insomnia got worse.

I was put on 50mcg/day then in March my levels were still up so I was put in 75mcg/day. Started having some chest pains, nite sweats- peroids were messed up. So in September/2009 an ultrasound revealed that the thyroid had shrunk in size and was conistent of that related to Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. My labs also revealed that the function was way low to .01 - so theEndo doctor reduced the prescription back down to 50mcg/day. I just had lab pulled again and now my levels have soared up to 11.61. Now my doctor wants me to do 50mcg/day -Monday thru Friday and to take 100mcg on Saturday and Sunday. Had I had not labs pulled for surgical procedure- who knows what my levels would be at- my Endo doctor was not gonna do labs again till March of 2010. The Endo doctor didn't want to pull labs again for another three months and I told him that he can pull labs again in six to eight weeks- Has anyone else been put on a regimen like that- so much during the weekdays and another dose on the weekends? Should I seek another opinion?

I don't care what the dr. says I just go by how I feel. anyway I don't have health insurance now so am self-medicating playing it by ear buying the med overseas, until I can afford to get health insurance again (maybe in 2014!)

Definitely this medication has made me gain unbelievable weight but i have steadily skipped sundays and got it lowered. I am also trying a much lower dose of about 37.5mcg engineered by myself and if i dont stress myself working for 30 hours straight I can stay awake. I dance and praise the Lord vigorously so the sad/depressed part of my life prior to the diagnosis is non existence. I'll say its been beneficial since I used to sleep for at least 30mins driving for many years while driving, but I want a natural remedy, if my body is a living tissue, it should be able to correct itself in Jesus name.

No heart issues, but then finally they discovered LOW thyroid. I couldn't believe it took that long to diagnose. Then, I was on 50 mg of Thyroid, then 75, and after 2 years (now increased to 100mg) I have continuously GAINED weight, feel tired, and sometimes tightness in chest.  Going through periomenopause at the same time (don't know what came first) and still have the sweats at night (don't know whether from the thyroid pill or periomenopause...they confuse the two).  There MUST be another way to get the thyroid in shape, a healthier way, than going through weight gain due to meds (don't let the dr. tell you it isn't true....I have NOT changed my eating and excercising, and the ONLY thing that has changed is my taking the thyroid pill and maybe menopause)  I believe this med causes weight gain in some...not all...but it definitely does NOT agree with everyone.

I TAKE IT IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP ABOUT 20 MIN BEFORE I EAT AND THERE ARE NO SIDE EFFECTS THAT I CAN REPORT. THIS MEDICINE IS WORKING I HAVE HAD BLOOD WORK DONE BEFORE AND AFTER TAKING IT AND MY DR. SAYS IT IS DOING WHAT IT IS SUPPOSE TO. WITHIN THE PAST 3 MONTHS I HAVE LOST 21 POUNDS WITHOUT REALLY EXCERSISING A LOT. I WORK AS A WAITRESS SO I WALK ALOT BUT THAT IS ABOUT IT. IT SEEMED THAT THE WEIGHT HAS JUST FALLEN OFF AND I HAVE HAD MORE ENERGY DURING THE DAY AND I AM NOT AS COLD AS MUCH WHICH BOTH OF THOSE ARE SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE. THIS MEDICINE HAS REALLY WORKED FOR ME AND I DIDNT EVEN KNOW WHY I WAS OVERWEIGHT OR ANYTHING BEFORE 3 MONTHS AGO. I HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE.

I was diagnosed in July 2009 and after the 1st month I notice a 10 lbs. weight gain.  Im only 42 and work out 3 times a week and eat right!  Im currently on Lisinopril 40 mg and hydrochlorothide 40 mg to control my HBP.  I was in denial and refused taking a 3rd drug for the remainder of my life, so I stopped!  Since then Im truly feeling it..  Chest pain that's very annoying, dizziness as if I'm going to faint, increase in heart rate, and swelling of face, lips, hands and arms for no apparent reason!  Now of course my symptoms doesn't occur daily but when it does it truly freaks me out!  I've been to the emergency room several time and had CRT, EKG, blood work, you name it and they find absolutely nothing!  It just dawned on me last night after not being able to sleep from pain and swelling that my thyroid was acting up! So today im going back on the pill... IM SCARED!  But will keep you updated on my condition!!!  I will reccommend a name brand pill if this pill doesnt work for me.

My doctor started me on 25 mcg's...After a couple months I noticed that I had more energy and not as sluggish before the meds. When I got my bloodwork done again in June/July my levels were still off, so the doc raised the dosage to 50 mcg. I did not see any difference with the increase of meds. I got my levels checked again in early Septemeber, they came back fine except for the TPO antibodies which were at 600, better than in April they were at 1800 very high since the normal range is 0-39. Anyway, at this point My biggest complaint is: gaining 10 pounds since starting this medication and sweating for no reason. I go back to the doctor OCtober 1st. I am letting him know about the weight gain and see if there is an alternative. If anybody has any suggestions email at ncqueen17@gmail.com Thanks!

In addition, when my dosage was increased from 125 to 150 mcg I also began having joint and muscle pains with no known cause.  Tests have revealed that I do not have any disease, condition, or specific injury that would account for these problems so I am starting to consider the possibility that the upping of the Levoxyl dose brought on some of these musculoskeletal problems.

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	8/23/2009 11:33:30 PM	I have always wondered if I had an overactive thyroid, or hyperthyroidism... I have always been underweight, not able to gain weight, fatigued, and have very dry skin. I went to the doctor for a check up after a lump appeared on my neck right where my thyroid is. My doctor was mostly concerned about my low weight and put me on the medication after my blood tests came back NORMAL for thyroid hormone. I figured she put me on this medication to treat the lump in my neck, however when i went back for a followup she explained that she really just wanted me to GAIN some weight. I'm pretty sure levothyroxine is not going to do much to help me with this problem...

K-U, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	8/21/2009 11:12:25 PM	I've been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and just recently started treatment. I had been exhausted, gained weight, developed patellofemural pain disorder &amp; carpal tunnel syndrome, and had severe depression. After a month at 25 mcg, there was no change in my levels so it was upped to 50 mcg. I have to go back to see if it has any effect on my levels. I feel better, though. The pain in my wrist and knee has been subsiding, I haven't needed to take a nap in the afternoon every day, and my mood has elevated. I'm even starting to remember things. Taking it is a pain in the butt though--I hate not being able to eat when I first get up! I have thus far been satisfied and hope to be able to get off all my antidepressants eventually. I will gladly sacrifice not being able to eat when I wake-up if it means I can stop taking 4 other pills a day.

In the beginning first month I began gaining weight. After about 2 1/2 months I started losing weight. Have kept 10lbs. off since. Hoarseness in  my voice diminished. Always seemed to feel nervous and sometimes snappy. Felt very restless and suffered from insomnia. A few months later I now feel lazy, sometimes depressed, need to sleep more, losing energy, always hungry, sometimes dizzy like I could pass out, on and off again hair thinning. I think it affects my blood sugar level, makes them low and gives me anxiety. Missing the way I used to feel when I had lots of energy now I wish I didn't have to take this medication any longer.

My dosage was upped again &amp; again, until I have now been at 0.150MCG.  I have gradually gained more weight,headaches more often,tightness in chest,swelling/bloating, no energy, sleeplisness.As time goes on I'm afraid I'll lose even more hair &amp; gain even more.

I had cervical disc fusion 5 years ago and because of an accident in surgery, my thyroid was nicked and it died.  I started out okay with the meds and then I had lack of energy and bouts of diarrhea - the dose was increased last year, I was okay and fine.  Now, last 6 months I've had horrible bouts with diarrhea and body cramps along with spasms in my back. I am average weight, I exercise all the time.  They say taking this drug has nothing to do with this.  Maybe I have another condition. I'm seeing my doctor today, but I am very frustrated because I come away with no answers.
Underactive Thyroid	Stacie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	8/2/2009 7:11:35 PM	I am updating you all from my last post.  If you all remember I stoped taking the medication and started taking Thyromine.  I went to my doctor last Monday and he ran the blood tests.  I got the results last Thursday and they where high (I was nearly in tears as I looked at my results over the years.)  I wanted to prove him wrong but I didn't.    My doctor said I really should go back on the medication.  I have a really wonderful doctor and he did honestly listen to me about how I felt on and off the medication.  He said since I was taken the generic the last seven years lets try the name brand.  So that is what I am doing.  I am now taking the Levoxly.  I go back in for more blood work in two months.  I am not excited to be back on this medication as I can't loose weight.  It is also very hard to take since you are not suppost to eat before taking it and you are not to have milk products or iron for four hours after taking it.  This is a very inconvienent medication to have to take.  The best thing for me to do is wakeup around 4:00 am and take it and than go back to bed.  I am really hoping the name brand does a better job than the generic.  I don't want all the side effects with it.  You would think that the drug companys would research their products better.  Their seems to be so many adverse side affects you would think they would want to do something about it.  I don't know how this is going to turn out but I will update again it two months.

Chiropractor strongly recommends Armour throid. I'm getting latest blood tests back and will update this info.

Underactive Thyroid	looking for answers, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	7/19/2009 8:13:43 PM	I have taken this medication for about 2 and 1/2 years now.  My thyroid had tested slightly low to normal for a few years prior to the doctor starting me on this.  I have high blood pressure and was having some muscle weakness and fatigue from the medication; the dose was lowered and the symptoms were much less severe.  I guess these symptoms, along with the fact that my thyroid had been testing low and then normal for several years, was the reason I was started on medication at that time, even though when the doctor asked me if I had been feeling tired, had been gaining weight, if my skin or hair were dry, my answer to all of these questions was &quot;no.&quot;  In fact, I said I had lost a few pounds recently.  A few months ago, I was at the doctor's office for an unrelated reason and noticed a poster on the wall showing symptoms of hypothyrodism.  I had most of them and had not had them prior to starting this med.  Symptoms I now have include: weight gain, dry skin, dry hair, stomach always hurts and feels hungry, completely stopped menustrating the first month I started the med and frequent night sweats.  About 17 months after being on this med I had my hormones checked (I was 49 years old at the time); hormone levels came back normal, I was not premenopausal; I had always had frequent, short cycles.  I also take Prilosec and started it within a month or 2 of the levothyroxine; I have been blaming that med all this time for the stomach pain and weight gain, even though I have other family members who have taken Prilosec and Nexium with absolutely no stomach pain.  I have also always had great cholesterol levels with very low triglycerides; I started a cholesteral med a few months ago and have been blaming Prilosec for that change too.  Since a med should never be stopped without consulting one's doctor, I will definitely be talking to mine soon.
Underactive Thyroid	Galatian, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	7/19/2009 9:22:40 AM	I find myself being more alert and napping less. Definitely a difference in my energy level. There has also been an increase in my motivational drive. I use to have a terrible time remembering the simplest stuff, even this has gone wayside. My memory is quite well and I even find myself reminding others of things they're forgetting. I use to become ill often with cold like symptoms, sinus congestion, upper respiratory issues including bronchial problems; not anymore. I've been taking levothyroxine for approximately 1.5 years and in this period I can not remember a reoccurrence of these symtoms. I relate this to better immune functions of the body. Overall this treatment has been very successful and I would recommend to anyone with hypothyroidism.

I had complained to my doc back in april with being soo tired all he did was take a blood test and said everything is fine.
Underactive Thyroid	Stacie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/18/2009 10:42:21 AM	I am updating you all from my last post on taking this medication.  I have been off of the Levothyroxine for almost a month now.  I haven't ended up in the hospital for stopping it suddenly like my doctor said I would either.  I didn't get my Thyromine until after returning from my vacation.  I have now been taking that for a little over a week now.  I can tell you all I feel 100% better than I have in along time.  I have much more energy, don't need to sleep 10-12 hours at night any longer, don't need 2 hour or more naps everyday.  It is amazing how much better I feel since I have stopped taking the medication.  I am also not as angry as I was, or at least I can control my mood swings better.  I still haven't lost any weight but being on vacation I ate like what ever I wanted.  I am now back to my daily routine and hoping to loose some weight soon.  I go in on July 27th to see my doctor and have my blood test done.  I am hoping they all come back normal so I can prove him wrong.  For all you people out there who hate this medication I suggest you research it, research the alternatives, as in the Thyromine I am now taking, and also natural remedies you can try.  I have found out certain foods are better for you and others are harmful.  I will post again after I get my tests done in a few weeks.

Not yet and I exercise three times a week.  My biggest complaint is the sweating.  I feel like I am going through menopause again but it's worse than that.  I don't like this reaction at all.  I also have developed swelling in my ankles and feet that I didn't have before.  Can only wear my flip flops.  Can't get into any of my other sandals or shoes.  Didn't have this problem before I started this medicine a few months ago.  My doctor says to limit my salt intake.  I did and no change.  This is very discouraging.

I have been off of it for 3 days though...I wanted to see if it was really working. I know when I have my blood tests done it shows if my THS levels went up or down but I want to see if I gain weight &amp; get more fatigued. I used to be on 7 different medication at one time for multiple reasons and now I am only down to this and my birth control, my goal is to be &quot;drug&quot; free all together. I know you should never stop taking prescriptions without talking to the doctor first but when I tried this a year ago she talked me out of it. I will keep you posted as to what happens after a couple of weeks :~)

Not happy with what I'm seeing from med use &amp; have contacted doctor to discuss other options for thyroid problems.

Underactive Thyroid	Stacie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	6/23/2009 8:29:05 PM	I wrote earlier telling you all that I hate this medication and was getting off of it.  I have since been to my doctor, yesterday, and talked to him about it.  He basically said all these sights where a bunch a bull s**t.  I told him I had just ordered some Thyromine and was going to give that a try.  He advised against it and said I should get back on the name brand, not the generic, medication for my thyroid.  He told me that people can end up in the hospital for stopping their thyroid treatment.  I just kept saying I have read many articles, forums, and have researched this medication alot.  He says all my side effects are from something else, not the medication.  He also says it could be due to how I am taking it and they other medications I am taking.  I told him I am sorry but there is no good time to take it for me.  It interacts with almost everything.  However, he said, he does not advise it but give the Thyromine a try. Hopefully I get the Thyromine before I go on vacation next week. I have another appointment in six weeks to have a blood test to see if it is working.  I really hope it does so I can prove him wrong.  I have been off of the Levothyroxine for over a week now, and I feel better than I have in along time.  I am still tired but not nearly as tired as I was before.  Haven't lost any weight but I am hoping that will change next month.  I will keep you all informed on how the Thyromine works for me and what I find out at my next doctors appointment.  
Underactive Thyroid	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	6/22/2009 1:11:54 AM	I have been on this drug for about five months since finding out I had this going on.

This is driving me crazy not being able to loose any weight and looking like a dude in my upper body LOL Im and not use to this at all. I use to be alot smaller and now I cant loose a pound.

Underactive Thyroid	Teecee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/16/2009 5:28:36 PM	I had went 3 years with no period, I was fatigued, my hair was falling out, I was depressed all the time, my skin was extremely dry, my nails were fragile,and I gained 70 lbs within 3 years.  I went from 140 lbs to 210 lbs.  I went to 3 doctors the first 2 doctors could not figure out what was wrong with me.  The 3rd doctor figured out that it was my underactive thyroid.  She started me out on 25 mcg it did not help, she upped it to 50 mcg it still did not help, then she upped it to 75 mcg it still did not help, and then she upped it to 100 mcg that seemed to help. I started getting periods a month after that were regular, I have lost 40 lbs, I have lots of engergy, my hair has stopped falling out, my skin is soft &amp; smooth, my finger nails are strong &amp; growing, I am happy &amp; no longer sad or depressed.  I am not a doctor by any stretch of the imagination, but it sounds like from reading some of the other reviews on this web site that the level of dosage for this medication may not be correct.  However, this is just my opinion, but I think some people need to go back to their doctors and get the correct dosage.
Underactive Thyroid	Treasure, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	6/15/2009 2:27:19 PM	Well I know why my hair is falling out now.  I have been on this medication for a year.  I started out taking 25mcg, then 50mcg, &amp; 75 mcg, but it did not help.  Now I am on 100 mcg, and I feel better.  I have more energy, I have lost 35 lbs, my skin is smooth again, and my nails don't hurt any more when I touch them.  My hair was shoulder length healthy and strong.  I recently cut it into a short bob because it was falling out.  However, I think of the people with cancer that have to go through chemotherapy and lose all of their hair.  They deal with it so surely I can deal with a little hair loss in exchange for energy and feeling better overall.

Underactive Thyroid	Stacie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	6/14/2009 7:19:12 PM	I have been on medication for my thyroid since 1993 after having my first child.  In between having my two kids, over 8 years apart, I had four miscarriages.  The doctor said it wasn't caused by taking synthroid but as soon as I stopped I had my second successful pregnancy.  After having my second child I switched doctors and was put back on Levothyroxine.  I have gained so much weight and can't loose it.  My menstrual cycles are very irregular, I am very moody for no apparent reasons.  I hate this medication.  When I stop taking it I feel much better.  I am so tired when taking it I can't function.  This medication is suppose to help me not be so tired, help me loose weight when at the correct levels but I just keep gaining.  I was told a few years ago I was at the right level and that I should be loosing weight.  I few months ago I started taking Acai Berry Supplement along with a Colon Cleanse.  I actually lost 15 pounds.  But now I have gained it all back and am still taking the supplements.  I am really tired again, have no energy, very irritable all the time, am eating lots more and just down right depressed.  I really need to loose about 60 pounds or more.  I was always really skinny until I had my kids and was diagnosed with this.  I have tried every diet possible and nothing helps.  I walk my dogs two miles a day, sometimes running with them, I swim and bike, I even have done a couple of triathlons.  I am in shape except for this stupid weight I cannot loose.  I am going to stop taking my medication tomorrow.  I have spent the last twelve hours researching this medication and most of want I have found is that it causes more problems than it solves.  I am going to see my doctor next Monday and have my thyroid tested again.  I am also going to have a serious talk with him about want I have read about these different medications.  I will see if I feel better of the medication and see if there is a natural none medication solution that will work for me.

I'm not eating much so I'm not sure if there will be a weight gain. It DID straighten out my brain. When they took out my thyroid no prescriptions were given to me to make up for the actions of my thyroid. I spent 3 weeks in mental hospitals before being diagnosed. Im was dying.
Underactive Thyroid	MichiganJ, 0-2 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	4	4	5	Female	0-2	6/12/2009 10:24:08 PM	Our daughter was diagnosed at 6 days old and has been on the medication ever since.  She was tested in the hospital and her levels were off the charts.  She either has no thyroid what she has doesn't function.  We have her labs done locally (now every 3 months!) and travel to see her Endo once a year.  We've only had to adjust her levels twice, most recently to 50mcg.  She had been sleeping a lot more, and was constipated, and lethargic, cold.  She is doing much better now and back to her old self.  I wish she would eat better, but has never had much of an appetite.  We're fortunate that this is easily treatable.

Was very sensitive to cold 2 yrs ago, and got light-headed to the point of passing out prior to going on medication.  Started with 25mcg, now at 50mcg, and cold no longer bothers me.  I've read several reviews here where others have experienced weight gain and increased appetite.  I've gained a little weight (5 lbs) in my stomach and want to blame the medication, but it could just be aging and lack of exercise on my part.  Benefits of being on meds trump weight gain in my mind.  I can control weight thru diet and exercise.

Underactive Thyroid	sarah, 35-44 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	2		35-44	6/7/2009 10:56:51 PM	I went on this medicine when I had an ultrasound of my thyroid and it was double the size of a normal one. I have been on this medicine since mid November 2008. Started out at 50mcg perday. Since starting this medicine my peroids have been irregular they still last as long but cycles are not every 28 days anymore, sometimes 21 days, 28 days and more than 6.5 weeks in between cycles. Very frustrating. Have not noticed any hair loss, my hair has actually gotten thicker. No weight loss, just weight gain. Sometimes I experience rapid heart beat. I get very tired at exactly noon each day, the weekend comes and I have to nap for at least 1 hour. Dry skin alot. Oh yeah we have a hard time going to bed- seems like the mind is always racing. In March 2009- my doage increased to 75mcg, still haveyet notice any benefits from taking it.

Underactive Thyroid	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	5/31/2009 2:29:33 PM	I have been put on 25mcg to start and recently raised to 50mcg. I don't like this medication at all...I have found that it increases my episodes of anxiety attacks...I already suffer from panic/anxiety disorder....I have been having heart palpitations/rapid heart rate more frequently since starting this medication. I have been put on Lexapro and Xanax to treat these side effects and they make me feel like a zombie. Does anyone know if there are any alternatives to this medicine?? My doctor has since lowered me back to 25mcg and told me only to take half the dose to start and see if the side effects lessen...I'm not sure that they have.

Other	C.O., 19-24 Male  (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	19-24	5/24/2009 11:35:46 PM	I had a pinched nerve in my neck which at the time I didn't realize. The pinched nerve caused my thyroid level to be a little off.  I never needed the medicine to begin with but that didn't stop my doctor from prescribing it or myself from taking it.  I am having a side effect from the drug.  It is causing sudden massive muscle cramps in my right hand and fingers, my right shin, foot and toes, and my side and chest. The cramps came on at about 2-3 times an hour and lasted for about 30 seconds. I stopped taking the pills and finally after about a week and a half the cramps have subsided.  Being a non-name bran (cynthroid) side effects are to be expected but that was too much.

I took brand Synthroid for one year and then asked my Dr if I could switch to generic.  She was hesitant at first but agreed and I have had no problems with the generic since.It is on the $4 list at most pharmacies and is even $10 for a 90 day supply.  For those people who want to save money this is the way to go.  I would recommend it to everyone.

I work with the public and have to be alert, but I can hardly keep my eyes open.  I was prescribed it after months of worsening sadness, weight gain and acheyness.  I hope in the coming days and weeks I start to see an improvement in my symptoms so I can be taken off the anti-depressants.  I think the Dr.'s should have looked at the thyroid BEFORE putting me on all sorts of pills for sadness instead of 9 months later.

Serious Decrease in Thyroid Function	Inam26@hotmail.com, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	2	2	Male	35-44	5/11/2009 1:33:48 PM	Been taking levo for over 25 years at 150 to 275 mcgs daily. It works better if you take it at night just before hitting the pillow, on an empty stomach with a glass of good quality water. Avoid calcium, multi vitamins, iron and mineral supplements during your dosage time, i.e, teke the levo on its own. When you wake up, drink cold water, your liver will love it and it needs it because it is doing the job of the throid gland in converting the inactive prohormone that is levo to the active triiodiothyronine. If you have been taking this med for a long time, it will be very helpful if you start to use Milk thistle, in moderate doses to assist liver function. I feel pressure in my liver and taking milk thistle in a drink helps tremendously. Ensure that you have a very good intake of vitamin C but avoid overdosing, I suggest taking 250 to 500 mgs every other day after a good meal. This will help your adrenals to function efficiently which is required before your liver can do the job effectively. Eat exceptionally well if you can. There are a myriad of symptoms that appear and disappear and each must be addressed in turn. To control the anxiety and depression and insomnia, use camomile tea, use lavender essential oil, drink milk. Use herbal teas like fennel and nettle, lemon grass. If you are suffering from constipation avoid over use of laxatives and use Isabgoal husks with milk instead. If you have an internal candida albicans infection, get it treated from your Dr and don't let him/her fob you off by saying that it doesn't exist. If you are feeling sharp moderate intermittent pain in your liver then drink plenty of water. Learn to be receptive to the symptoms of hyper/hypothyroidism. If your eyes start to bulge outwards (fibromyalgia), lower your dose by 10 mcgs until you feel relief. Increase your dose slightly when the cold winter months arrive and decrease when the hot season arrives. People taking levothyroxine, a synthetic hormone replacement for the real thing,

The quality of my sleep improved dramatically.  However it seriously aggravated my prostate and made it difficult and painful to urinate.  As a result, was never able to tolerate more than a minimal dose.  Asked doctor to change me to Armour Thyroid and began taking that yesterday.
Underactive Thyroid	MRT, 55-64 Male  (Patient) 	4	4	5	Male	55-64	4/28/2009 5:12:04 PM	The most important thing about this drug is finding the correct dosage,it takes time.Started with 50mg,then it increased to 75mg.First 4 days after increase I felt like I was jacked up on caffene. Nevous,dizzy,upset stomach,chest pain.Called my doctor and asked if I could split the pills and increase over 2 weeks,that did the trick.Just increased again to 88mg(today),felt a little dizzy,but not bad.This is a powerful drug and should be used with great care.If you have a problem,CALL YOUR DOCTOR, let him know.
Serious Decrease in Thyroid Function	inam, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	2	2	Male	35-44	4/24/2009 8:15:14 PM	Vitamin C along with zinc should be taken sometimes during the day but not with the levo. Because it will help your adrenals to function better and that will make your liver and kidneys work more efficiently to convert the synthetic prohormone levothyroxine that is taken orally to its more active form which is know as T3. Drink plenty of good quality water and eat exceptionally well. take your levothyroxine on an empty stomach at night just as you go to bed and go to sleep. It will work much better. I know because of my 25 years of experience of existing on high doses of this drug. Get a very very very good and sympathetic GP or Dr and abandon the Drs who fob you off and lie to you just to get rid off you. A bad Dr means life or death. Suffering or bliss.

I find it difficult to time when I should take it.  My prescript. says 1 hr before meals or 2 hours after.  If I don't take it with my other meds in the a.m. I forget to take it but when I forget I have wait until after meals and then forget it again. I like having increased energy but with the energy came insomnia, headaches, leg pain, weight gain, and irregular menstrual cycles.  I'd rather have the fatigue!!!

When I was first diagnosed I was at 25mg now I'm at 175mg. I don't really get the chills but I do get weight gain, tiredness, and I get sick extremely easily so I miss quite a bit of school. I have recently started the glycemic index diet and I have lost about 18 pounds in the last 2 months. I have to go see an endo every 9 months at childrens hospital. Once you are diagnosed with hypothyroidism you have pretty much got it for the rest of your life and I have learned to deal with that.

Underactive Thyroid	MM, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/26/2009 3:22:31 AM	I'm sorry to hear about the problems some of you  folks have had to endure. I was diagnosed at 11 years old (I'm 44 now).  I really don't remember having side effects. I do remember the the way I felt being 199 lbs in the fifth grade, having brittle hair and no energy. I remember constant DR visits with blood tests. Over the years I've had my dose lowered and raised many times. If I noticed any changes, I would check with the DR.  Even small changes in life effect us more than we realize. When I was pregnant (my youngest is 9) my dosage went down from 300mcg to 200mcg. About a year ago my dose went up to 275mcg and still is currently. I'm an average gal, don't always eat right, don't take vitamins or calcium(due to inconvenience with medication), don't always take my meds as directed and only exercise a little. I have noticed at different times in my live even the same old stuff(foods, herbs, medications and timing) can effect me.  I guess what I'm trying to say is check with your DR (if he/ she isn't working out change DR). Also check with the pharmacist they are a great resource (medications and foods). I know they're busy, but when you make your DR's appointment let them know you want to talk to the DR about issues so they can schedule more time for YOU. Plan your trip to the pharmacist when you have time and when it's not a busy time for them. And of course the web is full of info (that's why we're hear now). Just ask, it's your body, your life.  I wish all the best for every one. You are Loved.

I am now a 51 year old female. This has changed my life. I was gaining weight, low energy, and depressed. Since this med. I have actually gotten my energy back, don't feel down in the dumps anymore and with the help of the South Beach Diet, I have been able to actually loose weight.  I was 192 pounds back in the Spring of 2008.  I am now 156 pounds.  I started the SBD and within 3 months I had been able to loose weight.  It is the first time I have been able to loose.  My weight started at 130 and jumped within 1 1/2 years to 192 before I was diagnosed.  I don't seem to have any negative reactions only positive.  I take the med. first thing in the morning with 3 other medications.  Sometimes I forget and don't take it until after lunchtime.  I always try to be sure and take it at least an hour b/4 I eat or 2 hours after if I forget to take it in the morning.

I also experienced lack of energy.  Initially the treatment was ok felt somewhat better.  I see an endo every three months for IDDM and hypothyroid and test results seem fine.  Now going on over a yr I am having the same problems on top of extreme weight gain, dizziness, hair loss, signs of depression(for no reason), and very moody.  I am miserable.  I lead a very active life I am 25y/o, work 24 hr shifts on an ambulance, and have a six yr old.  I have no reason for feelings of depression nor have I ever felt like this.  I have an excellent relationship, wonderful son, and no worries such as money, life problems, NOTHING.  I want my life back to how I used to be outgoing, fun loving, interactive, non-moody... What is wrong w/ me.  I have a doc apt at the end of the month w/ my endo and I can not wait to see him.. I need some answers for my behavior lately.  Good to see I am not crazy or alone on these problems.

Underactive Thyroid	laynesgirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	3/7/2009 11:46:08 AM	My doctor told me I had a borderline underactive thyroid, as well as several small thyroid nodules. As I was experiencing many of the common symptoms of hypothyroidism, including weight gain, extremely dry skin and fatigue, my doctor gave me the option of trying the medication.I started with a low dose of 25mcg a week ago. So far, the only side effect I have noticed is dizziness, although I realize that it has been too short a time to know if there will be more.I was also diagnosed with fatty liver, which my doctor attributed to the rapid weight gain I've experienced, having gained 50 pounds in about 3 years. Fatty liver can be the result of a number of things, including excess alcohol intake and a high-fat diet, but I rarely drink and am fairly health-conscious when it comes to my diet. In any event, because of this condition, I am concerned about the effects this drug has on the liver.

It helped a lot with my energy level in past years, now I guess old age is catching up with me. My biggest challenge is to space my Vitamin supplements throughout the day especially calcium since I cannot take the vitamin in the morning. Oh one thing never went away, I am still cold all the time ( I live in South Georgia) yeah for hot flashes.

It took several months to reach the correct dosage, 75mcg.  I have noticed a drastic change in mood, increase in energy level, and overall feeling of wellbeing.  I am, however, cold a lot.  I keep the thermostat on 72 and wear sweats... and I live in AZ.  I have also noticed that I get really bad indigestion (chest pain).  My fingernails are very brittle and my skin is incredibly dry.  I haven't really lost any weight but maybe that takes more time.  I also read that if you eat a lot of antioxidants, you may need to have your dosage lowered... they are a natural thyroid regulator.

I do have very dry skin and the texture of my hair is now coarse.  Still, the benefits far out weigh the side effects.  I advise that you take the medication with breakfast so it doesn't tend to upset your stomach.

My one concern is muscle soreness that I noticed after reaching 75 micrograms.

Other	andeezle, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	11/22/2008 7:41:20 PM	had radioactive iodine treatment of thyroid gland to treat grave's disease (hyperthyroidism). thyroid gland no longer functions so i'll take this med for life. i have no problems to speak of. in response to some of the recent questions/comments--it takes 6-8 weeks for changes in dosage to register in the blood stream. so if you gained weight in the first week of taking this drug, it probably has nothing to do with the drug. also, you won't feel anything for 6-8 weeks, and the dosage may be to little or too much. but there's no way to tell until the dosage makes it's way into your blood stream (which takes 6-8 weeks) so it can take a year for your doctor to find the right dosage for you. it all depends on how your thyroid is functioning--if at all. And to the one poster who said she's lying to her doctor about taking the drug, if you're lying to your doctor about it, you probably need to see a pyschiatrist as well. if you need this drug, it's becuase you're thyroid can't produce what it's supposed to. Thyroid disorders do have a major impact on your overall well being. The importance of the thyroid gland should not be underestimated. Research the functions of the thyroid gland and impact on the rest of the body when it's not working right, either underactive or overactive.

Upon a blood test before going back to my doctor the test showed my thyroid was back to normal. That was well over a month ago and my hair continues to fall out...!  If the hair loss does not stop I have an appointment with my Dr. in a few weeks and will see what he can do.  The drug did no good and with the side effect of hair loss I seen no reason to ever take it again and will just take my chances with out the medication.

I am now taking Levothyroxine daily.  I started out with 100mcg,then 88, then 75 and , and today dr changed dose to 50 mcg.  My bloodwork is normal.  However, I'm experiencing slight anxiety,occasional heart palpitation.  I'm not sure if this is a side effect or a normal reaction to the many stressors in my life now.  I'm 54 years old and just entered menopause.  I wonder if the change has any affect on my condition.  My hormone levels indicate I'm post menopausal. I'm also very emotional.  I cry very easy, and feel nervous at times.  My doctor suggested anti Anxiety or anti depressants.  I'm not a big fan of this type of medication. I'm hoping that the adjustment of my Levothyroxine will make an improvement. I have made a definite change in life.  Now, I need to learn how to cope and adjust.

If the symptoms of muscle fatigue, lethargy, exhaustion, hair loss, and weight gain are still present with the med, along with possible liver damage, why take it?  Why not just take my chances without it?  Also, I was started out on 150 mcg. which sounds high compared to many of the posts I've read. Should that be a concern?  I haven't seen the Endocrinologist yet, the OBGYN prescribed this to me and had me make an appointment with Endocrinologist.  I was looking forward to this drug kicking in...now I fear it.  Are there any good experiences?
Underactive Thyroid	KLO, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	10/6/2008 1:30:47 PM	I am 34 years old and I have three children.  I was diagnosed with an underactive thyriod just over a year ago and started on 50mcg. I am 5'8 and 135 lbs.  I don't really feel any difference since taking this medication except feeling occasioally worse than I did before the medication.  If it helped at all I'm not as cold as I used to be.  But I feel this medication has contributed to higher anxiety and depression and when I feel that coming on I stop taking the medication for no more than two days.  I then feel better and continue with the medication.

I recently had my blood checked and my T3 &amp; T4 levels are normal.  My TSH level was 0.30 and that severly concerned me.  I went to my doctor and she ordered further blood test.  I guess I am frustrated with this and have decided I am going to take myself off the drug for a month and try to obtain a specialist..........I have gained over 40 pounds in the last year, constantly have swollen hands, ankles, &amp; feet. I don't feel that the medication is helping and I am severly depressed over the weight gain. I have tried taking diet pills with the synthroid and that does not help.

It's a case of finetuning the dose to your individual requirements which does take time and must be achieved because an incorrect dose can ruin your life. A strictly heart health diet and regular excercise is an absolute must. I take 175 micrograms in tablet form, and then I use a oral syringe to administer an additional 10-15 micrograms in liquid form. This has worked very well for me, because it allows me to adjust the dose precisley. I can lower or increase the dose by increments of 5 mcgs which is a tiny amount and most doctors would argue that it's impossible to detect such small adjustments of the drug but I know better because i am the one who has been taking it for over 25 years and i am highly atuned to how it makes me feel. Learn as much as you can about this drug and how it works and then you will be able to control it. It's great stuff, powerful and even doctors don't appreciate what exactly it does to you. Eat exceptionally well, especially if you are on high 150+ mcgs daily. I recommend eating high wheatgerm bread, virgin olive oils, a good multivitamin and mineral supplement, and plenty of water. keep up with your daily protein requirements and drink green and white teas. Buy cold pressed wheatgerm oil and take a spoon daily, 5ml, eat low fat yoghurt because it will help with the constipation that accompanies this drug. Use rock salt, brown sugar, organic honey, garlic, ginger, thyme, basil, sage, oregano, organic rice and lentils, with plenty of veg and fresh fruit. And you will live an amazing life!!

Is there a website addressing taking medications after gastric bypass? I already found out taking Ambien has an immediate effect knocking me out in less than 10 minutes. I never take it now until I am IN bed. 
Underactive Thyroid	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	4	Female	19-24	9/17/2008 5:19:00 AM	I've been experiencing the basic hypothyroidism symptoms most of my life. When I got past teenhood and was still experiencing all of the hormone related problems and the weight issue I decided it was time to find out if something was seriously wrong with me. 6 months ago my TSH came up around 9.5 and I was started on 50mcg. Last month when I went to get my prescription re-signed I found out that my last blood test still had me at 4.3 and my medication was increased to 75mcg. I haven't lost any weight to speak of but I haven't had any major complications with the medication. I've been having a bit of insomnia lately but I've gone through major bouts of insomnia prior to being on medication and I don't know if it's related at all. Not being cold all the time is awesome though! Mostly I find it difficult to remember my calcium supplement and my shins and ankles hurt a lot when I don't get adequate exercise (as I've learned through being sick twice this summer).

Underactive Thyroid	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	1	4	Female	45-54	9/8/2008 10:30:11 AM	Dose of 100mcg working very well- no side effects... I think. I thought &quot;empty stomach&quot; meant free of food, not other medicine. I've taken it with 8 other meds from the beginning so the dosage is adjusted based on that. very important: DO NOT TAKE IT TOGETHER WITH CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS! i DID AND I GAINED 40 LBS IN 4 MONTHS BEFORE I FIGURED OUT WHAT WAS WRONG. Now I take the calcium with lunch or dinner and am loosing the weight quite well. I have so many conditions that I do not know if the symptoms I have are due to the side effects of this medecine or the 10 others meds I take. But so far the side effects have been manageable. I have been disabled by chronic pain since 1994.

I also have some heart palpitations mostly at night. i am wondering if taking two doses a day, half in the morning and half at night would work better. this problem is very fustrating and sometimes i just want to stop the meds but i know i will feel really bad again if i do. my dr. tells me this is for life and i wonder if taking my thyroid out altogether would be better but then it would be just a different pill to have to take forever

A highly nutritious diet with plenty of water  is a must. Fine tuning of the dose your are taking is vital if you want to feel any sense of normality. Taking too much and you are risking your long term health and should be avoided. If you are taking too much you will find yourself unable to focus properly, a shortened attention span, insomnia, severe anxiety, excessive sweating and nervousness, irritability, thiamiine deficiency, bulging eyes, emotional instability, ravenous appetite, feeling high, muscle cramps, chest pains and tightness especially if you are older, hair loss, indigstion, dry eyes especially when you wake up, sensitivity to emotional stress, insensitivity towards others, frustration, vivid dreams, clenched teeth, frequent urination/defecation, pitted nails, itchy legs/rash, testicular feminization and shrinking genitals, shallow breathing, dizzziness. taking less than what you need has pretty much the opposite effect. Severe constipation, intolerance to cold, frequent infections, very dry skin on hands, sluggish thoughts, depression, palor, nausea. This drug does work, indeed it saves lives, but also ruins them if taken incorrectly. Doctors need to take a patient centre approach and not ignore symptoms that are present even after long term treatment. This drug needs further refining and adjusting to individual needs. Doctors need to realize that this is a treatment and by no means a cure. Watch out for your liver especailly if you are on a high dosage because it the liver which has to work harder to convert the t4 to t3, t2, t1 etc which is not normal. I strongly feel that t3 should be given alongside t4. The good thing about this drug is that when taken alongside a very good diet, you end up with lots and lots of energy but this too must be controlled because you may injure yourself. I feel less pain when my dose is high and end up working too hard.

Those meds had my number in the correct range; but, I was allergic to the medication.  Then spent 3 months with Dermatologist to get rid of the rash!!  Had the Radioactive method of Thyroid destruction before Easter this spring.  Finally, after months, my numbers dropped &quot;to the floor&quot; ........ completely hypothyroid state.  Put on 100 mcg per day.  Have wanted to literally slide out of my own skin since day 1. Muscle cramps, headaches, moody, insomnia, &quot;speedy&quot;.  It is hard to function this way + the people that are around me right now are all inquiring &quot;are you alright?&quot;.  I am alright ~ but, NO I am not myself and haven't felt OK since I started this drug. 30 day blood test in 2 days .......... hopefully, this 100 MCG dosage is reduced.  Everyday, is a little better and I do think this is workable.  My intentions are to adjust, adjust, and adjust until the numbers are right and I feel like myself again.  What else can I do?  My thyroid gland has been dystroyed.  I am on this for the rest of my life.

Serious Decrease in Thyroid Function	Inam, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	35-44	8/3/2008 10:11:44 PM	Have been taking this drug for over 20 years and I can honestly say that my life has been ruined. I sometimes wish that I was left for dead because of the life long suffering I have had to endure. Sure, the drug has kept me alive but the quality of life is poor. And I am suffering in silence because I have never found a doctor who knows how it feels to be on this drug. I was prescribed this medication when I was a withdrawn child who had swolen up, wasn't growing, had no friends, couldn't communicate, was always frozen and did very badly at school. I remember not being able to leave the heater for fear of freezing to death. Life was hell. Then I was diagnosed with severe hypothyroidism, and given thyroxine in high doses. Physically I developed fast and was soon looking like any other young boy but the psychological impact upon me has lasted into adulthood. I was never rehabilitated mentally back into normal life and twenty years later I am still locked in my mind as I was all those years ago with no-one to understand what it feels like to be on this drug. it has it's good points, and i am grateful to be alive. But I have never had a normal life, relationship, friendship, diet. I am like an autistic adult. Quite frequently I just do not feel 'right', and I know its the thyroxine. I will probably have to suffer in silence for the rest of my life because doctors are too stupid and missinformed or buzy, or inexperienced, or just too absorbed in there own lives to give a shit. I need help because I feel like i have developed an atypical tolerance to thyroxine and keep having to adjust the dose in order to stay alive and it's having a devastating effect on every aspect of my life. When I take the medication at a fixed dose, it stops working after a few days and i feel low, unable to go to the toilet, cold, calluses appear on my hands, I stop feeling hungry, inability to sleep despite being awake very early and working till others would drop, emotional insensitivity.......

Taking too little and you can't live your life properly. The truth needs to be told about this synthetic hormone replacement which does come with it's own complications. Feeling out of sync, excitability, constipation, sweating, insomnia, dry grotty hands, thiamine deficiency, all kinds of symptoms I have experienced over the 25 years I have been taking this drug. I am grateful to be alive, but sometimes the quality of life is just not there. Fine tuning of the dosage is very important and can take some time. Unfortunatley, Dr's do not have the time or patience to address all the issues related to this drug and many Dr's will just lie to you to get you off their backs. They left me on an incorrect dosage for nearly 15 years, and I had to do the research myself and I was shocked to learn the truth. This is a serious condition and Dr's who think that symtoms are just the figments of patients imaginations should be abandoned because they are just not experienced enough or professional enough to deal with the problem so get a new Dr who is willing and able to treat you properly. Don't let your life be ruined at the hands of incompetent GPs. My email is inam26@hotmail.com 07932634384. Taking levothyroxine incorrectly has ruined parts of my life, but I can't live without it so I am grateful to be alive. My Dr's just didn't advise me properly on how to manage this lifelong, life altering treatment. They just said take this amount, ask no questions. (They don't know themselves).

Was given 25 mcg.  Then it was doubled a month later to 50.  I started having severe muscle weakness gaining weight, extreme fatigue (I would nod off while  talking to someone) and I had very disturbing dreams.  So next blood test tsh was 155 and put on 75mcg.  This caused extreme muscle pain and muscle cramps.  I weaned myself off to 0 but now my thyroid is not working as well.  So went back to 25 mcg.  Am tired. weak but feel better than at 50.  I hate how I feel.

I have taken blood test 3 times now and the have up'd my dosage from 3 mcg to 88 mcg. I also drink alcohol on a daily basis is that of concern with this med.? I have not yet experienced hair loss or bad effects as I have only been on 88 mcg for about 3 day's now.

Underactive Thyroid	Danielle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	5/15/2008 1:31:40 PM	I found out I had hypothyroidism about 7 mos after I had my third child. My dr said it was the highest she had seen. My symptoms are dry scalp and skin, lots of hair loss, always cold, can't lose weight and very tired all the time. She started me on 78mcg, after a month she upped the dosage to 112mcg. I have not noticed any difference, still have all the same symptoms and not letting up at all. I also have been taking diet pills along with this medication, and will be asking my dr about this. I have found a natural remedy for hypothyroidism, called Thyoid Assist. Will try this to see if I can get some help on the problems/symptoms I am having.
Underactive Thyroid	mrs_gresham, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	5/14/2008 3:14:47 PM	I am 26 and was diagnosed with hyper thyroid at 17 when I had my first child. now 5 mths after my 2nd child I am hypo and scored a 63! which is way high on my test. I am trying this drug but only 0.25mcg. I am still unsure about it. I have heart palpatations, slight chest pains, anxiety, depression, intense sensitivity to cold, and hot flashes too. I don't know which is my thyroid and which is the meds.

I have been on this med for 8 months. I had hair loss for about 3 months (thought I would go bald but didn't) and lost some weight.  I hope my weight loss is subsiding.  I still have tremors and some loss of appetite.  Lately I have been short of breath and will talk to doctor about it.

Now, after getting blood tests every three months for almost two years of taking 125mcg I was told after my last two blood tests to decrease the dosage down to 111 mcg then to 100mcg.  I still am at my original weight , have shakiness in the hands, a great amount of hair loss, extremely dry skin and achiness in my legs.

I just haven't read anyone's experience who has been pregnant and taking this medication. 
Underactive Thyroid	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	4/1/2008 5:17:54 PM	I started out hyperthyroid, then it went hypo on it's own.  My Dr. started me on a very low dose of the Levo. I have had every possible side effect, except hair loss.  I've had high blood pressure for the first time in my life.  I am dizzy, I have extreme irrability, anxiety, heartracing and pounding, I feel like I am going crazy.  My Dr. gave me the O.K. to go off of it and see what happens.  It did help to put my thyroid in a normal range, but I feel awful.  I am very shaky and have muscle weakness. I drop everything.  I can't think straight.  I feel like I am stoned, or drunk.  It is possible that my thyroid will go back to being underactive, but I am really praying it will stay in a normal range.

Underactive Thyroid	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	3/22/2008 2:55:29 PM	I was diagnosed 7 years ago with hypothyroidism...just about six months after having my second child.  I was 25 at the time with no family history.  I went in because of tingling in my extremities, especially my toes.  After asking lots of questions and doing blood work, my doctor gave me the results.  My levels were at 67...many times higher than normal.  She put me on 100 mcg of Levothroid and I've been on it ever since.  I didn't notice anything as regards appetite loss or weight loss but the fatigue definitely subsided.  Recently, I've been experiencing renewed symptoms:  fatigue, depression, intolerance to cold, constipation, etc.  Doctor did new blood tests and they showed even on 100 mcg, my levels were elevated to 5.7.  Not exactly super high but definitely out of range.  I'm supposed to see him again in a month and we'll do another blood test before he adjusts medication.  Overall, I've been happy with this medication but did go through a period of time where I had a lot of dizziness and tingling in my arms and legs.  Had to get MRI to rule out brain tumor but eventually it went away.  Have no idea if it was attributed to Levothroid or hypothyroidism but possible.  No bad side effects from this medication and will continue to take it as doctor prescribes.
Underactive Thyroid	lady c, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	3/21/2008 6:02:25 PM	I had my thyroids removed on 3/27/08, they were making me very tired, I had problems sleeping because I had problems breathing,  they had grown so large that they had to be removed.  Two weeks later they started me on levothyroxine 100mcg, they gave me gas, I was always burping so when I went back in two weeks they increased by dose to 150mcg.  I still burp a lot but I feel better, waiting 3 wks. to take labs to see what it saids.  I also have lost 10 lbs. in that short time.  No hair loss or dry skin, everything is really going good so far.

Underactive Thyroid	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	3/5/2008 12:28:48 PM	I am a 24 year old female who was about 30 lbs. overweight, depressed, had hot flshes, and was always exhausted when I found out about my Underactive Thyroid. I have been on 75mcg for about a year and a half. It has taken this medication this long to stabalize my condition but, finally I am happy about the results. I have started to lose weight, about 20 lbs.), my hot flashes have disappeared for the most part, and I am not as exhausted as I use to be. The depression part still was fluctuating so I started taking Wellbutrin XL, which also helped with my weight loss. I do get dry skin and scalp off and on and am sensitive to hot and cold extremes but, overall you have to be patient witht his medication. I am sure it is not for everyone but, give it time and do your blood tests so you can find the right level of meds that you should be on. At first I swore up and down that this medication was not working but, like I said a year and a half later I feel good about where I am at. Don't give up on it quite yet, it takes time, your Thyroid is a major hormone controller in your body. This medication is not going to work miracles over a 3 month period, it probably took you much longer than that to figure out that you had a Thyroid problem it is trying to balance you out. Good Luck!!!

Underactive Thyroid	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	35-44	2/28/2008 9:59:29 AM	The first doctor who diagnosed my hypothyroidism prescribed a very lose dosage of 25 mg. My PCP upped it, and that was much more effective. My PCP now wants to lower the dosage after 90 days, because my thyroid is functioning very well. I am a bit nervous, but suppose that this is typical treatment, and does seem to make some sense. He recommends that I do another blood test in 7 weeks, before he prescribes it again. My sister has a thyroid condition, and has taken medication for several years now.

I did feel some bloating the first few weeks of taking it, but as my TSH level came down, the hypo symptoms started to abate. Now, by month 3, I am finally getting my energy back and feeling better.  Just give the medicine some time to work.

My dr recommended keeping a daily food diary, and I discovered I got a migraine within an hour of taking my Vit. E tablet each day. I got no migraine the days I forgot my Vit. E. I stopped taking Vit E, and after my levels being tested, dr. increased to 75 mg. Since the increase, I can't sleep more than 4 hrs., when I lie down I hear my blood pulsing in my ears, cold sweats, hot flashes. I see the dr. next week to decide how to proceed. The only benefit, a little more energy.

Enlarged Thyroid Gland	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/14/2007 7:27:31 AM	I just recently had a total thyroidectomy because of graves disease. I have now been on this med for 4 weeks.  I have had graves disease for about 6 years and i had 2 very large doses of radioactive iodine because i had a large goiter and it was not getting better.  My surgeon was wonderful and did a great job.  I was pregnant when we decided that I would have surgery and since I was having a baby I could not have the radioactive iodine again and be around him with no guarantee of working.  The only bed side effect I have found so far is being a lot more tired and the hair loss is a lot to deal with, but hopefully it will subside soon.  My dose is .125 a day.  I have just been a lot more tired since the surgery, more so than when my baby just came home.  I'm waiting on my lab results now, but I hope this was helpful for someone looking for this info.

The first i was on levethryoid. It worked wonderful, I was put on the 100 mcg at first and I lost 30 lbs in a month, then they reduced it to 85mcg. That was perfect. I felt great, my hair loss subsided, my appetite returned, and I maintained my weight. This time they put me on 50 mcg. so I am not sure how the long term will work. But overall I have had a great experience with this type of meds.

Had an allergic reaction at first...itchiness behind knees and under arms.  Seems to cause hyperthyroid symptoms and hypothyroid symptoms. My levels are normal now but we experimented for over a year to get dosage right.  I still have blood tests often to check it.  It seems to be a volatile drug...causing many side effects, but does help regulate thyroid levels.  I feel better by taking it, but I'm concerned about side effects and long term usage.

I wasn't sweating as much, I seemed to be sleeping better, and I didn't seem to be as irritable.  I also started Paxil shortly after I began the Levothyroxine .050 mcg, who's to say at this point just how much this is helping.  I have a lot of other contributing factors for the sweats, nasea, shakes, etc, but as for the weigt gain when my eating habits haven't changed in two weeks time, and that I don't gain weigt like this.  The only logical explanation would be to increase the Levothyroxine to .075 mcg.
