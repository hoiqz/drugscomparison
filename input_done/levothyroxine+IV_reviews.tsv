Underactive Thyroid	tomatsi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/29/2012 6:41:36 PM	I have been on this medicine for almost 10 years now.  I can tell when the dosage needs to be changed because I get tired easily, cold, and my skin gets real dry.  I am underweight but diagnosed hypothyroid.  They are increasing my dosage today for the first time in 2 years.  If I dont take my medicine everyday its like having the flu

I feel better, less tired all the time. I dont see any change in my mood or sleep patterns.But if I go more than two days without taking this medication, I feel lightheaded, dizziness, shaking and neusea.

I have no side effects and the goiter I have has hardly decreased in size. My menstruation is still not regular and, although I've been told I am in better moods, I feel no happier or less depressed than before.
