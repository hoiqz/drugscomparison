Acne	KimCam, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	6/13/2012 1:24:57 PM	I have only been using this acanya for a week, but I have already noticed a huge difference. Even after the first use, I noticed that my skin feels softer. The third day I had a little itching, but nothing major and that has calmed down. I do notice some peeling in the morning when I am putting on makeup, but if I wait about 20 minutes after applying it to put on makeup the peeling is decreased. I am very pleased so far! I have tried multiple things and this is the best yet. I am also on differin at night. My acne strikes around my chin and mouth and it is always in line with my cycle. I can't wait to see what a month of use will do!
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	25-34	5/15/2012 9:03:02 PM	Used product and had little irritation. Irritation went away and so did my acne, a few pimples remained, but huge difference. Out of nowhere, I woke up with an inflamed face that is red, itchy, and patchy as if I am sunburned. Skin feels rough to the touch. I've stopped using and will need to go back to demo to find out what else I can use.
Acne	CandiceF, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	4/14/2012 11:44:28 PM	I used this for two days, had a reaction were my face turned red and itched like a bad sunburn. Dermatologist told me to stop using, when I discontinued use the burning and itching went away. Going back to the dermatologist to get another prescription.
Acne	happy mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/10/2012 1:14:16 PM	my 14 yo son was put on acanya and epiduo by his derm. After 3 months of use he has baby skin.  He wears sunblock and a moisturizer every day.  A little dry skin and irritation at first.  But well worth it!  Love this product and my derm for helping him with his acne.  Now my 11yo old has also been prescribed the same treatment.  Will not use anything else, after seeing such great results. Don't be afraid and use it. It is worth every dime. I recommend this product 100%

She also uses CeraVe cleanser. It's been about two weeks and the acne on her forehead is almost gone and with very little drying....and no side effects. We're pleased so far.

Acne	hl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/8/2011 7:23:40 PM	I have suffered from acne all of my life.  I've tried every drug, surgery, peel, spa treatment and while some provided some relief, nothing worked for very long.  Acanya is amazing.  I've been using it for almost a year.  After I wash my face (twice a day) I apply it all over my face and follow up with a mositurizer.  No more face covered in zits!.  When I feel a breakout coming, I apply extra on that spot and within 2 days it's gone.  It's pricey, but worth it.
Acne	Alabama, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	6/11/2011 8:22:36 AM	I have &quot;sandpaper&quot; acne, which is basically minor pimples but a lot of rough skin with small pimples that are barely visible to the eye (it feel like sand paper when you touch it). I have used acanya TWICE along with atralin, perscribed by my dermatologist. I am having a severe burning reaction to acanya. It has made my face red and seem like a really bad sun burn. I also cant put anything else on my face (like lotion, to calm the burning or peeling) because it burns 10x worse. On a scale of one to ten (ten being the worst) my pain level is and 8. Its an 11 if lotion gets on it or after washing my face. I have stopped use of both acanya and atralin and have contacted my dermatologist. Hopefully the symptoms i have will calm before I can get in monday.

Acne	kittarn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/2/2010 2:57:21 PM	My dermatologist thought I needed prescription medication for moderate acne.  She gave me a sample of Acanya Gel.  She warned me it would be expensive but said it would work well.  She was right on both accounts.  My skin is beautiful-my friends and coworkers always comment on how clear it is.  It is a little pricey but I am willing to pay for the results.  I only have to get a refill every two months and only then because it expires after two months and it does quit working.  The only thing I would change would be for it to come in a smaller container since I always have leftovers when it expires.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	6/21/2010 11:48:59 AM	I've only been using this for a week and I see significant results already. I haven't had a new breakout and most of the old acne is already gone. I have moderate to severe acne and have been trying to treat it for years and this is the one thing that has really seemed to work!
Acne	Lauren, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	2/2/2010 1:07:34 AM	This topical gel worked well for my skin, HOWEVER, I ended up getting SEVERE abdominal cramps and bowel movements, which I later found out was colitis, a side effect of the drug. I wish my Dr. would have told me to look out for this, as I thought it was the stomach flu!  Now I might need to undergo treatments for colitis.
Acne	DBerry, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	1/4/2010 2:53:28 PM	Acanya seemed to make my acne worse.  I kept trying to hang in there and not quit taking the medicine, but being 30 years of age, I am so frustrated with such medicines not working.  I've even used Accutane and my acne came back within 3 years. It seems the dermatologist just want to continue getting paid while I continue being frustrated!! 
Acne	TGTW, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/7/2009 11:33:37 AM	Works great. I haven't had a breakout since about 2 weeks after use. This will bleach clothes. I am very pleased with teh results. I have tried tons of things and this has been the only thing that really worked.
