She tells of its development and how Johnson and Johnson committed fraud, and gave massive incentives to doctors to use it; pushed it in dangerous doses;promoted it for unlicensed, illegal uses;defrauded Medicare of millions of dollars; and used phoney studies to promote it. The dose of 40,000, according to the book, is extremely dangerous. Additionally, when a J&amp;J rep brought problems to the attention of management, he  was systematically harassed and finally fired.

The last one to be given on the day of the surgery. The next morning after the shot I had to have an ambulance take him to the ER. There at the Hospital his temp. went up to 102.8 very bad headache, vomiting. The scariest symptom was seen that morning he was very confused,not making any sense at all. They kept him over night he didn't realize where he was until 4:10 in the morning. He has no memory of what happened to him at all. He doesn't remember the spinal,the xrays,and scat scan they did. They determined he had an alergic reaction to the shot. To this day almost 2 weeks after the shot he still is not feeling well. He feels very weak and drained. He is not having the surgery. I am trying to convince him to see his primary dr.

It will be fine for a month and the next time I go, it's suddenly 10.  I feel absolutely no different after the shots and they've been giving me hefty doses. After being delayed for 2 hrs. in the office today, my BP was so high, they wouldn't give it to me.  The crit level was 11.9.  I told them I'd be back in two weeks, not one.  I really am getting disgusted as it doesn't seem to be making any change in the way I feel--tired all the time.  But if you stop taking it, what happens then?

I am on my 6th week of 20,000 units per week and my quality of life has returned to being active and full of energy.  No sign effects other then improvement of quality of life.

Treatment caused severe anemia.  Was put on 40,000 units injections weekly.  While my anemia is still present, it is stablized and not getting worse.  I only hope the recent FDA concerns for Procrit don't hit me later in life.  Unfortunately with medications, while it may help with one symptom/disease it may also be causing long term effects.  One can only decide if the good outweighs the potential bad.  Had I known of these concerns I would not have started with this drug.

My physician hopes to reduce the amount of frequent crises attacks sometimes leading to hospitalization. The 40,000 units that I am on has resulted in a stable HgB level but still on the low side of the normal range (6.5 g/dl). Often times I feel more lethargic than energetic within a 24-48 hr  period of receiving injection. Sometimes a hunger headaches developes or minor sickling attacks. Overall the good outweighs the bad a the present time.
