It pretty much knocks him out.  He never has any energy. - sleeps a lot, etc.  So it's been real depressing for him. He doesn't seem to have much quality of life with it...I would prefer that he not take it, but he doesn't seem to realize what it does to him.

High Blood Pressure	fender, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male	45-54	3/2/2009 10:31:12 PM	I have taken this combo for 5 years. However, over the last year I started having joint pain in big toe, ankle and elbow. I now have gout which is due to a build up in uric acid from the Chlorthal part of the drug. My doctor switched me to just Atenolol but BP is now back up to 170/100. The gout may be permanent.

Tried other meds, nothing worked for long. Started this medication 10 months ago with great results. No side effects so far other than frequent urination and that's slowing down. Now bp 120/88 or lower. Started exercising and walking 3x week for added benefit, gone salt-free too. Feeling much better, lost 20 lbs so far.

High Blood Pressure	lownbrown, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	45-54	10/20/2008 8:42:53 AM	Earlier this year my blood pressure started being uncontrolled on Atenolol alone. Finally my doctor recommeded this and my pressure has been good.  Occasionally due to me forgetting to take the medicaton or not drink enough water does my pressure go up to 90 for the bottom number, but generally it is well below 90.  Now my doc recommends that I take only half a pill because it is doing a good job.  Side affects - I get tired easily when walking - which I hate, and trouble losing weight. I need help losing about 50-60 lbs but I don't know what to use.  Any ideas that will work with the meds?

The ED was severe at first, then seemed to ease up.  I got off this medicine, and three weeks later the change was dramatic...as far as the ED goes.
