I feel great i have no problems wit it and it works. sure, yeah you'll gain a little weight but thats your responsiblity to keep your weight down dont blame the drug. and i barely have a period which is what i love most and the fact i cant get pregnant(but always use condoms no matter what). Otherwise its a great drug, use it. :)
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/26/2011 4:21:07 PM	I was on the shot a few years ago...never had any problems no bleeding that lasted for months nothing....I got off of it and had my 3rd son and then got back on it....I never did lose all my baby weight and by being on the shot now seems like I'm having the hardest time ever to lose a pound. Of course mydoctor told me thatif I can control my urges I will not have a problem with gaining any weight. Gotta learn self control....Other then that I love it!!! I do ge my period around the week before my next shot it's not heavt at all and lats for about 3 days....

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	12/3/2009 7:42:41 PM	I took one dose of this, which lasts for three months.  In the last three months I have had more problems than ever before.  I have had major emotional/mood swings, acne problems and breakthrough bleeding that has lasted over 35 days.  I called my dr. after a month and a half and demanded to be put on something different.  I will never again use a drug that lasts for three months and I have no control over!  Do Not Use This!
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/14/2009 7:07:04 PM	I was on this for 10 years. I only stopped because my husdand has ED with no real help in sight in the near future. I had no periods for 10 years. I loved it. I could not justify spending to money any more. I never thought about it ever.
