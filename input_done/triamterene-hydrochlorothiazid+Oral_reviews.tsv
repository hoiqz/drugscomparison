Other	jk, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	65-74	5/17/2012 4:42:08 PM	My cardiologist prescribed this because the combination bp/diuretic I was taking was lowering my Potassium level and this one doesn't.  After taking it for about 6 months I had an eye check and my opthamalogist couldn't find why my vision has deteriorated so rapidly.  Today I read all the fine print that comes with this drug and find it can cause vision loss and eye pain.  Has anyone else noticed this side effet ?  ( I will definitely discuss it at next eye appt.)

High Blood Pressure	KCStep, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	2/19/2012 10:14:09 PM	I was previously taking Lisinopril-hctz but my potassium numbers were consistently low, so my doctor switch me to the triamterene-hctz combo in hopes to increase my potassium numbers.  I have been on it for 2 weeks and developed cramps in my legs, arms and back. I am tired and thirsty more which means more trips to the bathroom and sometimes my chest feels heavy.  I have also noticed in the last 5 days my BP numbers steadily went up (from 122/74 to 137/90) and my moods have changed. I thought I had issues with the Lisinopril-hctz pill, that is nothing compared to the issues I am dealing with while taking this triamterene-hctz pill. I tried to be patient and initially consider the symptoms as part of my body adjusting to the meds, but the cramps and higher BP numbers are unbearable.  I have left a message with my doctor to discuss going back to the lisinopri-hctz.  As much I didn't like the low potassium numbers while on the lisinopril-hctz, I would rather go back to lisinopril-hctz and eat more foods high in potassium to boost my blood work numbers than take triamterene-hctz and have muscle cramps and fear that the cramps could get worse. What works for some, may not for others.

Was taking Lisinipril which lost its effectivness over time resulting in my MD increasing the dosage.  Finally I asked for a duuretic.  The first day I lost 5 lbs of fluid and my BP was below 115/72.  BP now is below 130 almost all the time.  I do experience some drowsiness and occasional leg cramps after a long (10 mile)hike.  But I eat bananas or apples when that happens and the cramps go away. I am very relieved not only that my BP is normal but also that I don't need to be as concerned about salt and eating out as I was.

When I first started this medication, I had oily skin.  Now my skin is very dry &amp; my lips are cracked always.  Don't know if it is due to aging process or the diuretic.  This is the only medicine I'm on.  So, I asked my doctor if I could try another medicine.  Changed to lisinopril for about 6 months until I developed constant cough, sore throat, and sinus infection.  Changed to Benacor &amp; have been on it for 3 weeks now.  I still have cough, sinus infection, &amp; occasional sore throat.  If this doesn't clear up soon, I'll ask my doctor to go back to triamterine.

High Blood Pressure	Lilly Rose, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/24/2008 2:04:35 PM	I was diagnosed with high blood pressure seven years ago at age 51. They put me on an alpha blocker &amp; a beta blocker. I became a near vegetable finding it difficult to function. My BP was lower but still too high. I got on a good exercise program with weights as well as swimming. I finally got off of the beta-blocker and the doctor put me on this Maxide. My blood pressure is now 118/60. I stay well hydrated and drink fresh brewed green tea, no sugar or artificial sweeteners instead of coffee and eat a very healthy diet. I dont eat any fast food and NEVER eat salt. I always have lots of energy and feel great since Ive been on this medication. As a bonus I lost another 20 pounds! I have NOT had any side effects other than if I dont stay hydrated, I have gotten leg cramps during the night.
High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/27/2008 11:01:52 PM	Starting taking this medication about less than a week ago for high blood pressure. My blood pressure was 150/98, sometimes higher. About 2 days ago it went down to 123/80. After I ate a can of salty soup it went back up. Now I try to really avoid salty foods and it went back to 130/83. The only side effects I felt was weakness, dizzyiess when walking/standing, weight-loss (good in my case), going to the bathroom alot, and muscle stiffness.
High Blood Pressure	poofie2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	10/6/2008 9:10:39 AM	I was diagnosed with Hypertension 1 at 29. I have been on this medication now for about 3 1/2 years. I tried to avoid being on a prescription medication for as long as I could to control my blood pressure. Hypertension runs in my family, especially on the women's side. I have always been in shape and excercise regularly and have never been overweight, but my blood pressure was just getting higher and higher and staying that way. I suffered from many headaches, migraines and fatigue. My sister had a stroke at 32 and this is what made me think twice about not being on a prescription to control my blood pressure. Not to mention my doctor was insisting on it. My &quot;normal&quot; blood pressure stays around 140/90. With this medication it is regulated to around 120/80. There are times that I have lapsed without taking this medication and if I do for more than a month, my blood pressure will creep back up to 140/90 and I start to feel the affects. This medication regulates my pressure very well with very few side affects once Ive been on it for a while. When I first started taking it, it took me about 3 weeks to get used to it. I experienced severe fatigue, stomach cramps, leg and arm cramps and weakness and dizziness. When I lapse for a month or more and then get back on the drug, I have to endure about a week or so of side affects like stomach cramps and fatigue. It seems as if this drug has withdrawel affects if you stop taking it cold turkey. Overall, I am satisfied with this drug. I can feel the difference physically when my blood pressure is where it should be.
