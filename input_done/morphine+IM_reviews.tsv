Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/14/2011 8:59:12 AM	Several breaks in my right leg, ankle, foot due to accident. I have RSD nerve damage along with the deep throbbing pain and bone on bone pain. Also have trigeminal neuralgia and severe pain and headaches due to systemic lupus. I was taking several different pain etc meds and was able to drop them all and just take the Morphine Im injectable. Amazing how 1 thing can take the place of 8 and do a much better job.

The testing would consist having a cervical spinal injury with no pain killers.  Ha. Ha. lets see how much he can take.  Oh and guess what I'am not seeking meds!!  I have a real injury they still havn't figured out completely.  I can only thank god the pain is for the most part manigable.  Two thumbs up for morphine and the doctor that perscribed it.  PS. My best advise came from a person in records not the medical field and she said REMEMBER DOCTORS ONLY GET A LIC. TO PRACTICE IT'S NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE.

The morphine only takes the edge off the pain. I was taking Norco, it took all the pain away and I was able to carry-on my daily routine.

Pain	mouse, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	4/11/2010 6:56:43 PM	I've been on morphine about 2 years, i take 60mg 4x a day, I,m also on other meds. It still doesn't help my pain. It does somewhat but, I think I need to try something else..... The one that helped me the most was oxycontin, but my doc quit prescribing it cause of all the controversy about it!!!!!!No fair...
