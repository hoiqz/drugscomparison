Pain	Becker0109, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	11/26/2010 1:45:25 AM	I took this medication in generic form (Propoxyphene-Acetaminophen 100/650mg) on 06/18/2010 for pain of my left index finger that I had surgery on. I took one evry four hours starting the 18th, June, 2010, a Friday. I started to experience, a few hours later, dizziness, slowing motor skills, confusion, an overall &quot;stupor&quot; and developed a hard time with relating to people talking to me or me to them. I called the doctors office on Sunday, the 20th (Fathers day) and was told by the doctor on call to go to the emerency room, which I did. I was NOT suppose to be given this drug as I have depression, have had a heart attack, and take medications such as those to sleep for my insomnia. I showed the doctors office my &quot;up to the date&quot; list of medications before the surgery on a pre operation in the doctors office on 06/14/2010. I could have died. I was in and out of this stopor feeling for about 6-8 weeks. 
Pain	jimss, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	11/23/2010 7:29:27 AM	Have taken Darvon compound 65 for 50+ years for migraines.  It will not kill a migraine, but if taken soon enough, will significantly reduce 75% of the time and then allow normal functioning.  I take oxycodone for increased pain, but then i sacrifice normal thinking/functioning.  People overdose on everything.  it is just a matter of self-control and understanding your own personal drug reactions.

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	9/8/2010 5:41:32 PM	I have so many back problems it's not even funny. This medicine does next to nothing for me. Might as well be taking a pink vitamin.
Pain	 Female  (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		7/5/2010 12:00:45 PM	my cousin took this medicine for pain control from an car accident, and overdosed on it and died.  I wouldn't recommend this drug or any drug with propoxyphene in it to anyone.  
Pain	Chuck U Farley, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	5	3	Male	25-34	6/6/2010 7:54:23 AM	I have a combination of diagnosed back issues and nothing I have come across has ever worked as good as Roxicodone 30 mg blue tablets. For those of you out there with similar ailments, I recommend them highly. Darvon and similar products such as Darvocet pack a dangerous punch to your kidneys and liver with high levels of acetaminophen. This can be avoided by taking Roxicodone or Oxycodone.  
Pain	Logan, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	35-44	4/6/2010 9:53:12 AM	The main effect of this was almost hallucinogenic.  I could not tolerate the odd thoughts and visual disturbances - but it provided almost no pain relief - which was prescribed post-op.  Returned to surgeon and got a replacement within the week.  Darvon is on my &quot;never again&quot; list. 
Pain	richard, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	65-74	12/24/2009 3:14:56 PM	I took the medication for knee and hip pain and it has virtually no effect.  I accidentally took two 650 pills and still it provided little pain reduction.  I did have feelings of flushness and slight dizziness.  Have not used it for any other type of pain.
Pain	Barbara, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	65-74	9/1/2009 3:26:28 PM	I have been using this to control spinal pain (stenosis and spondelosis) fibro and found it helps more than even when I was taking Oxycontin which I stopped on my own and switched back to Propo-N 100-650

Pain	jones8885@bellsouth.net, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		5/4/2009 12:51:11 PM	I kept waiting for approval for Lyrica for fybermyalgia from my pharmacy company...finally,  I took some Darvon I had on had for another &quot;pain problem&quot; every5 hours and it made me forget how much pain I had been in!  I don't like the side effects I just read on this site though!!!

Pain	GregL, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	45-54	3/20/2009 8:54:50 PM	Took it for a few years for chronic upper-back pain. It works pretty well for mild to moderate pain, as well as Tylenol #3. I never noticed any serious side effects.

Pain	cher, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	1/30/2009 7:42:46 PM	I,m allergic to NSAIDS and codiene and have very few choices and this drug works for the pain caused by a spinal fusion that healed badly and the pain fron Deg. disc disease. As I age and the pain gets worse I will have to go to something stronger but Darvon takes the edge off and has never given me a problem.
